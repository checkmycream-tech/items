            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>I found the best way to make use of this is to use a food grade oil on your child&#x27;s head and let it soak in for a good hour or so.  </li>

            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>This comb is very easy to use and excellent quality.</li>

            <li>very nice ..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing!</li>

            <li>The permethrin treatment I used said right on the box \\&quot;Kills lice AND their eggs in one treatment\\&quot;  WHAT A LIE!!!!  </li>
            <li>and Good luck! :)&lt;br</li>
            <li>and Good luck! :)&lt;br</li>
            <li>We purchased this comb after reading reviews and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>there are nit picking services which are typically very competent and they will do it for you.</li>
            <li>there are nit picking services which are typically very competent and they will do it for you.</li>
            <li>You might even find them in the shower cap because we sure did!  </li>
            <li>This comb just pulls them out, both the eggs (be sure to use the gel!)</li>
            <li>so I just combed with this nit comb and was amazed at how many nits I removed!  </li>
            <li>SO GLAD we found this comb!</li>
            <li>But truthfully this comb is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>A must-have to winning the war!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this!  </li>
            <li>Love this comb!  </li>
            <li>She reminded me to always check for nits in bright light, sunlight is best, because nits reflect &amp; shine in the light.</li>
            <li>This comb is so Amazing , I have tried the plastic nit combs which dont even wk</li>
            <li>this comb is so amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing with the chemical producs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This comb is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Amazing-</li>
            <li>It is amazing compared to what you can buy in the store.</li>
            <li>AND I &#x27;M AMAZING,</li>
            <li>This Terminator comb is probably the best one, the ridged teeth seem to work really well.  </li>
            <li>The Lice are kind of inmortals.</li>
            <li>I honestly tried every lice comb and treatment  </li>
            <li>My daughter said that the comb outs felt nice with this comb.</li>
            <li>I bought this to have handy just in case it was needed.</li>
            <li>It is a nice size</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, perfect buying experience!</li>
            <li>We went through every kind of comb, even those skinny metal ones with the plastic handle.  </li>
            <li>None of them were as effective.  </li>
            <li>Isopropyl alcohol also kills these guys quite nicely.</li>
            <li>THANK GOD*, and after examining my own scalp she found nothing.</li>
            <li>It is certainly the best quality most effective comb of its kind.  </li>
            <li>Being incredibly fastidious by nature, I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>If your fighting the lice battle this is going to be your new best friend!!!!</li>
            <li>very good thank so much</li>
            <li>This is by far the best nit comb out there.  </li>
            <li>We gave one to our neighbor as well, whose daughter has more medium thickness hair, and it was AMAZING for her.</li>
            <li>but I would have liked it even better if it had a bit of padding in the grip.  </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, these chemical companies keep boosting the toxicity in order to combat the stubborn lice more effectively, but it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>If you have very fine hair than maybe this is your solution.  </li>
            <li>I STRONGLY recommend you try this!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed with the item and received it in good time.</li>
            <li>A good comb is the most important thing needed to eradicate lice.</li>
            <li>A good comb is the most important thing needed to eradicate lice.</li>
            <li>though this was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly did a great job pulling out the nits and lice.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working much, much better than plastic version.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this item</li>
            <li>THIS COMB WORKS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER USED.  </li>
            <li>The Fairy Tales Terminator comb is more than just a lice and nit</li>
            <li>The teeth are varied in length to form a curved edge for better contact with your scalp at any angle.</li>
            <li>I used mouthwash, the one that is brown/tan in color that starts with an L :)  </li>
            <li>so I could see how many were in the hair.  </li>
            <li>and you will be able to see them</li>
            <li>I will repeat this a couple more times incase we did miss any nits</li>
            <li>What I love about this treatment is that I can repeat it as often as I want to make sure I get rid of them all.  </li>
            <li>and you will be able to see them</li>
            <li>I will repeat this a couple more times incase we did miss any nits</li>
            <li>What I love about this treatment is that I can repeat it as often as I want to make sure I get rid of them all.  </li>
            <li>She charged $100/hr, but I would pay that gladly again because she used this nit comb and it worked so well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this comb doesnt have more reviews.</li>
            <li>We were able to use this comb with no problem.</li>
            <li>and we were able to get all the nits.</li>
            <li>I swear there were more nits in the bowl than there was vinegar by the end.  </li>
            <li>(I found all this on the internet while researching for a safe process)</li>
            <li>but I want to make sure that I add my two cents.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than trying to use the combs that come in the over the counter kits.  </li>
            <li>so I started shopping Amazon for a better lice comb and found this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After spending 3 days hand picking as many nits</li>
            <li>Have purchased 2 more..</li>
            <li>It definitely is better than the comb that comes with Licemd.</li>
            <li>It is better at getting the lice.</li>
            <li>This lice and nit comb is way better than the plastic ones that come with the lice kits at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s held up well to many trips through the dishwasher and in forgotten pots of boiling water.</li>
            <li>better than what comes with a kit</li>
            <li>It missed most of the nits that I found.</li>
            <li>think the teeth would pick up more on thicker hair, but I can&#x27;t say for sure without testing it.</li>
            <li>Okay, you&#x27;re getting somewhere.</li>
            <li>Much better than the the already trashed plastic comb that came in the kit you may have</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I overnighted this comb from the get-go.</li>
            <li>Look no further this nit comb is superior to anything out there!!!!</li>
            <li>and it is SO MUCH better than the comb that came with the Nix or even the individually-sold combs in the drug stores.</li>
            <li>Soooooo glad we did.</li>
            <li>and it pulled so many nits out of her hair.  </li>
            <li>My kids say it smells like a Christmas tree :)</li>
            <li>We bagged up stuffed animals and sprayed everything that wouldn&#x27;t fit through the hole in the washing machine!</li>
            <li>I love this comb</li>
            <li>so he didn&#x27;t have many.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not the great part, it combed out all the lice and nits really well.</li>
            <li>Used this everytime at bath time for awhile just to make sure, and the pesky problem is gone. :)</li>
            <li>We bought it because there have been many children with lice at our son&#x27;s school.</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this comb on all of us for a while just to be safe.  </li>
            <li>I paid more than twice what is listed here</li>
            <li>I got all the lice out of my daughters hair and would recommend this product to many people</li>
            <li>We continued the comb-throughs for a couple more days but never found anymore evidence of lice, and they did not return.</li>
            <li>The teeth have ridges so it catches the eggs so much better.</li>
            <li>No louse is safe.</li>
            <li>She looked ridiculously cute in a shower cap, too.</li>
            <li>We are still combing every night to be sure we didn&#x27;t miss anything.</li>
            <li>Now they even recommend re-treatment after so many days.</li>
            <li>Now think about how confident you will feel knowing that you have the power to control these bugs without dousing your children in harmful chemicals -- whose side effects may take years or decades to fully surface...</li>
            <li>After all, nit picking has been the longest lived procedure that is most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>

            <li>After all, nit picking has been the longest lived procedure that is most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I have much more experience with lice than I ever wanted - this comb is my favorite and helps keep me sane when the kids&#x27; heads start itching</li>
            <li>I literally felt i was never going to be able to permanently get them out of her hair.</li>
            <li>So one night i happened to once again be searching thru forums, more home remedies, etc</li>
            <li>i ended up winning these 3 combs for shipping and all around $10.</li>
            <li>, THIS IS the ONLY one that works perfectly..</li>
            <li>, THIS IS the ONLY one that works perfectly..</li>
            <li>I did like most parents and got a Rid kit.</li>
            <li>My friend told me I&#x27;d need a better comb and the internet seemed to agree.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, didn&#x27;t need to use it more than one day by the time it arrived.</li>
            <li>It will save you many hours of nitpicking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it will work if (knock on wood)</li>
            <li>I found that if you look *toward* the points of the tines at an angle, instead of looking at them from the side, horizontally, you&#x27;re able to see if there&#x27;s anything on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The non-ridged brands are easier to tell if its clean, but I think the ridges make this one more effective.</li>
            <li>More substantial than the pharmacy brand and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use a good detangler or olive oil which really worked well to loosen the nits too</li>
            <li>Easily the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>I did find that combing the hair while wet to damp worked best</li>
            <li>It is unbelievably more comfortable for the licee.  </li>
            <li>It is so much better than the cheap plastic combs that come with the lice shampoos.</li>
            <li>The good things are the teeth are set very close and remain that way.  </li>
            <li>so, I actually used this comb to do a quick dandruff removal fix on my way out the door and it worked wonderfully for that, too.</li>
            <li>- so, I actually used this comb to do a quick dandruff removal fix on my way out the door and it worked wonderfully for that, too.</li>
            <li>You still need to work section-by-section, but this comb will help you move through the head more quickly and with much more assurance that you&#x27;re doing a thorough job.  </li>
            <li>My grand-daughter has had other treatments but the comb is the best remover.</li>
            <li>It is true!</li>
            <li>Easy to comb with gel.</li>
            <li>and she still was able to clean out dozens of nits using this comb.</li>
            <li>Now I make sure to wrap it in a paper towel when drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish it was easier to clean somehow</li>
            <li>or there were better directions on how to clean.  </li>
            <li>She also reported this one was easy to run through the child&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nits were easily visible, bugs weren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>We had to use a prescription to kill the lice--one treatment, that was easy.  </li>
            <li>and so when you boil comb the tines hold strong.</li>
            <li>the awesome thing about this comb is that you actually can get all the lice and nits in the first one or two treatments, if you are very diligent and working in a brightly lit area with a loop (magnifying glass).</li>

            <li>/&gt;IT IS A PRECISION-ENGENEERED HIGH-QUALITY, COMFORTABLE COMB</li>
            <li>The teeth are precisely aligned with smooth, rounded-tip teeth that can be run along your scalp without scratching.</li>
            <li>I dropped them into my light cream sink each time and that is how I could see all the nits.  </li>
            <li>And it goes smoothly through the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li>This comb is fabulous.</li>
            <li>We have been lice free ever since.</li>
            <li>and we we nit free with in a week.</li>
            <li>Thankfully he stayed lice free.</li>
            <li>This comb can make doing a thorough combing actually possible and greatly speeds the process.  </li>
            <li>The rounded tips help you comb thoroughly close to the scalp, and help keep the &#x27;patient&#x27; comfortable to reduce squirming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use a lot of conditioner with this comb.</li>
            <li>We have been lice free for 3 months now.</li>
            <li>I knew precisely how to de-nit</li>
            <li>Is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>I bought this comb  and so far so good.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>ONE bug on my 4 year old daughter, removed it and thought she was good, (didnt see any eggs),  </li>
            <li>My daughter was full full of head lice eggs, and after using this comb most of it dissapeared</li>
            <li>This comb is of very good quality as compared to all the other flimsy plastic combs.  </li>
            <li>You will find the bulk of lice in the first combing session -- once I found over 150 in a child!!</li>
            <li>You will find the bulk of lice in the first combing session -- once I found over 150 in a child!!</li>
            <li>Very useful when you find yourself in a &amp;#34;lousy&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Luckily we didn&#x27;t have any although I&#x27;m sure they would have stuck right to this comb for me to easily see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be so excited about a lice-related product, but this comb is making a HUGE difference in my daughter&#x27;s recovery.  </li>
            <li>It says that you can use it on dry hair, but damp hair is really the best way to use this comb.</li>
            <li>This prodcut is without a doubt worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>We used one treatment, and removed most of the lice/nits from the first comb-through.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>She has an incredible volume of hair down to her shoulders--</li>
            <li>Too good , I just use only two time  after hair wash ,Now  I am completely free from lice and nit.</li>
            <li>I would do one swipe with the comb and clean it out each time</li>
            <li>where both the nurse and the doctor checked her head and said she looked clean.</li>
            <li>Works great in dry hair.</li>
            <li>Strips hair clean.</li>
            <li>It is easier to clean and disinfect afterward.  </li>
            <li>A good vigorous workout always helps to clear the mind and calm the body...</li>
            <li>(yeah right!)</li>
            <li>in short good purchase... thank you</li>
            <li>We repeated the whole process in 5 days just to be safe since nits hatch about every 7 days.  </li>
            <li>You really need to be vigilant, and keep combing for days to make sure you are clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the one hand, I really like that it is all metal because I can boil it to make myself feel better, and also you can boil between users.  </li>
            <li>Ok,  didn&#x27;t get too much lice..  </li>
            <li>Picked those out and will check her daily for awhile and will use the lice shampoo again on her this weekend for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t care; most parents will agree with me that when there is lice in the family you&#x27;re ready to go all out and do whatever it takes to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li>:)t so so much time an money</li>
            <li>This saved us so much time and frustration as we were able to truly get everything out this time around.  </li>
            <li>, sometimes you have to move the comb around to get the right light to see the nits</li>
            <li>, sometimes you have to move the comb around to get the right light to see the nits</li>
            <li>until this comb arrived and the first swipe through resulted in many, many, many more dead nits.  </li>
            <li>The other reviews on it were great</li>
            <li>If that happens, just apply a drop of antiseptic, and the site should heal quickly.</li>
            <li>So, went back to the store to buy more treatment and treated both girls and myself just to be safe.  </li>
            <li>I then did more combing later that day and got one more louse.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo didn&#x27;t work but the comb was adequate.</li>
            <li>Ok, Ive read many an followed many reviews on all types of products for years left by other consumers, and this comb is so amazing</li>
            <li>GOT him clean and ordered this comb right away along with the leave in spray from Fairy tales and the shampoo.,..  </li>
            <li>a million times better than the other kind of combs.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, my daughter does not complaint of aches when I run the comb through on her scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Completely worth the money and not a bad price either.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much stuff this comb pulled out after I had been hand picking the eggs out for 3 days!!</li>
            <li>This is an absolute lifesaver!!  </li>
            <li>teeth are spaced tight and this is great when investigating for the possibility of lice.</li>
            <li>Got the hair really clean the first time.</li>
            <li>That may be very good for getting out nits, but it makes it a rather torturous process to use regularly for prevention, which is what I was hoping for by purchasing such a sturdy brush.</li>
            <li>for the next two days we comb her one in the morning and once a night and NOTHING, this comb is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Do this cleaning calmly AFTER removing them from the infected people.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m upset that this comb isn&#x27;t sold at my local stores.</li>
            <li>For anyone that has tried everything, honest to goodness you only need conditioner and this comb!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fully confident that she will be lice free by the time they go back to their moms!  </li>
            <li>it was worth every penny!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHEST success rate to get almost all lice and nits with this comb.</li>
            <li>Finally someone told me to try mouthwash (the brown antiseptic kind) and I found the fairy tales terminator lice comb.</li>
            <li>The oil suffocates them and that was when I was finally able to get the adult lice off his head.  </li>
            <li>Some nits were so tiny you need to hold the comb up to the light to be able to see it.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Nice but only bought to comb my cat.</li>
            <li>I suggest you buy this comb right away and use it</li>
            <li>I found it right away.</li>
            <li>This is your solution right here.</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We had eggs, nits, lice of all stages, combing right out of her hair</li>
            <li>But It wasnt until I get a metal Comb that it really get clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend spending the extra money on it and being able to get the job done right the first time and not having to spend more time or money having to retreat.</li>
            <li>For me, it was money excellently spent ($95 worth), because first and most important, she gave me peace of mind.</li>
            <li>We did everything right the first time.</li>
            <li>She only found 4-5 nits because the combing I did the night before did such a great job.</li>
            <li>Luckily, my 1.5-year old daughter came out clean, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She has 2 daughters with long hair that was easily pulled out by those cheap plastic combs.  </li>
            <li>It does a really good job pulling out nits unlike the little plastic combs that come with the pesticide products.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly (thx Prime) and I set to checking my kids hair at each bath/shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can easily fold back hair along the part to get a good view down to the roots, right where one should be looking.  </li>
            <li>the very top edge needs a little more attention for nits an lice can get a bit trapped in the top part of the comb</li>
            <li>the very top edge needs a little more attention for nits an lice can get a bit trapped in the top part of the comb</li>
            <li>Really took the nits out quickly, because her hairs fit between the teeth more tightly.</li>
            <li>although many lice/nit combs will comb out (larger) lice, i was resigned to using my fingernails for stubborn nit (egg) removal.</li>
            <li>Best of luck, and I am sorry to all who have the need for this comb.</li>
            <li>And did daily nit picking to make sure we were getting all of the nits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I was able to do this on myself which was a big plus because I did not have to have my husband pick through my hair!!!  </li>
            <li>Also, I was able to do this on myself which was a big plus because I did not have to have my husband pick through my hair!!!  </li>
            <li>I am an avid amazon buyer and tend to put quite a bit of weight into the customer review</li>
            <li>(especially when there are many of them).  </li>
            <li>My kids got headlice the first week of school.  </li>
            <li>highly recomended!!</li>
            <li>She got checked today at school and is completely nit free.  </li>
            <li>After combing is complete, spray/saturate with ACU LIFE LICE CURE (also available on amazon)[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care!</li>
            <li>This actually pulls out the nits and exposes the lice much better.</li>
            <li>With each comb out, I would dip the Nit comb into the hot water and then wipe the comb with a papertowel.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if those help but smells nice!</li>
            <li>This was an absolute necessity in getting rid of the buggers!  </li>
            <li>It came within the promised time frame and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Most of the combs you buy at local drug stores are junk.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonder tool that really gets rid of EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this comb to everyone.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure and check his hair daily to catch the lice if they ever appeared.</li>
            <li>There are many treatments to choose from for getting rid of lice, but the key is removing everything from the hair.</li>
            <li>This comb really is a lice and nit terminator!  </li>
            <li>Items that cannot be washed in hot water and stuck in the dryer (like wool hats), can be put in the freezer overnight.</li>
            <li>Infected items that are bagged and removed and out of human contact for 30 days will starve them and will then be safe.</li>
            <li>, Now we use this comb just as maintenance purposes, because Ive believed that she must have friends or kids at school that pass these around , I&#x27;m very leery every time i see anyone scratch their heads even!</li>
            <li>, Now we use this comb just as maintenance purposes, because Ive believed that she must have friends or kids at school that pass these around , I&#x27;m very leery every time i see anyone scratch their heads even!</li>
            <li>It was the first time in my life that I&#x27;ve had to deal with this.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to check his head to be absolutely sure the lice were gone and for future periodic checks.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my damp unconditioned hair and it definitely pulled it more than it did his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When we used this comb there were over 30 more nits combed out that I could not see and would have hatched starting this nightmare all over again.</li>
            <li>, you have to actually take the time to go through every section of their hair, but it does a much better job of removing nits than any of the combs that come with the kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you really want to know for SURE if your child has lice, or even more importantly, NO LONGER HAS LICE, you need this comb.</li>
            <li>the problem is you are not getting it all out in the first place, and eggs are hatching again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>Finally I bought this comb, found several more nits and finally they were gone for good.  </li>
            <li>The other family was not managing the problem, so we took it into our own hands.  </li>
            <li>The swirled teeth are close together and effective, getting stuff other combs miss.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to hire a professional again because of the comb, but I&#x27;m grateful that she taught us how to clean it out ourselves.  </li>
            <li>I used an old tooth brush to clean the nit comb between each pull.  </li>
            <li>The first time I combed through her hair the comb was FULL of nits, they were clearly visible (you&#x27;d think she was fully infested</li>
            <li>Nobody wants to have to use this ever, but the truth is, if you have a child in school you will most likely have to at one point or another.  </li>
            <li>I treated my whole family with spray  first time even though not all  had lice</li>
            <li>My daughter caught lice again this year, and though our hair is fine, this helped us get rid of nits way better than the usual lice combs...</li>
            <li>The tines are super tightly spaced and they can find these little bugs along with their eggs incredibly well.</li>
            <li>An alcohol soaked paper towel is great place to deposit them or you can simply rinse them down the drain.</li>
            <li>Off to the store I go for more nix, the next morning I still found 5 live nymphs.</li>
            <li>I actually spotted a live bug on top of my daughters head during bathtime.</li>
            <li>My eyes were kind of swimming, actually, as there are a million and one different brands of these combs, all of which look pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Far superior to other combs, no doubt!!</li>
            <li>The ones that come in the shampoos are pretty useless, and you really want a high quality lice comb because everything I&#x27;ve read says that good effective combing is the key.  </li>
            <li>This is time consuming, especially because you can&#x27;t see if the nits are in the comb because the comb is metal and reflects light.</li>
            <li>The comb is stainless steel, and will not rust or break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am going to use this comb anyway since some nits are very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much my daughter smiles again because of this comb</li>
            <li>I got out so much gunk.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t send the kids back to school until they are nit free.  </li>
            <li>We had used a plastic nit comb and the chemical lice wash years ago when we had this problem and it took much longer to get rid of the lice.  </li>
            <li>My daughter couldnt go back to school until she was 100% nit free</li>
            <li>It seems very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this de-nitting comb!</li>
            <li>The spiral grooves in each tooth of the comb really grab hold of the lice and eggs.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy too.</li>
            <li>Really works as said.</li>
            <li>This nit come works very well.</li>
            <li>I really</li>
            <li>IT really picks up the nits and does not damage the hair.</li>
            <li>it really help to get rid off the flaky stuffs or lice/egg from the hair.</li>
            <li>I combed my daughter&#x27;s hair with this comb without really knowing how to do it</li>
            <li>The coils around each tine really grabs hold of the nits and lice.</li>
            <li>but you really have to work on the nits.</li>
            <li>much much MUCH sooner..</li>
            <li>The real winner was Licefree and Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(shampoo with dawn dish detergent to remove) and comb tangles out before using this comb because the teeth are very close together and will pull hair out if not.</li>
            <li>We also put our childs clothes and coat straight in the washer from school knowing there was a chance of this coming home again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This comb works very well if you use it as directed.</li>
            <li>hands of society&#x27;s children and their ever so responsible parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>This comb does a fantastic job of getting every last trace out.  </li>
            <li>Repeated the process until her whole head had been combed through (I keep a spray bottle of water to keep her hair wet during the process because I can see the nits in her hair better that way)</li>
            <li>The few that it did pull out of her hair on its&#x27; own, got stuck in the comb (at the end of the teeth, under the handle).</li>
            <li>I tired several brands and this was one of the 2 best that I tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Turns out, covering our heads in coconut oil and a variety of essential oils worked better than the nastiest chemicals you could buy at the drug store, and made me feel a lot safer about having to treat my three year old for this issue.</li>
            <li>It is more trouble than it is worth.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I have had way too much experience with lice and have tried many different ways to get rid of them and even though I have had this comb now for a couple of years I have just found out how amazing it really is!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not certain what did more damage to the lice-</li>
            <li>so I did go to our local drug store to buy a decent nit comb which it was until I put it in hot water to clean.  </li>
            <li>Since it takes 6-7 days for the eggs to hatch you are combing for the first week to find any new hatchlings.</li>
            <li>Since it takes 6-7 days for the eggs to hatch you are combing for the first week to find any new hatchlings.</li>
            <li>However, the teeth went right through my six year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I would say this is a must and does work better than the other stainless steel combs we tried.</li>
            <li>Better than any other comb I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>We tried many other combs that come with the darn shampoo (over the counter)</li>
            <li>had more nits and bugs than I had ever found with any other comb.  </li>
            <li>This comb works better than any other combs we have used</li>
            <li>We tried a few different brands of combs and this was the best at removing lice from my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other comb.  </li>
            <li>The school checked them again the next day and were amazed at how clean they were.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you have thick, strong hair this could work, but on fine hair it does nothing, and you can (literally) feel and hear it shredding the hair.</li>
            <li>My son has psoriasis on his scalp and this comb is great for getting the little flakes of dry skin out of his hair.</li>
            <li>Terminator comb : available on Amazon or Ulta beauty supply- for long hair, part into 3 sections, start with bottom,</li>
            <li>She came home Thursday morning when the nurse called and said she found a new baby louse on her head!</li>
            <li>This process did not take nearly as long as picking through the hair myself with my nails and was much easier on me and my daughters!!!  </li>
            <li>This process did not take nearly as long as picking through the hair myself with my nails and was much easier on me and my daughters!!!  </li>
            <li>We then towel dry the hair and brought out the Nit Free comb.  </li>
            <li>When we got home I decided to try running this comb through her hair while she was in the tub on her wet hair, just to see how easily it combed.</li>
            <li>And was able to pull out eggs I missed from previous comb outs.  </li>
            <li>In combination with Licefree liquid this comb worked nicely, much better then those plastic combs that last abut ten minutes.</li>
            <li>Love to hate this thing-it works great for what it is supposed to do-extract lice, nits &amp; nymphs from your scalp, but it hurts like hell and rips your hair out.  </li>
            <li>In this lifecycle, they go through three molts lasting a total of 10 days before they are able to reproduce.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this wallet-friendly tool.</li>
            <li>highly recomed it over any combes on the market.</li>
            <li>I have 5 kids, oldest is in high school...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>in all, though, I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li>huge thanks to all the other reviewers who shared their experiences with it</li>
            <li>2 year old daughter first got lice 2 months ago and my life turned into complete chaos, I was a held prisoner by nits and buggies!</li>
            <li>After newly moving &amp; my children going to a new school system, I was absolutely Mortified one day when my kids were sent home with head lice.  </li>
            <li>Can say this gets through his hair well, although it pulls a little (he has buzzed hair), but its better than getting lice/not finding the lice.</li>
            <li>Made to last, very tight tolerances on the spacing between teeth, which is good.</li>
            <li>The teeth don&#x27;t bend like other combs, so it makes it easy to pull lice out without damaging or pulling the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had done a decent job of picking through my daughter&#x27;s hair, but after two passes with this gadget we&#x27;d already found 3 new nymphs.  </li>
            <li>This little comb really works!!!!</li>
            <li>Clean the comb between strokes with a tissue, rinse, and wipe dry with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are combing sensitive people, this really upsets them.</li>
            <li>, the RID treatment doesnt work very well, lice were still alive after being treated...  </li>
            <li>and I had to hand pick most of them out and always ended up missing some.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean which is also a plus, because a lot of other combs have stuff get stuck in them that is hard to clean out.</li>
            <li>Then I used the Terminator comb and I was able to get out the dead lice.  </li>
            <li>I agree with another poster - order this next day shipping, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Then you might find a few more after that, keep combing</li>
            <li>Then you might find a few more after that, keep combing</li>
            <li>but it is not hard.  </li>
            <li>but it is not hard.  </li>
            <li>I am also ordering the Fairy Tales shampoo and leave in spray--since my son is going right back into the fray at school.</li>
            <li>Then I put regular conditioner in and it glides right through her hair and mine.  </li>
            <li>Most likely you will find little to nothing 3-6 days after the first combing session.</li>
            <li>Most likely you will find little to nothing 3-6 days after the first combing session.</li>
            <li>and the live bugs.  </li>
            <li>but she had not one live bug on her head.  </li>
            <li>I still didn&#x27;t see any live lice</li>
            <li>I knew it was lice, but I couldn&#x27;t see any live ones.  </li>
            <li>I took out my Terminator and with one swipe, I got two live bugs.  </li>
            <li>; spray is for killing live</li>
            <li>and I started combing with the new comb.</li>
            <li>They live for 32-35 days.</li>
            <li>The ridges make it harder to see if its completely clean, which is why I tend to boil it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap... comes early as expected..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming it would do a superior job to other metal combs because the teeth are spaced tightly together.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from the professional lice removers (yes, these companies exist and I highly recommend them, too.  </li>
            <li>Sadly we started with the pesticides, both rid and nix, and found that neither of them were successful in killing the live bugs.  </li>
            <li>divide hair into small sections and be sure to comb from all directions -- from the sides and below.</li>
            <li>only one that actually works - worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li>Works much better than the small, sharp-edged plastic combs that come with lice treatment kits.</li>
            <li>Finally my husband after much research found this comb, thank goodness for Amazon and their reviews!</li>
            <li>It is the first comb I&#x27;ve seen that actually pulls out nits.</li>
            <li>With this, 3 days of cleaning (just to be sure there was nothing remaining) and no more problems.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first time I actually saw it work.</li>
            <li>washed and conditioned her hair, and then I took this comb, some spray in conditioner, a pot of hot boiling water (which I poured into a mason jar to dispose of later), a roll of papertowels, and went to work.  </li>
            <li>but this will definitely help with that more than the other combs</li>
            <li>Maybe if people brushed their hair first then it wouldnt tangle.</li>
            <li>things are minor compared to the payoff, plus for anyone with thick hair the length of the comb teeth is true blessing as well.. :)</li>
            <li>If one is left and it&#x27;s an adult female, you have the potential of her laying more eggs, so keep on combing.</li>
            <li>If one is left and it&#x27;s an adult female, you have the potential of her laying more eggs, so keep on combing.</li>
            <li>I would like to point out that if you have lice or nits in your hair they will come out in the comb and the big ones you will be able to see easily and the nits look like little dark things in-between the teeth of the comb.  </li>

            <li>: it&#x27;s actually more comfortable for the head, too - my daughter complained about the sharp teeth on the plastic combs, but the rounded tips on these teeth didn&#x27;t hurt her scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was amazing to see how much lice and nits I had missed with all of the other products I had wasted time and money on.</li>
            <li>The next night I combed again, and the amount was almost nothing, the first combing had almost completely removed everything.</li>
            <li>Then I called a professional service because it was our first time dealing with lice and the professional used the same comb.</li>
            <li>The KEY is you must wet the hair down and use a good de-tangler.  </li>
            <li>Keep using the comb twice a day, every day for at least 2 weeks after you&#x27;re certain they&#x27;re gone, and then still occasionally after that (to be sure).  </li>
            <li>AND THEY WERE CLEAR OF ALL NITS AND ANY BUGS.  </li>
            <li>but we&#x27;re in the clear.</li>
            <li>I used this comb in conjuction with the &#x27;Clear Lice&#x27; product line of Shampoos, which they (Clear Lice) guarantee will rid your family of lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i literally wanted to cry for joy, Ive spent so so much time an money, an my poor daughter sat thru mayonnaise wraps, olive oil, Listerine, concoctions from online home remedies, countless lice shampooing, coconut oil treatments, i bought coconut shampoos an added tea tree oils</li>
            <li>My 14 year old has had lice now for 3 months just cant seem to get them all.</li>
            <li>We had used that stuff before we called the professional</li>
            <li>and I tried just about everything a two year old</li>
            <li>My daughter got lice from school recently and she has really curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have to politely disagree, but I will tell you how I used this comb on my 8 year old&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Both of my kids, 6 year old boy and 3 year old girl, got lice.</li>
            <li>but I also think I caught it early.</li>
            <li>Also, I think you need the comb to really tell if you have all the nits, along with visual inspection.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see every nit with the naked eye and some are really buried close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>Also, I think you need the comb to really tell if you have all the nits, along with visual inspection.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see every nit with the naked eye and some are really buried close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and paid the extra to have it shipped out as fast as I could.</li>
            <li>By the 4th night of using the comb we were completely lice</li>
            <li>The combs in all the kids did bupkiss as far as getting out all the lice &amp; nits.  </li>
            <li>I tried two others but this was by far the best/ Will use it once a month</li>
            <li>I hired a professional lice removal person and here is what they did:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>My 12 year old decided to have makeovers with her friends..</li>
            <li>Again noticed one bug on the 10 year old, and didnt see anything else.....  </li>
            <li>I received this today and promptly tested it on my 7-year old daughter who has been having these lice and nits on and off for quite some time now.  </li>
            <li>I finally came upon this really neat comb and ordered it immediately.</li>
            <li>If you are dealing with this spawn of Satan, do not waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li>This comb was FAR, FAR easier to work</li>
            <li>s, then a natural treatment on both of us</li>
            <li>I decided to go buy this comb just to be safe and low in behold, there came all the nits out of my daughters long, long hair.  </li>
            <li>and i decided to try to do Nix professional grade treatment since it claims to kill eggs</li>
            <li>My 3.5-year old was sent home yesterday from preschool with lice.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money as it was a big help in combination with treatment to finally be rid of all the lice.</li>
            <li>, one has baby fine thinner dark hair, but the other one, baby fine super long almost to her waist super thick hair strawberry blonde, with reading that much can u only imagine my nightmare..</li>
            <li>They must live next to the scalp as they live on blood.</li>
            <li>EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR A WEEK, because this is the first time in 40 years I have ever encountered lice)</li>
            <li>Then we used an old plastic blue nit comb I&#x27;d used in the past, many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the only comb that works on a toddlers fine hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and definitely did the job!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The precision-aligned, long teeth with laser-cut micro spirals really do dislodge and damage nits and sweep away lice.</li>
            <li>If you find more than ten adult lice, chances are that you&#x27;ve been infected for at least three to four weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally diligent about tying her hair up, back, and away from her face when she&#x27;s outdoors (i.e. preschool, YMCA childcare, playground, etc.), but contagions are contagions.</li>
            <li>Repeat combing after 4 days, no spray unless there are live bugs (re-comb weekly to ensure nits are gone &amp; for prevention(comb only not spray)</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll keep getting all of the new hatchlings as they become larger.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll keep getting all of the new hatchlings as they become larger.</li>
            <li>I can not tell you enough how it got everything, every egg, nit, live lice.</li>
            <li>I found LIVE bugs on my child 2 hours later and NOTHING on the market kills the eggs.  </li>
            <li>3 hours later the jar was filled with nits and dead bugs.  </li>
            <li>You can control only so much of your environment, and the rest is left in the trust</li>
            <li>Spent a few more hours picking the nits out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; few quick suggestions&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt; few quick suggestions&lt;</li>
            <li>down, it&#x27;s going to be all right.</li>
            <li>We tried 3 other combs from various locations, but this is far and away better than any other lice comb!</li>
            <li>Neem seems to treat everything from breast cancer to insects to major bacterial and viral infections.</li>
            <li>For adults it may strip your hair shafts a little and cause some frizz, but my view is hair can always be cut and grown back -- just get a trim once you&#x27;re clean and bug</li>
            <li>Her hair is light, it&#x27;s harder to see in dark hair.</li>
            <li>After 3.5 weeks I thought we were in the clear, i couldn&#x27;t see anything with the naked eye</li>
            <li>Regular use of the Fairy Tales comb helps alleviate this condition, because the person feels that he or she is taking proactive action to ensure a lice-free life.</li>
            <li>We then followed standard lice procedures - washed all the bedding, vacuumed all the furniture, tossed all brushes and combs, had the mattresses professionally steam cleaned, etc...</li>
            <li>Giant plus for me because my daughters have sensitive heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dog picked up some flying sand lice, that were barely visible yet this comb picked them up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After researching a few things, I saturated her scalp and hair in TheraNeem Scalp Therape Conditioner (available on Amazon or local health stores), covered her head with a plastic disposable (4 pack from drug store in just a couple bucks) shower cap and left it that way for 5 hours.</li>
            <li>So last week my 8 year old son, sits on the sofa with me its midnight</li>
            <li>So I combed the 4 year old yesterday and only found one bug...</li>
            <li>The various methods of killing them are secondary.op to egg laying stage - the comb will remove them all during the continued frequent combings that should be done for a couple weeks).</li>
            <li>Do be careful to be gentle or it WILL take your hair with it</li>
            <li>MANUAL removal is THE only way to guarantee complete removal of lice and their eggs (nits).  </li>
            <li>however I found 5 nymphs, 2 full grown louse and quite a few nits!</li>
            <li>We ordered this via prime and and in the mean time resorted to a cheap drugstore plastic comb.  </li>
            <li>have neem oil which seems to work very well on mites and lice, but of course is not as harmless as the other oils like rosemary, and geranium.</li>
            <li>I used it every other day for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li>comb gets out lice and eggs, and the rounded tips means it&#x27;s much softer on the head than other combs.  </li>
            <li>step daughter had been coming for the last 5 months with lice and always claimed her mother wasn&#x27;t finding anything, then I would look and find several nits and bugs, my 3yr old ended up getting it and WHAT A DISASTER</li>
            <li>Though I usually try natural products first</li>
            <li>, since we could only douse our heads in chemicals once every seven days, i went to war with a lot of natural solutions - and one of them included similar ingredients to Fairy Tales spray, and I think that&#x27;s why I went ahead and chose this comb (that and,</li>
            <li>The tips of the comb teeth also gently sooth the itchy spots, avoiding the more dangerous behavior of gouging one&#x27;s scalp with finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>end and pretty close to a break down when I finally decided to google aggressive lice treatment.  </li>
            <li>One daughter has very curly blond hair, the other straight dark hair - I could use it on both</li>
            <li>Lice ONLY like the head -- no other part of the body.</li>
            <li>Pulls out nits, lice and is easy to use on thick long hair.  </li>
            <li>They can be killed by squishing, hot water (over 140°F), freezing (8-112 hours in the freezer is sufficient.</li>
            <li>I used a very small bristled brush like used to clean-out the blades of a wahl electric razor, to help clean out between the teeth of this comb,&lt;br /&gt;#2.</li>
            <li>I used a very small bristled brush like used to clean-out the blades of a wahl electric razor, to help clean out between the teeth of this comb,&lt;br /&gt;#2.</li>
            <li>I took out olive oil and spent 2 hours combing her hair and got out 25 live bugs.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter has very long hair and got lice from school.</li>
            <li>The lice care professional also brought real samples of lice (from nit to louse stages), all dead and laminated, of course!</li>
            <li>It works really well for getting all the little nits you can&#x27;t see.</li>

            <li> Great idea but not constructed well.  </li>
            <li> Great comb.</li>

            <li> This comb is very easy to use and excellent quality.</li>

            <li> Everyone with school age children should own one of these!</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this Terminator, and that&#x27;s fact not fiction :)</li>

            <li> We purchased this comb after reading reviews and have been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> there are nit picking services which are typically very competent and they will do it for you.</li>
            <li> there are nit picking services which are typically very competent and they will do it for you.</li>
            <li> You might even find them in the shower cap because we sure did!  </li>
            <li> This comb just pulls them out, both the eggs (be sure to use the gel!)</li>
            <li> so I just combed with this nit comb and was amazed at how many nits I removed!  </li>
            <li> SO GLAD we found this comb!</li>
            <li> But truthfully this comb is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> A must-have to winning the war!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this!  </li>
            <li> Love this comb!  </li>
            <li> She reminded me to always check for nits in bright light, sunlight is best, because nits reflect &amp; shine in the light.</li>
            <li> This comb is so Amazing , I have tried the plastic nit combs which dont even wk</li>
            <li> this comb is so amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing with the chemical producs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This comb is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> Amazing-</li>
            <li> It is amazing compared to what you can buy in the store.</li>
            <li> AND I &#x27;M AMAZING,</li>
            <li> This Terminator comb is probably the best one, the ridged teeth seem to work really well.  </li>
            <li> The Lice are kind of inmortals.</li>
            <li> I honestly tried every lice comb and treatment  </li>
            <li> My daughter said that the comb outs felt nice with this comb.</li>
            <li> I bought this to have handy just in case it was needed.</li>
            <li> It is a nice size</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, perfect buying experience!</li>
            <li> We went through every kind of comb, even those skinny metal ones with the plastic handle.  </li>
            <li> None of them were as effective.  </li>
            <li> Isopropyl alcohol also kills these guys quite nicely.</li>
            <li> THANK GOD*, and after examining my own scalp she found nothing.</li>
            <li> It is certainly the best quality most effective comb of its kind.  </li>
            <li> Being incredibly fastidious by nature, I followed the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> If your fighting the lice battle this is going to be your new best friend!!!!</li>
            <li> very good thank so much</li>
            <li> This is by far the best nit comb out there.  </li>
            <li> We gave one to our neighbor as well, whose daughter has more medium thickness hair, and it was AMAZING for her.</li>
            <li> but I would have liked it even better if it had a bit of padding in the grip.  </li>
            <li> Meanwhile, these chemical companies keep boosting the toxicity in order to combat the stubborn lice more effectively, but it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> If you have very fine hair than maybe this is your solution.  </li>
            <li> I STRONGLY recommend you try this!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed with the item and received it in good time.</li>
            <li> A good comb is the most important thing needed to eradicate lice.</li>
            <li> A good comb is the most important thing needed to eradicate lice.</li>
            <li> though this was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> and it certainly did a great job pulling out the nits and lice.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working much, much better than plastic version.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this item</li>
            <li> THIS COMB WORKS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER USED.  </li>
            <li> The Fairy Tales Terminator comb is more than just a lice and nit</li>
            <li> The teeth are varied in length to form a curved edge for better contact with your scalp at any angle.</li>
            <li> I used mouthwash, the one that is brown/tan in color that starts with an L :)  </li>
            <li> so I could see how many were in the hair.  </li>
            <li> and you will be able to see them</li>
            <li> I will repeat this a couple more times incase we did miss any nits</li>
            <li> What I love about this treatment is that I can repeat it as often as I want to make sure I get rid of them all.  </li>
            <li> and you will be able to see them</li>
            <li> I will repeat this a couple more times incase we did miss any nits</li>
            <li> What I love about this treatment is that I can repeat it as often as I want to make sure I get rid of them all.  </li>
            <li> She charged $100/hr, but I would pay that gladly again because she used this nit comb and it worked so well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this comb doesnt have more reviews.</li>
            <li> We were able to use this comb with no problem.</li>
            <li> and we were able to get all the nits.</li>
            <li> I swear there were more nits in the bowl than there was vinegar by the end.  </li>
            <li> (I found all this on the internet while researching for a safe process)</li>
            <li> but I want to make sure that I add my two cents.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than trying to use the combs that come in the over the counter kits.  </li>
            <li> so I started shopping Amazon for a better lice comb and found this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After spending 3 days hand picking as many nits</li>
            <li> Have purchased 2 more..</li>
            <li> It definitely is better than the comb that comes with Licemd.</li>
            <li> It is better at getting the lice.</li>
            <li> This lice and nit comb is way better than the plastic ones that come with the lice kits at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up well to many trips through the dishwasher and in forgotten pots of boiling water.</li>
            <li> better than what comes with a kit</li>
            <li> It missed most of the nits that I found.</li>
            <li> think the teeth would pick up more on thicker hair, but I can&#x27;t say for sure without testing it.</li>
            <li> Okay, you&#x27;re getting somewhere.</li>
            <li> Much better than the the already trashed plastic comb that came in the kit you may have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I overnighted this comb from the get-go.</li>
            <li> Look no further this nit comb is superior to anything out there!!!!</li>
            <li> and it is SO MUCH better than the comb that came with the Nix or even the individually-sold combs in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> Soooooo glad we did.</li>
            <li> and it pulled so many nits out of her hair.  </li>
            <li> My kids say it smells like a Christmas tree :)</li>
            <li> We bagged up stuffed animals and sprayed everything that wouldn&#x27;t fit through the hole in the washing machine!</li>
            <li> I love this comb</li>
            <li> so he didn&#x27;t have many.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not the great part, it combed out all the lice and nits really well.</li>
            <li> Used this everytime at bath time for awhile just to make sure, and the pesky problem is gone. :)</li>
            <li> We bought it because there have been many children with lice at our son&#x27;s school.</li>
            <li> love it love it</li>
            <li> love it love it</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this comb on all of us for a while just to be safe.  </li>
            <li> I paid more than twice what is listed here</li>
            <li> I got all the lice out of my daughters hair and would recommend this product to many people</li>
            <li> We continued the comb-throughs for a couple more days but never found anymore evidence of lice, and they did not return.</li>
            <li> The teeth have ridges so it catches the eggs so much better.</li>
            <li> No louse is safe.</li>
            <li> She looked ridiculously cute in a shower cap, too.</li>
            <li> We are still combing every night to be sure we didn&#x27;t miss anything.</li>
            <li> Now they even recommend re-treatment after so many days.</li>
            <li> Now think about how confident you will feel knowing that you have the power to control these bugs without dousing your children in harmful chemicals -- whose side effects may take years or decades to fully surface...</li>
            <li> After all, nit picking has been the longest lived procedure that is most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>

            <li> After all, nit picking has been the longest lived procedure that is most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I have much more experience with lice than I ever wanted - this comb is my favorite and helps keep me sane when the kids&#x27; heads start itching</li>
            <li> I literally felt i was never going to be able to permanently get them out of her hair.</li>
            <li> So one night i happened to once again be searching thru forums, more home remedies, etc</li>
            <li> i ended up winning these 3 combs for shipping and all around $10.</li>
            <li> , THIS IS the ONLY one that works perfectly..</li>
            <li> , THIS IS the ONLY one that works perfectly..</li>
            <li> I did like most parents and got a Rid kit.</li>
            <li> My friend told me I&#x27;d need a better comb and the internet seemed to agree.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, didn&#x27;t need to use it more than one day by the time it arrived.</li>
            <li> It will save you many hours of nitpicking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it will work if (knock on wood)</li>
            <li> I found that if you look *toward* the points of the tines at an angle, instead of looking at them from the side, horizontally, you&#x27;re able to see if there&#x27;s anything on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The non-ridged brands are easier to tell if its clean, but I think the ridges make this one more effective.</li>
            <li> More substantial than the pharmacy brand and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use a good detangler or olive oil which really worked well to loosen the nits too</li>
            <li> Easily the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I did find that combing the hair while wet to damp worked best</li>
            <li> It is unbelievably more comfortable for the licee.  </li>
            <li> It is so much better than the cheap plastic combs that come with the lice shampoos.</li>
            <li> The good things are the teeth are set very close and remain that way.  </li>
            <li> so, I actually used this comb to do a quick dandruff removal fix on my way out the door and it worked wonderfully for that, too.</li>
            <li> - so, I actually used this comb to do a quick dandruff removal fix on my way out the door and it worked wonderfully for that, too.</li>
            <li> You still need to work section-by-section, but this comb will help you move through the head more quickly and with much more assurance that you&#x27;re doing a thorough job.  </li>
            <li> My grand-daughter has had other treatments but the comb is the best remover.</li>
            <li> It is true!</li>
            <li> Easy to comb with gel.</li>
            <li> and she still was able to clean out dozens of nits using this comb.</li>
            <li> Now I make sure to wrap it in a paper towel when drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish it was easier to clean somehow</li>
            <li> or there were better directions on how to clean.  </li>
            <li> She also reported this one was easy to run through the child&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nits were easily visible, bugs weren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> We had to use a prescription to kill the lice--one treatment, that was easy.  </li>
            <li> and so when you boil comb the tines hold strong.</li>
            <li> the awesome thing about this comb is that you actually can get all the lice and nits in the first one or two treatments, if you are very diligent and working in a brightly lit area with a loop (magnifying glass).</li>

            <li> I have fine hair and this comb, did nothing but break my hair.  </li>
            <li> still worked but needed a FINE TOOTH COMB WHICH I COULDN&#x27;T FIND ANYWHERE.</li>

            <li> /&gt;IT IS A PRECISION-ENGENEERED HIGH-QUALITY, COMFORTABLE COMB</li>
            <li> The teeth are precisely aligned with smooth, rounded-tip teeth that can be run along your scalp without scratching.</li>
            <li> I dropped them into my light cream sink each time and that is how I could see all the nits.  </li>
            <li> And it goes smoothly through the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair.</li>
            <li> This comb is fabulous.</li>

            <li> The rounded tips help you comb thoroughly close to the scalp, and help keep the &#x27;patient&#x27; comfortable to reduce squirming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use a lot of conditioner with this comb.</li>
            <li> We have been lice free for 3 months now.</li>
            <li> I knew precisely how to de-nit</li>
            <li> Is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> I bought this comb  and so far so good.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> ONE bug on my 4 year old daughter, removed it and thought she was good, (didnt see any eggs),  </li>
            <li> My daughter was full full of head lice eggs, and after using this comb most of it dissapeared</li>
            <li> This comb is of very good quality as compared to all the other flimsy plastic combs.  </li>
            <li> You will find the bulk of lice in the first combing session -- once I found over 150 in a child!!</li>
            <li> You will find the bulk of lice in the first combing session -- once I found over 150 in a child!!</li>
            <li> Very useful when you find yourself in a &amp;#34;lousy&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Luckily we didn&#x27;t have any although I&#x27;m sure they would have stuck right to this comb for me to easily see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be so excited about a lice-related product, but this comb is making a HUGE difference in my daughter&#x27;s recovery.  </li>
            <li> It says that you can use it on dry hair, but damp hair is really the best way to use this comb.</li>
            <li> This prodcut is without a doubt worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> We used one treatment, and removed most of the lice/nits from the first comb-through.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> She has an incredible volume of hair down to her shoulders--</li>
            <li> Too good , I just use only two time  after hair wash ,Now  I am completely free from lice and nit.</li>
            <li> I would do one swipe with the comb and clean it out each time</li>
            <li> where both the nurse and the doctor checked her head and said she looked clean.</li>
            <li> Works great in dry hair.</li>
            <li> Strips hair clean.</li>
            <li> It is easier to clean and disinfect afterward.  </li>
            <li> A good vigorous workout always helps to clear the mind and calm the body...</li>
            <li> (yeah right!)</li>
            <li> in short good purchase... thank you</li>
            <li> We repeated the whole process in 5 days just to be safe since nits hatch about every 7 days.  </li>
            <li> You really need to be vigilant, and keep combing for days to make sure you are clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the one hand, I really like that it is all metal because I can boil it to make myself feel better, and also you can boil between users.  </li>
            <li> Ok,  didn&#x27;t get too much lice..  </li>
            <li> Picked those out and will check her daily for awhile and will use the lice shampoo again on her this weekend for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care; most parents will agree with me that when there is lice in the family you&#x27;re ready to go all out and do whatever it takes to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> :)t so so much time an money</li>
            <li> This saved us so much time and frustration as we were able to truly get everything out this time around.  </li>
            <li> , sometimes you have to move the comb around to get the right light to see the nits</li>
            <li> , sometimes you have to move the comb around to get the right light to see the nits</li>
            <li> until this comb arrived and the first swipe through resulted in many, many, many more dead nits.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews on it were great</li>
            <li> If that happens, just apply a drop of antiseptic, and the site should heal quickly.</li>
            <li> So, went back to the store to buy more treatment and treated both girls and myself just to be safe.  </li>
            <li> I then did more combing later that day and got one more louse.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo didn&#x27;t work but the comb was adequate.</li>
            <li> Ok, Ive read many an followed many reviews on all types of products for years left by other consumers, and this comb is so amazing</li>
            <li> GOT him clean and ordered this comb right away along with the leave in spray from Fairy tales and the shampoo.,..  </li>
            <li> a million times better than the other kind of combs.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, my daughter does not complaint of aches when I run the comb through on her scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Completely worth the money and not a bad price either.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much stuff this comb pulled out after I had been hand picking the eggs out for 3 days!!</li>
            <li> This is an absolute lifesaver!!  </li>
            <li> teeth are spaced tight and this is great when investigating for the possibility of lice.</li>
            <li> Got the hair really clean the first time.</li>
            <li> That may be very good for getting out nits, but it makes it a rather torturous process to use regularly for prevention, which is what I was hoping for by purchasing such a sturdy brush.</li>
            <li> for the next two days we comb her one in the morning and once a night and NOTHING, this comb is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> Do this cleaning calmly AFTER removing them from the infected people.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m upset that this comb isn&#x27;t sold at my local stores.</li>
            <li> For anyone that has tried everything, honest to goodness you only need conditioner and this comb!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fully confident that she will be lice free by the time they go back to their moms!  </li>
            <li> it was worth every penny!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHEST success rate to get almost all lice and nits with this comb.</li>
            <li> Finally someone told me to try mouthwash (the brown antiseptic kind) and I found the fairy tales terminator lice comb.</li>
            <li> The oil suffocates them and that was when I was finally able to get the adult lice off his head.  </li>
            <li> Some nits were so tiny you need to hold the comb up to the light to be able to see it.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Nice but only bought to comb my cat.</li>
            <li> I suggest you buy this comb right away and use it</li>
            <li> I found it right away.</li>
            <li> This is your solution right here.</li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We had eggs, nits, lice of all stages, combing right out of her hair</li>
            <li> But It wasnt until I get a metal Comb that it really get clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend spending the extra money on it and being able to get the job done right the first time and not having to spend more time or money having to retreat.</li>
            <li> For me, it was money excellently spent ($95 worth), because first and most important, she gave me peace of mind.</li>
            <li> We did everything right the first time.</li>
            <li> She only found 4-5 nits because the combing I did the night before did such a great job.</li>
            <li> Luckily, my 1.5-year old daughter came out clean, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has 2 daughters with long hair that was easily pulled out by those cheap plastic combs.  </li>
            <li> It does a really good job pulling out nits unlike the little plastic combs that come with the pesticide products.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly (thx Prime) and I set to checking my kids hair at each bath/shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can easily fold back hair along the part to get a good view down to the roots, right where one should be looking.  </li>
            <li> the very top edge needs a little more attention for nits an lice can get a bit trapped in the top part of the comb</li>
            <li> the very top edge needs a little more attention for nits an lice can get a bit trapped in the top part of the comb</li>
            <li> Really took the nits out quickly, because her hairs fit between the teeth more tightly.</li>
            <li> although many lice/nit combs will comb out (larger) lice, i was resigned to using my fingernails for stubborn nit (egg) removal.</li>
            <li> Best of luck, and I am sorry to all who have the need for this comb.</li>
            <li> And did daily nit picking to make sure we were getting all of the nits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I was able to do this on myself which was a big plus because I did not have to have my husband pick through my hair!!!  </li>

            <li> I am an avid amazon buyer and tend to put quite a bit of weight into the customer review</li>
            <li> (especially when there are many of them).  </li>
            <li> My kids got headlice the first week of school.  </li>
            <li> highly recomended!!</li>
            <li> She got checked today at school and is completely nit free.  </li>
            <li> After combing is complete, spray/saturate with ACU LIFE LICE CURE (also available on amazon)[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care!</li>
            <li> This actually pulls out the nits and exposes the lice much better.</li>
            <li> With each comb out, I would dip the Nit comb into the hot water and then wipe the comb with a papertowel.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if those help but smells nice!</li>
            <li> This was an absolute necessity in getting rid of the buggers!  </li>
            <li> It came within the promised time frame and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Most of the combs you buy at local drug stores are junk.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonder tool that really gets rid of EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this comb to everyone.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure and check his hair daily to catch the lice if they ever appeared.</li>
            <li> There are many treatments to choose from for getting rid of lice, but the key is removing everything from the hair.</li>
            <li> This comb really is a lice and nit terminator!  </li>
            <li> Items that cannot be washed in hot water and stuck in the dryer (like wool hats), can be put in the freezer overnight.</li>
            <li> Infected items that are bagged and removed and out of human contact for 30 days will starve them and will then be safe.</li>
            <li> , Now we use this comb just as maintenance purposes, because Ive believed that she must have friends or kids at school that pass these around , I&#x27;m very leery every time i see anyone scratch their heads even!</li>
            <li> , Now we use this comb just as maintenance purposes, because Ive believed that she must have friends or kids at school that pass these around , I&#x27;m very leery every time i see anyone scratch their heads even!</li>
            <li> It was the first time in my life that I&#x27;ve had to deal with this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to check his head to be absolutely sure the lice were gone and for future periodic checks.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my damp unconditioned hair and it definitely pulled it more than it did his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When we used this comb there were over 30 more nits combed out that I could not see and would have hatched starting this nightmare all over again.</li>
            <li> , you have to actually take the time to go through every section of their hair, but it does a much better job of removing nits than any of the combs that come with the kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you really want to know for SURE if your child has lice, or even more importantly, NO LONGER HAS LICE, you need this comb.</li>
            <li> the problem is you are not getting it all out in the first place, and eggs are hatching again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Finally I bought this comb, found several more nits and finally they were gone for good.  </li>
            <li> The other family was not managing the problem, so we took it into our own hands.  </li>
            <li> The swirled teeth are close together and effective, getting stuff other combs miss.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to hire a professional again because of the comb, but I&#x27;m grateful that she taught us how to clean it out ourselves.  </li>
            <li> I used an old tooth brush to clean the nit comb between each pull.  </li>
            <li> The first time I combed through her hair the comb was FULL of nits, they were clearly visible (you&#x27;d think she was fully infested</li>
            <li> Nobody wants to have to use this ever, but the truth is, if you have a child in school you will most likely have to at one point or another.  </li>
            <li> I treated my whole family with spray  first time even though not all  had lice</li>
            <li> My daughter caught lice again this year, and though our hair is fine, this helped us get rid of nits way better than the usual lice combs...</li>
            <li> The tines are super tightly spaced and they can find these little bugs along with their eggs incredibly well.</li>
            <li> An alcohol soaked paper towel is great place to deposit them or you can simply rinse them down the drain.</li>
            <li> Off to the store I go for more nix, the next morning I still found 5 live nymphs.</li>
            <li> I actually spotted a live bug on top of my daughters head during bathtime.</li>
            <li> My eyes were kind of swimming, actually, as there are a million and one different brands of these combs, all of which look pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Far superior to other combs, no doubt!!</li>
            <li> The ones that come in the shampoos are pretty useless, and you really want a high quality lice comb because everything I&#x27;ve read says that good effective combing is the key.  </li>
            <li> This is time consuming, especially because you can&#x27;t see if the nits are in the comb because the comb is metal and reflects light.</li>
            <li> The comb is stainless steel, and will not rust or break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am going to use this comb anyway since some nits are very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so much my daughter smiles again because of this comb</li>
            <li> I got out so much gunk.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t send the kids back to school until they are nit free.  </li>
            <li> We had used a plastic nit comb and the chemical lice wash years ago when we had this problem and it took much longer to get rid of the lice.  </li>
            <li> My daughter couldnt go back to school until she was 100% nit free</li>
            <li> It seems very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this de-nitting comb!</li>
            <li> The spiral grooves in each tooth of the comb really grab hold of the lice and eggs.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy too.</li>
            <li> Really works as said.</li>
            <li> This nit come works very well.</li>
            <li> I really</li>
            <li> IT really picks up the nits and does not damage the hair.</li>
            <li> it really help to get rid off the flaky stuffs or lice/egg from the hair.</li>
            <li> I combed my daughter&#x27;s hair with this comb without really knowing how to do it</li>
            <li> The coils around each tine really grabs hold of the nits and lice.</li>
            <li> but you really have to work on the nits.</li>
            <li> much much MUCH sooner..</li>
            <li> The real winner was Licefree and Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (shampoo with dawn dish detergent to remove) and comb tangles out before using this comb because the teeth are very close together and will pull hair out if not.</li>
            <li> We also put our childs clothes and coat straight in the washer from school knowing there was a chance of this coming home again.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This comb works very well if you use it as directed.</li>
            <li> hands of society&#x27;s children and their ever so responsible parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> This comb does a fantastic job of getting every last trace out.  </li>
            <li> Repeated the process until her whole head had been combed through (I keep a spray bottle of water to keep her hair wet during the process because I can see the nits in her hair better that way)</li>
            <li> The few that it did pull out of her hair on its&#x27; own, got stuck in the comb (at the end of the teeth, under the handle).</li>
            <li> I tired several brands and this was one of the 2 best that I tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Turns out, covering our heads in coconut oil and a variety of essential oils worked better than the nastiest chemicals you could buy at the drug store, and made me feel a lot safer about having to treat my three year old for this issue.</li>
            <li> It is more trouble than it is worth.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have had way too much experience with lice and have tried many different ways to get rid of them and even though I have had this comb now for a couple of years I have just found out how amazing it really is!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain what did more damage to the lice-</li>
            <li> so I did go to our local drug store to buy a decent nit comb which it was until I put it in hot water to clean.  </li>
            <li> Since it takes 6-7 days for the eggs to hatch you are combing for the first week to find any new hatchlings.</li>
            <li> Since it takes 6-7 days for the eggs to hatch you are combing for the first week to find any new hatchlings.</li>
            <li> However, the teeth went right through my six year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I would say this is a must and does work better than the other stainless steel combs we tried.</li>
            <li> Better than any other comb I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> We tried many other combs that come with the darn shampoo (over the counter)</li>
            <li> had more nits and bugs than I had ever found with any other comb.  </li>
            <li> This comb works better than any other combs we have used</li>
            <li> We tried a few different brands of combs and this was the best at removing lice from my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other comb.  </li>
            <li> The school checked them again the next day and were amazed at how clean they were.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if you have thick, strong hair this could work, but on fine hair it does nothing, and you can (literally) feel and hear it shredding the hair.</li>
            <li> My son has psoriasis on his scalp and this comb is great for getting the little flakes of dry skin out of his hair.</li>
            <li> Terminator comb : available on Amazon or Ulta beauty supply- for long hair, part into 3 sections, start with bottom,</li>
            <li> She came home Thursday morning when the nurse called and said she found a new baby louse on her head!</li>
            <li> This process did not take nearly as long as picking through the hair myself with my nails and was much easier on me and my daughters!!!  </li>
            <li> This process did not take nearly as long as picking through the hair myself with my nails and was much easier on me and my daughters!!!  </li>
            <li> We then towel dry the hair and brought out the Nit Free comb.  </li>
            <li> When we got home I decided to try running this comb through her hair while she was in the tub on her wet hair, just to see how easily it combed.</li>
            <li> And was able to pull out eggs I missed from previous comb outs.  </li>
            <li> In combination with Licefree liquid this comb worked nicely, much better then those plastic combs that last abut ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Love to hate this thing-it works great for what it is supposed to do-extract lice, nits &amp; nymphs from your scalp, but it hurts like hell and rips your hair out.  </li>
            <li> In this lifecycle, they go through three molts lasting a total of 10 days before they are able to reproduce.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this wallet-friendly tool.</li>
            <li> highly recomed it over any combes on the market.</li>
            <li> I have 5 kids, oldest is in high school...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> in all, though, I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> huge thanks to all the other reviewers who shared their experiences with it</li>
            <li> 2 year old daughter first got lice 2 months ago and my life turned into complete chaos, I was a held prisoner by nits and buggies!</li>
            <li> After newly moving &amp; my children going to a new school system, I was absolutely Mortified one day when my kids were sent home with head lice.  </li>
            <li> Can say this gets through his hair well, although it pulls a little (he has buzzed hair), but its better than getting lice/not finding the lice.</li>
            <li> Made to last, very tight tolerances on the spacing between teeth, which is good.</li>
            <li> The teeth don&#x27;t bend like other combs, so it makes it easy to pull lice out without damaging or pulling the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had done a decent job of picking through my daughter&#x27;s hair, but after two passes with this gadget we&#x27;d already found 3 new nymphs.  </li>
            <li> This little comb really works!!!!</li>
            <li> Clean the comb between strokes with a tissue, rinse, and wipe dry with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are combing sensitive people, this really upsets them.</li>
            <li> , the RID treatment doesnt work very well, lice were still alive after being treated...  </li>
            <li> and I had to hand pick most of them out and always ended up missing some.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean which is also a plus, because a lot of other combs have stuff get stuck in them that is hard to clean out.</li>
            <li> Then I used the Terminator comb and I was able to get out the dead lice.  </li>
            <li> I agree with another poster - order this next day shipping, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Then you might find a few more after that, keep combing</li>
            <li> Then you might find a few more after that, keep combing</li>
            <li> but it is not hard.  </li>
            <li> but it is not hard.  </li>
            <li> I am also ordering the Fairy Tales shampoo and leave in spray--since my son is going right back into the fray at school.</li>
            <li> Then I put regular conditioner in and it glides right through her hair and mine.  </li>
            <li> Most likely you will find little to nothing 3-6 days after the first combing session.</li>
            <li> Most likely you will find little to nothing 3-6 days after the first combing session.</li>
            <li> and the live bugs.  </li>
            <li> but she had not one live bug on her head.  </li>
            <li> I still didn&#x27;t see any live lice</li>
            <li> I knew it was lice, but I couldn&#x27;t see any live ones.  </li>
            <li> I took out my Terminator and with one swipe, I got two live bugs.  </li>
            <li> ; spray is for killing live</li>
            <li> and I started combing with the new comb.</li>
            <li> They live for 32-35 days.</li>
            <li> The ridges make it harder to see if its completely clean, which is why I tend to boil it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap... comes early as expected..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it would do a superior job to other metal combs because the teeth are spaced tightly together.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from the professional lice removers (yes, these companies exist and I highly recommend them, too.  </li>
            <li> Sadly we started with the pesticides, both rid and nix, and found that neither of them were successful in killing the live bugs.  </li>
            <li> divide hair into small sections and be sure to comb from all directions -- from the sides and below.</li>
            <li> only one that actually works - worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li> Works much better than the small, sharp-edged plastic combs that come with lice treatment kits.</li>
            <li> Finally my husband after much research found this comb, thank goodness for Amazon and their reviews!</li>
            <li> It is the first comb I&#x27;ve seen that actually pulls out nits.</li>
            <li> With this, 3 days of cleaning (just to be sure there was nothing remaining) and no more problems.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the first time I actually saw it work.</li>
            <li> washed and conditioned her hair, and then I took this comb, some spray in conditioner, a pot of hot boiling water (which I poured into a mason jar to dispose of later), a roll of papertowels, and went to work.  </li>
            <li> but this will definitely help with that more than the other combs</li>
            <li> Maybe if people brushed their hair first then it wouldnt tangle.</li>
            <li> things are minor compared to the payoff, plus for anyone with thick hair the length of the comb teeth is true blessing as well.. :)</li>
            <li> If one is left and it&#x27;s an adult female, you have the potential of her laying more eggs, so keep on combing.</li>
            <li> If one is left and it&#x27;s an adult female, you have the potential of her laying more eggs, so keep on combing.</li>
            <li> I would like to point out that if you have lice or nits in your hair they will come out in the comb and the big ones you will be able to see easily and the nits look like little dark things in-between the teeth of the comb.  </li>

            <li> : it&#x27;s actually more comfortable for the head, too - my daughter complained about the sharp teeth on the plastic combs, but the rounded tips on these teeth didn&#x27;t hurt her scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was amazing to see how much lice and nits I had missed with all of the other products I had wasted time and money on.</li>
            <li> The next night I combed again, and the amount was almost nothing, the first combing had almost completely removed everything.</li>
            <li> Then I called a professional service because it was our first time dealing with lice and the professional used the same comb.</li>
            <li> The KEY is you must wet the hair down and use a good de-tangler.  </li>
            <li> Keep using the comb twice a day, every day for at least 2 weeks after you&#x27;re certain they&#x27;re gone, and then still occasionally after that (to be sure).  </li>
            <li> AND THEY WERE CLEAR OF ALL NITS AND ANY BUGS.  </li>
            <li> but we&#x27;re in the clear.</li>
            <li> I used this comb in conjuction with the &#x27;Clear Lice&#x27; product line of Shampoos, which they (Clear Lice) guarantee will rid your family of lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i literally wanted to cry for joy, Ive spent so so much time an money, an my poor daughter sat thru mayonnaise wraps, olive oil, Listerine, concoctions from online home remedies, countless lice shampooing, coconut oil treatments, i bought coconut shampoos an added tea tree oils</li>
            <li> My 14 year old has had lice now for 3 months just cant seem to get them all.</li>
            <li> We had used that stuff before we called the professional</li>
            <li> and I tried just about everything a two year old</li>
            <li> My daughter got lice from school recently and she has really curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have to politely disagree, but I will tell you how I used this comb on my 8 year old&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Both of my kids, 6 year old boy and 3 year old girl, got lice.</li>
            <li> but I also think I caught it early.</li>
            <li> Also, I think you need the comb to really tell if you have all the nits, along with visual inspection.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see every nit with the naked eye and some are really buried close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> Also, I think you need the comb to really tell if you have all the nits, along with visual inspection.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see every nit with the naked eye and some are really buried close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and paid the extra to have it shipped out as fast as I could.</li>
            <li> By the 4th night of using the comb we were completely lice</li>
            <li> The combs in all the kids did bupkiss as far as getting out all the lice &amp; nits.  </li>
            <li> I tried two others but this was by far the best/ Will use it once a month</li>
            <li> I hired a professional lice removal person and here is what they did:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old decided to have makeovers with her friends..</li>
            <li> Again noticed one bug on the 10 year old, and didnt see anything else.....  </li>
            <li> I received this today and promptly tested it on my 7-year old daughter who has been having these lice and nits on and off for quite some time now.  </li>
            <li> I finally came upon this really neat comb and ordered it immediately.</li>
            <li> If you are dealing with this spawn of Satan, do not waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li> This comb was FAR, FAR easier to work</li>
            <li> s, then a natural treatment on both of us</li>
            <li> I decided to go buy this comb just to be safe and low in behold, there came all the nits out of my daughters long, long hair.  </li>
            <li> and i decided to try to do Nix professional grade treatment since it claims to kill eggs</li>
            <li> My 3.5-year old was sent home yesterday from preschool with lice.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money as it was a big help in combination with treatment to finally be rid of all the lice.</li>
            <li> , one has baby fine thinner dark hair, but the other one, baby fine super long almost to her waist super thick hair strawberry blonde, with reading that much can u only imagine my nightmare..</li>
            <li> They must live next to the scalp as they live on blood.</li>
            <li> EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR A WEEK, because this is the first time in 40 years I have ever encountered lice)</li>
            <li> Then we used an old plastic blue nit comb I&#x27;d used in the past, many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the only comb that works on a toddlers fine hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and definitely did the job!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The precision-aligned, long teeth with laser-cut micro spirals really do dislodge and damage nits and sweep away lice.</li>
            <li> If you find more than ten adult lice, chances are that you&#x27;ve been infected for at least three to four weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally diligent about tying her hair up, back, and away from her face when she&#x27;s outdoors (i.e. preschool, YMCA childcare, playground, etc.), but contagions are contagions.</li>
            <li> Repeat combing after 4 days, no spray unless there are live bugs (re-comb weekly to ensure nits are gone &amp; for prevention(comb only not spray)</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll keep getting all of the new hatchlings as they become larger.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll keep getting all of the new hatchlings as they become larger.</li>
            <li> I can not tell you enough how it got everything, every egg, nit, live lice.</li>
            <li> I found LIVE bugs on my child 2 hours later and NOTHING on the market kills the eggs.  </li>
            <li> 3 hours later the jar was filled with nits and dead bugs.  </li>
            <li> You can control only so much of your environment, and the rest is left in the trust</li>
            <li> Spent a few more hours picking the nits out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; few quick suggestions&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt; few quick suggestions&lt;</li>
            <li> down, it&#x27;s going to be all right.</li>
            <li> We tried 3 other combs from various locations, but this is far and away better than any other lice comb!</li>
            <li> Neem seems to treat everything from breast cancer to insects to major bacterial and viral infections.</li>
            <li> For adults it may strip your hair shafts a little and cause some frizz, but my view is hair can always be cut and grown back -- just get a trim once you&#x27;re clean and bug</li>
            <li> Her hair is light, it&#x27;s harder to see in dark hair.</li>
            <li> After 3.5 weeks I thought we were in the clear, i couldn&#x27;t see anything with the naked eye</li>
            <li> Regular use of the Fairy Tales comb helps alleviate this condition, because the person feels that he or she is taking proactive action to ensure a lice-free life.</li>
            <li> We then followed standard lice procedures - washed all the bedding, vacuumed all the furniture, tossed all brushes and combs, had the mattresses professionally steam cleaned, etc...</li>
            <li> Giant plus for me because my daughters have sensitive heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dog picked up some flying sand lice, that were barely visible yet this comb picked them up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After researching a few things, I saturated her scalp and hair in TheraNeem Scalp Therape Conditioner (available on Amazon or local health stores), covered her head with a plastic disposable (4 pack from drug store in just a couple bucks) shower cap and left it that way for 5 hours.</li>
            <li> So last week my 8 year old son, sits on the sofa with me its midnight</li>
            <li> So I combed the 4 year old yesterday and only found one bug...</li>
            <li> The various methods of killing them are secondary.op to egg laying stage - the comb will remove them all during the continued frequent combings that should be done for a couple weeks).</li>
            <li> Do be careful to be gentle or it WILL take your hair with it</li>
            <li> MANUAL removal is THE only way to guarantee complete removal of lice and their eggs (nits).  </li>
            <li> however I found 5 nymphs, 2 full grown louse and quite a few nits!</li>
            <li> We ordered this via prime and and in the mean time resorted to a cheap drugstore plastic comb.  </li>
            <li> have neem oil which seems to work very well on mites and lice, but of course is not as harmless as the other oils like rosemary, and geranium.</li>
            <li> I used it every other day for 2 weeks straight</li>
            <li> comb gets out lice and eggs, and the rounded tips means it&#x27;s much softer on the head than other combs.  </li>
            <li> step daughter had been coming for the last 5 months with lice and always claimed her mother wasn&#x27;t finding anything, then I would look and find several nits and bugs, my 3yr old ended up getting it and WHAT A DISASTER</li>
            <li> Though I usually try natural products first</li>
            <li> , since we could only douse our heads in chemicals once every seven days, i went to war with a lot of natural solutions - and one of them included similar ingredients to Fairy Tales spray, and I think that&#x27;s why I went ahead and chose this comb (that and,</li>
            <li> The tips of the comb teeth also gently sooth the itchy spots, avoiding the more dangerous behavior of gouging one&#x27;s scalp with finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> end and pretty close to a break down when I finally decided to google aggressive lice treatment.  </li>
            <li> One daughter has very curly blond hair, the other straight dark hair - I could use it on both</li>
            <li> Lice ONLY like the head -- no other part of the body.</li>
            <li> Pulls out nits, lice and is easy to use on thick long hair.  </li>
            <li> They can be killed by squishing, hot water (over 140°F), freezing (8-112 hours in the freezer is sufficient.</li>
            <li> I used a very small bristled brush like used to clean-out the blades of a wahl electric razor, to help clean out between the teeth of this comb,&lt;br /&gt;#2.</li>
            <li> I used a very small bristled brush like used to clean-out the blades of a wahl electric razor, to help clean out between the teeth of this comb,&lt;br /&gt;#2.</li>
            <li> I took out olive oil and spent 2 hours combing her hair and got out 25 live bugs.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has very long hair and got lice from school.</li>
            <li> The lice care professional also brought real samples of lice (from nit to louse stages), all dead and laminated, of course!</li>
            <li> It works really well for getting all the little nits you can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> things are minor compared to the payoff, plus for anyone with thick hair the length of the comb teeth is true blessing as well..</li>
            <li> For boys, we simply buzz cut their hair pretty short, wet down the hair and apply oil to the scalp (use food grade olive oil -- which is beneficial to your hair and scalpanyway).</li>
            <li> It says to use on dry or barely wet hair, but if you have thick or curly hair it is not going to be easy.</li>
            <li> Since we didn&#x27;t have time to pick through her hair constantly (due to all the laundry and cleaning we had to do because of the lice), we hired a professional lice cleaner.  </li>
            <li> But dont forget to do all the other steps to completely eliminate head lice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also why I only gave it 4 out of five stars - because I really just can&#x27;t see the difference between this and other combs that look just like it, other than the packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just barely long enough to pull back and put in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> the reality is that these little creatures, while quite adept at finding hosts, are delicate little creatures.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it really matters if you see them.</li>
            <li> After a desperate call to the lice care removal service, they literally used this exact same comb, along with a spray bottle with water &amp; conditioner to help detangle hair first..</li>
            <li> It is well made and will last a long time</li>
            <li> This comb did that, removing lice and nits from short and long hair.</li>
            <li> What worked for us to prevent reinfestation was the initial treatment, this comb everyday for 1st 14 days, cleaned and washed everything, vacuumed floors and furniture daily,  washed bedding everyday for 2 weeks, bagged all toys that couldn&#x27;t be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer for 4 weeks, and a designated seat for use only for our child with lice in the living room with a sheet put down and washed daily, all combs thrown away and purchased replacements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d treated with the products available locally - both the shampoo and the ridiculous little plastic combs - but went ahead and ordered this after researching.  </li>
            <li> Their hair always looks so pretty after this conditioning treatment and no more lice!</li>
            <li> When we were blessed with the little buggers I nearly DIED!</li>
            <li> The next day I turned on a very long movie for her and pick through ever hair with this comb.  </li>
            <li> Look NO Further .. take it from a mom that&#x27;s spent countless hours and literally well over $100 + in products, with the cheap plastic combs, expensive metal flea combs, even the \\&quot;electric lice combs\\&quot; rid combs, u name it</li>
            <li> Look NO Further .. take it from a mom that&#x27;s spent countless hours and literally well over $100 + in products, with the cheap plastic combs, expensive metal flea combs, even the \\&quot;electric lice combs\\&quot; rid combs, u name it</li>
            <li> The other comb separated the hair enough for me to see the nits but didn&#x27;t actually pull them out-</li>
            <li> , only i knew it would be costly to have enough for her hair, so I decided to search amazon, eBay, other online sites for any sorta price breaks on this, when to my discovery</li>
            <li> It is thick with large corkscrew curls.</li>
            <li> It really does get everything, and yes it is hard to see nits, but if you rinse after each run through the hair...</li>
            <li> so I was surprised those little suckers were so fast to hide.  </li>
            <li> it was unfortunate i had to research these products in the first place, but my three year old came home scratching one day and lo and behold...</li>
            <li> The teeth are long, so works well with long hair (although we have medium length hair).</li>
            <li> On day 4 the comb arrived and while there was a minor learning curve to it we reduced our combing time dramatically to about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> We used it with Lice MD as a treatment and then later with wet hair to check for nits/lice.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to let the hair get too deep in.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair, and my daughter, who has hair over two feet long.</li>
            <li> The oil will simply allow the hair to remain slippery wet for a longer time for you to comb.</li>
            <li> The oil will simply allow the hair to remain slippery wet for a longer time for you to comb.</li>
            <li> i happened upon this comb on eBay, it was actually an auction for 3 brand new ones , no one hardly had bid on them, so</li>
            <li> ONE use of this comb through my son&#x27;s hair removed live lice and tons of nits that were too small for me to see.  </li>
            <li> I would spray each small section with the leave in conditioner, brush it out with a new brush from the dollar store (which we threw that away after as well), and then ran the Nit Comb through it.  </li>
            <li> dandruff (she has itchy eczema), and plain old dirt/sand.</li>
            <li> It made my scalp red, dry, hot and very sensitive to the subsequent scraping with the lice &amp; nit comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, these little buggies have been around as long as humans, and enough time to have built up immunities to these dangerous &amp; harmful chemical treatments.</li>
            <li> It was a very big part in being rid of those pesky little lice at long last.</li>
            <li> Run the comb through your hair, along the scalp, starting from the nape of the neck upward, and repeat for other areas.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a precaution due to my daughter possibly being exposed at camps and school.  </li>
            <li> After a freakout session that lasted longer than I&#x27;d care to admit, I began trying to figure out the best method of eradicating these little disgusting buggies.</li>
            <li> I recomend this comb to everyone as well as concentrate dish soap on a dry head.</li>
            <li> comb (DRY HAIR) with nit comb[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I used this on his dry hair that he conditioner washes (no shampoo).</li>
            <li> I then repeated this mouthwash and comb treatment the next day and only found a few nits.  </li>
            <li> I then repeated this mouthwash and comb treatment the next day and only found a few nits.  </li>
            <li> This is also a miracle, it was the only thing we found that actually did what it said and KILLED the eggs.</li>
            <li> think the &#x27;fairy tale&#x27; shampoos and repellent&#x27;s are nearly as effective as the  &amp;#34;Clear Lice&amp;#34; products, but the clear lice products</li>
            <li> When I used it, the comb didn&#x27;t grab a single thing off his head.</li>
            <li> It was able to catch the tiny tiny little eggs left behind from those little suckers.</li>
            <li> She discovered that our other daughter was starting to get lice, which I missed although I thought I looked carefully.  </li>
            <li> The metal teeth came loose because they were attached to a plaster frame.  </li>
            <li> My kids came down with lice last week.  </li>
            <li> We will continue to run the comb through her hair daily and take all other preventative measures, but this was truly a lifesaver!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The comb is made out of stainless steel with long, thin, spiral etched tines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was skeptical about this comb&#x27;s nit removal powers until the first time I ran it through my daughter&#x27;s hair and removed about ten nits in one fell swoop!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have a single incident after!</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, combing it for nits with that little plastic comb from the kit was about as possible as getting an elephant to sit in a church pew.</li>
            <li> My teen son had lice a little over a week ago.</li>
            <li> recent outbreak had my family in the weeds with little critters...</li>
            <li> My scalp reacted terribly to the stuff and flaked quite a bit in my obsessive treatment process (first chemicals, then a natural treatment on both of us EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR A WEEK, because this is the first time in 40 years I have ever encountered lice) -</li>
            <li> I probably spent over a $100 before I found this comb a week into my ordeal and it has changed my entire view of these little nuisances!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calm</li>
            <li> and I found them early after she complained that her head itched a lot.</li>
            <li> For girls, especially those with long hair, you&#x27;re going to have to section off the hair in small chunks and scrape the scalp, combing the hair all the way to the ends.</li>

            <li> but if it is too wet you get a lot of water in the comb.  </li>
            <li> Then repeated another few days later and found none!  </li>
            <li> Then repeated another few days later and found none!  </li>
            <li> I went through my daughters hair everyday for the last two weeks</li>
            <li> I went into overdrive when I found out our household had lice and ordered almost every product out there, including a few different lice combs.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;d spent 6 hours every night at it.</li>
            <li> is money well spent.</li>
            <li> and they were actually already dead.</li>
            <li> We spent so much money on useless over the counter treatments, I hand picked nits for hours to no avail, I even called our pediatrician who sadly told me there was nothing he could do or prescribe that wasn&#x27;t already readily available to me.  </li>
            <li> a few days later I would find nits again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with all the others, especially the ones that come with the lice kits.</li>
            <li> I have spent well over $250 in</li>
            <li> It removes loose hair, dandruff, dust and other particles that often collect in brushes (especially those round brushes with a dozen bristles per socket).</li>
            <li> I used the gallon sized clear lice shampoo to make a safe spray-on repellent, laundry soap, and learned to keep my dog away from other infected dogs and places with sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We treated her very long, thick hair on Monday night and I continued checking her before and after school and each evening and re-treated her with Nix on Wednesday evening when we found a few live baby lice.</li>
            <li> Also, lice prefer clean people who wash their hair frequently as this dries out the base of the hair shaft making it easier for them to affix their eggs.</li>
            <li> Also, lice prefer clean people who wash their hair frequently as this dries out the base of the hair shaft making it easier for them to affix their eggs.</li>
            <li> Also the other comb we have has a very nice handle, but terrible comb performance.</li>
            <li> Wash the bedding and dry thoroughly, then use the comb, repeat process typically just once, then it is done period.</li>
            <li> I too used a white paper towels, to wipe them from the comb every time we pulled it thru her long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It did pull out a few stands but that is to be expected with a metal comb that has such tightly spaced teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left it sitting wet a few times on the counter, and have seen a little bit of orange appear.</li>
            <li> one child keeps getting reinfected in school and reinfecting all the other kids.</li>
            <li> My other daughter ended up with them.  </li>
            <li> This time I went back to a solution I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Our school has since called to see what we did for other families who were struggling to get rid of the problem.  </li>
            <li> but it beat out all the other combs I tried.  </li>
            <li> We tried all the other combs that came with the lice kits.</li>
            <li> Did ya look at other metal combs?</li>
            <li> Can you see the space between the teeth of other metal combs?</li>
            <li> All other combs, including other metal combs, do not compare to this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with other combs.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other semi-metal combs I had to use, these metal teeth didn&#x27;t fall out like the others.</li>
            <li> We were skeptical about this product until the first swipe.</li>
            <li> ANYWAY also combed my two other girls out and found just nits, maybe one bug on one of them...</li>
            <li> I have thrown the other 4 combs, the ones that come with the kits from the stores away</li>
            <li> This comb beat out all of the other combs that came in the boxes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying other products i realize that this was what I need it for results</li>
            <li> My husband came home to do another round on her a few hours later, and there was nothing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that expensive for how well it works and how much time and stress it saves.</li>
            <li> so you have at least a chance of taking care of the problem as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the comb (aside from needing the dang thing at all) is that sometimes hair gets caught in the corner edges where the tines meet the handle area.</li>
            <li> The various methods of killing them are secondary.</li>
            <li> my daughters hair was so thick i always had to buy double the shampoo treatments just to almost cover her hair, an i refused to cut it.</li>
            <li> as I could my eyes and fingers were tired and between my daughter and I (both with very long hair) and my teenage son</li>
            <li> None of them kept the screaming and discomfort down to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> Do this from 3-4 directions (down, sideways from both sides and even combing up from the bottom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to repeat this treatment twice a day (morning and night), for about 2-3 weeks, depending on your level of OCD.</li>

            <li> The other plastic combs are a joke, but this comb means business!  </li>
            <li> It made it hurt less and cut down the amount of time he was spending going through my hair and the time I was spending on our kids.</li>
            <li> Used it on both girls and spent a few hours hand picking through her hair to remove the nits (not a fun job!).  </li>
            <li> will (by this I mean I think it&#x27;s unnecessary to pick eggs off every stand - just comb a couple times a day for a few days after the initial comb to get all the nasties out, and use whatever seconday method works to kill any hatchlings before they can develop to egg laying stage - the comb will remove them all during the continued frequent combings that should be done for a couple weeks).</li>
            <li> My daughter has long (to her waist), thick, dark black hair.</li>
            <li> I have three daughters all with long, dark, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was seriously on the verge of shaving my entire head until I came across this .</li>
            <li> head was full of nits that were impossible to remove all from her thick, long hair by hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have spent $100s of dollars past 8 months if they put this comb In ever lice medicine box LICE</li>
            <li> With 4 boys and one girl with long, thick hair, I&#x27;ve been battling lice for 4 months--</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> Nix and Rid did nothing in our house, it came down to three weeks of combing every few days, this comb worked.</li>
            <li> and hopefully won;t have need of it again, or at least for a very long time.</li>
            <li> but the bugs invaded my little ones hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> We are crossing our fingers in hopes we got all the little guys.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now the mouthwash can sting/tingle a little but it all the times I have used it I have never had any problems.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now the mouthwash can sting/tingle a little but it all the times I have used it I have never had any problems.  </li>
            <li> with this, and some medical treatment, those hair infesting skull blood suckers were gone!</li>
            <li> A must have when you have little kids.</li>
            <li> I was SHOCKED when this comb pulled out not only 4 eggs, but A LIVE BUG.  </li>
            <li> My daughter actually likes the tough comb because it helps ease the itchy scalp from her eczema.</li>
            <li> After trying a few of the shampoos and lotion/conditioner kits, I found that my little one still would have a number of nits, and even a few bugs.  </li>
            <li> After trying for 3 straight days separating hair, combing and cutting nits out twice a day there were still nits being found after i thought we had them all.</li>
            <li> frm the store that was still missing Nits .</li>
            <li> If you plug your sink up as you rinse the mouthwash out you can find the dead lice floating or on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> She said her mom had been combing her hair everyday with a lice comb (probably the comb that came with the medication)</li>
            <li> and we were not free.</li>
            <li> However the school found a few nits and told the kids I needed to pick them again.  </li>
            <li> and I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> then every few days after that for another 2 weeks</li>
            <li> The eggs we found after that had not advanced or hatched.</li>
            <li> Plastic combs are a waste of time, money and landfill.</li>
            <li> If you or someone you know is battling this problem, don&#x27;t waste another moment searching for solutions, just get this.  </li>
            <li> As soon as we received it, we ran it through my childrens&#x27; hair and removed quite a few lice.</li>
            <li> Reused every few days to catch missed eggs that may have hatched.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few.</li>
            <li> After the Nix I hadn&#x27;t found anything for a few days.  </li>
            <li> , an my poor daughter sat thru mayonnaise wraps, olive oil, Listerine, concoctions from online home remedies, countless lice shampooing, coconut oil treatments, i bought coconut shampoos an added tea tree oils..</li>
            <li> If you have been struggling with lice and they \\&quot;keep coming back\\&quot;  every few weeks or months...</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm, removed all nits from my daughters hair that the other plastic combs left behind!</li>
            <li> --so the nits were never easy to spot.  </li>
            <li> I think they were deads ones that had been pulled furthur down on her hair, but it just proves the combs with the kids are crap.  </li>
            <li> being in the bathtub for an hour with nit cream in my toddler&#x27;s hair, I was growing easily frustrated with what exactly I was looking for-</li>
            <li> The teeth are very close together and getting it through my daughter&#x27;s hair is practically impossible.  </li>
            <li> This was our first and hopefully last experience with these nasty little bugs.</li>
            <li> And when the comb arrived, I was happy at the ease with which it slipped through my daughter&#x27;s poor, abused hair in a way that awful, stupid plastic comb never could, and how much gunk it picked up out of there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would highly recommend, My 2 year old daughter had an awful case of nits and lice, this comb did the job!</li>
            <li> Frustrated with going around in circles trying to treat the lice I read up on how to really truly get rid of the lice.</li>
            <li> waste your money or time on anything else!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I had to in this case.</li>
            <li> Not sure where, but assume the boy brought it home from school.</li>
            <li> One of the mothers in my child&#x27;s class who was unfortunately dealing with their 2nd lice infestation swore by this comb.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this silly comb.</li>
            <li> Once I bought this comb all I had to do was wash my daughter&#x27;s hair as usual, apply conditioner and go to work with the comb.</li>
            <li> Ok this has been horrible</li>
            <li> Ok this has been horrible</li>
            <li> Why this product isn&#x27;t sold in drug stores (next to mostly useless lice removal products) is beyond me.  </li>
            <li> i was charged for 3 of these when i only bought one, so i am angry.</li>
            <li> You have to do small</li>
            <li> only complaint with this product is that the tines are so shiny, it&#x27;s difficult to see if anything came out.  </li>
            <li> After that i applied the gel to her hair and combed it every night for a week until i had at least 7 days with nothing coming out during combing.  </li>
            <li> If lice are a common occurrence in your schools I recommend purchasing one of these.</li>
            <li> I had never had to deal with them before &amp; bought everything I could to get rid of the suckers.  </li>
            <li> It sucks that I had to buy a lice and nit comb period</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where all of the glowing reviews are coming from, because this is not a good product.</li>
            <li> the comb sucks.</li>
            <li> There is NO treatment product on the market, chemical or otherwise, that can guarantee you that you will be free of this nasty affliction.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The combs that come with the treatment products you buy, like Rid or Nix, and yes, even the Fairy Tales product (come on Fairy Tales, I like your products but the plastic comb that comes with your lice killing foam sucks</li>
            <li> Having deloused 4 girls all with waist length thick curly hair my hand and the comb got a bit of a workout.  </li>
            <li> Mine is really thick</li>
            <li> hair is thick, dense, and curly.</li>
            <li> well let&#x27;s just say some of these are soooo small that there was no way to see them and this comb pulled them out!</li>
            <li> this going to mean you won&#x27;t get reinfested?</li>
            <li> might find it a little painful if they have long hair.  </li>
            <li> It removed the nits and the teeniest tiniest bugs that were too small to see yet!  </li>
            <li> No more lice!</li>
            <li> Very little is as frustrating as finding out your child has lice.</li>
            <li> This comb catches very, very small lice and their eggs.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> [seriously we have two].</li>
            <li> forget anything else, throw the chemicals away, and those cheesy little plastic combs.  </li>
            <li> I say whats wrong are you itchy,  he says a little</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that it rips out a lot of hair where the teeth attach into the handle.</li>
            <li> If you are unfortunate to have lice worm its head into your home, spend the money overnight it and end the nightmare in just a few combings.  </li>
            <li> its tough and durable...</li>
            <li> are tough to get rid of and I also bought all the treatment products, chemicals, etc until I learned the truth.  </li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this, you probably know how embarrassing and exhausting head lice can be.  </li>
            <li> We have been fighting lice for what seems like FOREVER and when I saw the price of this comb I was skeptical to say the least -</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe what was in my poor daughters hair/head.  </li>
            <li> This might work on really thin hair, but the teeth are so close</li>
            <li> Have you spent HOURS upon HOURS picking nits, cutting nits out or trying desperately to comb out nits from your child&#x27;s hair?  </li>
            <li> The only discomfort is that you must rake each hair section from the base of the hair, along the scalp and this can be uncomfortable for children.</li>
            <li> She has very, very thick, curly hair and difficult to comb</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days of using the crappy, painful plastic combs that come with lice removal kits, I was sent this way by a forum thread of moms who&#x27;d dealt with this before.</li>
            <li> This comb is tough, rugged and it gets them out!  </li>
            <li> I still use it everyday on the kids to ensure the disgusting little, children hopping buggers haven&#x27;t hit again!!</li>
            <li> and it was basically useless</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the only comb that grabs and pulls those nasty critter eggs off the hair</li>
            <li> It is a tedious process but it WORKS.</li>
            <li> Had a scare, but thankfully we were wrong.</li>
            <li> So even after all the reviews I was still skeptical but after dealing with this for a month with my daughter I thought what the heck.</li>
            <li> , I know this sounds silly</li>
            <li> Over the years with kids and now grandkids and useless combs, this comb does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this extremely difficult to draw through my daughters hair without hurting her, even with lubrication and a lot of patience.</li>
            <li> was picking eggs out of my kids hair with tweezers and cutting hair before I had</li>
            <li> Desperate, I looked on Amazon and found this comb.  </li>
            <li> and I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> In fact buy a few!!!!!</li>

            <li> I will never be casual about lice warnings again when the notice comes home!</li>
            <li> We had the unfortunate experience of repeated, horrible, terrible, no good, very bad lice in our home from a child who we watched regularly.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> You will be frustrated.</li>

            <li> Very badly designed product.</li>

            <li> It was awful.  </li>

            <li> Seems to be working much, much better than plastic version.</li>
            <li> Too good , I just use only two time  after hair wash ,Now  I am completely free from lice and nit.</li>
            <li> Works great. The one to get.</li>
            <li> This is a great nit comb. With daily comb throughs all the nits were removed. Our problem was solved in one week, with treatment and daily use of this comb. Great product for a stressful situation.</li>
            <li> although many lice/nit combs will comb out (larger) lice, i was resigned to using my fingernails for stubborn nit (egg) removal. this comb pulls them ALL out! divide hair into small sections and be sure to comb from all directions -- from the sides and below.</li>
            <li> When you need it, you need it.  Have it shipped overnite &amp; it will save you tons of headaches!  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Wish I never had to use this but the bugs invaded my little ones hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the terminator they WONT BE BACK!</li>
            <li> My 14 year old has had lice now for 3 months just cant seem to get them all. I bought this comb  and so far so good. It works well and is great on their head. Easy to comb with gel. We are crossing our fingers in hopes we got all the little guys. I dont want them anymore!!!!!!!!!!! Pray it works!!!!!!! Would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m upset that this comb isn&#x27;t sold at my local stores. I only heard about it through another mom. It actually saved me from having a nervous breakdown. With 4 boys and one girl with long, thick hair, I&#x27;ve been battling lice for 4 months--one child keeps getting reinfected in school and reinfecting all the other kids. I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on shampoos. ONE use of this comb through my son&#x27;s hair removed live lice and tons of nits that were too small for me to see.  I literally cried with relief.  My children&#x27;s lice is gone. To all the moms out there battling lice--just get this comb so you can get on with your life.  It&#x27;s AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> only one that actually works - worth its weight in gold!</li>
            <li> a million times better than the other kind of combs. Worth every penny and more</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This prodcut is without a doubt worth every penny! It works so well! I am so glad I found this item and I would recommend every household have one on hand!</li>
            <li> If you have lice, just use that generic yellow/brown mouthwash for about an hour and this comb.  Keep using the comb twice a day, every day for at least 2 weeks after you&#x27;re certain they&#x27;re gone, and then still occasionally after that (to be sure).  The comb makes getting rid of them a lot easier than picking through your own head though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE RAISED KIDS FOR 20 YRS.  I HAD 5 DAUGHTERS AND 3 NIECES.  THIS COMB WORKS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I HAVE EVER USED.  ONE TIME IS ALL WE&#x27;VE NEEDED TO GO THRU HAIR AND THEY WERE CLEAR OF ALL NITS AND ANY BUGS.  WONDERFUL ITEM!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> OMg This comb is so Amazing , I have tried the plastic nit combs which dont even wk and I bought a metal comb frm the store that was still missing Nits . But not this one The Terminator is a must if ur having a lice problem .</li>
            <li> Very little is as frustrating as finding out your child has lice. No matter what chemical or product you use on it...you are going to end up combing her hair for several hours, several different times. I suggest you buy this comb right away and use it so you have at least a chance of taking care of the problem as quickly as possible. It really does get everything, and yes it is hard to see nits, but if you rinse after each run through the hair...I am not sure it really matters if you see them. It says to use on dry or barely wet hair, but if you have thick or curly hair it is not going to be easy. I think that is where the lice combing gels would come in very handy. Best of luck, and I am sorry to all who have the need for this comb.</li>
            <li> Great product, and it does help a lot, but BEWARE! This is time consuming, especially because you can&#x27;t see if the nits are in the comb because the comb is metal and reflects light.</li>
            <li> Better than any other comb I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The Fairy Tales Terminator comb is more than just a lice and nit comb.&lt;br /&gt;It is also:&lt;br /&gt;- A high-quality, comfortable comb for combing out your hair,&lt;br /&gt;- A hair cleaning comb that gets what shampoos and brushes miss, and&lt;br /&gt;- A psycho-therapy comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A PRECISION-ENGENEERED HIGH-QUALITY, COMFORTABLE COMB&lt;br /&gt;for combing out your hair. The teeth are precisely aligned with smooth, rounded-tip teeth that can be run along your scalp without scratching. The teeth are varied in length to form a curved edge for better contact with your scalp at any angle. The comb is stainless steel, and will not rust or break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A HAIR CLEANING COMB&lt;br /&gt;that gets what shampoos and brushes miss. It removes loose hair, dandruff, dust and other particles that often collect in brushes (especially those round brushes with a dozen bristles per socket). Run the comb through your hair, along the scalp, starting from the nape of the neck upward, and repeat for other areas. Clean the comb between strokes with a tissue, rinse, and wipe dry with a tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS A PSYCHO-THERAPY COMB&lt;br /&gt;It is an adjunct to treating lusphobic paranoia (fear of imagined lice), a condition that often follows recovery from a lice infestation. With this condition, every scalp itch is perceived as a potential head louse, and every spec of dust or dandruff as a nit. As itching spreads, the imagined re-infection spreads. Regular use of the Fairy Tales comb helps alleviate this condition, because the person feels that he or she is taking proactive action to ensure a lice-free life. The tips of the comb teeth also gently sooth the itchy spots, avoiding the more dangerous behavior of gouging one&#x27;s scalp with finger nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND, OF COURSE, IT IS ALSO A LICE TREATMENT AND ONGOING PREVENTIVE COMB.&lt;br /&gt;The precision-aligned, long teeth with laser-cut micro spirals really do dislodge and damage nits and sweep away lice. Works much better than the small, sharp-edged plastic combs that come with lice treatment kits. Note that, like any comb, this comb can dislodge scabs from bite sites. If that happens, just apply a drop of antiseptic, and the site should heal quickly.tic combs that come with lice treatment kits.

            <li> I tried using this comb, it ended in the trash-can.  I have fine hair and this comb, did nothing but break my hair.  I might catch some lice, however your hair will be gone too.</li>
            <li> If you have lice you need this comb!  Unfortunately I have had way too much experience with lice and have tried many different ways to get rid of them and even though I have had this comb now for a couple of years I have just found out how amazing it really is!!!  One or both of my girls always seem to get lice in the spring and this year was not any different.  So, when one came home with it in March I went out and bought 2 bottles of the stuff you find at your local drug store.  Used it on both girls and spent a few hours hand picking through her hair to remove the nits (not a fun job!).  I then did a follow up treatment a week later on both.  And did daily nit picking to make sure we were getting all of the nits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought all was well, but I was wrong!  My other daughter ended up with them.  So, went back to the store to buy more treatment and treated both girls and myself just to be safe.  Spent a few more hours picking the nits out.  Repeated treatment a week later with daily nit pickings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again thought all was well and I was wrong again!  This time I went back to a solution I have used in the past. I used mouthwash, the one that is brown/tan in color that starts with an L :)  Put in on the girls hair and mine and put a disposable shower cap on.  Left it on for about 45 minutes or so and rinsed it out.  If you plug your sink up as you rinse the mouthwash out you can find the dead lice floating or on the bottom.  You might even find them in the shower cap because we sure did!  We then towel dry the hair and brought out the Nit Free comb.  I combed through their hair and boy was I getting a lot of adults, babies and even the nits.  I would do one swipe with the comb and clean it out each time so I would not put it back in the hair.  I actually put the lice/nit on a paper towel so I could see how many were in the hair.  I did find that combing the hair while wet to damp worked best but if it is too wet you get a lot of water in the comb.  I would like to point out that if you have lice or nits in your hair they will come out in the comb and the big ones you will be able to see easily and the nits look like little dark things in-between the teeth of the comb.  Just look between the teeth each time and you will be able to see them, sometimes you have to move the comb around to get the right light to see the nits but it is not hard.  This process did not take nearly as long as picking through the hair myself with my nails and was much easier on me and my daughters!!!  Also, I was able to do this on myself which was a big plus because I did not have to have my husband pick through my hair!!!  I then repeated this mouthwash and comb treatment the next day and only found a few nits.  Then repeated a couple of days later and found only a couple.  Then repeated another few days later and found none!  Just did it again and found none again!!!! I will repeat this a couple more times incase we did miss any nits, I do not want any to grow into adults to start the cycle again!  What I love about this treatment is that I can repeat it as often as I want to make sure I get rid of them all.  I do not have to wait 7-10 days to repeat, I can do it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the mouthwash can sting/tingle a little but it all the times I have used it I have never had any problems.  If you look the mouthwash treatment up you will find different variations but what I have described above has worked for us and I will continue just to use the mouthwash and comb the next time lice comes around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!.

            <li> Totally worth it!  This is by far the best nit comb out there.  The rest of the ones that come in the boxes with the shampoo are worthless.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this, you probably know how embarrassing and exhausting head lice can be.  We discovered lice on our daughter 3 days before we were going on vacation.  Since we didn&#x27;t have time to pick through her hair constantly (due to all the laundry and cleaning we had to do because of the lice), we hired a professional lice cleaner.  She charged $100/hr, but I would pay that gladly again because she used this nit comb and it worked so well.  She discovered that our other daughter was starting to get lice, which I missed although I thought I looked carefully.  Anyway, we bought this comb and it has been great at giving us peace of mind that we hadn&#x27;t missed any.  I don&#x27;t need to hire a professional again because of the comb, but I&#x27;m grateful that she taught us how to clean it out ourselves.  The best part is that no pesticides are involved.  We had used that stuff before we called the professional and she still was able to clean out dozens of nits using this comb.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this comb doesnt have more reviews. I am an avid amazon buyer and tend to put quite a bit of weight into the customer review (especially when there are many of them).  If you are the same, put your worries aside and buy this comb. It is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2 year old daughter first got lice 2 months ago and my life turned into complete chaos, I was a held prisoner by nits and buggies! It took me an entire month to get rid of the lice and I tried just about everything a two year old would let me do.  Sadly we started with the pesticides, both rid and nix, and found that neither of them were successful in killing the live bugs.  We bought the \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; comb that they sell at CVS and it was basically useless and i resorted to hours of picking nits with my fingers for hours a day. After 3.5 weeks I thought we were in the clear, i couldn&#x27;t see anything with the naked eye and we had her 2 year check up that where both the nurse and the doctor checked her head and said she looked clean. That afternoon I  bought this comb and the Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel Gel to be prepared for next time, and my life has never been the same. THANK GOD FOR THIS COMB.  When we got home I decided to try running this comb through her hair while she was in the tub on her wet hair, just to see how easily it combed. I was SHOCKED when this comb pulled out not only 4 eggs, but A LIVE BUG.  After that i applied the gel to her hair and combed it every night for a week until i had at least 7 days with nothing coming out during combing.  we were in the clear....until this weekend.  Lice struck again and after my initial dread passed i pulled out my comb and gel and in an hour cleaned her head till nothing was left. This comb just pulls them out, both the eggs (be sure to use the gel!) and the live bugs.  My husband came home to do another round on her a few hours later, and there was nothing.  for the next two days we comb her one in the morning and once a night and NOTHING, this comb is AMAZING.  it has given me back my sanity and makes me feel like i am in control of situation. If you are struggling with lice, get this comb now, DO IT QUICK! pay for the rush shipping, you wont regret it.NG.  it has given me back my sanity and makes me feel like i am in control of situation.

            <li> I would say this is a must and does work better than the other stainless steel combs we tried. Avoid plastic altogether!</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing!!! I went through my daughters hair everyday for the last two weeks and I thought I had all the nits, then my comb came today...well let&#x27;s just say some of these are soooo small that there was no way to see them and this comb pulled them out! What a relief! THANK YOU THANK YOU!! For anyone that has tried everything, honest to goodness you only need conditioner and this comb!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My step daughter had been coming for the last 5 months with lice and always claimed her mother wasn&#x27;t finding anything, then I would look and find several nits and bugs, my 3yr old ended up getting it and WHAT A DISASTER but thank god I found it right away. Anyway the step daughter comes tomorrow and claims mom took her to doct and they didn&#x27;t see anything but I am going to use this comb anyway since some nits are very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on anything else!</li>
            <li> The best ever!!! I have spent $100s of dollars past 8 months if they put this comb In ever lice medicine box LICE WOULDN&#x27;T EXIST thank-you so much my daughter smiles again because of this comb</li>
            <li> My boyfriends kids came home with lice. We treated them with nix, combed out their hair and sent them back to their moms during Christmas break. 11 days later the youngest one is scratching her head again. Off to the store I go for more nix, the next morning I still found 5 live nymphs. Frustrated with going around in circles trying to treat the lice I read up on how to really truly get rid of the lice. 5 days later we get the girls back and I&#x27;m armed with this comb. I got out so much gunk. She said her mom had been combing her hair everyday with a lice comb (probably the comb that came with the medication) however I found 5 nymphs, 2 full grown louse and quite a few nits! The girls are with us the next 5 days and I&#x27;m fully confident that she will be lice free by the time they go back to their moms!  Get this comb don&#x27;t bother with the chemicals that don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> My daughter got lice from school recently and she has really curly hair. We were able to use this comb with no problem. It didn&#x27;t pull her hair out even though it&#x27;s so curly and we were able to get all the nits. I used it twice a day for two weeks and we were not free.</li>
            <li> We have been fighting lice for what seems like FOREVER and when I saw the price of this comb I was skeptical to say the least - but then it arrived and I used it and OMG - it&#x27;s the best nit comb I&#x27;ve come across and we have 4 count &#x27;em 4 children that means if 1 comes home with lice, they all have it in about a day. One of the 1 star reviews said that you can&#x27;t see the nits you comb out because the comb is metal.  I have to politely disagree, but I will tell you how I used this comb on my 8 year old&#x27;s hair.  I washed her hair with Fairy Tales Lice Repel shampoo and conditioner (it&#x27;s the only line of hair care products we use on our children now) and she got out of the bathtub.  I used a regular rat tail comb to comb out the tangles, sectioned her hair off with about 15 clips, set a bowl of vinegar next to us and just combed out each section of her hair.  The first time I combed through her hair the comb was FULL of nits, they were clearly visible (you&#x27;d think she was fully infested but she had not one live bug on her head.  I put the comb into the vinegar and just watched the nits float out of it.  Repeated the process until her whole head had been combed through (I keep a spray bottle of water to keep her hair wet during the process because I can see the nits in her hair better that way) I swear there were more nits in the bowl than there was vinegar by the end.  We then followed standard lice procedures - washed all the bedding, vacuumed all the furniture, tossed all brushes and combs, had the mattresses professionally steam cleaned, etc...and so far so good.  BUT school just started again so y&#x27;all wish us good luck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap... comes early as expected.. does it&#x27;s job well... its tough and durable... in short good purchase... thank you</li>
            <li> My kids got headlice the first week of school.  You can&#x27;t send the kids back to school until they are nit free.  We washed with concentrate dishsoap and left it on for an hour, then washed with a coconut scented shampoo which is said to repel the lice.  (I found all this on the internet while researching for a safe process) Then we used an old plastic blue nit comb I&#x27;d used in the past, many years ago.  We repeated the process the next day and our kids went back to school after only being home one day.  However the school found a few nits and told the kids I needed to pick them again.  I had Amazon Prime and had ordered the Fairy Tales Terminator nit comb the day before and it arrived the next day.  I still didn&#x27;t see any live lice so I just combed with this nit comb and was amazed at how many nits I removed!  I used an old tooth brush to clean the nit comb between each pull.  I dropped them into my light cream sink each time and that is how I could see all the nits.  The school checked them again the next day and were amazed at how clean they were.  We repeated the whole process in 5 days just to be safe since nits hatch about every 7 days.  I found nothing but wasn&#x27;t taking any chances.  Our school has since called to see what we did for other families who were struggling to get rid of the problem.  It was definately the dish soap and the comb!  We had used a plastic nit comb and the chemical lice wash years ago when we had this problem and it took much longer to get rid of the lice.  I recomend this comb to everyone as well as concentrate dish soap on a dry head.</li>
            <li> Hands down the only comb that works on a toddlers fine hair. We tried many other combs that come with the darn shampoo (over the counter) and none could get the \\&quot;nits\\&quot; out. My daughter couldnt go back to school until she was 100% nit free and this was a one time sit for two hours in front of a movie and got all the nits out! highly recomended!!</li>
            <li> Pulls out nits, lice and is easy to use on thick long hair.  Nobody likes dealing with lice but this comb is great.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried the lice kits with the plastic combs and still have lice....click order and get this comb asap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only comb that grabs and pulls those nasty critter eggs off the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;I was picking eggs out of my kids hair with tweezers and cutting hair before I had this.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product for lice removal.  Works!</li>
            <li> Only concern is that I think its starting to rust. Also the other comb we have has a very nice handle, but terrible comb performance. If we could combine the two designs I think we&#x27;d have the ultimate comb that I hope I never have to use again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I had to in this case. The terminator comb is the only one you need. Others have said it but I want to make sure that I add my two cents. Both of my kids, 6 year old boy and 3 year old girl, got lice. Not sure where, but assume the boy brought it home from school. I will never be casual about lice warnings again when the notice comes home! He had been checked very recently (within a week) at school and they found nothing, so they missed it but I also think I caught it early. I actually spotted a live bug on top of my daughters head during bathtime. Her hair is light, it&#x27;s harder to see in dark hair. I called our dr office who suggested the NIX, insisting it works but I knew from coworkers who tried it on their kids that it wouldn&#x27;t. IT DOES NOT WORK! Whether lice have become resistant or whatever I don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s a pesticide and potentially carcinogenic and I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my time and money. Even the CVS metal comb wasn&#x27;t getting all the nits. Finally my husband after much research found this comb, thank goodness for Amazon and their reviews! This comb got what nothing else could. It is a tedious process but it WORKS. It took 3 days of combing religiously 2x a day but we&#x27;re in the clear. I am going to keep combing every day for another week and then every few days after that for another 2 weeks (this is what the Fairy Tales site recommends). I am also ordering the Fairy Tales shampoo and leave in spray--since my son is going right back into the fray at school. It&#x27;s so stressful because kids can&#x27;t go to daycare or school with nits. You really need to be vigilant, and keep combing for days to make sure you are clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got the LiceFreee spray. This is also a miracle, it was the only thing we found that actually did what it said and KILLED the eggs. The eggs we found after that had not advanced or hatched. Before that we&#x27;d see them just as they started to hatch. SO GLAD we found this comb! It&#x27;s something every family should have on hand. If you have an outbreak days count and for some unfathomable reason this is not found in regular drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am calling my dr office and the school to let them know. This is why we can&#x27;t get rid of lice in our schools--we are getting bad advice from our health care professionals!! Also, I think you need the comb to really tell if you have all the nits, along with visual inspection. You can&#x27;t see every nit with the naked eye and some are really buried close to the scalp. I&#x27;ll be using this comb to actually check from now on, once a week till school is out.ery family should have on hand.

            <li> I went into overdrive when I found out our household had lice and ordered almost every product out there, including a few different lice combs. The ones that come in the shampoos are pretty useless, and you really want a high quality lice comb because everything I&#x27;ve read says that good effective combing is the key.  This Terminator comb is probably the best one, the ridged teeth seem to work really well.  The teeth are long, so works well with long hair (although we have medium length hair). It seems very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the one hand, I really like that it is all metal because I can boil it to make myself feel better, and also you can boil between users.  I wouldn&#x27;t feel as good about boiling a plastic handle. However, I worry about it eventually rusting.  I&#x27;ve left it sitting wet a few times on the counter, and have seen a little bit of orange appear. Now I make sure to wrap it in a paper towel when drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish it was easier to clean somehow or there were better directions on how to clean.  The ridges make it harder to see if its completely clean, which is why I tend to boil it.  The non-ridged brands are easier to tell if its clean, but I think the ridges make this one more effective.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than trying to use the combs that come in the over the counter kits.  Went from 7 hours to comb through to about 45 minutes.  And was able to pull out eggs I missed from previous comb outs.  Use regular hair conditioner and dont wash it out.  The Nit Glue Dissolver also helps.</li>
            <li> We have unfortunately and disgustingly been struggling with lice for about 4 months now. My oldest brought it home from school and gave it to her sisters and now they just keep passing it back and forth and we can&#x27;t seem to get rid of it. We tried everything! The smothering methods, the over the counter shampoos, prescription shampoos, everything. Cleaned and washed and vacuumed everything in the house and still couldn&#x27;t get rid of them. No matter what comb or method I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get all the nits out of their hair and I had to hand pick most of them out and always ended up missing some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this comb is so amazing. I can&#x27;t even begin to describe how grateful I am for this comb and whoever created it! It is the first comb I&#x27;ve seen that actually pulls out nits. And it pulls a lot out every time. It&#x27;s easy to clean which is also a plus, because a lot of other combs have stuff get stuck in them that is hard to clean out. And it goes smoothly through the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair. Giant plus for me because my daughters have sensitive heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely worth the money and not a bad price either. I will always recommend this comb. It&#x27;s amazing and wonderful. I&#x27;d give it a thousand stars if I could. If you&#x27;re struggling with a lice problem, get this comb. Don&#x27;t even worry about anything else. This is your solution right here.</li>
            <li> With no clue where we got lice from I found out on a Saturday evening that my 5-year-old was infested and since she had been waking at night and climbing in bed with me... so was I. *facepalm* After 10 hours of shampooing and laundry I went to bed at 4am and was so itchy I couldn&#x27;t sleep so I started shopping Amazon for a better lice comb and found this. I ordered it and paid the extra to have it shipped out as fast as I could. Let me tell you what... it was worth every penny!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending 3 days hand picking as many nits as I could my eyes and fingers were tired and between my daughter and I (both with very long hair) and my teenage son (turns out he had some too) we&#x27;d spent 6 hours every night at it. On day 4 the comb arrived and while there was a minor learning curve to it we reduced our combing time dramatically to about 4 hours. By the 4th night of using the comb we were completely lice free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this going to mean you won&#x27;t get reinfested? Not at all. But I can say that I think it was a miracle. My husband went to the Fairy Tales website and watched the video and we followed the same procedure each night. It made it hurt less and cut down the amount of time he was spending going through my hair and the time I was spending on our kids. If lice are a common occurrence in your schools I recommend purchasing one of these. It&#x27;s really not that expensive for how well it works and how much time and stress it saves. It truly made all the difference for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge thanks to all the other reviewers who shared their experiences with it, you&#x27;re the reason I decided to buy this.</li>
            <li> A product you never want to buy, but when you need it, it was a life saver.. Have purchased 2 more..</li>
            <li> In combination with Licefree liquid this comb worked nicely, much better then those plastic combs that last abut ten minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help get rid of lice when my daughter got them from my niece. It definitely is better than the comb that comes with Licemd. It is better at getting the lice.</li>
            <li> Love to hate this thing-it works great for what it is supposed to do-extract lice, nits &amp; nymphs from your scalp, but it hurts like hell and rips your hair out.  Very useful when you find yourself in a &amp;#34;lousy&amp;#34; situation! Sorry just had to. :)</li>
            <li> The Lice are kind of inmortals. I tryed tons of products over my doter heads. But It wasnt until I get a metal Comb that it really get clean. Amazing with the chemical producs I applied her 3 weeks after the problems returned. With this, 3 days of cleaning (just to be sure there was nothing remaining) and no more problems. And I can keep it just in case.</li>
            <li> Great item! would highly recommend, My 2 year old daughter had an awful case of nits and lice, this comb did the job!</li>
            <li> One swipe through damp hair and this comb was covered with nits. It&#x27;s amazing. Hopefully this is the last of these nasties.</li>
            <li> After newly moving &amp; my children going to a new school system, I was absolutely Mortified one day when my kids were sent home with head lice.  I had never had to deal with them before &amp; bought everything I could to get rid of the suckers.  The combs in all the kids did bupkiss as far as getting out all the lice &amp; nits.  Desperate, I looked on Amazon and found this comb.  IT TOTALLY WORKED and I didn&#x27;t have a single incident after!</li>
            <li> This lice and nit comb is way better than the plastic ones that come with the lice kits at the grocery store.  I have long, thick hair and I battled lice for a month, treating and combing and thinking I had gotten rid of them only to have them come back.  Finally I bought this comb, found several more nits and finally they were gone for good.  This is a great comb!</li>
            <li> My daughter caught lice again this year, and though our hair is fine, this helped us get rid of nits way better than the usual lice combs... We gave one to our neighbor as well, whose daughter has more medium thickness hair, and it was AMAZING for her. Really took the nits out quickly, because her hairs fit between the teeth more tightly. I highly recommend this de-nitting comb!</li>
            <li> Believe the hype.  This is a great tool for the job it&#x27;s designed for.  Let&#x27;s not talk about why I had to buy this but it beat out all the other combs I tried.  Highly recommend this wallet-friendly tool.</li>
            <li> This comb is fabulous. We tried 3 other combs from various locations, but this is far and away better than any other lice comb! The spiral grooves in each tooth of the comb really grab hold of the lice and eggs. I used this on my entire family for weeks. Our family represents every texture, thickness, and length of hair you could imagine, and it was invaluable at treating our family. It&#x27;s held up well to many trips through the dishwasher and in forgotten pots of boiling water. Far superior to other combs, no doubt!!</li>
            <li> My daughter was complaining of mosquito bites on her head.  I took a look and saw lots of what looked like drandruff that was stuck to the hair....I knew it was lice, but I couldn&#x27;t see any live ones.  I took out my Terminator and with one swipe, I got two live bugs.  I took out olive oil and spent 2 hours combing her hair and got out 25 live bugs.  I then did more combing later that day and got one more louse.  She got checked today at school and is completely nit free.  This comb is AMAZING.  It gets all the eggs and lice out.  You have to comb the hair east to west, west to east, north to south and south to north using oil, gel or conditioner.  It gets EVERYTHING out.  I was shocked bc I&#x27;ve had this comb for almost a year and it&#x27;s the first time I actually saw it work.</li>
            <li> better than what comes with a kit</li>
            <li> Wow!!!! This little comb really works!!!! BUY IT!!!!! In fact buy a few!!!!! It removes both stubborn lice and nits!!!</li>
            <li> Without a doubt this is the best lice comb we have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent outbreak of lice out my children&#x27;s school sent us scurrying for lice products.  We ordered this via prime and and in the mean time resorted to a cheap drugstore plastic comb.  We ordered this comb in combo with the rosemary shampoo and conditioner, IMHO a great value and combo.  It arrived promptly (thx Prime) and I set to checking my kids hair at each bath/shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can easily fold back hair along the part to get a good view down to the roots, right where one should be looking.  Then comb through and check for eggs and nits.  Luckily we didn&#x27;t have any although I&#x27;m sure they would have stuck right to this comb for me to easily see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As further endorsement.  One of the mothers in my child&#x27;s class who was unfortunately dealing with their 2nd lice infestation swore by this comb.  She has 2 daughters with long hair that was easily pulled out by those cheap plastic combs.  She also reported this one was easy to run through the child&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it now before the next daycare, school or camp outbreak.</li>
            <li> This comb is a life saver if your child gets lice. It does a really good job pulling out nits unlike the little plastic combs that come with the pesticide products.</li>
            <li> The comb arrived quickly and I was pleased with the quality of the comb. However, the teeth went right through my six year old&#x27;s hair. It missed most of the nits that I found. The few that it did pull out of her hair on its&#x27; own, got stuck in the comb (at the end of the teeth, under the handle). I ended up just using my hands to check her hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think the teeth would pick up more on thicker hair, but I can&#x27;t say for sure without testing it.</li>
            <li> We tried all the other combs that came with the lice kits. This one got everything out. Very sturdy too.</li>
            <li> This comb damaged my hair.  Great idea but not constructed well.  Hair kept getting stuck where the teeth meet the base.</li>
            <li> my daughter got some lice from somewhere, and this thing removed them like a champ. not only that, but also removed the eggs like a boss! with this, and some medical treatment, those hair infesting skull blood suckers were gone!</li>
            <li> Great comb. Really works as said. Pulls out lice and eggs . I tried two others but this was by far the best/ Will use it once a month</li>
            <li> It sucks that I had to buy a lice and nit comb period but that isn&#x27;t going to stop me from reviewing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you have the rinky dink plastic comb that comes in a kit. Those are worthless and just need to be trashed. Plastic combs are a waste of time, money and landfill. Then you have metal combs. Okay, you&#x27;re getting somewhere. Much better than the the already trashed plastic comb that came in the kit you may have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, zoom in on the picture of this comb. See the spiracles around each tooth of the comb? Now we&#x27;re talking! Did ya look at other metal combs? No spiracles. Hmmph. Not so great. Can you see how there&#x27;s no space between the teeth of this comb? Can you see the space between the teeth of other metal combs? Yup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No space between teeth of comb AND spiracles. Look no further. You&#x27;ve found the perfect lice and nit comb. HIGHEST success rate to get almost all lice and nits with this comb. All other combs, including other metal combs, do not compare to this one. I can assure you the money you spend on this comb is money well spent. I&#x27;m so glad I overnighted this comb from the get-go.</li>
            <li> I used this comb in conjuction with the &#x27;Clear Lice&#x27; product line of Shampoos, which they (Clear Lice) guarantee will rid your family of lice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My dog picked up some flying sand lice, that were barely visible yet this comb picked them up. I used the gallon sized clear lice shampoo to make a safe spray-on repellent, laundry soap, and learned to keep my dog away from other infected dogs and places with sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the &#x27;fairy tale&#x27; shampoos and repellent&#x27;s are nearly as effective as the  &amp;#34;Clear Lice&amp;#34; products, but the clear lice products have neem oil which seems to work very well on mites and lice, but of course is not as harmless as the other oils like rosemary, and geranium. Neem seems to treat everything from breast cancer to insects to major bacterial and viral infections. They call it the &#x27;miracle tree in India&#x27; as it such and integral part of their health care and food systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also recommend  &#x27;brewers yeast&#x27; daily supplements as non-toxic anti flea , and anti- tick organic solutions that work well in conjunction with the fairy tales product lines. Amazon sells these products under various brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.clearlice.com/head-lice-products/gallons-sizes</li>
            <li> This nit come works very well. It definitely takes out the eggs and not just the actual lice. My only complaint about the comb (aside from needing the dang thing at all) is that sometimes hair gets caught in the corner edges where the tines meet the handle area. If you are combing sensitive people, this really upsets them. But it is very effective. We used it with Lice MD as a treatment and then later with wet hair to check for nits/lice. Removing the nits themselves helps a lot with nipping the infestation in the bud.</li>
            <li> I have 5 kids and about had a heart attack when 2 of them brought lice home! I hired a professional lice removal person and here is what they did:&lt;br /&gt;1) comb (DRY HAIR) with nit comb[[ASIN:B002STJFP2 Fairy Tales Terminator Lice and Nit Comb, 2 Ounce]] this is key, nits HAVE to be removed!  People who say products kills the eggs are misinformed!&lt;br /&gt;she used Fairytales Terminator comb : available on Amazon or Ulta beauty supply- for long hair, part into 3 sections, start with bottom, clip sides forward, working thru each section&lt;br /&gt;2) After combing is complete, spray/saturate with ACU LIFE LICE CURE (also available on amazon)[[ASIN:B000GCUCPU ACU-LIFE lice cure lice killing solution with maximum strength for hair bond- kit]]leave in AT LEAST 20 minutes or overnight before washing out.&lt;br /&gt;3) Repeat combing after 4 days, no spray unless there are live bugs (re-comb weekly to ensure nits are gone &amp; for prevention(comb only not spray); spray is for killing live bugs)- I treated my whole family with spray  first time even though not all  had lice&lt;br /&gt;4) For Prevention : Fairy Tales Rosemary leave-in conditioning spray [[ASIN:B003E10YDK Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel® Conditioning Spray 8 oz.]]was recommended for daily prevention (spray before school), as well as shampoo Fairy Tales Rosemary repel &amp; conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I had to pay $400 for advice hope it helps you! GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> Freaking awesome!  Totally worth the price! We got rid of our lice problem using tea tree oil and this comb...no chemicals, no reinfestations. Anybody with children should buy this comb just to have it on hand. Seriously.</li>
            <li> Look no further this nit comb is superior to anything out there!!!! If your fighting the lice battle this is going to be your new best friend!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter recently got lice from school. Though I usually try natural products first I thought this time I&#x27;d just get out the &#x27;big guns&#x27; and use Nix and the accompanying comb to go ahead and get rid of it before it spread. We treated her very long, thick hair on Monday night and I continued checking her before and after school and each evening and re-treated her with Nix on Wednesday evening when we found a few live baby lice. She came home Thursday morning when the nurse called and said she found a new baby louse on her head! Ugh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching a few things, I saturated her scalp and hair in TheraNeem Scalp Therape Conditioner (available on Amazon or local health stores), covered her head with a plastic disposable (4 pack from drug store in just a couple bucks) shower cap and left it that way for 5 hours. I rinsed all of that out then used the Fairy Tales Lice Good-Bye foam and this comb. I&#x27;m not certain what did more damage to the lice- the neem oil (look up neem oil and lice) in the TheraNeem conditioner or the Fairy Tales foam but I don&#x27;t really care! Any lice I found after this were babies only and they were actually already dead. I combed through her hair with this comb and it is SO MUCH better than the comb that came with the Nix or even the individually-sold combs in the drug stores. This actually pulls out the nits and exposes the lice much better. The other comb separated the hair enough for me to see the nits but didn&#x27;t actually pull them out- I had to do it with my fingers. We still have to wait and see if they&#x27;re all gone or, even if they are, if she catches them again at school where they&#x27;re having a big outbreak. But either way, I will NEVER use another lice comb than this one- it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Ordered this at the last minute. Soooooo glad we did. The teeth are close together, but it is the swirling cuts on the teeth that get the nits out.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been battling head lice for months.  We spent so much money on useless over the counter treatments, I hand picked nits for hours to no avail, I even called our pediatrician who sadly told me there was nothing he could do or prescribe that wasn&#x27;t already readily available to me.  I was at my wits end and pretty close to a break down when I finally decided to google aggressive lice treatment.  A link took me to this Nit comb on Amazon, and when I read reviews I really though this was too good to be true.  My daughter has long (to her waist), thick, dark black hair. Nits were easily visible, bugs weren&#x27;t.  It was a nightmare and I was desperate.  For the price, I figured I had nothing to lose so I ordered this and had it overnighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We washed and conditioned her hair, and then I took this comb, some spray in conditioner, a pot of hot boiling water (which I poured into a mason jar to dispose of later), a roll of papertowels, and went to work.  I knew it would take time so I plopped an iPad in front of her and went to work while she watched Netflix. I would spray each small section with the leave in conditioner, brush it out with a new brush from the dollar store (which we threw that away after as well), and then ran the Nit Comb through it.  The stuff I pulled out amazed and disgusted me.  I couldn&#x27;t believe what was in my poor daughters hair/head.  With each comb out, I would dip the Nit comb into the hot water and then wipe the comb with a papertowel.  Throw the papertowel away and repeat.  3 hours later the jar was filled with nits and dead bugs.  This comb gets out everything!! We will continue to run the comb through her hair daily and take all other preventative measures, but this was truly a lifesaver!  If you or someone you know is battling this problem, don&#x27;t waste another moment searching for solutions, just get this.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Unlike plastic combs included in store kits, this actually gets everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids might find it a little painful if they have long hair.  Use it on damp hair with a good leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> this is the best nit comb there is.  IT really picks up the nits and does not damage the hair.</li>
            <li> It works well like it said.  it really help to get rid off the flaky stuffs or lice/egg from the hair.</li>
            <li> This is the comb to have if you or your child contracts lice. Don&#x27;t even bother with other combs. I combed my daughter&#x27;s hair with this comb without really knowing how to do it and it pulled so many nits out of her hair.  Then I called a professional service because it was our first time dealing with lice and the professional used the same comb. She only found 4-5 nits because the combing I did the night before did such a great job. The coils around each tine really grabs hold of the nits and lice. Everyone with school age children should own one of these!</li>
            <li> Look no further!! Only thing you need to get rid of lice. My 6 year old daughter has very long hair and got lice from school. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much stuff this comb pulled out after I had been hand picking the eggs out for 3 days!! I also ordered the shampoo/ cond and detangler. Not sure if those help but smells nice! My kids say it smells like a Christmas tree :)</li>
            <li> the best combs ever made</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a precaution due to my daughter possibly being exposed at camps and school.  The other reviews on it were great so I ordered it and have it stashed &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This might work on really thin hair, but the teeth are so close together I can&#x27;t get it to work without getting stuck.</li>
            <li> This comb works wonderfully!! 100% satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> My granddaughters are exposed to lice often and this comb removes even the smallest lice.  We saturate their hair with conditioner and use the comb.  Their hair always looks so pretty after this conditioning treatment and no more lice!</li>
            <li> Years ago there was a lice outbreak in my daughter&#x27;s school.  We weren&#x27;t exempt from getting the nasty critters in our home.  This was an absolute necessity in getting rid of the buggers!  We drenched my daughter&#x27;s hair in canola oil overnight.  The lice can only be suffocated by an oil of this thickness, water doesn&#x27;t work.  The next day I turned on a very long movie for her and pick through ever hair with this comb.  The oil and this comb did the trick!!  The other plastic combs are a joke, but this comb means business!  I still use it everyday on the kids to ensure the disgusting little, children hopping buggers haven&#x27;t hit again!!</li>
            <li> I have three daughters all with long, dark, thick hair. When we were blessed with the little buggers I nearly DIED! But I knew what to do... and we did it. We washed, we combed we picked. We bagged up stuffed animals and sprayed everything that wouldn&#x27;t fit through the hole in the washing machine! For 4 months I waged war with lice and every time I thought I had finally won... a few days later I would find nits again. I honestly tried every lice comb and treatment  I could find. Nothing worked. Finally someone told me to try mouthwash (the brown antiseptic kind) and I found the fairy tales terminator lice comb. One treatment folks, I&#x27;m not kidding! I soaked the girls&#x27; hair in the antiseptic and left it on for about 15 minutes. Wash, rinse and a leave in conditioner and I started combing with the new comb. With one pass through I had more nits and bugs than I had ever found with any other comb.  Don&#x27;t misunderstand, I combed and picked and washed the comb out for hours. But after that, I combed once a day after every shampoo for about a week... We have been lice free ever since. I can&#x27;t say enough about this silly comb. It&#x27;s wonderful. Use it according to instructions and use it thoroughly and your prayers will be answered too.</li>
            <li> I love this comb I recommend this comb to everybody works very good thank so much</li>
            <li> I recommend this comb to anyone that has a child with lice. I had tried everything on my daughter and nothing would get rid of them. Not even those over priced lice shampoos. Once I bought this comb all I had to do was wash my daughter&#x27;s hair as usual, apply conditioner and go to work with the comb. It was amazing to see how much lice and nits I had missed with all of the other products I had wasted time and money on. I STRONGLY recommend you try this! It actually works!</li>
            <li> This is probably my best purchase from when my son got lice from a friend at school.  I found the best way to make use of this is to use a food grade oil on your child&#x27;s head and let it soak in for a good hour or so.  You can use a shower cap or something to cover it so that the oil stays on their head.  Then I used the Terminator comb and I was able to get out the dead lice.  Before I did the oil thing I would find the nits but the louse on his head were escaping me, and my son of course has short hair so I was surprised those little suckers were so fast to hide.  The oil suffocates them and that was when I was finally able to get the adult lice off his head.  His was just beginning so he didn&#x27;t have many.  I did the oil treatment two times about a week apart.</li>
            <li> A must have when you have little kids. Nix and Rid did nothing in our house, it came down to three weeks of combing every few days, this comb worked. Please remember to use a conditioning spray on the hair to help with it sliding through easier. My daughter said that the comb outs felt nice with this comb.</li>
            <li> MUST have product for removing those nits!  The plastic combs are worthless</li>
            <li> This comb works better than any other combs we have used and I have dealt with lice with children and grandchildren. I highly recommend spending the extra money on it and being able to get the job done right the first time and not having to spend more time or money having to retreat.</li>
            <li> Ok,  didn&#x27;t get too much lice..  I ended up picking up the lice by hand..</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!! forget anything else, throw the chemicals away, and those cheesy little plastic combs.  If you are unfortunate to have lice worm its head into your home, spend the money overnight it and end the nightmare in just a few combings.  Wash the bedding and dry thoroughly, then use the comb, repeat process typically just once, then it is done period.</li>
            <li> works well on cart hair</li>
            <li> I bought this to have handy just in case it was needed. It is certainly the best quality most effective comb of its kind.  Although I have not needed to use it for it&#x27;s intended purpose, I have peace of mind knowing I am prepared with the Terminator.</li>
            <li> This comb is tough, rugged and it gets them out!  The teeth don&#x27;t bend like other combs, so it makes it easy to pull lice out without damaging or pulling the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This comb gets out everything! The only bad thing about it is that it rips out a lot of hair where the teeth attach into the handle. I have to be careful not to let the hair get too deep in.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews and I was not disappointed. My kid sister contracted lice from another child and I found them early after she complained that her head itched a lot. Within a week of receiving this comb, by brushing and looking for an hour a day, we got rid of those pests. This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Had a scare, but thankfully we were wrong. Got this JUST IN CASE</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing comb! I used this on my niece and it works beyond great, in my opinion. Compared to the other semi-metal combs I had to use, these metal teeth didn&#x27;t fall out like the others. lol But that&#x27;s not the great part, it combed out all the lice and nits really well. Got the hair really clean the first time. Used this everytime at bath time for awhile just to make sure, and the pesky problem is gone. :)</li>
            <li> So even after all the reviews I was still skeptical but after dealing with this for a month with my daughter I thought what the heck. I got this comb and also ordered the LiceFreee spray as per another reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her head was full of nits that were impossible to remove all from her thick, long hair by hand. So for 2 hours I sectioned her hair, used the spray and this comb. It removed the nits and the teeniest tiniest bugs that were too small to see yet!  I kept a cup of water there with a squirt of dishwashing liquid in it and swished the comb off in it after combing thru a section. After all done you can see what all youve combed out in the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, 24 hours later I checked her hair and maybe 5 nits...out of hundreds that were there before.  Picked those out and will check her daily for awhile and will use the lice shampoo again on her this weekend for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive also bought the Fairy Tale repel shampoo and spray conditioner for daily use. But truthfully this comb is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best one on the market!  So far it seems to be working.  We bought it as a precautionary measure, so we didn&#x27;t actually use it for lice.  We got it just in case!</li>
            <li> It came within the promised time frame and was exactly as described. We bought it because there have been many children with lice at our son&#x27;s school.</li>
            <li> We purchased this comb after reading reviews and have been very pleased with it.  It gets even the smallest nymphs out.  I recommend it all the time to families who are dealing with lice.  Works great in dry hair.</li>
            <li> love it love it love it love it&lt;br /&gt;we highly recomed it over any combes on the market. love it!</li>
            <li> Definitely  works well. It was able to catch the tiny tiny little eggs left behind from those little suckers. Hope to never have to deal with lice again! Used it every day and we we nit free with in a week.</li>
            <li> Nobody wants to have to use this ever, but the truth is, if you have a child in school you will most likely have to at one point or another.  Buy it before you need it is my only suggestion.  Most of the combs you buy at local drug stores are junk.  This comb is very easy to use and excellent quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good nit comb and with any delousing effort you need a good comb.  I tired several brands and this was one of the 2 best that I tried.  The good things are the teeth are set very close and remain that way.  It is a nice size but I would have liked it even better if it had a bit of padding in the grip.  Having deloused 4 girls all with waist length thick curly hair my hand and the comb got a bit of a workout.  I used it every other day for 2 weeks straight and it certainly did a great job pulling out the nits and lice.  But dont forget to do all the other steps to completely eliminate head lice.  As this is only one piece of the solution</li>
            <li> We were skeptical about this product until the first swipe. This is a wonder tool that really gets rid of EVERYTHING! Even lint and dust. Some nits were so tiny you need to hold the comb up to the light to be able to see it. Theres no way a regular lice comb would have gotten that [seriously we have two]. I would most definitely recommend this comb to everyone. It&#x27;s so good you don&#x27;t even need to use a liquid product, it alone will get rid of everything.</li>
            <li> It worked great. My grand-daughter has had other treatments but the comb is the best remover. It is well made and will last a long time</li>
            <li> I had bought the lice md kit from Walgreens and tried a number of home remedies . This product is a life saver and the only thing that works !!!! I was seriously on the verge of shaving my entire head until I came across this . I used it in conjunction with the fairy tales lice goodbye and it worked !</li>
            <li> Bought this because there was a lice outbreak at my sons preschool. I wanted to make sure and check his hair daily to catch the lice if they ever appeared. Thankfully he stayed lice free. Can say this gets through his hair well, although it pulls a little (he has buzzed hair), but its better than getting lice/not finding the lice.</li>
            <li> I have 5 kids, oldest is in high school... We have NEVER had to deal with lice, until now.  My 12 year old decided to have makeovers with her friends.. UGH.  THis has been a nightmare for over two months now.  Initial finding was her sister noticed something moving in her hair it was midnight the day before Presidents day.. We went immediately to Walmart, bought the lice treatments, came home stripped beds treated both girls 10 and 12... Got in bed at 2am.. FREAKING out.  THen all the next day all I did was wash everthing in the the house.  So, I then waited a week and treated them again.  Also checked both of my boys and didnt see anything.  About a couple weeks later notice ONE bug on my 4 year old daughter, removed it and thought she was good, (didnt see any eggs),  Again noticed one bug on the 10 year old, and didnt see anything else.....  So last week my 8 year old son, sits on the sofa with me its midnight and he&#x27;s scratching his head,.. I say whats wrong are you itchy,  he says a little so I tell him to go to bed and check him in the morning.... HE IS INFESTED AHHHHHHHHHHHHH... I immediately shave him bald.  WISH I could do that with the girls.  GOT him clean and ordered this comb right away along with the leave in spray from Fairy tales and the shampoo.,..  After the comb came, MOnday , I combed my 4 year olds hair and found about 20 itty bitty bugs the size of a pinhead.  Could NOT see them with just looking ...  I have only noticed a couple of  eggs though so I dont know what is going on!!! ANYWAY also combed my two other girls out and found just nits, maybe one bug on one of them... So I combed the 4 year old yesterday and only found one bug... I THINK THIS IS THE ANSWER.  I wish I had gotten it at the beginning, the RID treatment doesnt work very well, lice were still alive after being treated...  I will continue to use this comb on all of us for a while just to be safe.  I have thrown the other 4 combs, the ones that come with the kits from the stores away they all SUCK...  Ok this has been horrible and I hope to never ever go through it again... GOOD LUCK TO OTHERS...way they all SUCK...  Ok this has been horrible and I hope to never ever go through it again... GOOD LUCK TO OTHERS...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only lice comb you&#x27;ll ever need. Forget those plastic pieces of junk. Spend the money, get this comb and piece  of mind.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be so excited about a lice-related product, but this comb is making a HUGE difference in my daughter&#x27;s recovery.  We had to use a prescription to kill the lice--one treatment, that was easy.  But the nits stayed stuck in her hair.  She has an incredible volume of hair down to her shoulders--dirty blonde--so the nits were never easy to spot.  I had been using the comb contained in an OTC box of Rid and thought we were making progress....until this comb arrived and the first swipe through resulted in many, many, many more dead nits.  I am now hopeful that we are on the road to recovery.</li>
            <li> I received this today and promptly tested it on my 7-year old daughter who has been having these lice and nits on and off for quite some time now.  Voila! It is true! This comb can get those pesky parasites out in a sweep! And it looks durable, too, like it can outlast any of these creeping vampires. What&#x27;s more, my daughter does not complaint of aches when I run the comb through on her scalp and hair.  It is definitely worth the money. I am impressed with this Terminator, and that&#x27;s fact not fiction :)</li>
            <li> teeth are spaced tight and this is great when investigating for the possibility of lice.</li>
            <li> This comb beat out all of the other combs that came in the boxes.  A must-have to winning the war!</li>
            <li> Why this product isn&#x27;t sold in drug stores (next to mostly useless lice removal products) is beyond me.  I bought this product from the professional lice removers (yes, these companies exist and I highly recommend them, too.  They will come to your house and HELP YOU and get you on a program to remove lice).  I paid more than twice what is listed here but I don&#x27;t care; most parents will agree with me that when there is lice in the family you&#x27;re ready to go all out and do whatever it takes to get rid of them.  This comb catches very, very small lice and their eggs.  The drug store combs - - the plastic ones from the pesticide products and the metal comb purchased at the drug store - do not.  I agree with another poster - order this next day shipping, it is worth it.  And comb, comb comb those buggers out.  I have used on my son, short hair, myself (yes mom, you might have it too.  The pros found baby lice on me using this comb) I have medium length hair, and my daughter, who has hair over two feet long.</li>
            <li> I chose 5 because its the best comb out there right now.&lt;br /&gt;After trying other products i realize that this was what I need it for results</li>
            <li> This comb works so well! It pulls out the baby lice as well as the eggs and adults.  We quit chemical treatments because the lice were resistant.  We are at our wits end when I came across this comb on Amazon.  As soon as we received it, we ran it through my childrens&#x27; hair and removed quite a few lice. Reused every few days to catch missed eggs that may have hatched.  No more lice!</li>
            <li> Does as it is designed, but it needs to be used in hair coated with conditioner or an oil based product to prevent pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> Bought several over the counter items trying to rid two kids in the family of their head lice. I finally came upon this really neat comb and ordered it immediately. I was not disappointed with the item and received it in good time. It was well worth the money as it was a big help in combination with treatment to finally be rid of all the lice. Thank you, Thank you for this wonderful little comb. It was a very big part in being rid of those pesky little lice at long last. I would buy from this seller again for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;D Cannady</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  Perfect for all hair types.  One daughter has very curly blond hair, the other straight dark hair - I could use it on both and it did the job wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Great comb!  Don&#x27;t waste your time with all the others, especially the ones that come with the lice kits. This comb will save you time and money! Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I loved it  I got all the lice out of my daughters hair and would recommend this product to many people thank you</li>
            <li> The grooves in the comb catch the nits and bugs. A must have if you have an issue with lice. It was our lifesaver after 3 boughts with lice.</li>
            <li> There are many treatments to choose from for getting rid of lice, but the key is removing everything from the hair. This comb did that, removing lice and nits from short and long hair. We used one treatment, and removed most of the lice/nits from the first comb-through. We combed again the second day only finding a couple of nits. We continued the comb-throughs for a couple more days but never found anymore evidence of lice, and they did not return. Fast shipping, perfect buying experience!</li>
            <li> This comb really is a lice and nit terminator!  Strips hair clean. It says that you can use it on dry hair, but damp hair is really the best way to use this comb.</li>
            <li> This comb is the best one on the market. I have tried a few. The teeth have ridges so it catches the eggs so much better.</li>
            <li> We tried a few different brands of combs and this was the best at removing lice from my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing- best lice comb there is!</li>
            <li> Gets out the lice but you really have to work on the nits. I still have to pull the nits off of hair follicle with my hand, As soon as we fell and itch on the scalp we go after it with this comb. No louse is safe.</li>
            <li> Best purchase ever for such a terrible problem! Highly recommend and definitely did the job!!!</li>
            <li> Hate having to deal with lice that seem to come home around the fall from school.  This comb always gets rid of the lice/nits.  Wonderful tool.  I recommend using it with the Fairy Tails line of products... especially the conditioning spray as it helps you comb through hair with this nit comb.</li>
            <li> Must use with conditioner, per instructions. Made to last, very tight tolerances on the spacing between teeth, which is good.</li>
            <li> This thing is absolutely great !</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm, removed all nits from my daughters hair that the other plastic combs left behind!</li>
            <li> We had the unfortunate experience of repeated, horrible, terrible, no good, very bad lice in our home from a child who we watched regularly.  It was awful.  I cried.  A lot.  The other family was not managing the problem, so we took it into our own hands.  We kept her with us and treated her ourselves.  We went through every kind of comb, even those skinny metal ones with the plastic handle.  Nope.  None of them were as effective.  None of them kept the screaming and discomfort down to a minimum.  Along came &amp;#34;Fairy Tales Terminator&amp;#34; comb.  It is unbelievably more comfortable for the licee.  It is easier to pull through the air.  It is easier to clean and disinfect afterward.  It is easier to use, period.  If you are dealing with this spawn of Satan, do not waste your time or money.  BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> it was unfortunate i had to research these products in the first place, but my three year old came home scratching one day and lo and behold... EW!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days of using the crappy, painful plastic combs that come with lice removal kits, I was sent this way by a forum thread of moms who&#x27;d dealt with this before. My eyes were kind of swimming, actually, as there are a million and one different brands of these combs, all of which look pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, since we could only douse our heads in chemicals once every seven days, i went to war with a lot of natural solutions - and one of them included similar ingredients to Fairy Tales spray, and I think that&#x27;s why I went ahead and chose this comb (that and, well, the name... the name...) It&#x27;s also why I only gave it 4 out of five stars - because I really just can&#x27;t see the difference between this and other combs that look just like it, other than the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out, covering our heads in coconut oil and a variety of essential oils worked better than the nastiest chemicals you could buy at the drug store, and made me feel a lot safer about having to treat my three year old for this issue. She looked ridiculously cute in a shower cap, too. And when the comb arrived, I was happy at the ease with which it slipped through my daughter&#x27;s poor, abused hair in a way that awful, stupid plastic comb never could, and how much gunk it picked up out of there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I took it to MY hair. Friends, I have hair to the middle of my back. It is thick with large corkscrew curls. Suffice it to say, combing it for nits with that little plastic comb from the kit was about as possible as getting an elephant to sit in a church pew. This comb was FAR, FAR easier to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed something else - I had a bit of dandruff after the lice chemical treatment. My scalp reacted terribly to the stuff and flaked quite a bit in my obsessive treatment process (first chemicals, then a natural treatment on both of us EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR A WEEK, because this is the first time in 40 years I have ever encountered lice) - so, I actually used this comb to do a quick dandruff removal fix on my way out the door and it worked wonderfully for that, too.

            <li> I don&#x27;t ever review anything but I had to put one for this comb!  My kids came down with lice last week.  I went into overdrive and did coconut oil, then Nix and I checked twice a day plus combing once a day.  After the Nix I hadn&#x27;t found anything for a few days.  I decided to go buy this comb just to be safe and low in behold, there came all the nits out of my daughters long, long hair.  I think they were deads ones that had been pulled furthur down on her hair, but it just proves the combs with the kids are crap.  I am so glad I bought this!  Also bought the Repel Leave in Conditioner and spray that in her hair before I comb (still once a day)  Then I put regular conditioner in and it glides right through her hair and mine.  Mine is really thick so it&#x27;s great!  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This comb is the only thing that has gotten rid of our lice problem. It is so much better than the cheap plastic combs that come with the lice shampoos. When I combed my eight year olds hair with this metal comb, I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of bugs and eggs it removed. The next night I combed again, and the amount was almost nothing, the first combing had almost completely removed everything. We are still combing every night to be sure we didn&#x27;t miss anything. After struggling with lice for almost six weeks, this comb cured our problem almost overnight. Do yourself a favor and get this comb!</li>
            <li> We used this in combinations with Cetephyl face soap and were successful!  It works really well for getting all the little nits you can&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> Found this product on an exhaustive internet search after finding lice on my children AND me!! After a freakout session that lasted longer than I&#x27;d care to admit, I began trying to figure out the best method of eradicating these little disgusting buggies. I probably spent over a $100 before I found this comb a week into my ordeal and it has changed my entire view of these little nuisances!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calm down, it&#x27;s going to be all right. This is the ONLY product you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb is made out of stainless steel with long, thin, spiral etched tines. The tines are super tightly spaced and they can find these little bugs along with their eggs incredibly well. The only discomfort is that you must rake each hair section from the base of the hair, along the scalp and this can be uncomfortable for children. For adults it may strip your hair shafts a little and cause some frizz, but my view is hair can always be cut and grown back -- just get a trim once you&#x27;re clean and bug free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy herbal creams and shampoos if you&#x27;d like, but it is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE ON CAUTION: The over-the-counter chemicals should be left untouched! In my desperation to rid myself of these disgusting creatures, I decided I would use the chemicals on me, but not the children. Being incredibly fastidious by nature, I followed the instructions exactly. The result was that it did not kill the lice but it did leave me with a horrific chemical burn! And this was only after one application! It made my scalp red, dry, hot and very sensitive to the subsequent scraping with the lice &amp; nit comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen, these little buggies have been around as long as humans, and enough time to have built up immunities to these dangerous &amp; harmful chemical treatments. The FDA approves them based on the inventing company&#x27;s own scientific findings -- they are not tested by impartial parties as part of an FDA approval!! Meanwhile, these chemical companies keep boosting the toxicity in order to combat the stubborn lice more effectively, but it still doesn&#x27;t work. Now they even recommend re-treatment after so many days. If you have box of these, DO NOT even open it up, return it to the store and get your money back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the reality is that these little creatures, while quite adept at finding hosts, are delicate little creatures. They must live next to the scalp as they live on blood. They can be killed by squishing, hot water (over 140°F), freezing (8-112 hours in the freezer is sufficient. Wool items, hairbrushes, etc. can be bagged in zip-lock bags and tossed into the freezer. Isopropyl alcohol also kills these guys quite nicely. An alcohol soaked paper towel is great place to deposit them or you can simply rinse them down the drain. Lice ONLY like the head -- no other part of the body. They may get caught in clothes, hats, bedding, blankets, carpeting, fabric furniture, etc. so these items should be washed or vacuumed. Items that cannot be washed in hot water and stuck in the dryer (like wool hats), can be put in the freezer overnight. Infected items that are bagged and removed and out of human contact for 30 days will starve them and will then be safe. Do this cleaning calmly AFTER removing them from the infected people. A good vigorous workout always helps to clear the mind and calm the body...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lice eggs take 6-7 days to hatch. They live for 32-35 days. In this lifecycle, they go through three molts lasting a total of 10 days before they are able to reproduce. One to two days after that they begin laying eggs. They lay 3-9 eggs per day for the next 16 days until they die. If you find more than ten adult lice, chances are that you&#x27;ve been infected for at least three to four weeks minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t freak out your gonna get rid of them now. For boys, we simply buzz cut their hair pretty short, wet down the hair and apply oil to the scalp (use food grade olive oil -- which is beneficial to your hair and scalpanyway). The oil will simply allow the hair to remain slippery wet for a longer time for you to comb. Also, lice prefer clean people who wash their hair frequently as this dries out the base of the hair shaft making it easier for them to affix their eggs. When you have oily hair, it is much more difficult for the eggs to stick. For girls, especially those with long hair, you&#x27;re going to have to section off the hair in small chunks and scrape the scalp, combing the hair all the way to the ends. Do this from 3-4 directions (down, sideways from both sides and even combing up from the bottom).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need to repeat this treatment twice a day (morning and night), for about 2-3 weeks, depending on your level of OCD. You will find the bulk of lice in the first combing session -- once I found over 150 in a child!! Then it will taper off dramatically. The nits are much smaller than the lice so this will become your second target. Since it takes 6-7 days for the eggs to hatch you are combing for the first week to find any new hatchlings. If one is left and it&#x27;s an adult female, you have the potential of her laying more eggs, so keep on combing. Most likely you will find little to nothing 3-6 days after the first combing session. Then you might find a few more after that, keep combing and you&#x27;ll keep getting all of the new hatchlings as they become larger. When you reach a point that you haven&#x27;t found ANY bugs or nits for 10 full days, then you can be confident that you&#x27;ve won the battle. Now think about how confident you will feel knowing that you have the power to control these bugs without dousing your children in harmful chemicals -- whose side effects may take years or decades to fully surface...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the awesome thing about this comb is that you actually can get all the lice and nits in the first one or two treatments, if you are very diligent and working in a brightly lit area with a loop (magnifying glass). Did I mention how AWESOME this comb is?!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are just too unnerved and cannot deal with it then there are nit picking services which are typically very competent and they will do it for you. After all, nit picking has been the longest lived procedure that is most effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have confidence you will succeed. Good luck!nyway).

            <li> I have much more experience with lice than I ever wanted - this comb is my favorite and helps keep me sane when the kids&#x27; heads start itching and/or the notes come home from school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb gets out lice and eggs, and the rounded tips means it&#x27;s much softer on the head than other combs.  This comb can make doing a thorough combing actually possible and greatly speeds the process.  You still need to work section-by-section, but this comb will help you move through the head more quickly and with much more assurance that you&#x27;re doing a thorough job.  The rounded tips help you comb thoroughly close to the scalp, and help keep the &#x27;patient&#x27; comfortable to reduce squirming.</li>
            <li> Ok, Ive read many an followed many reviews on all types of products for years left by other consumers, and this comb is so amazing, i only wished Id came across it much much MUCH sooner.. and with that being said, i have also nvr left a review on any product before as well,  all until NOW.. I shall explain.. Im a mom of 2 girls, one has baby fine thinner dark hair, but the other one, baby fine super long almost to her waist super thick hair strawberry blonde, with reading that much can u only imagine my nightmare.. Ive been battling lice for , unfortunately YEARS and spending more money on products, home remedies, lice combs, flea combs, shampoos, mayonnaise, olive oils.. my daughters hair was so thick i always had to buy double the shampoo treatments just to almost cover her hair, an i refused to cut it. I literally felt i was never going to be able to permanently get them out of her hair. So one night i happened to once again be searching thru forums, more home remedies, etc and i decided to try to do Nix professional grade treatment since it claims to kill eggs, only i knew it would be costly to have enough for her hair, so I decided to search amazon, eBay, other online sites for any sorta price breaks on this, when to my discovery i happened upon this comb on eBay, it was actually an auction for 3 brand new ones , no one hardly had bid on them, so i thru my bid out there for about $6/7 i ended up winning these 3 combs for shipping and all around $10., i was sold INSTANTLY on them, soon as they arrived, i got my daughters hair prepped by brushing out all the tangles, sectioned off a portion an began, this was the most AMAZING comb  EVER!!!  I can not tell you enough how it got everything, every egg, nit, live lice. I too used a white paper towels, to wipe them from the comb every time we pulled it thru her long thick hair. We had eggs, nits, lice of all stages, combing right out of her hair, I know this sounds silly but i literally wanted to cry for joy, Ive spent so so much time an money, an my poor daughter sat thru mayonnaise wraps, olive oil, Listerine, concoctions from online home remedies, countless lice shampooing, coconut oil treatments, i bought coconut shampoos an added tea tree oils.. but all i needed was ... THIS COMB.. TIME... and NO Chemicals, Now we use this comb just as maintenance purposes, because Ive believed that she must have friends or kids at school that pass these around , I&#x27;m very leery every time i see anyone scratch their heads even! In conclusion... BUY IT! Look NO Further .. take it from a mom that&#x27;s spent countless hours and literally well over $100 + in products, with the cheap plastic combs, expensive metal flea combs, even the \\&quot;electric lice combs\\&quot; rid combs, u name it, THIS IS the ONLY one that works perfectly.. I hope this review helps at least one desperate parent out there!! and Good luck! :)&lt;br /&gt; few quick suggestions&lt;br /&gt;#1. I used a very small bristled brush like used to clean-out the blades of a wahl electric razor, to help clean out between the teeth of this comb,&lt;br /&gt;#2. the very top edge needs a little more attention for nits an lice can get a bit trapped in the top part of the comb&lt;br /&gt;those things are minor compared to the payoff, plus for anyone with thick hair the length of the comb teeth is true blessing as well.. :)t so so much time an money, an my poor daughter sat thru mayonnaise wraps, olive oil, Listerine, concoctions from online home remedies, countless lice shampooing, coconut oil treatments, i bought coconut shampoos an added tea tree oils.. but all i needed was ...

            <li> My teen son had lice a little over a week ago. It was the first time in my life that I&#x27;ve had to deal with this. I did like most parents and got a Rid kit. It came with shampoo and a double sided comb. My friend told me I&#x27;d need a better comb and the internet seemed to agree. But before ordering this I used the one that comes with the Rid shampoo. I used that comb along with conditioner, a bottle of Licefreee, and Listerine to obliterate the lice. The shampoo didn&#x27;t work but the comb was adequate. The real winner was Licefree and Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time I ordered this comb his lice was already gone because everything I mentioned above did such a thorough job. So I can&#x27;t say how well this comb would work to get out bugs and eggs. I&#x27;m assuming it would do a superior job to other metal combs because the teeth are spaced tightly together. I ordered this to check his head to be absolutely sure the lice were gone and for future periodic checks. When I used it, the comb didn&#x27;t grab a single thing off his head. It would have if anything was lurking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His hair is thick, dense, and curly. He&#x27;s growing it out and it&#x27;s just barely long enough to pull back and put in a ponytail. I used this on his dry hair that he conditioner washes (no shampoo). It glided through his hair with ease. It did pull out a few stands but that is to be expected with a metal comb that has such tightly spaced teeth. It&#x27;s important to use a lot of conditioner with this comb. I tried it on my damp unconditioned hair and it definitely pulled it more than it did his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to get this comb for lice treatment. I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s necessary to pick nits like a lot of parents do but this will definitely help with that more than the other combs will (by this I mean I think it&#x27;s unnecessary to pick eggs off every stand - just comb a couple times a day for a few days after the initial comb to get all the nasties out, and use whatever seconday method works to kill any hatchlings before they can develop to egg laying stage - the comb will remove them all during the continued frequent combings that should be done for a couple weeks). A good comb is the most important thing needed to eradicate lice. The various methods of killing them are secondary.op to egg laying stage - the comb will remove them all during the continued frequent combings that should be done for a couple weeks).

            <li> More substantial than the pharmacy brand and easy to use. Thankfully, didn&#x27;t need to use it more than one day by the time it arrived.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I could have eliminated all the lice without this comb! It was a life saver! I was horrified to learn my 2 kids had gotten head lice and immediately started researching non-toxic procedures for removing it. This comb got great reviews and I can see why. It didn&#x27;t seem to bother my kids while I used it to rake out bugs from their hair and it even worked great on my son who basically had a buzz cut. I now have a lice kit on hand if it ever occurs again and this comb is in it! I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> There is no way we would have gotten rid of our child&#x27;s lice without this comb. This was our first and hopefully last experience with these nasty little bugs. The plastic combs that come with the treatments are a joke and do not comb out all the nits. After trying for 3 straight days separating hair, combing and cutting nits out twice a day there were still nits being found after i thought we had them all. So I ordered this as a precaution and had next day delivery. Thank goodness I did. When we used this comb there were over 30 more nits combed out that I could not see and would have hatched starting this nightmare all over again. I used this comb daily until we made it to 14 days after the 1st lice treatment and never found anymore lice or nits since using this comb. Just make sure to use a good detangler or olive oil which really worked well to loosen the nits too (shampoo with dawn dish detergent to remove) and comb tangles out before using this comb because the teeth are very close together and will pull hair out if not. We have been lice free for 3 months now. What worked for us to prevent reinfestation was the initial treatment, this comb everyday for 1st 14 days, cleaned and washed everything, vacuumed floors and furniture daily,  washed bedding everyday for 2 weeks, bagged all toys that couldn&#x27;t be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer for 4 weeks, and a designated seat for use only for our child with lice in the living room with a sheet put down and washed daily, all combs thrown away and purchased replacements. We also put our childs clothes and coat straight in the washer from school knowing there was a chance of this coming home again.  We were taking no chances on having to go through this again and it worked. Good luck to all that has to go through this nightmare.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute lifesaver!!  Don&#x27;t even bother with the combs that come with the shampoo kits, they are worthless. Used correctly, this comb ended our nightmare. Once I learned it is all about proper and thorough nit removal, lice was GONE in two days. Now I just use it to check my kids hair once a month. Would  definitely recommend!  Easily the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> great product. This comb works just as described. Saved lots of time and money. I will use this again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Urban teacher &#x3D; occupational hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This recent outbreak had my family in the weeds with little critters...ick.  They seem resistent to traditional treatments and the danged nits and eggs are so tiny they defy picking out, so we bought this and found them.  The swirled teeth are close together and effective, getting stuff other combs miss.  Do be careful to be gentle or it WILL take your hair with it; we use it with conditioner and hopefully won;t have need of it again, or at least for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My daughter got lice two years ago and I could have just cried.  She has very, very thick, curly hair and difficult to comb so I did go to our local drug store to buy a decent nit comb which it was until I put it in hot water to clean.  The metal teeth came loose because they were attached to a plaster frame.  I thought Fairy Tales Nit Comb would solve the problem since it is all metal.  The teeth are very close together and getting it through my daughter&#x27;s hair is practically impossible.  It is more trouble than it is worth.  If you have very fine hair than maybe this is your solution.  If hair is very thick and curly I would not recommend this product.  You will be frustrated.</li>
            <li> Nice but only bought to comb my cat. still worked but needed a FINE TOOTH COMB WHICH I COULDN&#x27;T FIND ANYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where all of the glowing reviews are coming from, because this is not a good product. Perhaps if you have thick, strong hair this could work, but on fine hair it does nothing, and you can (literally) feel and hear it shredding the hair. Very badly designed product.</li>
            <li> This is a very good nit comb! It works really good to take out the lice.</li>
            <li> Works great, but my daughter does not like it!  She does not like it because if we are using it, it means she has visitors in her scalp.  Works like a charm though.</li>
            <li> This comb works very well if you use it as directed.</li>
            <li> very nice .. it is what we need to do</li>
            <li> I guess it does what it says. My daughter was full full of head lice eggs, and after using this comb most of it dissapeared</li>
            <li> If you have lice in your house, get this comb!!!!!! It will save you many hours of nitpicking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical about this comb&#x27;s nit removal powers until the first time I ran it through my daughter&#x27;s hair and removed about ten nits in one fell swoop!</li>
            <li> I NEVER write reviews but I have been dealing with lice in my house for 3 months now and personally would have paid $1000 to find this product to get rid of them sooner. I have spent well over $250 in prescription co pays to treat daughter then myself and son multiple times. This comb only pulls out hair that has stubborn louse attached to it. Maybe if people brushed their hair first then it wouldnt tangle. The design would not look like it would grab the bugs and eggs but it does. Save time, money, energy and stress and buy this comb!</li>
            <li> This comb is of very good quality as compared to all the other flimsy plastic combs.  I like it because the tines are welded to the handle and so when you boil comb the tines hold strong.</li>
            <li> i was charged for 3 of these when i only bought one, so i am angry. the comb sucks. it missed lots of nits, even though i kpt combing the same spot from different angles</li>
            <li> Works better than any other comb.  Over the years with kids and now grandkids and useless combs, this comb does the trick.</li>
            <li> Love this comb!  I couldn&#x27;t believe the nits it got out of my daughter&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> My son has psoriasis on his scalp and this comb is great for getting the little flakes of dry skin out of his hair.</li>
            <li> I was so upset when my daughter came home from school with lice this year. We did everything right the first time. Treated her head with lice treatment and the bought this comb. It is amazing compared to what you can buy in the store. Took nits out with ease. I washed her bedding every day for two weeks, and bagged what I couldn&#x27;t wash for a month. I wasn&#x27;t taking any chances that the lice would come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one else got them, and she was never reinfected. I am conviced that twice daily combing of her head with this comb is what did it!</li>
            <li> bought it as precaution since we started getting lice notes from my daughters school stating that there was lice going around. I use it on her every Sunday and if she has any sort of lint and even dandruff it comes off so I&#x27;m sure it will work if (knock on wood) she were to get lice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this extremely difficult to draw through my daughters hair without hurting her, even with lubrication and a lot of patience. That may be very good for getting out nits, but it makes it a rather torturous process to use regularly for prevention, which is what I was hoping for by purchasing such a sturdy brush.</li>
            <li> My 3.5-year old was sent home yesterday from preschool with lice. Her and her best buddy both got it. I&#x27;m normally diligent about tying her hair up, back, and away from her face when she&#x27;s outdoors (i.e. preschool, YMCA childcare, playground, etc.), but contagions are contagions. You can control only so much of your environment, and the rest is left in the trust (yeah right!) hands of society&#x27;s children and their ever so responsible parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After being in the bathtub for an hour with nit cream in my toddler&#x27;s hair, I was growing easily frustrated with what exactly I was looking for- I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between nit (lice eggs), dandruff (she has itchy eczema), and plain old dirt/sand. After a desperate call to the lice care removal service, they literally used this exact same comb, along with a spray bottle with water &amp; conditioner to help detangle hair first..and that&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s all she used. This Terminator comb was all she needed. For me, it was money excellently spent ($95 worth), because first and most important, she gave me peace of mind. I knew precisely how to de-nit her hair, step-by-step, and what to look for. The lice care professional also brought real samples of lice (from nit to louse stages), all dead and laminated, of course! She reminded me to always check for nits in bright light, sunlight is best, because nits reflect &amp; shine in the light. She only found 2 nits in my daughter&#x27;s entire scalp *THANK GOD*, and after examining my own scalp she found nothing. Luckily, my 1.5-year old daughter came out clean, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning/packing/vacuuming up the house is another entire headache but it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due diligence is key. Make nit check-ups a regular part of your routine. My daughter actually likes the tough comb because it helps ease the itchy scalp from her eczema. Yeah, she reminds me of a dog getting groomed, but it serves it&#x27;s purpose well, Beyond that, in fact.</li>
            <li> After trying a few of the shampoos and lotion/conditioner kits, I found that my little one still would have a number of nits, and even a few bugs.  This comb does a fantastic job of getting every last trace out.  Mind you, you have to actually take the time to go through every section of their hair, but it does a much better job of removing nits than any of the combs that come with the kits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint with this product is that the tines are so shiny, it&#x27;s difficult to see if anything came out.  I found that if you look *toward* the points of the tines at an angle, instead of looking at them from the side, horizontally, you&#x27;re able to see if there&#x27;s anything on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, though, I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d treated with the products available locally - both the shampoo and the ridiculous little plastic combs - but went ahead and ordered this after researching.  I *thought* I had done a decent job of picking through my daughter&#x27;s hair, but after two passes with this gadget we&#x27;d already found 3 new nymphs.  This saved us so much time and frustration as we were able to truly get everything out this time around.  Added bonus: it&#x27;s actually more comfortable for the head, too - my daughter complained about the sharp teeth on the plastic combs, but the rounded tips on these teeth didn&#x27;t hurt her scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now recommending this product to everyone with kids in school or daycare.  Get it before you need it!!</li>
            <li> FAIRY TALES COMB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AND TRY ON ALREADY AND I &#x27;M AMAZING, IT WORKS, I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF NITS.</li>
            <li> MANUAL removal is THE only way to guarantee complete removal of lice and their eggs (nits).  There is NO treatment product on the market, chemical or otherwise, that can guarantee you that you will be free of this nasty affliction.  Not mayonnaise, olive oil, listerine, heat treatments, none of it. You MUST manually remove all bugs and nits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combs that come with the treatment products you buy, like Rid or Nix, and yes, even the Fairy Tales product (come on Fairy Tales, I like your products but the plastic comb that comes with your lice killing foam sucks and you know it) do NOT WORK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This terminator comb, (which by the way is not a \\&quot;fairy tales\\&quot; product...they have just put their name on it...I bought it locally) Is FANTASTIC.  If you really want to know for SURE if your child has lice, or even more importantly, NO LONGER HAS LICE, you need this comb. The teeth of the comb are close enough together and have teeny tiny ridges that pull out nits.  Have you spent HOURS upon HOURS picking nits, cutting nits out or trying desperately to comb out nits from your child&#x27;s hair?  This comb will actually get them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has VERY thick and wavy hair.  The KEY is you must wet the hair down and use a good de-tangler.  This will help you to glide the comb through the hair.  You have to do small sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a lice removal service salon here in our area and that is where I learned about this comb.  They use it and sell it in their business.  If you have been struggling with lice and they \\&quot;keep coming back\\&quot;  every few weeks or months...You aren&#x27;t getting re-infested....the problem is you are not getting it all out in the first place, and eggs are hatching again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lice are tough to get rid of and I also bought all the treatment products, chemicals, etc until I learned the truth.  The permethrin treatment I used said right on the box \\&quot;Kills lice AND their eggs in one treatment\\&quot;  WHAT A LIE!!!!  I found LIVE bugs on my child 2 hours later and NOTHING on the market kills the eggs.  Do yourself a favor and get this comb.on my child 2 hours later and NOTHING on the market kills the eggs.  Do yourself a favor and get this comb.</li>
