            <li> One of the BEST products I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick cream.  I used to use Eucerin day cream but it was too watery for my taste, switched to this and live happily ever after.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, and package is the same as the product I have been using. (I haven&#x27;t opened the ones I ordered, but the product that I&#x27;m using is the same.) The cream has a nice texture, and a small amount goes a long way. I use it under my make-up in the morning, with positive results. Makes the skin look more youthful, but one warning-- it burns and causes discomfort if you get it in your eyes, so avoid the sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> I do not go out without it , it smooths out your lines in your face,and you can wear under makeup, or without makeup.. Also the cost here is so reasonable, try it , a great product...</li>

            <li> Item as advertised, received promptly.</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth as silk, applies evenly, and melts into your skin. It has a wonderful brightening effect. Nice smell. Lovely moisturizing and it has SPF also! Great product for the price. I use this as my daily moisturizer and sunscreen for the face, neck, and décolleté.</li>
            <li> Super product.  I love the way it goes on and feels.  It really makes my face and neck look better.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years now and I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I put this on and let it soak in for a few minutes before apply make up.</li>
