            <li>For the price, the  minor irritations are worth it, overall a decent lash.</li>
            <li>The only problem i had was the price was a bit high for me.</li>
            <li>These are the same lashes that my professional person uses!</li>
            <li>and it said should arrive early to mid December</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product due to the fact that they are so cheap but they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>they are very light on her eyes but still give her a bit of a dramatic look</li>

            <li> Took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> They took a very long time to get as well</li>
            <li> They are so thin they are not even worth the trouble!</li>
            <li> They took a little long to get to me</li>
            <li> The glue was all over the lashes, nit sure if ill be able to even use them after all ... very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Thin and very natural.</li>
            <li> And now I see that $2-300 is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Technically they will work as single false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because one of the box came broken</li>
            <li> The entire lash was taped to the tray, 3 of the 4 trays were broken, one didn&#x27;t even have a case cover, the lashes were trashed..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> Less then two weeks !</li>
            <li> but I could&#x27;ve looked past that</li>
            <li> A lot for price but not good quality</li>
            <li> Not good quality.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase again you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But when they came in the mail one of the cases was totally broken and some of the eyelashes were damaged and bent from the broken plastic</li>
            <li> Lashes are too thin but the work.</li>
            <li> One of the box is broken</li>
            <li> The containers were cracked, one of them completely,  but even worse than that is these lashes are terrible!</li>
            <li> Wrong size, was supposed to be .15C</li>
            <li> Very thin lashes.</li>
            <li> bad quality don not buy them</li>
            <li> They were bent and had creases from the base up, the rows were falling out of the trays..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for the price! The curl in the lash came out after about 2 weeks. So they were straight. But still looked good!</li>
            <li> The item is just as described in the description. The item was shipped from china and I placed my order nov 4 and it said should arrive early to mid December but I got it on nov 14 ! Less then two weeks ! Item seems like good quality will update when I start playing with them. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because one of the box came broken but it did not damage the lashes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Eyelashes are easy to remove from try, and the look real.</li>
            <li> Good product, soft, good cuality, thanks</li>
            <li> Eyelashes came thiner than it promised</li>
            <li> A lot for price but not good quality</li>
            <li> great product.. the box fits in my hand..</li>
            <li> Very poor quality!! The glue was all over the lashes, nit sure if ill be able to even use them after all ... very disappointed. I have bought many times similar product from different sellers, but never seen anything like this... I guess you get what you pay for!!</li>
            <li> I choose this rating for this product because it was a good product to work with. The only problem i had was the price was a bit high for me. but seeing that it works,ill probably buy again in the future if the price does not goes up anymore.</li>
            <li> Very thin lashes. Feel and look cheap</li>
            <li> Overall these lashes are good quality however I find that some of them are glued to eachother and I have to throw them out and sometimes the lashes are glued to well to the backing so I end up bending the last trying to peel it off.  For the price, the  minor irritations are worth it, overall a decent lash.</li>
            <li> Quality is medium, but then the price does reflect on the quality.</li>
            <li> These lashes are fantastic! The lash trays I received did not say &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; on them, as seller&#x27;s picture does. However, they have to be silk. They&#x27;re extremely soft &amp; lovely &amp; wonderful! &amp;#60;3 I completely enjoy using these babies &amp; you cannot argue any quality issues for the super cheap price either. They&#x27;re fantastic</li>
            <li> These are soft and beautiful. Great value for the price. Only wish the offer in .20 thickness for that price.</li>
            <li> I bought these lashes off of my husbands account but I am a licensed esthetician and lash technician. I was skeptical about this product due to the fact that they are so cheap but they are fantastic. My main concern is how the lashes feel and these have to be silk because they are so soft. I&#x27;m buying more because they are such high quality and priced well.</li>
            <li> i am very plesaed with this purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certified in eyelash extensions, and these are God awful!

            <li> bad quality don not buy them</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my order. Great buy for the price. I used them on one client and she loves them they are very light on her eyes but still give her a bit of a dramatic look and that&#x27;s what she wanted.</li>
            <li> These are the same lashes that my professional person uses! And now I see that $2-300 is not worth it. Starting to do them myself with these affordable lashes. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wrong size, was supposed to be .15C ended up being .07B. Mislabeled  and unusable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time it&#x27;s horrible quality!</li>
            <li> Love the C curl and variety of lengths!</li>

            <li> Not good quality. You get what you pay for. I won&#x27;t be buying from this company again.</li>
            <li> omg dont get themm they are realyy baddd</li>
            <li> The containers were cracked, one of them completely,  but even worse than that is these lashes are terrible! They are so thin they are not even worth the trouble! Guess in this case you get what you pay for. They took a very long time to get as well but I could&#x27;ve looked past that had they been better quality!</li>
            <li> Thin and very natural.</li>
            <li> I have yet to personally use them but all of my clients love them. I would definitely purchase again you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are really great lashes.  They took a little long to get to me but I was in no hurry.  I was really impressed with the quality.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t for home use, I&#x27;m a cosmetologist but I couldn&#x27;t apply to myself</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive. But the end product was as promised.</li>
            <li> Great, they are nice and soft and look very natural</li>
            <li> One of the box is broken</li>
