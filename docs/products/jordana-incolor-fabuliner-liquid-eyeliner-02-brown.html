    <ol>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>Rolls onto the eyelid flawlessly!  </li>
            <li>Great products, great service!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great for touch ups or for an all over look.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s GREAT customer service.</li>
            <li>Good price also</li>
            <li>Color is good though.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fine tip</li>
            <li>not as easy to apply as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>A lighter brown than I was hoping, but gets darker with more applications.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>mostly it&#x27;s gone in 3-5 hours.</li>
            <li>This is the best and the longest lasting eyeliner I have used</li>
            <li>I also tried their mascara and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on trying more of their products.</li>
            <li>but i actually like the brown better!!!</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy liner !</li>
            <li>This is one of the better ones available.</li>
            <li>so you can do fine lines</li>
            <li>so you would be fine with 1 swipe.</li>
            <li>So for someone error-prone like me, who also wants the intense look of a liquid liner, this is a great option.</li>
            <li>Jordana found one and sent it to me free of charge.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, so glad a friend introduced me to this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>The only nice thing---it washes off very easy</li>
            <li>I got this really excited to get it in the mail.</li>
            <li>The fact that it was made in China did not make me more confident about the chemicals going near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>The one I got is true to color.  </li>
            <li>It also wipes off pretty easily if you make a mistake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked for a good brown liquid eyeliner for a long time.</li>
            <li>It goes on my soft, fine eyelashes easily, and again, lasts all day.</li>
            <li>If you are curious about how a liquid liner works for you this is a good price point to start at.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super watery so it hard to appy, it is a nice long felt pen that goes on very nicely.</li>
            <li>This little pen is perfect for a close line next to the eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that it almost looks like a pencil application, nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Somehow there is more room for error with this gentle marker-like tip, and with the color being brown and not black.</li>
            <li>This pen goes on smooth, has a sharp end and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I bought this from the Jordana website with high hopes, because I&#x27;d seen some very positive reviews for it.  </li>
            <li>It lasts longer than many liquid liners in the same price range (although since most of those start flaking off immediately, that&#x27;s not much of a</li>
            <li>and I really do like the shape of the eyeliner,</li>
            <li>too much hasstle to return..</li>
            <li>Wish it was available in my local stores!</li>
            <li>but I did find that my brown one was kind of dried up already.</li>
            <li>Have q-tips ready to clear up any messes.</li>
            <li>it has more of a natural look to it compared to the black.</li>
            <li>What a great liner for such a small price!!</li>
            <li>The eyeliner seemed a little dry when I got it and the color was very very light.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to apply, for someone who is not very good at applying eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I called to inquire when it might come in because I will be having several surgeries and wanted to have a new one that I can keep by my bedside.</li>
            <li>It skipped and generally it acted like a dying marker despite being brand new.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>and it goes on smooth and thick</li>
            <li>It does not dry out, it goes on well.</li>
            <li>It had a very strong chemical smell, which I found disturbing since I was putting it on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and black eyeliners look harsh on me.</li>

            <li> I have light brown hair and black eyeliners look harsh on me.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to get an even fine line.  </li>
            <li> It does not stay on for too long---</li>
            <li> ordered a replacement of my almost used up liner directly from the Jordana a few weeks ago, but they were out of stock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other eyeliners in the past and if you don&#x27;t have a perfectly steady hand you see ALL of the imperfections, NOT with the design of this pen!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried this would be junky due to the low, low price; however, I decided to try it</li>
            <li> It was dry and rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at using makeup, especially eyeliner.</li>
            <li> but I have it flipped upside down in holder.</li>
            <li> I bought this...thinking it was in black...</li>
            <li> I never buy it was waste the money</li>
            <li> Appears almost black!</li>
            <li> The brown pencil was actually black when applied...same colour as black pencil!!!</li>
            <li> I found it hard to use the pen without hurting my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I usually do 2 swipes to ensure I didn&#x27;t miss a spot!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very difficult to apply and when you do get it on it is streaky and not a very solid color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a sharpie -- a sharpy with a very hard, pointy tip.  </li>
            <li> Thus eyeliner is of poor quality.</li>
            <li> My eyelids sting and are otherwise uncomfortable after application -- although I can&#x27;t tell whether this is due to the brutal application method, the chemicals, or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> applies smudgy, leaves a VERY faint brown line and lasts about one hour.  </li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to be precise.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> it was really bad one</li>
            <li> I hate this</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Rich and creamy liner ! Appears almost black! Good price also</li>
            <li> Fades off by the time I get to work.</li>
            <li> it was really bad one I hate this I never buy it was waste the money</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very difficult to apply and when you do get it on it is streaky and not a very solid color. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I wanted a liquid eyeliner because I like they way they glide on.  This did not.  It was dry and rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for a good brown liquid eyeliner for a long time. This is one of the better ones available. If you are curious about how a liquid liner works for you this is a good price point to start at.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching some tutorials and I really do like the shape of the eyeliner, but I did find that my brown one was kind of dried up already. I don&#x27;t know if it was user error or not- but I have it flipped upside down in holder. I do like it, I just wish it would have lasted longer</li>
            <li> Love this. It does not dry out, it goes on well. For the price it works better than the expensive stuff at Sephora.</li>
            <li> What a great liner for such a small price!!</li>
            <li> I got this really excited to get it in the mail. Note: I got this about 4 months ago....I STILL don&#x27;t have it and I don&#x27;t think I ever will...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at using makeup, especially eyeliner. This pen goes on smooth, has a sharp end and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on and makes my eyes itch after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT! I get compliments on it all of the time but you can get this for .99 cents or even $1.99 from Walgreens / CVS.</li>
            <li> A lighter brown than I was hoping, but gets darker with more applications. It isn&#x27;t super watery so it hard to appy, it is a nice long felt pen that goes on very nicely. I was surprised that it almost looks like a pencil application, nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner seemed a little dry when I got it and the color was very very light. I honestly didn&#x27;t even use it.</li>

It&#x27;s a very fine tip so you can do fine lines and it goes on smooth and thick so you would be fine with 1 swipe. I usually do 2 swipes to ensure I didn&#x27;t miss a spot!</li>
            <li> not as easy to apply as I would have liked.  Color is good though. Have q-tips ready to clear up any messes.</li>
            <li> The brown pencil was actually black when applied...same colour as black pencil!!! too much hasstle to return..Reluctant to reorder in case it happens agin</li>
            <li> I bought this...thinking it was in black...ah!!! but i actually like the brown better!!! it has more of a natural look to it compared to the black.</li>
            <li> Rolls onto the eyelid flawlessly!  I&#x27;ve used other eyeliners in the past and if you don&#x27;t have a perfectly steady hand you see ALL of the imperfections, NOT with the design of this pen! Highly recommend, so glad a friend introduced me to this eyeliner! Wish it was available in my local stores!</li>
            <li> This little pen is perfect for a close line next to the eyelashes.  Love it!  No flaking, running, stays in place.</li>
            <li> applies smudgy, leaves a VERY faint brown line and lasts about one hour.  Would NOT purchase again!  I guess I will be sticking with my Physician&#x27;s Formula felt tip eyeliner pen from now on.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to apply, for someone who is not very good at applying eyeliner. Somehow there is more room for error with this gentle marker-like tip, and with the color being brown and not black. It also wipes off pretty easily if you make a mistake. So for someone error-prone like me, who also wants the intense look of a liquid liner, this is a great option.</li>
            <li> I need to buy another one.  It&#x27;s really great for touch ups or for an all over look.</li>
            <li> Thus eyeliner is of poor quality. The felt tip is scratchy and does not draw well. It does not stay on for too long---mostly it&#x27;s gone in 3-5 hours. The only nice thing---it washes off very easy</li>
            <li> I bought this from the Jordana website with high hopes, because I&#x27;d seen some very positive reviews for it.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- The one I got is true to color.  It&#x27;s definitely a medium brown.&lt;br /&gt;-- It lasts longer than many liquid liners in the same price range (although since most of those start flaking off immediately, that&#x27;s not much of a compliment)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- It&#x27;s basically a sharpie -- a sharpy with a very hard, pointy tip.  I found it hard to use the pen without hurting my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-- I found it very difficult to be precise.&lt;br /&gt;-- I found it difficult to get an even fine line.  It skipped and generally it acted like a dying marker despite being brand new.&lt;br /&gt;-- It had a very strong chemical smell, which I found disturbing since I was putting it on my eyelids.  The fact that it was made in China did not make me more confident about the chemicals going near my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;-- My eyelids sting and are otherwise uncomfortable after application -- although I can&#x27;t tell whether this is due to the brutal application method, the chemicals, or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I will never use this as an eyeliner again.  I may see how it fares as an eyebrow pencil, though.  Or perhaps a Sharpie.  Or perhaps I&#x27;ll just trash it.</li>
            <li> Great products, great service! I stumbled on this brand at a local retail drug store. I have light brown hair and black eyeliners look harsh on me. Finding a truly brown color has been almost fruitless until now. This is the best and the longest lasting eyeliner I have used so I don&#x27;t need to search further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a replacement of my almost used up liner directly from the Jordana a few weeks ago, but they were out of stock. I called to inquire when it might come in because I will be having several surgeries and wanted to have a new one that I can keep by my bedside. Jordana found one and sent it to me free of charge. That&#x27;s GREAT customer service. I also tried their mascara and love it. It goes on my soft, fine eyelashes easily, and again, lasts all day. I&#x27;m planning on trying more of their products.</li>
