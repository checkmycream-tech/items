            <li> Pretty smell! I&#x27;ve been buying a lot of Arabian perfume oils because I like that they are small and concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;This one wasn&#x27;t as strong as some others that I own, I found myself putting on a lot more than the others.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, smells like Guess Gold. A little sweet, but sexy. Reminds me of one of the &amp;#34;Very Sexy&amp;#34; fragrances from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, great smell - just wish it were a tad more concentrated. But for the price... I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> I received this today, the bottle was PKG wonderful. The little Box it is in is gorgeous  I am in Bed tonight and put some on to see how long it does last. But I love it and will be buying more of this companies Perfume Oils. I got one other and its so pretty to and smells wonderful too! so I am very Happy with this. I would encourage anyone to buy it, its well worth it. The description of the sent is Beautiful!</li>
            <li> Makes me feel like a queen. oil roll on, lasts for hours, I smell myself. and I smell pretty. and clean. will order more.</li>
            <li> It is very potent. Arrived fast and in good condition. I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell however, a small dab at the nape of my neck seems to drive my husband crazy! Guess I&#x27;ll keep this one around.</li>
            <li> This has a musky scent that is different from what is described. Please check out my review on it and you will get a better idea. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2OOkjYQk2EM</li>
            <li> this smells so awesome my son used it all in the oil burner. He thought that is what it was for I will buy this again</li>
            <li> These oils smell even better than their descriptions, and the order came sooner than expected. I feel like an EMPRESS, blessed, heavenly, sophisticated etc. I&#x27;m already placing another order for more on their website: [...]  You pay only $1.25 when you buy 6 or more oils.  You can&#x27;t beat that! This was my order:  Al Sharquiah Perfume Oil, Illusion - Perfume Oil, Empress - Perfume Oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with several of the perfume oils now and this is probably one of favorites so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfume scents can vary because of personal taste, body chemistry and what not; so your nose might detect something different than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice hint of citrus to me. A bright note of oranges. The top note for me is definitely jasmine though. It has a very deep floral scent. I think that&#x27;s what makes it sophisticated and sexy. The light scent of citrus blends really well with the jasmine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would probably be a nice fall and winter scent. It&#x27;s a bit heavy. A little goes a long way. Trust me, don&#x27;t overdo it. Just a dab on your wrist and behind the ear is more than enough. These oils will last a long time if you use them accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such a great price for something that smells so expensive and refined. I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Quite sexy and romantic.  Great for warm weather.</li>
            <li> JUST AWFUL WHEN YOU APPLY AND AIR INTERACTS THE STINK IS AWFUL. I MEAN REALLY RUBBING ALCOHOL TO GET RID OF THE STINK IS UNREAL. PKGD PRETTY BIG DEAL</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance. Brighter dupe of Chanel Coco Madm? Cute petite box/container.  Ships fast. Great Customer service. Hubby gives compliments without prompting. Drydown is heavenly, more depth and sophistication than expected. Longevity is good, several hours on skin, days on clothes. Projection is skin scent to moderate.  Floral Woody Musk. Opens Bright, warm, sweet, citrus, floral, gourmand with a hint of musk and patchouli, spices. Several stage dry down hints at  sweet spices, roses, jasmine, warm vanilla, praline, almond, citrus, slight musk, sandalwood, patchouli,new mown hay. mild green notes, spices, tonka.  Women wear anytime. Men wear for evening. Migraine free frag 4 me. Oils and roll ons, especially like these without alcohol, are better for allergy, asthma and migraine sufferers. Now ordered numerous times over the years, shared with friends. Also like Roses, Nebras, Christine, Lovely, Al Sharquiah.  Vendor packs well, sometimes gives bonuses. High grade fragrance adapted to Western tastes at Great Value. Note: all oils require time to warm on skin before producing ultimate scent profiles.</li>
