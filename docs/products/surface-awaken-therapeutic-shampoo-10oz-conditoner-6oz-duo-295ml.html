            <li>I recommend this to people who need more volume in their hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the products and the tingly feeling.  </li>
            <li>Have used these products for awhile and love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair and scalp feel very clean and the scent is not overbearing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I think the shampoo/conditioner are wonderful, but I rated these a 4 instead of a 5 due to the price.</li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>- I found my scalp itch/pain intolerable and nothing seemed to calm it.  </li>
            <li>Well, was I surprised when not only did it do that exceptionally well...</li>

            <li>I have fine hair strands, but a lot of hair, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I tried natural remedies like coconut oil soaks, mother&#x27;s vinegar, emu oil</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some sort of magic in Surface line as I get at least some relief - albeit, 24 hours without the product</li>
            <li>and I figured maybe it will at least make what&#x27;s left feel and look better.</li>

            <li> .., various &#x27;itch&#x27; shampoos with neem, rosemary, tea tree, even RX level Nioxin, and an RX for some dermasmooth oil from my dermatologist to try to calm it down (which was awful as I had to sleep in it with a shower cap which left a mark on my forehead the next day), but nothing seemed to do much.  </li>

            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  Feels like a peppermint patty on your scalp!  Great for dry scalp or built-up residue on the scalp and makes my hair feel thick and yet lightweight/bouncy.  I have fine hair strands, but a lot of hair, so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Good for my hair as it is thinning.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner! I use it a couple of times a week and a small amount goes a long way. While it is expensive, it lasts for months and I have heavy, shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> My experience was identical to the one written by Amanda Roth.  I don&#x27;t know if this works for everyone but it sure seems to have for me.  John Langmore - Austin</li>
            <li> I have lost half my hair in the last six months.  I ordered Awaken because my daughter has been using it.  It really does work!  I new hair growing</li>
            <li> this feels great on my hair.  I recommend this to people who need more volume in their hair.  It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> I am allergic to sulfates and this product does not contain sulfates.  It is no irritating to my scalp and it leaves my hair soft and nonfrizzy.</li>
            <li> I love the products and the tingly feeling.  It makes my hair and scalp feel very clean and the scent is not overbearing.</li>
            <li> My beautician recommended this product so I decided to try it.  The shampoo smells wonderful and I feel like it makes my hair cleaner than some shampoos.  I think the shampoo/conditioner are wonderful, but I rated these a 4 instead of a 5 due to the price.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with my hair falling out for 4-5 yrs now. I have tried vitamins, supplements for hair, topical solutions...almost everything. Medical problems were ruled out also. Just \\&quot;normal\\&quot; aging I was told. My hairdresser suggested this product and I figured maybe it will at least make what&#x27;s left feel and look better. Well, was I surprised when not only did it do that exceptionally well...My hair stopped falling out! LOVE this product and will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.  Was glad to purchase over Amazon in the larger bottles. Salons only carry in small bottles</li>
            <li> I had a really bad 2 years with Alopecia Areata where I lost so much hair, I had to wear wigs - when my hair finally started growing back in (yeah!) - I found my scalp itch/pain intolerable and nothing seemed to calm it.

            <li> Using this because of itchy scalp. Helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Conditioner was half used</li>
            <li> Cleared up my scalp residue and made my hair feel so good :) definately recommend to my friends! Thank you!</li>
            <li> It is everything I thought it would be. It is very good. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was having a problem with my hair falling out. I started using this product and can noticeable tell a difference in the amount of hair that I am losing while shampooing. Will definitely continue using this product</li>
            <li> good product, good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Have used these products for awhile and love the way it makes my hair feel.  There is bounce, body and shine.  Will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was really fast and packed very well.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! My hair has never looked this good. It really works!!!</li>
