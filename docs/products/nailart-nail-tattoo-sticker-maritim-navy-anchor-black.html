            <li>Works perfectly!</li>
            <li>my daughter wanted anchor items since that is the symbol of her sorority and thought these were awesome!  </li>

            <li>great quality too</li>
            <li>I really liked these!</li>
            <li>The anchors are very cute and attractive, however, the &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; background has a brown color to it, so when you put it on your nail, it adds a hue that doesn&#x27;t match with your polish or &amp;#34;plain&amp;#34; nail.  </li>
            <li>They also come with good instructions.</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re really cute &amp; easy to put on the nails</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and looks super cute on my nails.</li>
            <li>They come in many different sizes and are of good quality.</li>
            <li>Nautical is in right now!</li>
            <li>The idea is very cute, but it took me awhile to figure out how to remove it from the back of the paper.</li>
            <li>Would love these in different colors...easy to use</li>
            <li>They fall off rather fast and they don&#x27;t stick very good, also very hard to cut out... . . .</li>
            <li>These are difficult to work with, not even my nail professional was able to make them look good.</li>
            <li>super hard to peel off and to add the top coat</li>
            <li>Very cute and easy to place the only problem is they start turning yellow after a few days.</li>
            <li>For the money it&#x27;s not bad, but not really worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>i would love to speak to anyone who was able to remove the stupid sticker.</li>

            <li> the stickers are not strong enough when we pull off the foil from the brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can scrape it off the paper in small tiny shreds.</li>
            <li> Also, they&#x27;re really hard to remove from the backing.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to peel off the paper and it gets wrinkled when you try and stick it on your nail.</li>
            <li> It is very thin and you need to be very careful when applying to nail.</li>
            <li> SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> it looks weird!</li>
            <li> Very difficult to do.</li>
            <li> this was insanely impossible</li>
            <li> Hate them!!!</li>
            <li> They look horrible on!!!</li>

            <li> my daughter wanted anchor items since that is the symbol of her sorority and thought these were awesome!  great quality too</li>
            <li> you can scrape it off the paper in small tiny shreds. i do my nails all the time and use stickers often. this was insanely impossible i would love to speak to anyone who was able to remove the stupid sticker. it doesnt even feel like there is a sticker it just feels like the paper.</li>
            <li> These are difficult to work with, not even my nail professional was able to make them look good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really cute &amp; easy to put on the nails but you start to peel after a day &amp; looks not so good, but I&#x27;m goin to try them again!</li>
            <li> These anchor nail tattoos are very cute! They come in many different sizes and are of good quality. They also come with good instructions.</li>
            <li> They make your nails look so cute! I love anchor stuff! They are just as shown and described. I love them!</li>
            <li> When you cut the sticker sheet it has a flim that you can see on your nail that surounds the art work.</li>
            <li> They fall off rather fast and they don&#x27;t stick very good, also very hard to cut out... . . .</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; Daughter have enjoyed using this product</li>
            <li> The idea is very cute, but it took me awhile to figure out how to remove it from the back of the paper. Very difficult to do. I was expecting it to be a transferable tattoo not a sticker. It is very thin and you need to be very careful when applying to nail. I ruined a couple of them trying to figure it out, but I finally got one to stay on my nails.</li>
            <li> I really liked these! Easy to put on and looks super cute on my nails. Nautical is in right now!</li>
            <li> My daughter just recently told me that she loves anchors so I got here these for Christmas.  She loved it!</li>
            <li> Very cute and easy to place the only problem is they start turning yellow after a few days.</li>
            <li> Hate them!!! They don&#x27;t pull off like a sticker . You have to cut the paper and then pull them off of the paper!!! They look horrible on!!! Would not buy again!!!</li>
