    <ol>
            <li>it is the best!</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>This is the best product ever invented!  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>This is great!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about two years and it is the best product I have found for oil control.</li>
            <li>I use dermadoctor pore perfect (also a great product) followed by the tease zone oil controller.  </li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>It controls my oil beautifully for about 5 hours which is hella-longer than everything else.  </li>
            <li>and they said it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a great anti-oil product,</li>
            <li>Great for achieving a matte finish without a powdery look.</li>
            <li>This product won by a longshot, though the Mary Kay oil control product was 80% as good as this one.</li>
            <li>This product works very good to keep your face from becoming shiny throughout the day.</li>
            <li>And Tease Zone gives my skin a satiny feel, a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>I think they have their own people add reviews because I don&#x27;t believe it works for anyone.  </li>
            <li>Tease zone oil control gel gives my face a nice matte look and feel for hours after application.  </li>
            <li>nice put under makeup, but there have been times I used it without makeup and by the end of the day</li>
            <li>Great product, worth the money.</li>
            <li>I used the oil control gel almost every day and it worked great, at first.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin, and this takes the shine beautifully.</li>
            <li>I also use it on top of my makeup, whenever I want to refresh my look, and it eliminates all oil and perspiration breakthrough.  </li>
            <li>Tease Zone does none of this, and, on top of its oil-blocking effectiveness, it makes skin feel silky.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It kept me oil free all day!  </li>
            <li>The more oily I let my skin get,</li>
            <li>Also, the gel&#x27;s streaking seemed to go away as I learned to apply it more sparingly.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m completely satisfied with</li>
            <li>my skin looks much better with tighter pores and many fewer blackheads and whiteheads.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure this product would work</li>
            <li>I just assume my face would be more oily without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it works better if you put makeup/powder over it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I waited to review this product because after a couple of weeks my skin seemed to become used to it.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Very light in texture and literally soaks up the oil right before your eyes!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do squat, I tried it once (for my wedding &amp; reception, a nice cool day &amp; evening</li>
            <li>At first I thought the product was okay, but nothing phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about my bangs absorbing the oil from my forehead anymore, so it even helps my hair look better all day!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling really smooth</li>
            <li>The TEASE ZONE site claims:\\&quot;Tease Zone goes on lightly and disappears</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a zit, but filled with oil.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s on, it makes my face feel really smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and that alone is a fantastic thing.  </li>
            <li>But its formulation contains a highly concentrated level of effective patented Polymer Technology - Sebum Sequestering Micro-Particles(tm) - that work to keep surface skin oils at bay without parching skin.</li>
            <li>For me, it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>so make up goes on smooth and stays fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>This product was a huge step in the right direction.</li>
            <li>It keeps the oil and shine away for up to 8 hours, I only wish it was available in a more &#x27;manly&#x27; package!</li>
            <li>Sebum Sequestering Micro-Particles(tm) are an extraordinary innovation whereby the particles \\&quot;soak up\\&quot; sebum produced by sebaceous oil glands.</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin...</li>
            <li>it produces so much oil it could easily qualify for OPEC status.  </li>
            <li>Usually I am very oily on my nose and forehead by mid-day, but today I stayed shine free until I washed my face before</li>
            <li>This product is far better than Clinac O.C., which I used for months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just about given up on keeping my pores clear since most products for that purpose give my skin a severe case of the flakes.  </li>
            <li>This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth getting.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on this product I decided the product would be worth the price.  </li>
            <li>You may need to apply twice a day and blot here and there, but its worth your money.</li>
            <li>right away:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily I found this product and it keeps my skin from freaking out so much.  </li>
            <li>This one works better than anything I have ever tried and keeps my face looking fresh for almost my entire shift at work, which is about 9 hours.</li>
            <li>Everyone else who complains about having super oily skin and recommends an oil control product that \\&quot;really works\\&quot; or is \\&quot;holy grail status\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>The only problem with it is that it leaves white streaks, but I find that a little pore minimizing moisturizer on top of it fixes this problem, and is good for my skin, and makes my pores look better.     </li>
            <li>I thought the product worked at first</li>
            <li>so no excuses for hot, sweaty weather there) &amp; now I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
            <li>Tease Zone feels better on my face, streaks far less, and traps oil better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as light as air, completely clear, and gentle.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to put on just to get that feeling, notwithstanding the other obvious</li>
            <li>he, I would feel better that way, but I really don&#x27;t care as long as it works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to go for hours and hours without a single shiny spot showing up on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of these reviews and maybe it just really depends on the person.  </li>
            <li>Really, I have a very oily face.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who fights with the shine of oily skin!</li>
            <li>You know, oily in some places, not so much in others.</li>
            <li>This really should be sold at drug stores over the counter because I often wonder what guys do about oily skin.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful, though, in applying it because the pump sometimes dispenses more than you want.</li>
            <li>AHA&#x27;s work imperfectly; they irritate without really addressing the cause of the problem.  </li>
            <li>But this product really works.</li>
            <li>People who reports streaking are probably using too much.  </li>
            <li>, my face was really oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>have really made a difference in my face.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, if you&#x27;re a dude with oily skin, you should get this and put it in a non-feminine container like a tiny lip balm container and take it with you because it&#x27;ll neutralize all the oils on your skin the instant you put it on</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually get lots of breakouts on my skin, but for some reason after using this I noticed more and more especially on my cheeks and forehead.   </li>
            <li>Between this and the pore reduction gel also from DermaDoctor, I&#x27;m better off than with ANY product my dermatologists or any other product I can get over the counter at drug</li>
            <li>(gross, I know) try this and cry for the right reasons!</li>
            <li>and heck, you probably won&#x27;t need it again for many hours down the road again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I put on a lot of it, my face appears slightly streaky, with some parts more matte-looking than others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many oil-control products, but they can feel tight on skin, they can leave films, or create flakes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend for anyone with an oily face.  </li>
            <li>Use it on clean skin and it will keep you shine free for at least 6 hours in my case.</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin and my makeup and whatnot come off way too early if I don&#x27;t use this.  </li>
            <li>On top of that it does tend to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you blend it in well, or you&#x27;ll have some dry powdery white stuff on your face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could live without it now.  </li>
            <li>, although I was unhappy that the product didn&#x27;t give my skin a perfectly matte look when I applied it, I continued using it daily for about a couple of months.</li>
            <li>tube is pretty big, too.</li>
            <li>Even if I take a walk outside in hot weather</li>
            <li>Sometimes I do still need to blot my nose, but even that&#x27;s not usually an issue until about 6 hours</li>
            <li>This is the first product that actually does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I do, however, recommend Neutrogena Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser, which actually does help &amp; is much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and have never been able to use facial moisturizers during the day because my face became one shiny mess of oil, even in the driest weather.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s good---it&#x27;ll keep me from getting wrinkles early.</li>
            <li>I said, I really really wish they&#x27;ll sell this at drug stores because, especially kids, need something like this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55, and still struggling to find products that work for oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Non-irritating, no oil all day, skin soft.</li>
            <li>i have really really oily skin that nothing else worked on, and this stuff totally controls my oiliness.</li>
            <li>all I really had to do was blot instead of washing my face and starting over.</li>
            <li>It feels soft, not oily, and not dry.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t want to try it due to the price.</li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t take much of the gel to cover my face, so I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li>The bottle is not that small and you really don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help control my oily skin at all :o</li>
            <li>I use a primer that comes with my BARE MINERALS kit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap but for my face not being oily all day it&#x27;s completely worth it.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve had so far that really does keep the oil and shine down.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I used it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I put on a lot of it, my face appears slightly streaky, with some parts more matte-looking than others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many oil-control products, but they can feel tight on skin, they can leave films, or create flakes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend for anyone with an oily face.  </li>
            <li> Use it on clean skin and it will keep you shine free for at least 6 hours in my case.</li>
            <li> I have VERY oily skin and my makeup and whatnot come off way too early if I don&#x27;t use this.  </li>
            <li> On top of that it does tend to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you blend it in well, or you&#x27;ll have some dry powdery white stuff on your face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could live without it now.  </li>
            <li> , although I was unhappy that the product didn&#x27;t give my skin a perfectly matte look when I applied it, I continued using it daily for about a couple of months.</li>
            <li> tube is pretty big, too.</li>
            <li> Even if I take a walk outside in hot weather</li>
            <li> Sometimes I do still need to blot my nose, but even that&#x27;s not usually an issue until about 6 hours</li>
            <li> This is the first product that actually does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I do, however, recommend Neutrogena Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser, which actually does help &amp; is much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have never been able to use facial moisturizers during the day because my face became one shiny mess of oil, even in the driest weather.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s good---it&#x27;ll keep me from getting wrinkles early.</li>
            <li> I said, I really really wish they&#x27;ll sell this at drug stores because, especially kids, need something like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55, and still struggling to find products that work for oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating, no oil all day, skin soft.</li>
            <li> i have really really oily skin that nothing else worked on, and this stuff totally controls my oiliness.</li>
            <li> all I really had to do was blot instead of washing my face and starting over.</li>
            <li> It feels soft, not oily, and not dry.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t want to try it due to the price.</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t take much of the gel to cover my face, so I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The bottle is not that small and you really don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help control my oily skin at all :o</li>
            <li> I use a primer that comes with my BARE MINERALS kit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap but for my face not being oily all day it&#x27;s completely worth it.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve had so far that really does keep the oil and shine down.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I used it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s when you have such excessive oil being produced on your face that the pores just get enlarged and grow, like tiny little volcanoes filled with oil.</li>
            <li> I normally use blotting papers every few hours to control my oil</li>
            <li> I am a 26-year-old female with extremely oily skin and have tried countless products to counteract the shine.</li>
            <li> Not surprised it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Let it dry, then finish putting on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry but prone to blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I go every other day because it does seem to have a lasting effect of overall less oil.  </li>
            <li> And they normally never do.</li>
            <li> all day long!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to mattify your face &amp; dry up the oil</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but was completely disappointed (especially since I paid so much).</li>
            <li> The oil is no intense there.  </li>
            <li> But a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Maybe it was in combination with other stuff, but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely oily</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have tried several so-called oil control products over the years, usually without apreciable results.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> If you have ever cried because you cant even rest your forehead on a flat surface without leaving a slick..</li>
            <li> The micro-particles are non-sticky and very lightweight, so Tease Zone vanishes instantly without leaving unpleasant residue, or chemical odor.</li>
            <li> Someone using it every day in sparing amounts would probably last at least three or four months.</li>
            <li> the more I get these annoying bumps.</li>
            <li> It keeps the shine down but also acts as a primer</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s 35 or whatever dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> I used to use a half dozen blotting sheets a day, and I haven&#x27;t had to use one in years.</li>
            <li> few days ago I forgot to apply it, and when I did I noticed that as the day progressed my face was producing visibly less oil than it used to.</li>
            <li> but just a little - all over.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few mattifying products and this stuff works</li>
            <li> I hope I save a few people from being dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for me very long after spending that much money.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;ve got another oil slick.</li>
            <li> It takes a ridiculously small amount to cover your face.  </li>
            <li> its not magical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on Accutane at least 4 times because of my excessively oily skin, with no eventual change once I stopped taking it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> If it worked it would at least work for a while....</li>
            <li> I look younger because of the oily skin - I don&#x27;t need weird and irritating anti-aging ingredients that just make my skin flaky and inflamed.</li>
            <li> I use blotters and can completley soak up 4 of them at a time 3x a day at least.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there because the gel isn&#x27;t thick and seems to sink into your skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve had so far that really does keep the oil and shine down.  I have VERY oily skin and my makeup and whatnot come off way too early if I don&#x27;t use this.  Plus, it keeps my face feeling fresher and cleaner for longer.  Use it on clean skin and it will keep you shine free for at least 6 hours in my case. Make sure you blend it in well, or you&#x27;ll have some dry powdery white stuff on your face.  Not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but was completely disappointed (especially since I paid so much). Didn&#x27;t help control my oily skin at all :o(  Would NOT recommend! I do, however, recommend Neutrogena Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser, which actually does help &amp; is much cheaper! Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;d been researching it for a while. It is silky on your skin, but for me, I thought this product made me break out! I don&#x27;t usually get lots of breakouts on my skin, but for some reason after using this I noticed more and more especially on my cheeks and forehead.   I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work for me, and I was disappointed because I do have oily skin!  Maybe it was in combination with other stuff, but I didn&#x27;t like it. And I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all in the amount of oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this over sunscreen, before foundation application, to keep the sunscreen from ruining my makeup.  I also use it on top of my makeup, whenever I want to refresh my look, and it eliminates all oil and perspiration breakthrough.  It&#x27;s as light as air, completely clear, and gentle.  I&#x27;ve tried many oil-control products, but they can feel tight on skin, they can leave films, or create flakes.  Tease Zone does none of this, and, on top of its oil-blocking effectiveness, it makes skin feel silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of these reviews and maybe it just really depends on the person.  I&#x27;ve tried a few mattifying products and this stuff works so well I just keep coming back to it.  It&#x27;s not cheap but for my face not being oily all day it&#x27;s completely worth it.  On top of that it does tend to last a long time.  Sometimes I go every other day because it does seem to have a lasting effect of overall less oil.  Really, I have a very oily face.  You could probably see yourself reflected in my face it if weren&#x27;t for this stuff.  It spreads well so you don&#x27;t need much.  I highly recommend this stuff.  I don&#x27;t understand all the negative reviews.  If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, sorry, no need to call those of us who have used it and love it, fools.  That just gives your review no credit.</li>
            <li> I started using this product several months ago and I love it.  I have oily skin and have never been able to use facial moisturizers during the day because my face became one shiny mess of oil, even in the driest weather.  I can now use moisturizer every day under the gel.  It leaves my face feeling really smooth and I think it has helped control my acne, too.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about my bangs absorbing the oil from my forehead anymore, so it even helps my hair look better all day!  I highly recommend this product to anyone who fights with the shine of oily skin!</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday...it is the best! It kept me oil free all day!  Usually I am very oily on my nose and forehead by mid-day, but today I stayed shine free until I washed my face before bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for oily skin!</li>
            <li> DERMAdoctor&#x27;s TEASE ZONE OIL CONTROL GEL is just what the doctor ordered! It keeps the shine down but also acts as a primer so make up goes on smooth and stays fresh all day. I use a primer that comes with my BARE MINERALS kit but I noticed that oil was seeping through as the weather heated up. Anyone whose ever been to Shreveport knows about the infamous humidity down here! TEASE ZONE OIL CONTROL GEL may not be as velvety as my former primer but it gets the job done. The TEASE ZONE site claims:\\&quot;Tease Zone goes on lightly and disappears; you won&#x27;t even realize you&#x27;ve got it on. But its formulation contains a highly concentrated level of effective patented Polymer Technology - Sebum Sequestering Micro-Particles(tm) - that work to keep surface skin oils at bay without parching skin. Sebum Sequestering Micro-Particles(tm) subtly entice oils into exile. No \\&quot;matte-r\\&quot; what your skin type, skin looks beguiling and balanced. \\&quot;Matte-ifying\\&quot; gel vanishes on contact without a hint of residue. Sebum Sequestering Micro-Particles(tm) are an extraordinary innovation whereby the particles \\&quot;soak up\\&quot; sebum produced by sebaceous oil glands. The micro-particles are non-sticky and very lightweight, so Tease Zone vanishes instantly without leaving unpleasant residue, or chemical odor. The proof is in the pudding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use DERMAdoctor because it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the review I wrote for beautystat dot com.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin. You know, oily in some places, not so much in others. I wash my face, apply the DERMAdoctor - but just a little - all over.  Let it dry, then finish putting on my makeup.  The first few times I used it I was amazed that I didn&#x27;t have to powder my nose (or forehead or chin) all day long!! Bonus - I have fewer blemishes.  How did I get by without this stuff?</li>
            <li> This really should be sold at drug stores over the counter because I often wonder what guys do about oily skin. Honestly, if you&#x27;re a dude with oily skin, you should get this and put it in a non-feminine container like a tiny lip balm container and take it with you because it&#x27;ll neutralize all the oils on your skin the instant you put it on and heck, you probably won&#x27;t need it again for many hours down the road again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always warned my dermatologists since I was 16 that I hated my oily skin and they said it&#x27;s great, it&#x27;s good---it&#x27;ll keep me from getting wrinkles early. I&#x27;ve been on Accutane at least 4 times because of my excessively oily skin, with no eventual change once I stopped taking it.  Now I&#x27;m 38 and have what&#x27;s been diagnosed as sebaceous hyperplasma. What is that? It&#x27;s when you have such excessive oil being produced on your face that the pores just get enlarged and grow, like tiny little volcanoes filled with oil. It&#x27;s like a zit, but filled with oil. The more oily I let my skin get, the more I get these annoying bumps. It&#x27;s AWFUL!  Luckily I found this product and it keeps my skin from freaking out so much.  Between this and the pore reduction gel also from DermaDoctor, I&#x27;m better off than with ANY product my dermatologists or any other product I can get over the counter at drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I really really wish they&#x27;ll sell this at drug stores because, especially kids, need something like this. Those oil wiping sheets only keep oil off my skin for like 20 minutes and then I&#x27;ve got another oil slick. It&#x27;s gross and annoying.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Tease Zone about a month ago. At first I thought the product was okay, but nothing phenomenal. I observed the following things about the product right away:&lt;br /&gt;1. When it&#x27;s on, it makes my face feel really smooth and silky. I just want to touch my face...it&#x27;s great to put on just to get that feeling, notwithstanding the other obvious benefits.&lt;br /&gt;2. When I put on a lot of it, my face appears slightly streaky, with some parts more matte-looking than others. &lt;br /&gt;3. This product is far better than Clinac O.C., which I used for months. Tease Zone feels better on my face, streaks far less, and traps oil better. &lt;br /&gt;Now, although I was unhappy that the product didn&#x27;t give my skin a perfectly matte look when I applied it, I continued using it daily for about a couple of months. Then I noticed something.&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago I forgot to apply it, and when I did I noticed that as the day progressed my face was producing visibly less oil than it used to. Also, the gel&#x27;s streaking seemed to go away as I learned to apply it more sparingly. Now I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;The tube is pretty big, too. Someone using it every day in sparing amounts would probably last at least three or four months. You have to be careful, though, in applying it because the pump sometimes dispenses more than you want. I&#x27;ve finally got the hang of it. &lt;br /&gt;This is a neat product. Not only does it control oil when it appears on the face, but also seems to decrease oil production altogether, which is delighting.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry but prone to blemishes.  I&#x27;d just about given up on keeping my pores clear since most products for that purpose give my skin a severe case of the flakes.  AHA&#x27;s work imperfectly; they irritate without really addressing the cause of the problem.  Since I&#x27;ve started using Tease Zone my skin looks much better with tighter pores and many fewer blackheads and whiteheads.  And Tease Zone gives my skin a satiny feel, a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin then you know how disappointing it is when you buy an oil control product that does not deliver. And they normally never do. But this product really works. My skin is extremely oily so I have to apply this product 2-3 times per day. But a little goes a long way so you don&#x27;t need to apply alot. And it is not too drying either so no flaking or irritation. This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had oily skin all my life so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  I normally use blotting papers every few hours to control my oil and I thought this would eliminate me having to use them.  Well I purchased DERMAdoctor Oil Control Gel and it did not do a thing.  I think they have their own people add reviews because I don&#x27;t believe it works for anyone.  If it worked it would at least work for a while....Total waste of money! I hope I save a few people from being dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried several so-called oil control products over the years, usually without apreciable results.  Tease zone oil control gel gives my face a nice matte look and feel for hours after application.  People who reports streaking are probably using too much.  It takes a ridiculously small amount to cover your face.  I use dermadoctor pore perfect (also a great product) followed by the tease zone oil controller.  If you have oily skin, you should definitely try this!</li>
            <li> I ordered various products and tested them on my face. This product won by a longshot, though the Mary Kay oil control product was 80% as good as this one. Nothing else came close.  Dang, it is 10 pm at night and my foundation, powder, and mascara are still in place from 7 am this morning. Before, all of it would have dripped off into a Vaseline melt about 10 hours ago. And no allergic hives!  I&#x27;m 55, and still struggling to find products that work for oily and sensitive skin. I look younger because of the oily skin - I don&#x27;t need weird and irritating anti-aging ingredients that just make my skin flaky and inflamed. Is there anyone else like me?  This product was a huge step in the right direction. Non-irritating, no oil all day, skin soft. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  Very light in texture and literally soaks up the oil right before your eyes!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely greasy skin because I have the worst acne problem. Even after I wash my face, ten minutes later, my face starts to shine. I wasn&#x27;t really sure this product would work but I decided to give it a try. I use three pumps of the gel and apply it all over my face. You don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there because the gel isn&#x27;t thick and seems to sink into your skin. Then I put my makeup on. I&#x27;ve been able to go for hours and hours without a single shiny spot showing up on my face. Even if I take a walk outside in hot weather and I sweat, it still holds and the shine is kept at bay. This stuff is worth getting.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this multiple times, so I do keep going back to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its nice put under makeup, but there have been times I used it without makeup and by the end of the day, my face was really oily.&lt;br /&gt;So its not magical. I just assume my face would be more oily without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for a great anti-oil product, but I dont mind using this up. I think it works better if you put makeup/powder over it so you get double the oil control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since November. I must have the oiliest skin on the planet. I thought the product worked at first but my skin is oily an hour after I put on my makeup. I use blotters and can completley soak up 4 of them at a time 3x a day at least. And that is with no strenuous activity. I&#x27;m 43 and still have zits and sometimes cystic acne every now and then. If anyone knows something that will help me let me know please!</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever invented!  It keeps the oil and shine away for up to 8 hours, I only wish it was available in a more &#x27;manly&#x27; package! he he, I would feel better that way, but I really don&#x27;t care as long as it works.  All guys should try this in addition to women.</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed a product before, but I felt compelled to do so with this one. I am a 26-year-old female with extremely oily skin and have tried countless products to counteract the shine. This one works better than anything I have ever tried and keeps my face looking fresh for almost my entire shift at work, which is about 9 hours. Sometimes I do still need to blot my nose, but even that&#x27;s not usually an issue until about 6 hours or so have passed. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t take much of the gel to cover my face, so I expect it to last a long time. For me, it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I have super oily skin... it produces so much oil it could easily qualify for OPEC status.  No lie.  Everyone else who complains about having super oily skin and recommends an oil control product that \\&quot;really works\\&quot; or is \\&quot;holy grail status\\&quot;... well... none of those has ever done a thing for me.  But Tease Zone?  This stuff WORKS! It controls my oil beautifully for about 5 hours which is hella-longer than everything else.  Plus, it feels like there is nothing at all on my face (even over sunscreen) and that alone is a fantastic thing.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dermadoctor Tease Zone Gel for about a year now.  I don&#x27;t think I could live without it now.  I&#x27;ve tried other products that claim to mattify your face &amp; dry up the oil but none have worked.  I HIGHLY recommend for anyone with an oily face.  In fact, buy two bottles because once you try it, you won&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product I decided the product would be worth the price.  I used the oil control gel almost every day and it worked great, at first.  I&#x27;m glad I waited to review this product because after a couple of weeks my skin seemed to become used to it.  It began to become oily again sooner and sooner every time I used it.  I now only use it every once in a while and it works okay.  I was a little disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for me very long after spending that much money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and I adore it. i have really really oily skin that nothing else worked on, and this stuff totally controls my oiliness. I used to use a half dozen blotting sheets a day, and I haven&#x27;t had to use one in years. The bottle lasts forever, too.     The only problem with it is that it leaves white streaks, but I find that a little pore minimizing moisturizer on top of it fixes this problem, and is good for my skin, and makes my pores look better.     Everyone needs to buy this so they keep making it!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product.  It controls my oily face for hours.  My forhead is another issue.  The oil is no intense there.  I&#x27;m going to try the bodyguard under this product and see if that works.  The Tease Zone with the Aint misbehaving have really made a difference in my face.  It feels soft, not oily, and not dry.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This product works very good to keep your face from becoming shiny throughout the day. I use to have to wipe my face every 2 hours or so to remove the oil and shine. I can tell it helps even when I&#x27;m not wearing it too. Great product, worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this primer in hopes it would absorb oil and prevent shine. It did not seem to help at all.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin. I would put on my make-up and about 30 minutes later, my face would look like I had vaseline on my face. This is the first product that actually does what it says it will do. At first I didn&#x27;t want to try it due to the price. After reading the reviews, i gave it a try and I am glad that I did. The bottle is not that small and you really don&#x27;t need that much. I use it as a primer for my press powder and throughout the day all I really had to do was blot instead of washing my face and starting over. This is great!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do squat, I tried it once (for my wedding &amp; reception, a nice cool day &amp; evening so no excuses for hot, sweaty weather there) &amp; now I can&#x27;t even return it. There&#x27;s 35 or whatever dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> Not surprised it was discontinued.  Doesn&#x27;t work.  The search continues....</li>
            <li> Great for achieving a matte finish without a powdery look. I&#x27;ve used it under and above foundation for different results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two years and it is the best product I have found for oil control. I have VERY oily skin, and this takes the shine beautifully. You may need to apply twice a day and blot here and there, but its worth your money. I can go about 6 hours before I need to reapply it. If you have ever cried because you cant even rest your forehead on a flat surface without leaving a slick.. (gross, I know) try this and cry for the right reasons!</li>
