            <li>I was also impressed as to how quickly I got it.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist recommended this brush to me and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I have never in my life been able to low-dry my hair!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It gives LOTS of volume with the blow drying and leaves a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>It dries evenly and the handle has a nice grip.</li>
            <li>I liked the &amp;#34;big bouncy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>i use the better quality shampoos and treatments but thought, meh, why would i pay more than drugstore cost for a brush?!</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, great results and doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair (which is a fine texture) - and that&#x27;s an accomplishment since I never seem to be able to reproduce styling done by my hair stylist.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed by this brush for the cost and will probably purchase more in different sizes.</li>
            <li>I had my doubts on whether it was authentic, but at this point it doesn&#x27;t matter if it isn&#x27;t as it is holding up just well.</li>
            <li>I think this is more a user-learning issue</li>
            <li>but it was definitely more involving than a straightener.</li>
            <li>did I see even better results with softer, fuller hair.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with both the product and the shipper.  </li>
            <li>I like the brush, wish it has more bristles in it so that it would hold on to the hair better, or maybe just longer bristles.</li>
            <li>Love the product and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>They are well made, reasonably priced and are good for your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and glides easily through my hair easily without any pulling.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened it, I quickly realized it is NOT A CRICKET!  </li>
            <li>It gives me tremendous volume and I love the way my hair turns out.</li>
            <li>When I tried to return it, there were no options available for return.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a comfortable thickness.</li>
            <li>Great for my long hair......makes it smooth with having to wrestle with it......</li>
            <li>It has turned out to be my favorite brush, it leaves my fine hair full looking and very shiny.</li>
            <li>But yea, I really like this brush, haven&#x27;t quite found a reason to love it</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products with no luck to have that straight healthy hair that I love.</li>
            <li>the hair doesn&#x27;t tangle and the handle is easy to grip and very well priced.</li>
            <li>You will finish fast!!</li>
            <li>Simply put, I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>and so worth it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brush arrived right on time.  </li>
            <li>This brush is amazing for long hair.</li>
            <li>With this brush (I got the 2 1/2 in), blow drying my hair is super fast</li>
            <li>Great large brush to help create the volume you want on those days that only big hair will do.  </li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Much better than another brush I had of similar size and style.</li>
            <li>After my first use..let&#x27;s just say I never used my straightener again.</li>
            <li>They were first recommended by my stylist and almost every stylist I know.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s straight!</li>
            <li>Also, there really wasn&#x27;t any difference in drying time between using that brush or just running my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and this brush gives my hair so much volume.</li>
            <li>I had two people comment on how much thicker my hair looked</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to wear my hair straight</li>
            <li>so I wonder if we really needed a point at all.</li>
            <li>(mostly) straight hair.</li>
            <li>Now, I personally have experience blow drying hair, so I&#x27;m not saying this brush will make you a pro, but if you look up a couple videos on YouTube something, you can go better far,</li>
            <li>so I can use it to straighten my hair without a flat iron and thus I have no more breakage and my hair is now healthy and flowing :)</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t get tangled in long hair which is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this brush!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that sits at my shoulder and sometimes flips under (as I wish) and other times flips out as it wants.  </li>
            <li>Cuts the dry time significantly.</li>
            <li>Smooth silky straight hair with a slight curl where I need it.  </li>
            <li>It cuts my drying time in half and really makes my hair look smooth.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ll admit, i was too cheap to purchase anything other than something from a drugstore.</li>
            <li>I ordered in on Tuesday and since I live in MI</li>
            <li>She said she had a new one that I could purchase from her.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and takes less time to do my hair because of the size.  </li>
            <li>I was afraid it would be too big for my shoulder length layered hair - but its perfect.</li>
            <li>;-) I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I was using only a hot iron before to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>When using it to blow dry hair it would work okay at the start, but once my hair started to actually dry, it would get caught and snag.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, for someone who suffers from Fibromyalgia or other chronic pain issues, like myself: The handle is comfortable to grasp and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand.</li>
            <li>Only thing keeping me from giving it a 5-star is that after a lot of use and over time, the fact that it has the removable handle to take out the pick, that starts to come off/slide down on its own, making re-adjustment necessary whenever you use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely amazed at this brush.  </li>
            <li>bristles don&#x27;t get soft....</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how large this brush was going to be as I couldn&#x27;t remember the sizes of the other round brushes I have, or how to measure them.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight and with this brush I can blow dry it in about 15 mins!</li>
            <li>i have slightly coarse but naturally</li>
            <li>I have tried several different round brushes, but my stylist used this brush on my hair and this works the best for my very thick hair and my hair does not get all tangled or wrapped around the brush as with other brushes I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I also have very thick hair so having it feel lighter and less frizzier is amazing.</li>
            <li>(past shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;- VERY fast drying time with hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;-</li>

            <li> I also have very thick hair so having it feel lighter and less frizzier is amazing.</li>
            <li> (past shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;- VERY fast drying time with hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are stiff enough to hold your hair but not so much that it hurts against your scalp.</li>
            <li> The other had a foam handle that felt too soft</li>
            <li> It reminds me of my Tigi round brush, I bought ages ago, in the way it looks and is constructed- right down to the pick inside the handle that you can use to take the hair out of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> I have A LOT of hair which is also pretty thick and has a wave to it.</li>
            <li> so I purchased this brush so I could finally learn to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It was a bit larger than I expected, but I ordered according to the recommendations for my hair length (</li>
            <li> It you have medium to long hair</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair twice a week</li>
            <li> I can use this brush to shape my hair as I dry it</li>
            <li> due to the required blow drying and use of a flat iron.</li>
            <li> this is the brush to blow dry your hair,!</li>
            <li> Even when completely dry!  </li>
            <li> This brush helps my hair do that less than it did with a smaller barrel</li>
            <li> and it felt like I had to work harder to hang onto it while drying my hair and trying to turn the brush.  </li>
            <li> The only round brush I&#x27;d used before was one I&#x27;d bought from Ulta (Olivia Garden ceramic + turbo vent).  </li>
            <li> I think this is just me not being careful though.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair and this brush helps me in blowing it out.</li>
            <li> This brush helps me blow dry my hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> I tossed two other brushes, replacing them with this one.</li>
            <li> I use to blow dry my hair with 1 1/2 in round brush and my hair is maybe 30&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> With so many bristles I was very afraid it would not work with my hair (slightly course and lots of tangles).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve emailed Amazon so hopefully I at least get my money back.</li>
            <li> This brush contributes to my hair drying faster and smoother with less frizz.</li>
            <li> I sometimes even think it takes a lot less time to do my hair than when I used a straightener.</li>
            <li> and I have wavy hair that I color regularly which in the past has meant that my hear was not healthy with breakage, split ends, etc.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I bought the one that is a little over 2 inches.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest round brushes I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The nylon bristles are sturdy and have not shown any signs of wear after using a few times now.  </li>
            <li> The dead give away is the &amp;#34;Antibacterial&amp;#34; printed on the handle  instead of Antimicrobial.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this round brush along with a quality hairdryer and have been AMAZED!</li>
            <li> This brush has bristles stiff enough to grab and hold hair while blow drying, yet not so stiff that they are painful when brushing.  </li>
            <li> I did not expect it for at least 7-10 days since it was coming from CA.</li>
            <li> not fine or thin.</li>
            <li> This product is not too hard on the tangles in ur hair and makes everything less painful</li>

            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. Great buy....a keeper for life!!!  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Brush arrived right on time.  I wasn&#x27;t quite sure how large this brush was going to be as I couldn&#x27;t remember the sizes of the other round brushes I have, or how to measure them. It was a bit larger than I expected, but I ordered according to the recommendations for my hair length (a few inches past my shoulders) and it is perfect.  This is one of the nicest round brushes I&#x27;ve purchased. It reminds me of my Tigi round brush, I bought ages ago, in the way it looks and is constructed- right down to the pick inside the handle that you can use to take the hair out of the bristles. Most importantly, for someone who suffers from Fibromyalgia or other chronic pain issues, like myself: The handle is comfortable to grasp and doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand. It is lightweight and glides easily through my hair easily without any pulling. The nylon bristles are sturdy and have not shown any signs of wear after using a few times now.  I am really impressed by this brush for the cost and will probably purchase more in different sizes.</li>
            <li> Excellent roundbrush, one of the best I&#x27;ve owned. Only thing keeping me from giving it a 5-star is that after a lot of use and over time, the fact that it has the removable handle to take out the pick, that starts to come off/slide down on its own, making re-adjustment necessary whenever you use it. Even still with that, the brush itself is great. I would have preferred it without the unnecessary feature which ended up complicating things.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a couple of weeks now and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.  I have fine hair that sits at my shoulder and sometimes flips under (as I wish) and other times flips out as it wants.  This brush helps my hair do that less than it did with a smaller barrel and it dries faster as well.  The end of the pick was broken on my brush but I don&#x27;t use it anyhow so that didn&#x27;t matter to me.  I also bought the Spornette Prego Brush [don&#x27;t know how to do a product link yet but you can buy it on Amazon] and I preferred this handle.  The other had a foam handle that felt too soft and it felt like I had to work harder to hang onto it while drying my hair and trying to turn the brush.  The bristles on this brush are stiff enough to hold your hair but not so much that it hurts against your scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific brush. It is so easy to use, great results and doesn&#x27;t get tangled in my hair (which is a fine texture) - and that&#x27;s an accomplishment since I never seem to be able to reproduce styling done by my hair stylist.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life been able to low-dry my hair! I have A LOT of hair which is also pretty thick and has a wave to it. Recently, I cut it just above my shoulders so I purchased this brush so I could finally learn to blow dry my hair. Well, this brush is fool-proof!! I seriously looked like I had just come out of the salon!!. Needless to say, I&#x27;d definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This product is not too hard on the tangles in ur hair and makes everything less painful</li>
            <li> MY hair is very thick. This brush helps me blow dry my hair in half the time. So far I love it.</li>
            <li> It you have medium to long hair this is the brush to blow dry your hair,! You will finish fast!!</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was looking for.  It cuts my drying time in half and really makes my hair look smooth.</li>
            <li> Great size, works like a charm.  Smooth silky straight hair with a slight curl where I need it.  Great for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for long hair. I blow dry my hair twice a week and this has made it easier and faster. My hair is naturally straight and with this brush I can blow dry it in about 15 mins! Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush based on the recommendation from my hair stylist. This brush contributes to my hair drying faster and smoother with less frizz. I also have very thick hair so having it feel lighter and less frizzier is amazing. I was also impressed as to how quickly I got it. I ordered in on Tuesday and since I live in MI I did not expect it for at least 7-10 days since it was coming from CA. I received my brush by Thursday. TWO DAYS!!! I will definitely be ordering from this seller again, should the need arise!</li>
            <li> I have used this brush now for over 6 months and it is still in great shape. I had my doubts on whether it was authentic, but at this point it doesn&#x27;t matter if it isn&#x27;t as it is holding up just well. I have thick, naturally curly hair and this brush helps me in blowing it out. Cuts the dry time significantly.</li>
            <li> The only round brush I&#x27;d used before was one I&#x27;d bought from Ulta (Olivia Garden ceramic + turbo vent).  When using it to blow dry hair it would work okay at the start, but once my hair started to actually dry, it would get caught and snag.  Also, there really wasn&#x27;t any difference in drying time between using that brush or just running my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is a totally different story.  With so many bristles I was very afraid it would not work with my hair (slightly course and lots of tangles).  To my surprise it goes through my hair with ease.  Even when completely dry!  I&#x27;m completely amazed at this brush.  It gives LOTS of volume with the blow drying and leaves a nice shine.  The only downside is the rubber handle.  Because I have to spin the handle as I&#x27;m brushing my hair, some hairs get snagged against my hand and the handle.  I think this is more a user-learning issue though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Size is great for my hair length (past shoulders).&lt;br /&gt;- VERY fast drying time with hair dryer&lt;br /&gt;- Does not pull hair!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Some hairs get snagged on the handle.  I think this is just me not being careful though.  Still 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;This brush has changed my life.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST brush. I was afraid it would be too big for my shoulder length layered hair - but its perfect. It grabs the hair without tangleing or getting caught in brush. It dries evenly and the handle has a nice grip. It has turned out to be my favorite brush, it leaves my fine hair full looking and very shiny. Love it!</li>
            <li> I just received my hair brush in the mail. As soon as I opened it, I quickly realized it is NOT A CRICKET!  The dead give away is the &amp;#34;Antibacterial&amp;#34; printed on the handle  instead of Antimicrobial.  When I tried to return it, there were no options available for return.  I&#x27;ve emailed Amazon so hopefully I at least get my money back.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this brush to me and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.  Much better than another brush I had of similar size and style.</li>
            <li> Love cricket brushes!!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and this brush gives my hair so much volume. I had two people comment on how much thicker my hair looked and I noticed that I dont need to style my hair on a daily basis anymore. I can use this brush to shape my hair as I dry it and thats it for the day.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the delivery was very quick. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Simply put, I love this brush!  My stylist used one during my appts and I finally asked her where I could get one.  She said she had a new one that I could purchase from her.  I have curly hair and I like to keep it shoulder length and this brush works great on my hair.  I have the #370 - 1 3/4\\&quot; barrel brush and I am purchasing the #400 - 2 1/2\\&quot; barrel brush.  Don&#x27;t second guess. . . get one and you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> The thought of blowing my hair out with a blow dryer and a brush never appealed to me until recently. I liked the &amp;#34;big bouncy&amp;#34; look so I gave it a go with a brush I bought at a local store. Long story short I hated how it turned out. Granted, I wasn&#x27;t an expert but it was definitely more involving than a straightener. I decided to give it another go and came across THIS one. After my first use..let&#x27;s just say I never used my straightener again. This brush is amazing!!! It gives me tremendous volume and I love the way my hair turns out. I sometimes even think it takes a lot less time to do my hair than when I used a straightener. Others say the bristles are too rough on their scalp and that it&#x27;s painful but, I had no issues with that what so ever. I bought the one that is a little over 2 inches. I have long, thick hair and I always get compliments on how gorgeous my mane looks ;-) I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> BEST Brush I have EVER owned in all my 56 years!&lt;br /&gt;Love It!</li>
            <li> I was using only a hot iron before to straighten my hair.  It wasn&#x27;t until my stylist showed me how to use a round brush with my hair dryer did I see even better results with softer, fuller hair.  I have tried several different round brushes, but my stylist used this brush on my hair and this works the best for my very thick hair and my hair does not get all tangled or wrapped around the brush as with other brushes I have tried.  The result is straighter, softer, fulller, healthier hair.  I cannot live without this brush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line of brushes for years.  They were first recommended by my stylist and almost every stylist I know.  They are well made, reasonably priced and are good for your hair.  I just don&#x27;t use anything else.  Shipment was fast.  I was pleased with both the product and the shipper.  I have shoulder length hair and this is a great brush.  the hair doesn&#x27;t tangle and the handle is easy to grip and very well priced.</li>
            <li> Love it! Easy to use and takes less time to do my hair because of the size.  Would reccommend this.</li>
            <li> This brush it great for me. I use to blow dry my hair with 1 1/2 in round brush and my hair is maybe 30&amp;#34;. I was quite terrible, it took forever, and it still wasn&#x27;t every straight. With this brush (I got the 2 1/2 in), blow drying my hair is super fast and it&#x27;s straight! Now, I personally have experience blow drying hair, so I&#x27;m not saying this brush will make you a pro, but if you look up a couple videos on YouTube something, you can go better far, and of course practice. But yea, I really like this brush, haven&#x27;t quite found a reason to love it but it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> This brush has bristles stiff enough to grab and hold hair while blow drying, yet not so stiff that they are painful when brushing.  The handle is a comfortable thickness. I tossed two other brushes, replacing them with this one.</li>
            <li> I prefer to wear my hair straight and I have wavy hair that I color regularly which in the past has meant that my hear was not healthy with breakage, split ends, etc. due to the required blow drying and use of a flat iron. I have tried many different products with no luck to have that straight healthy hair that I love. I purchased this round brush along with a quality hairdryer and have been AMAZED! This brush does not get caught in my hair and does not cause snarling so I can use it to straighten my hair without a flat iron and thus I have no more breakage and my hair is now healthy and flowing :)</li>
            <li> I like the brush, wish it has more bristles in it so that it would hold on to the hair better, or maybe just longer bristles. The point at the bottom doesn&#x27;t do anything for me so I wonder if we really needed a point at all.</li>
            <li> this brush is awesome. it&#x27;s what my stylist has been using on my hair forever but i&#x27;ll admit, i was too cheap to purchase anything other than something from a drugstore. i use the better quality shampoos and treatments but thought, meh, why would i pay more than drugstore cost for a brush?! well this brush makes my hair so shiny - same as when i leave the salon. it was the missing piece in my repertoire for having the \\&quot;i just got my hair done\\&quot; look. so awesome! and so worth it!&lt;br /&gt;ps i have slightly coarse but naturally (mostly) straight hair. not fine or thin.</li>
            <li> Great for my long hair......makes it smooth with having to wrestle with it......If you have longer hair, this is the way to go.  I in fact have these brushes in all size even when my hair was shorter...they last forever....bristles don&#x27;t get soft....great brush!!!!</li>
            <li> Great large brush to help create the volume you want on those days that only big hair will do.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t get tangled in long hair which is fabulous.</li>
