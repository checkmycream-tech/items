    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is one of the best comb dryer that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Very good dryer for the price.  </li>
            <li>This was a good replacement.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer!  </li>
            <li>Tools and settings are nice.</li>
            <li>I rate this product with a happy smile</li>
            <li>Due to the texture of my hair, this type of hair dryer works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>They did fit well on the dryer and stayed on well during use when I did attempt to use them.</li>
            <li>good air flow and a good firm brush</li>
            <li>The bristles in the brush are nice and stiff, the dryer is light, it&#x27;s just a great dryer.  </li>
            <li>Quieter and not as hot as most hairdryers of this style.  </li>
            <li>Love how it leaves the hair straight like you did it in the salon.</li>
            <li>Hair drys quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>This is for protection, I know, but it doesn&#x27;t seem very hot when it shuts off.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very frizzy, and this blow dryer gives it a smoother flow.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much of an opinion on the attachments.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, it shuts off too quickly when it reaches a certain temperature.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy, It appears that the manufacture near answers their phone</li>
            <li>It covers more drying area and at 275 watts less than my old dryer, is less damaging to my hair.</li>
            <li>I like it very much at the present time, but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price, I have paid twice as much for a dryer and have it not last as long.</li>

            <li> Really helps with straightening her hair, even if she doesn&#x27;t flat iron it, by drying it with this she can get it straight enough to comb through, which is no easy feat for her, since it usually takes 4-6 hours to flat iron it.</li>
            <li> Some have brushes that fall off, some brushes are way too soft, and some of the dryers die after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I like the wide air flow feature.</li>
            <li> My old dryer started emitting scary smells</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for xmas and it is already dead.  </li>
            <li> Went dead IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            <li> USELESS.</li>

            <li> good air flow and a good firm brush</li>
            <li> It was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Quieter and not as hot as most hairdryers of this style.  I like it very much at the present time, but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  The only thing is, it shuts off too quickly when it reaches a certain temperature.  This is for protection, I know, but it doesn&#x27;t seem very hot when it shuts off.  Maybe the shut-off temperature is set too low.</li>
            <li> The dryer is a bit cumbersome but it gets the job done.  Love how it leaves the hair straight like you did it in the salon. I rate this product with a happy smile</li>
            <li> received it broken.never worked.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured &amp; described</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter who loves it.  Really helps with straightening her hair, even if she doesn&#x27;t flat iron it, by drying it with this she can get it straight enough to comb through, which is no easy feat for her, since it usually takes 4-6 hours to flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer in February 2012.  Today I am back for a second one.  It lasted almost 21/2 years.  My hair is very frizzy, and this blow dryer gives it a smoother flow.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> My old dryer started emitting scary smells so it was time for it to go. This was a good replacement. I like the wide air flow feature. It covers more drying area and at 275 watts less than my old dryer, is less damaging to my hair. I don&#x27;t have much of an opinion on the attachments. My hair type is not conducive to these attachments so I don&#x27;t use them. They did fit well on the dryer and stayed on well during use when I did attempt to use them.</li>
            <li> Very good dryer for the price.  Tools and settings are nice. Hair drys quickly and evenly. Would recommend this dryer</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I needed so I got my trusty FHI brand of blow dryer instead</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for xmas and it is already dead.  I a lot of money for a product that lasted 3 weeks.  Stay away...</li>
            <li> Do not buy, It appears that the manufacture near answers their phone</li>
            <li> Love this dryer!  I always wear out the dryer before the brush wears out.  The bristles in the brush are nice and stiff, the dryer is light, it&#x27;s just a great dryer.  You can&#x27;t beat the price, I have paid twice as much for a dryer and have it not last as long. Some have brushes that fall off, some brushes are way too soft, and some of the dryers die after just a few uses.  I always keep a spare!</li>
            <li> Went dead IMMEDIATELY. Can not handle African American/Black hair. USELESS.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best comb dryer that I have tried.  Due to the texture of my hair, this type of hair dryer works the best for me.  I have tried several different models/makes.....I like this one a lot.</li>
