            <li>Love it this is my signature scent have been using it for years</li>
            <li>This is among my favorite men&#x27;s cologne fragrances.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Hello, yes I recieved my order of Aspen cologne 4 oz spray, I have been useing this product for many years, and</li>
            <li>It is truly everything and more.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in two days and I am totally satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>One of the many that I buy often.</li>
            <li>Love the price and smell.</li>
            <li>Enjoy FOLKS</li>
            <li>Fantastic.... used if for years...</li>
            <li>If it is available in the 4 oz bottles now, let me know.</li>
            <li>was quick service I like aspen</li>
            <li>Well worth the affordable price.</li>
            <li>Smells great but not long lasting.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t want to pay twice as much for a leading similar fragrance, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It smells good for half the day before it starts to fade away.</li>
            <li>And it can be had for a very reasonable number of dollar bills.</li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>Otherwise send me ( 2 ) more bottles of the 4 oz cologne spray, and charge it to my same credit card.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of when we first met...</li>
            <li>Clean, masculine, and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much.</li>
            <li>I am very particular about my colognes and this one really exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li>A bit strong at first but lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s not the trendiest scent, but I really like it on him.</li>
            <li>Very outdoors smelling.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells at a very reasonible price, compared to retail stores.</li>
            <li>Only downside to the cologne is the scent seems to fade quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s masculine, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>but this doesn&#x27;t quite smell like the Aspen I used in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The only difference is, I like the AFTER SHAVE LOTION better, but I guess it&#x27;s not available in the 4 oz bottles, so they tell me.</li>
            <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s and don&#x27;t generally gravitate to the fancy aromas advertised to the stud bare-chested young men.</li>
            <li>I do admit I have to apply several more sprays than I do with Green Irish Tweed, but unlike Coolwater the dry down is fresh.</li>
            <li>My man loves it... Brings back old memories.</li>
            <li>If you love the clean smell of outdoors, woods and mountains, and don&#x27;t like sickening sweet or overbearing colognes, Aspen remains a hidden gem.</li>
            <li>I actually think this smells more like Green Irish Tweed than Coolwater, which in my opinion smells too synthetic (without the longevity of Green Irish Tweed).</li>

            <li> This is my husbands favorite cologne. It smells good for half the day before it starts to fade away.</li>
            <li> Smells great but not long lasting. You get what you pay for when buying scents. Nice bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> Love it this is my signature scent have been using it for years and you can&#x27;t beat the price thumbs-up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since my youth and it lasts a long time. I know some cologne will go bad fast if you don&#x27;t use them up.</li>
            <li> My man loves it... Brings back old memories. It smells really good then and now!</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and don&#x27;t generally gravitate to the fancy aromas advertised to the stud bare-chested young men. This is among my favorite men&#x27;s cologne fragrances. And it can be had for a very reasonable number of dollar bills. Who needs to spend $70 for those hard-sell fancy-named colognes when this fits the need. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I actually think this smells more like Green Irish Tweed than Coolwater, which in my opinion smells too synthetic (without the longevity of Green Irish Tweed). I do admit I have to apply several more sprays than I do with Green Irish Tweed, but unlike Coolwater the dry down is fresh.</li>
            <li> Got this for hubby. He loves the smell. It&#x27;s good favorite cologne. I can say that I don&#x27;t hate the smell and will learn to like it as he wears it often.</li>
            <li> Ill keep wearing it as long as they make it! Nice smell... I get complements on it from time to time.</li>
            <li> was quick service I like aspen was a good price to</li>
            <li> Some have come along recently which are so similar, yet get rave reviews ... e.g., &amp;#34;koolwater&amp;#34; if you catch the drift. If you love the clean smell of outdoors, woods and mountains, and don&#x27;t like sickening sweet or overbearing colognes, Aspen remains a hidden gem. For those who don&#x27;t want to pay twice as much for a leading similar fragrance, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Clean, masculine, and long-lasting. I bought it for a friend of mine who loves the fragrance. It&#x27;s a classic, one of the best.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic! I like many colognes but this one for the price etc, beats many! Enjoy FOLKS you&#x27;re gonna smell so handsome &amp; sexy!</li>
            <li> Fantastic.... used if for years... sweetheart loves it...</li>
            <li> Hello, yes I recieved my order of Aspen cologne 4 oz spray, I have been useing this product for many years, and like it very much. The only difference is, I like the AFTER SHAVE LOTION better, but I guess it&#x27;s not available in the 4 oz bottles, so they tell me. If it is available in the 4 oz bottles now, let me know. Otherwise send me ( 2 ) more bottles of the 4 oz cologne spray, and charge it to my same credit card. My last order was, $11.71 plus s&amp;h, plus tax &#x3D; $18.75.  Thanks very much. Let me know.

            <li> My husband loves this stuff, and it&#x27;s so hard to find. Perhaps it&#x27;s not the trendiest scent, but I really like it on him. It&#x27;s masculine, but not overpowering.  Well worth the affordable price.</li>
            <li> Good cheap cologne for work (im outside a lot and around heavy machinery). Very outdoors smelling. A bit strong at first but lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Good cologne.Fast shipping. My brother loves it, it smells great.</li>
            <li> Normally double the cost at Walmart.  So a great buy if you like the scent.</li>
            <li> It is truly everything and more.  It arrived in two days and I am totally satisfied with the product. I am very particular about my colognes and this one really exceeds my expectations. I am now a life-time customer. Great Job!</li>
            <li> Maybe my nose is changing with age but this doesn&#x27;t quite smell like the Aspen I used in the early 90&#x27;s. It&#x27;s still good though.</li>
            <li> I buy this at my Aunt&#x27;s request she loves it and uses a lot of it so she keeps me reordering it.</li>
            <li> A long time like of mine</li>
            <li> Coty Aspen Cologne is a really good spray cologne. One of the many that I buy often. And I would recommend to those men who are looking for a good cologne product.</li>
            <li> Love the price and smell. Will continue to buy it...</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s what the woman in my life says, she attacks me when I wear this stuff.  I luv it.</li>
            <li> Always loved this scent and gifted it- prefect!!</li>
            <li> Always loved the smell of Aspen.  Amazon sells at a very reasonible price, compared to retail stores. Only downside to the cologne is the scent seems to fade quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby. Reminds me of when we first met...</li>
