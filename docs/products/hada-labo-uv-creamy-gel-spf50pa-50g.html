            <li>Awesome sunscreen.</li>
            <li>very good product at very good price.</li>
            <li>It doesnt feel sticky or greasy but is perfectly hydrating and great for wear under makeup.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m quite happy with this.  </li>
            <li>(I combine it with a silicon primer, also known as Monistat LOL and it makes the finish flawless)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great under makeup.  </li>
            <li>This one is great though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great consistency (rather runny)</li>
            <li>Great consistency, no whitecast, no sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love this Creamy Gel, perfect for oily skin!</li>
            <li>It has good UVA protection (I apply about 1/4 tsp to my face and haven&#x27;t tanned).</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>If you have brown skin this is good for you.</li>
            <li>I gave it as a gifts to friends and they absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging, does not look cheap and price is awesome.</li>
            <li>Goes on very light and has a great UV protection</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li>My favorite!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>my favorite sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but it does make an amazing primer.</li>
            <li>and I must say it did a nice job protecting my face.  </li>
            <li>I liked it a lot</li>
            <li>, you get a nice, soft/slightly dewy look.</li>
            <li>It takes about 20 minutes to fully sink in but it feels nice my skin</li>
            <li>It works very well and is perfect for humid weather.</li>
            <li>That being said, this is still a great product that absorbs better than most and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>I do think, however, that the coverage is excellent and while the initial smell isn&#x27;t pleasant, it goes away almost immediately and is odorless throughout the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if your skin doesn&#x27;t mind alcohol in products, and you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight sunscreen with excellent sun protection and a good price, then I would definitely recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li>Incredible price and a fast ship.</li>
            <li>I actually liked using this on my neck better because the alcohol did not irritate my neck.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>this one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>Creamy consistency, excellent sun protection, great under makeup, not a strong smell, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts</li>
            <li>Very light, lotion-y sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>The lotion is fairly watery, and doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as I would like.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff to death.</li>
            <li>I think this is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts for me, even though my skin does not agree with most products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Hypoallergenic and didn&#x27;t cause any rashes like most cream sunscreens do to me.</li>
            <li>And I love that it has PA+++.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to my girlfriends and they all love it.</li>
            <li>I would have given it more stars if it wasn&#x27;t so drying on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The texture/moisture is great for my combination skin (oily on the t-zone, normal everywhere else).</li>
            <li>Looks pretty good under my powder makeup</li>
            <li>Love how light weight and non greasy</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is great, it&#x27;s clear and watery but still moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Others may enjoy the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; finish of the lotion, but I like something more matte for under my makeup.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m quite happy with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>love how light the cream is</li>
            <li>Great sun protection, almost no smell, good for sensitive skin, and such a nice texture that if I use this, I don&#x27;t need makeup primer.</li>
            <li>Hada Labo UV Creamy Gel is a little heartbreaking for me, because in many ways, it is a perfect SPF.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this sunscreen has worked great for me!</li>
            <li>They are both excellent products, but I slightly prefer the Sheisedo, which absorbs more quickly and leaves a more satiny finish.</li>
            <li>With 4 pa pluses this is a great sunscreen (most sunscreen I encountered only have 3).  </li>
            <li>-Easy removal.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels pretty nice with it on.</li>
            <li>but I want slightly better and more protection on hot days.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, non-sticky, applies easily, absorbs quickly, light scent for a sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>Light and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and keeps my skin protected.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy how light it is.</li>
            <li>This one comes out watery but goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, it goes on smoothly with no residue or irritation.  </li>
            <li>I switched over to this gem of a sunscreen after wearing Olay Sensitive SPF 15 (loved that</li>
            <li>It goes on quickly and was quite effective with preventing me from tanning on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>their other products, this cream is very good.  </li>
            <li>This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve been able to use without getting clogs.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found the holy grail, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>My package actually says PA++++, which is one more + than listed in the title, so that&#x27;s even better!  </li>
            <li>Super lightweight and so light on the dkin</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and that it&#x27;s giving my skin the intense protection it needs.  </li>
            <li>I have literally dozens in my house, mineral sunscreen, the fancy organic all natural kind, sunscreens that cost lots...</li>
            <li>It even works as a decent primer if you put makeup on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The formula is rather liquidy and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>The only sunscreen that won&#x27;t break me out and perfect for daily wear.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super shiny</li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is very lightweight and is absorbed into skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that breaks out or gets clogged very easily by most products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of watery consistency, so it blends quite well into the skin without turning your face white, or in my case, gray.  </li>
            <li>(so many sunblocks can give the skin a white cast) but I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the tightness in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Ugh this looks super shiny and I liked it at first, but I noticed my skin redness flaring up big time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, soaks in well, does not leave a flim on skin and has a high SPF.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>/&gt;-1 star because the product leaves my skin a bit shiny, which shouldn&#x27;t be a concern, however, if makeup is going on top or if the user has generally drier skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing that&#x27;s kind of a drawback is that it takes about 20 minutes or so to sink in, and until then my face is really shiny.</li>
            <li>This would be good for people with normal dry skin I guess.</li>
            <li>The only time I&#x27;ve gotten burned  this summer was waiting in a concert line for 9 hours, but it was very light.</li>
            <li>It has a milky texture that is pretty watery.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my review of the product if you&#x27;re interested: http://www.amazon.com/review/R19Z6RA29HFGP7/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00IG12XLO&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smell like most suncreens (it has an alcohol smell actually, but it disappears</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed by how it looks when you first put it on</li>
            <li>but in a short time it dries with a matte finish that I love.</li>
            <li>This is the first AB sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I used it under make up (BB cream) and it melds with the bb cream pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I have fair dry sensitive skin and this does not irritate me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of thin and easy to work in.</li>
            <li>The price was also pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of sunscreens and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for one that doesn&#x27;t have that quintessential sunscreen scent or leaves a white cast on your face.  </li>
            <li>Texture is very lightweight and goes well under makeup.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very silky, and plays well with makeup.</li>
            <li>Light, basic SPF protection that goes on well over my AM skincare.</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and its a shame its being discontinued.</li>
            <li>but after a while, I started to really notice the alcohol in this sunscreen(you</li>
            <li>really because I could not stand the smell or texture of wearing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it absorbs fast into the skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy, I don&#x27;t see a gray cast in pictures, and doesn&#x27;t really seem to change my oil production.</li>
            <li>but I really like the consistency.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it has caused any break outs because I already had some pimples before I started using it, but I&#x27;ll update if I notice any changes.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a really nice sunscreen, especially for your neck area.</li>
            <li>This product would be great for someone with dry skin - it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
            <li>only con that bothers me is that it has a bit of an alcohol scent upon application, although that disappears pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>greasy feeling like most other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably more due to my finicky skin than this product, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s relatively cheap for such a high quality sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The packaging is smaller than typical american products (which is nice for traveling or carrying in a purse, but you will have to purchase it more often).</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>It does have some alcohol which makes the finish beautiful but can be a bit drying or irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using Hada Labo products consistently when living in Asia, so was surprised to see them on</li>
            <li>so I needed something that offered full protection without leaving a white caste.</li>
            <li>Previously using Shiseido sunscreen for many years.</li>
            <li>Lol...I find myself doing a double layer on my face just to make sure it&#x27;s covered with enough sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently, so make sure you test it out before using it daily.</li>
            <li>decent product</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and without any greasy film or white cast at all, but it takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched long and hard for the perfect daily sunscreen and this is it!</li>
            <li>-High</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- high protection factor</li>
            <li>I usually turn bright red.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>So far i really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had issues with acne in a few years after making some changes to my diet and using appropriate skin care products, but after I started using this</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it seems better suited for dry skin than normal-oily skin</li>
            <li>Overall, a great sunscreen that I am on the 3rd bottle of (wish they came in a bigger size, but it does last pretty long).</li>
            <li>A light and slightly liquidy sunblock, with a high alcohol content.  </li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>sinks in really quickly and has prevented me for tanning or burning even though i didn&#x27;t reapply like i was supposed to.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my favorite sunscreen for daily wear, hands down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy, light and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin nor leave a white cast.</li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the infamous &amp;#34;white cast&amp;#34;  of many sunscreen products.</li>
            <li>I love that it leaves no white cast, sinks in quickly, and dries matte after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It has a clear creamy consistency from  the tube.</li>
            <li>it dries to a clear finish</li>
            <li>This is the first sunscreen in a long time I&#x27;ve purchased that didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no fragrance and hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my review of this product after completely using it up.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re sensitive to alcohol, in which case you should probably avoid this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far</li>
            <li>However, for everyday, it&#x27;s as light as moisturizer</li>
            <li>It works very well with the same brand of moisturizer that i used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t suitable for my skin in the end, because I immediately noticed that my skin was a little dry after use.</li>
            <li>Luckily, its replacement only has a single ingredient difference.</li>
            <li>Unlike most facial sunscreens i&#x27;ve tried, this doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy and actually leaves my face really soft!</li>
            <li>Even when I wasn&#x27;t wearing the sunscreen, my skin was always dry, tight, and tingly, and was more breakout prone.</li>
            <li>It has a faint scent while wet; it kind of reminds me of a marker (it probably has alcohol in it as a solvent so that it dries quickly).</li>
            <li>Years ago, s blogger recommended that I try Asian sunscreens because they were better and wouldn&#x27;t make me look like an oil slick.</li>
            <li>It goes on white at first and the white cast goes away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, and the bottle is small enough to tuck into a pocket or bag, so that you can easily reply throughout the day as needed.</li>
            <li>It provides amazing sun protection, due to the mix of chemical and physical sun filters, and it completely absorbs into the skin, leaving behind no white cast and a lovely, slightly dewy finish on the face.</li>
            <li>I normally go through one bottle each month, and it wasn&#x27;t a big financial burden to keep repurchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this SPF, it also moisturizes and has very little alcohol compared to other brands</li>
            <li>is not as much as I have seen in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the only possible problem for some sensitive skinned people would be the alcohol, but for me it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li>There is no white cast like with my old Neutrogena spf, so that&#x27;s a definite bonus.</li>
            <li>No dry or chalky finish with this.  </li>
            <li>For those of you who have dry to normal skin, this sunscreen will leave enough moisture on your face without making it look too shiny or dewy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that I can attribute it to stress (I&#x27;m a grad student, so I&#x27;m just generally stressed), hormonal changes, or age (I&#x27;m in my mid 20s)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days at this point and will update this review if I learn anything different but so far I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Goes on completely invisible, not a single bit on white cast and absolutely NO</li>
    </ol>

            <li> That being said, this is still a great product that absorbs better than most and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I do think, however, that the coverage is excellent and while the initial smell isn&#x27;t pleasant, it goes away almost immediately and is odorless throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if your skin doesn&#x27;t mind alcohol in products, and you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight sunscreen with excellent sun protection and a good price, then I would definitely recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> Incredible price and a fast ship.</li>
            <li> I actually liked using this on my neck better because the alcohol did not irritate my neck.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> this one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li> Creamy consistency, excellent sun protection, great under makeup, not a strong smell, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts</li>
            <li> Very light, lotion-y sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> The lotion is fairly watery, and doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as I would like.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff to death.</li>
            <li> I think this is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts for me, even though my skin does not agree with most products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Hypoallergenic and didn&#x27;t cause any rashes like most cream sunscreens do to me.</li>
            <li> And I love that it has PA+++.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to my girlfriends and they all love it.</li>
            <li> I would have given it more stars if it wasn&#x27;t so drying on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The texture/moisture is great for my combination skin (oily on the t-zone, normal everywhere else).</li>
            <li> Looks pretty good under my powder makeup</li>
            <li> Love how light weight and non greasy</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great, it&#x27;s clear and watery but still moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Others may enjoy the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; finish of the lotion, but I like something more matte for under my makeup.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m quite happy with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> love how light the cream is</li>
            <li> Great sun protection, almost no smell, good for sensitive skin, and such a nice texture that if I use this, I don&#x27;t need makeup primer.</li>
            <li> Hada Labo UV Creamy Gel is a little heartbreaking for me, because in many ways, it is a perfect SPF.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this sunscreen has worked great for me!</li>
            <li> They are both excellent products, but I slightly prefer the Sheisedo, which absorbs more quickly and leaves a more satiny finish.</li>
            <li> With 4 pa pluses this is a great sunscreen (most sunscreen I encountered only have 3).  </li>
            <li> -Easy removal.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels pretty nice with it on.</li>
            <li> but I want slightly better and more protection on hot days.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, non-sticky, applies easily, absorbs quickly, light scent for a sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> Light and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and keeps my skin protected.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how light it is.</li>
            <li> This one comes out watery but goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it goes on smoothly with no residue or irritation.  </li>
            <li> I switched over to this gem of a sunscreen after wearing Olay Sensitive SPF 15 (loved that</li>
            <li> It goes on quickly and was quite effective with preventing me from tanning on a hot day.  </li>
            <li> their other products, this cream is very good.  </li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve been able to use without getting clogs.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found the holy grail, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My package actually says PA++++, which is one more + than listed in the title, so that&#x27;s even better!  </li>
            <li> Super lightweight and so light on the dkin</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and that it&#x27;s giving my skin the intense protection it needs.  </li>
            <li> I have literally dozens in my house, mineral sunscreen, the fancy organic all natural kind, sunscreens that cost lots...</li>
            <li> It even works as a decent primer if you put makeup on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The formula is rather liquidy and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> The only sunscreen that won&#x27;t break me out and perfect for daily wear.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super shiny</li>
            <li> It also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very lightweight and is absorbed into skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that breaks out or gets clogged very easily by most products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of watery consistency, so it blends quite well into the skin without turning your face white, or in my case, gray.  </li>
            <li> (so many sunblocks can give the skin a white cast) but I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the tightness in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Ugh this looks super shiny and I liked it at first, but I noticed my skin redness flaring up big time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, soaks in well, does not leave a flim on skin and has a high SPF.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> /&gt;-1 star because the product leaves my skin a bit shiny, which shouldn&#x27;t be a concern, however, if makeup is going on top or if the user has generally drier skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s kind of a drawback is that it takes about 20 minutes or so to sink in, and until then my face is really shiny.</li>
            <li> This would be good for people with normal dry skin I guess.</li>
            <li> The only time I&#x27;ve gotten burned  this summer was waiting in a concert line for 9 hours, but it was very light.</li>
            <li> It has a milky texture that is pretty watery.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my review of the product if you&#x27;re interested: http://www.amazon.com/review/R19Z6RA29HFGP7/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00IG12XLO&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like most suncreens (it has an alcohol smell actually, but it disappears</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed by how it looks when you first put it on</li>
            <li> but in a short time it dries with a matte finish that I love.</li>
            <li> This is the first AB sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I used it under make up (BB cream) and it melds with the bb cream pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I have fair dry sensitive skin and this does not irritate me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of thin and easy to work in.</li>
            <li> The price was also pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of sunscreens and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for one that doesn&#x27;t have that quintessential sunscreen scent or leaves a white cast on your face.  </li>
            <li> Texture is very lightweight and goes well under makeup.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very silky, and plays well with makeup.</li>
            <li> Light, basic SPF protection that goes on well over my AM skincare.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and its a shame its being discontinued.</li>
            <li> but after a while, I started to really notice the alcohol in this sunscreen(you</li>
            <li> really because I could not stand the smell or texture of wearing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it absorbs fast into the skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy, I don&#x27;t see a gray cast in pictures, and doesn&#x27;t really seem to change my oil production.</li>
            <li> but I really like the consistency.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if it has caused any break outs because I already had some pimples before I started using it, but I&#x27;ll update if I notice any changes.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a really nice sunscreen, especially for your neck area.</li>
            <li> This product would be great for someone with dry skin - it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
            <li> only con that bothers me is that it has a bit of an alcohol scent upon application, although that disappears pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> greasy feeling like most other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably more due to my finicky skin than this product, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s relatively cheap for such a high quality sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The packaging is smaller than typical american products (which is nice for traveling or carrying in a purse, but you will have to purchase it more often).</li>
            <li> It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> It does have some alcohol which makes the finish beautiful but can be a bit drying or irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hada Labo products consistently when living in Asia, so was surprised to see them on</li>
            <li> so I needed something that offered full protection without leaving a white caste.</li>
            <li> Previously using Shiseido sunscreen for many years.</li>
            <li> Lol...I find myself doing a double layer on my face just to make sure it&#x27;s covered with enough sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently, so make sure you test it out before using it daily.</li>
            <li> decent product</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and without any greasy film or white cast at all, but it takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched long and hard for the perfect daily sunscreen and this is it!</li>
            <li> -High</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- high protection factor</li>
            <li> I usually turn bright red.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> So far i really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had issues with acne in a few years after making some changes to my diet and using appropriate skin care products, but after I started using this</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it seems better suited for dry skin than normal-oily skin</li>
            <li> Overall, a great sunscreen that I am on the 3rd bottle of (wish they came in a bigger size, but it does last pretty long).</li>
            <li> A light and slightly liquidy sunblock, with a high alcohol content.  </li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> sinks in really quickly and has prevented me for tanning or burning even though i didn&#x27;t reapply like i was supposed to.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favorite sunscreen for daily wear, hands down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy, light and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin nor leave a white cast.</li>
            <li> It does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the infamous &amp;#34;white cast&amp;#34;  of many sunscreen products.</li>
            <li> I love that it leaves no white cast, sinks in quickly, and dries matte after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It has a clear creamy consistency from  the tube.</li>
            <li> it dries to a clear finish</li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen in a long time I&#x27;ve purchased that didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no fragrance and hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my review of this product after completely using it up.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re sensitive to alcohol, in which case you should probably avoid this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far</li>
            <li> However, for everyday, it&#x27;s as light as moisturizer</li>
            <li> It works very well with the same brand of moisturizer that i used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t suitable for my skin in the end, because I immediately noticed that my skin was a little dry after use.</li>
            <li> Luckily, its replacement only has a single ingredient difference.</li>
            <li> Unlike most facial sunscreens i&#x27;ve tried, this doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy and actually leaves my face really soft!</li>
            <li> Even when I wasn&#x27;t wearing the sunscreen, my skin was always dry, tight, and tingly, and was more breakout prone.</li>
            <li> It has a faint scent while wet; it kind of reminds me of a marker (it probably has alcohol in it as a solvent so that it dries quickly).</li>
            <li> Years ago, s blogger recommended that I try Asian sunscreens because they were better and wouldn&#x27;t make me look like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> It goes on white at first and the white cast goes away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, and the bottle is small enough to tuck into a pocket or bag, so that you can easily reply throughout the day as needed.</li>
            <li> It provides amazing sun protection, due to the mix of chemical and physical sun filters, and it completely absorbs into the skin, leaving behind no white cast and a lovely, slightly dewy finish on the face.</li>
            <li> I normally go through one bottle each month, and it wasn&#x27;t a big financial burden to keep repurchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this SPF, it also moisturizes and has very little alcohol compared to other brands</li>
            <li> is not as much as I have seen in other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the only possible problem for some sensitive skinned people would be the alcohol, but for me it&#x27;s not an issue.</li>
            <li> There is no white cast like with my old Neutrogena spf, so that&#x27;s a definite bonus.</li>
            <li> No dry or chalky finish with this.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who have dry to normal skin, this sunscreen will leave enough moisture on your face without making it look too shiny or dewy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that I can attribute it to stress (I&#x27;m a grad student, so I&#x27;m just generally stressed), hormonal changes, or age (I&#x27;m in my mid 20s)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days at this point and will update this review if I learn anything different but so far I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Goes on completely invisible, not a single bit on white cast and absolutely NO</li>
            <li> Sadly caused me to break out a little but the formula was fantastic and soaked right in.</li>
            <li> It has a thin, runny, but kind of slick and &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is really an spf 50 as I can&#x27;t read the ingredients</li>
            <li> In the past I have always avoided wearing sunscreen not because I didn&#x27;t care too much about skin health, but</li>
            <li> However, it definitely kept me from getting sunburnt during a long day at the beach.</li>
            <li> Has 3 different forms of hyaluronic acid that acts to moisturize my dry skin&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> By my calculations, if you apply the proper amount (2mg per cm^2 of skin), one tube of this will last about a month and a half of daily application to the face only.</li>
            <li> The problem is that I&#x27;ve been using this for a little more than a week and believe that it may be irritating the somewhat sensitive/acne prone characteristic of my skin.</li>
            <li> Compared to multiple other sunscreens I use (including Elta MD and other high quality brands) it seems to have less of a drying effect on facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this for as long as it is sold.</li>
            <li> I normally apply Paula&#x27;s Choice Shine Stopper over my usual SPF</li>
            <li> It is not too thick and sticky or too greasy and does not take too much to rub in.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin even further like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> and I think that if you have dry skin, this sunscreen would be holy grail status.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat dry skin</li>
            <li> (I have somewhat dry skin)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li> Loaded with expensive H Acid which really makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and haven&#x27;t suffered any major side effects or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting and although it comes out the tube sort of thick, a little goes a long way and it spreads evenly and sinks right in.  </li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t put on extra moisturizer before putting on this sunscreen, my face felt quite tight and dry.</li>
            <li> However, once it sinks in(which doesn&#x27;t take very long)</li>
            <li> It has a faint scent, but it goes away fairly quickly after application.</li>
            <li> : -When you initially put it on, it does make your face shine just a little bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, but I&#x27;m glad to see that it worked for others.</li>
            <li> It settles matte, which can feel a bit heavy and the amount of product is in the actual container</li>
            <li> No white cast observed on face after the product has dried.  </li>
            <li> I have had several small blemishes pop up around my face (with a small red dot currently on the tip of my nose).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE sunscreen of any kind.  </li>
            <li> This is less drying than Shishiedo&#x27;s Anesso brand , for those of you with dry skin</li>
            <li> But other than that, the product never broke me out</li>
            <li> To me this sunscreen was not exactly moisturising, but not drying either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest a heavier duty sunscreen for extreme exposure.</li>
            <li> Also, compared to other mineral based sunscreens it does not leave me with premature &amp;#34;grey beard&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Before I had to use a moisturizer under my bb cream since my skin tends to be a little dry.</li>
            <li> I hate suncreens, but I absolutely love this one.</li>
            <li> Now, I can&#x27;t use any other sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, it doesn&#x27;t have an annoying white cast or greasy feel, it&#x27;s slightly moisturizing, and it&#x27;s SPF50 and PA++++.</li>
            <li> I have noticed some slight dryness on my skin, but it is winter</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also comes with wrinkle protection that is typical of Asian/European brands.</li>
            <li> It has less viscosity than I&#x27;m accustomed to (which may aid in the absorption).</li>
            <li> It goes on silky and has little to no scent.</li>
            <li> It feels slightly heavy but not as heavy as using Coppertone/Banana Boat  sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> that when applied, does not feel greasy or heavy on the skin&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film behind like a lot of sunscreen does.</li>
            <li> This is cheaper and less chalky!</li>
            <li> Lower that to  a month or half a month if you have to reapply (I don&#x27;t need to since I&#x27;m usually in class) or are also applying it to your neck or hands</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the PA++++ version, and for people looking for a moisturizing but light-feeling, dewy finish sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave any unpleasant white residue, this is the stuff.</li>
            <li> a little greasy, not very good</li>
            <li> I wanted to stick with the product and tried using different moisturizers and facial mists to keep my skin from drying out, but after nine months of using the UV Creamy Gel, my skin was in bad shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly small</li>
            <li> and then translucent powder over that, and usually can rely on 6-7 hours of a shine-free face.  </li>
            <li> After washing my face in the morning, I apply my usual moisturizer and then after that dries I apply this then after it dries I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> However not good for acne prone skin, it gave me cystic acne until I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Just not great for day-to-day under makeup.</li>
            <li> I tried a ton of them, some from very expensive brands, and I was never completely satisfied with one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think this product is going to work for me.</li>
            <li> Its a shame however that is has alcohol but as the fifth ingredients, that isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> Hated the fact that it took over TWO months to receive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Texture is very lightweight and goes well under makeup. However not good for acne prone skin, it gave me cystic acne until I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is the bomb diggity. It absorbs quickly, it doesn&#x27;t have an annoying white cast or greasy feel, it&#x27;s slightly moisturizing, and it&#x27;s SPF50 and PA++++. Perhaps the only possible problem for some sensitive skinned people would be the alcohol, but for me it&#x27;s not an issue. Also, it&#x27;s relatively cheap for such a high quality sunscreen. I love this stuff to death.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen! It&#x27;s creamy, light and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin nor leave a white cast. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and it is not breaking my face out. Of course what doesn&#x27;t break me out can break you out (YMMV) depending on your skin sensitivity. I use a different sunscreen when I need waterproof (when it&#x27;s raining, or go to beach, etc) but otherwise I use this sunscreen and we buy again. It&#x27;s fairly small so I use it for the face only.</li>
            <li> I think this is my favorite sunscreen. It does have some alcohol which makes the finish beautiful but can be a bit drying or irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first sunscreen in a long time I&#x27;ve purchased that didn&#x27;t break me out. Gentle on the skin, absorbs nicely. It makes my skin feel very silky, and plays well with makeup. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Light, basic SPF protection that goes on well over my AM skincare.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it seems better suited for dry skin than normal-oily skin (like I have). It settles matte, which can feel a bit heavy and the amount of product is in the actual container is not as much as I have seen in other sunscreens. But other than that, the product never broke me out and I think that if you have dry skin, this sunscreen would be holy grail status.</li>
            <li> I love this SPF, it also moisturizes and has very little alcohol compared to other brands</li>
            <li> Love how light weight and non greasy this is. Hated the fact that it took over TWO months to receive.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that breaks out or gets clogged very easily by most products.  This is the first sunscreen I&#x27;ve been able to use without getting clogs.</li>
            <li> Super lightweight and so light on the dkin I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s working! Lol...I find myself doing a double layer on my face just to make sure it&#x27;s covered with enough sunscreen! This is less drying than Shishiedo&#x27;s Anesso brand , for those of you with dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is really an spf 50 as I can&#x27;t read the ingredients but it does make an amazing primer. Loaded with expensive H Acid which really makes my skin soft. Incredible price and a fast ship.</li>
            <li> Creamy consistency, excellent sun protection, great under makeup, not a strong smell, didn&#x27;t cause breakouts</li>
            <li> I got this by accident.  I ordered the UV Whitening one instead, so I won&#x27;t be a &amp;#34;verified buyer&amp;#34;.  But I&#x27;m quite happy with this.  It&#x27;s kind of watery consistency, so it blends quite well into the skin without turning your face white, or in my case, gray.  I went to the beach with this and I must say it did a nice job protecting my face.  There&#x27;s no fragrance and hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> With 4 pa pluses this is a great sunscreen (most sunscreen I encountered only have 3).  Does have a shine if not wearing any makeup over it.  No white cast observed on face after the product has dried.  Nice packaging, does not look cheap and price is awesome.</li>
            <li> Very light, lotion-y sunscreen. Blends evenly into skin. I have somewhat dry skin so I always like moisturizing products. It&#x27;s not greasy but, like all sunscreens, will add an extra layer on skin. Previously using Shiseido sunscreen for many years. This is cheaper and less chalky!</li>
            <li> Arrived by 10:30 am 7 days after I placed my order. I didn&#x27;t wear makeup to work because I hoped my sunscreen would be here by today.Put it on as soon as I got it from the front desk. Goes on completely invisible, not a single bit on white cast and absolutely NO greasy feeling like most other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. I think I&#x27;ve found the holy grail, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> a little greasy, not very good</li>
            <li> My favorite! It works so well under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisture all day. No shine.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to sunscreen product!  I&#x27;m a huge fan of sunscreens and I&#x27;m always on the hunt for one that doesn&#x27;t have that quintessential sunscreen scent or leaves a white cast on your face.  The texture is creamy to begin with, but when you rub it against your face, it gets watery and literally melts onto your skin.  For those of you who have dry to normal skin, this sunscreen will leave enough moisture on your face without making it look too shiny or dewy. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and haven&#x27;t suffered any major side effects or breakouts.  Everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently, so make sure you test it out before using it daily.</li>
            <li> Hada Labo UV Creamy Gel is a little heartbreaking for me, because in many ways, it is a perfect SPF. It provides amazing sun protection, due to the mix of chemical and physical sun filters, and it completely absorbs into the skin, leaving behind no white cast and a lovely, slightly dewy finish on the face. It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, and the bottle is small enough to tuck into a pocket or bag, so that you can easily reply throughout the day as needed. The price was also pretty decent. I normally go through one bottle each month, and it wasn&#x27;t a big financial burden to keep repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts for me, even though my skin does not agree with most products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it wasn&#x27;t suitable for my skin in the end, because I immediately noticed that my skin was a little dry after use. I wanted to stick with the product and tried using different moisturizers and facial mists to keep my skin from drying out, but after nine months of using the UV Creamy Gel, my skin was in bad shape. Even when I wasn&#x27;t wearing the sunscreen, my skin was always dry, tight, and tingly, and was more breakout prone. After quitting the product, these symptoms went away, so that was that. Curtains for Hada Labo UV Creamy Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if your skin doesn&#x27;t mind alcohol in products, and you&#x27;re looking for a lightweight sunscreen with excellent sun protection and a good price, then I would definitely recommend giving this a try!</li>
            <li> Great sun protection, almost no smell, good for sensitive skin, and such a nice texture that if I use this, I don&#x27;t need makeup primer. This is absolutely my favorite sunscreen for daily wear, hands down.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very lightweight and is absorbed into skin very quickly. I have noticed some slight dryness on my skin, but it is winter and I have very sensitive skin so it may be unrelated.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hada Labo products consistently when living in Asia, so was surprised to see them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It took a while to arrive, but I understand it came from Japan, so I did not have a problem with waiting.  The price is also comparable to what I was paying in Asia .&lt;br /&gt;As their other products, this cream is very good.  It&#x27;s light, soaks in well, does not leave a flim on skin and has a high SPF.&lt;br /&gt;But as always the case with cosmetics - just because it suits my skin, it may not suit someone else&#x27;s. It is a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten sunburnt with this on, even when I&#x27;m in the water. This is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and I can layer it underneath my makeup!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever. It is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have that sunblock smell. It also plays well under make up and can be used both as a sunblock and a primer.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice sunscreen. It has a milky texture that is pretty watery. I love that it leaves no white cast, sinks in quickly, and dries matte after a few minutes. While the link says its PA+++, the bottle says PA++++ which is the highest UVA rating we can currently label. Its a shame however that is has alcohol but as the fifth ingredients, that isn&#x27;t so bad. I really like this product and its a shame its being discontinued. Luckily, its replacement only has a single ingredient difference.</li>
            <li> very good product at very good price.</li>
            <li> This is a Japanese sunscreen which has both UVA &amp; UVB protections which are indicated in the SPF 50 &amp; PA+++ rating on the label.  It has a clear creamy consistency from  the tube. It does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the infamous &amp;#34;white cast&amp;#34;  of many sunscreen products. No film after rubbing onto the skin. It feels slightly heavy but not as heavy as using Coppertone/Banana Boat  sunscreens.  I wish that the products was larger and  was waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent product but I want slightly better and more protection on hot days.</li>
            <li> theres a lot of alcohol in this product. If you are looking for sunscreen without alcohol look elsewhere</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my review of this product after completely using it up. I liked it a lot and here&#x27;s why: -When you initially put it on, it does make your face shine just a little bit. However, once it sinks in(which doesn&#x27;t take very long), you get a nice, soft/slightly dewy look. -High UV protection. SPF 50+, PA++++(a Japanese equivalent of PPD16+) -Easy removal. Just use a regular facial cleanser. No cleansing oil/makeup remover necessary. -Initially, I used this on my face.. but after a while, I started to really notice the alcohol in this sunscreen(you can smell it) so I used it on my neck. I actually liked using this on my neck better because the alcohol did not irritate my neck. It even provided a cooling sensation which was a bonus. To me this sunscreen was not exactly moisturising, but not drying either. (I have somewhat dry skin) -Speaking of which, this sunscreen did not stain my clothes (collars of my shirt, neck ring of my T-shirt, etc)  Overall, this is a really nice sunscreen, especially for your neck area. However, I will not rate it 5 stars because of some of the cons mentioned above. My favourite sunscreen is Shiseido senka aging care UV sunscreen (SPF50+, PA ++++). Here&#x27;s my review of the product if you&#x27;re interested: http://www.amazon.com/review/R19Z6RA29HFGP7/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00IG12XLO&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty</li>
            <li> In the past I have always avoided wearing sunscreen not because I didn&#x27;t care too much about skin health, but really because I could not stand the smell or texture of wearing sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this, I couldn&#x27;t believe it when it soaked into my skin with no smell, no white cast, and no stickiness. It even works as a decent primer if you put makeup on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also comes with wrinkle protection that is typical of Asian/European brands. I will be using this for as long as it is sold.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used yet. It&#x27;s photo stable and that&#x27;s a big deal to me. I can&#x27;t be reapplying constantly like the american sunscreens recommend. It takes about 20 minutes to fully sink in but it feels nice my skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> I switched over to this gem of a sunscreen after wearing Olay Sensitive SPF 15 (loved that but it was not enough SPF for me and sometimes left a white caste). Sun exposure eventually destroys your stores of collagen and elastin so I needed something that offered full protection without leaving a white caste. This sunscreen fits the bill in various ways:&lt;br /&gt;1) Gel, lotion-like consistency that when applied, does not feel greasy or heavy on the skin&lt;br /&gt;2) Has 3 different forms of hyaluronic acid that acts to moisturize my dry skin&lt;br /&gt;3) Has both UVA and UVB filters&lt;br /&gt;4) Looks pretty good under my powder makeup (I combine it with a silicon primer, also known as Monistat LOL and it makes the finish flawless)&lt;br /&gt;The only con that bothers me is that it has a bit of an alcohol scent upon application, although that disappears pretty quickly. Overall, a great sunscreen that I am on the 3rd bottle of (wish they came in a bigger size, but it does last pretty long).</li>
            <li> No white cast, not greasy, plays well with topicals and makeup.</li>
            <li> The lotion is not greasy at all. It works very well and is perfect for humid weather. I like that it works well as both a moisturizer and a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for this sunscreen.  It goes on like silk and contains hyaluronic acid.  No dry or chalky finish with this.  Works great under makeup.  I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I hate suncreens, but I absolutely love this one. I tried a ton of them, some from very expensive brands, and I was never completely satisfied with one. This one is great though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- high protection factor&lt;br /&gt;- great consistency (rather runny) and it absorbs fast into the skin&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t leave white residue&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t make the face look greasy&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t break me out&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t smell like most suncreens (it has an alcohol smell actually, but it disappears quickly)&lt;br /&gt;- affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- none</li>
            <li> Lightweight, non-sticky, applies easily, absorbs quickly, light scent for a sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;-1 star because the product leaves my skin a bit shiny, which shouldn&#x27;t be a concern, however, if makeup is going on top or if the user has generally drier skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Works well with my bb cream.</li>
            <li> They mislabeled this. It&#x27;s actually the PA++++ version, and for people looking for a moisturizing but light-feeling, dewy finish sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave any unpleasant white residue, this is the stuff. Unless you&#x27;re sensitive to alcohol, in which case you should probably avoid this.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great! It has good UVA protection (I apply about 1/4 tsp to my face and haven&#x27;t tanned). It has a thin, runny, but kind of slick and &amp;#34;buttery&amp;#34; consistency. It has a faint scent while wet; it kind of reminds me of a marker (it probably has alcohol in it as a solvent so that it dries quickly). It dries quickly and without any greasy film or white cast at all, but it takes a couple of minutes. It also plays well with makeup, without balling up or anything. Like most Asian and upper-tier sunscreens, this comes in a really tiny tube, so it&#x27;s a bit expensive. By my calculations, if you apply the proper amount (2mg per cm^2 of skin), one tube of this will last about a month and a half of daily application to the face only. Lower that to  a month or half a month if you have to reapply (I don&#x27;t need to since I&#x27;m usually in class) or are also applying it to your neck or hands (I just use my body sunscreen for that).</li>
            <li> I bought this off a recommendation from /r/skincareaddiction. I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and I absolutely love it. I have fair dry sensitive skin and this does not irritate me. It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin even further like other sunscreens. The formula is rather liquidy and absorbs really quickly. It&#x27;s also not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a white film behind like a lot of sunscreen does. It has a faint scent, but it goes away fairly quickly after application. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Light and smooth.  Perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen. I have tried a lot of them and this one is a keeper! It makes my skin so smooth and keeps my skin protected. Now, I can&#x27;t use any other sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Sadly caused me to break out a little but the formula was fantastic and soaked right in. Hypoallergenic and didn&#x27;t cause any rashes like most cream sunscreens do to me. 4 stars because it is still the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found and I can use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> The only sunscreen that won&#x27;t break me out and perfect for daily wear. The only time I&#x27;ve gotten burned  this summer was waiting in a concert line for 9 hours, but it was very light. I usually turn bright red. I&#x27;d suggest a heavier duty sunscreen for extreme exposure. However, for everyday, it&#x27;s as light as moisturizer and I forget I have it on.</li>
            <li> Good product. Strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think this product is going to work for me. The texture/moisture is great for my combination skin (oily on the t-zone, normal everywhere else). It doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy, I don&#x27;t see a gray cast in pictures, and doesn&#x27;t really seem to change my oil production. My skin feels pretty nice with it on. The problem is that I&#x27;ve been using this for a little more than a week and believe that it may be irritating the somewhat sensitive/acne prone characteristic of my skin. I haven&#x27;t had issues with acne in a few years after making some changes to my diet and using appropriate skin care products, but after I started using this I have had several small blemishes pop up around my face (with a small red dot currently on the tip of my nose). I don&#x27;t believe that I can attribute it to stress (I&#x27;m a grad student, so I&#x27;m just generally stressed), hormonal changes, or age (I&#x27;m in my mid 20s) so I think that this product may be clogging my pores. It&#x27;s too bad, but I&#x27;m glad to see that it worked for others.</li>
            <li> Too moisturizing for me.  I normally apply Paula&#x27;s Choice Shine Stopper over my usual SPF (Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protection Face Cream SPF 50+) and then translucent powder over that, and usually can rely on 6-7 hours of a shine-free face.  This product gave me a shiny, greasy face almost 2 hours after applying the shine stopper and powder.  This product would be great for someone with dry skin - it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
            <li> A light and slightly liquidy sunblock, with a high alcohol content.  I like that it dries to a clear finish (so many sunblocks can give the skin a white cast) but I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy the tightness in my skin.  I do think, however, that the coverage is excellent and while the initial smell isn&#x27;t pleasant, it goes away almost immediately and is odorless throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great, it&#x27;s clear and watery but still moisturizing.  I love that it&#x27;s not greasy and that it&#x27;s giving my skin the intense protection it needs.  My package actually says PA++++, which is one more + than listed in the title, so that&#x27;s even better!  I&#x27;ll probably purchase this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably more due to my finicky skin than this product, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away. The lotion is fairly watery, and doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as I would like. Others may enjoy the &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; finish of the lotion, but I like something more matte for under my makeup. However, it definitely kept me from getting sunburnt during a long day at the beach. Just not great for day-to-day under makeup.</li>
            <li> sinks in really quickly and has prevented me for tanning or burning even though i didn&#x27;t reapply like i was supposed to.</li>
            <li> If you have brown skin this is good for you. No white caste on the skin. It&#x27;s not greasy or chalky. Years ago, s blogger recommended that I try Asian sunscreens because they were better and wouldn&#x27;t make me look like an oil slick. I read about this on the Skin and Tonics blog.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a few days but I really like the consistency. It is not too thick and sticky or too greasy and does not take too much to rub in. It&#x27;s kind of thin and easy to work in. It goes on white at first and the white cast goes away. After washing my face in the morning, I apply my usual moisturizer and then after that dries I apply this then after it dries I apply my makeup. It doesn&#x27;t interfere with how my makeup applies which I like, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face look greasy. The greasiness goes away after a while. Anyway, I really like it so far. I can&#x27;t really tell if it has caused any break outs because I already had some pimples before I started using it, but I&#x27;ll update if I notice any changes.</li>
            <li> THE BEST sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on silky and has little to no scent. I gave it as a gifts to friends and they absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I really enjoy how light it is. There is no white cast like with my old Neutrogena spf, so that&#x27;s a definite bonus. Be aware the bottle is a bit small, but since it&#x27;s going only on my face, I&#x27;m making it last.</li>
            <li> This is a water based sunscreen. Not greasy at all. It&#x27;s almost like a lotion with sun screen in it. Doesn&#x27;t dry you out. And I love that it has PA+++. I&#x27;ve recommended it to my girlfriends and they all love it.</li>
            <li> Love this Creamy Gel, perfect for oily skin!</li>
            <li> So far i really like this sunscreen. Unlike most facial sunscreens i&#x27;ve tried, this doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy and actually leaves my face really soft! The only thing that&#x27;s kind of a drawback is that it takes about 20 minutes or so to sink in, and until then my face is really shiny. Other than that, this sunscreen has worked great for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched long and hard for the perfect daily sunscreen and this is it! Don&#x27;t be alarmed by how it looks when you first put it on, it&#x27;s super shiny but in a short time it dries with a matte finish that I love. I&#x27;m just ordered my third bottle. Wish they were bigger.</li>
            <li> Ugh this looks super shiny and I liked it at first, but I noticed my skin redness flaring up big time. This would be good for people with normal dry skin I guess.</li>
            <li> my favorite sunscreen! dries instantly!!</li>
            <li> It works very well with the same brand of moisturizer that i used. I tried with another brand and it create rubbery feeling. This one comes out watery but goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m quite happy with this sunscreen. It spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days at this point and will update this review if I learn anything different but so far I really like the product. It also arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Read about this product on a blog for guys with beards.  Compared to multiple other sunscreens I use (including Elta MD and other high quality brands) it seems to have less of a drying effect on facial hair.  Also, compared to other mineral based sunscreens it does not leave me with premature &amp;#34;grey beard&amp;#34;.  As others have mentioned, it goes on smoothly with no residue or irritation.  Just wish they had a distributor in the U.S. as it does take a couple of weeks to get it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. This is the first AB sunscreen I&#x27;ve used. I knew I had to use one but I dreaded the American brand ones that gave a white cast. Before I had to use a moisturizer under my bb cream since my skin tends to be a little dry. Now I can have the benefits of sun protection and moistured skin!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used! It doesnt feel sticky or greasy but is perfectly hydrating and great for wear under makeup. Best part is that as a WOC, it doesnt leave an awful white cast!</li>
            <li> I bought this along with Sheisedo Senka aging care SPF50. They are both excellent products, but I slightly prefer the Sheisedo, which absorbs more quickly and leaves a more satiny finish. That being said, this is still a great product that absorbs better than most and moisturizes well. It has less viscosity than I&#x27;m accustomed to (which may aid in the absorption). The packaging is smaller than typical american products (which is nice for traveling or carrying in a purse, but you will have to purchase it more often).</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE sunscreen of any kind.  I have literally dozens in my house, mineral sunscreen, the fancy organic all natural kind, sunscreens that cost lots...this one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  It doesn&#x27;t sting and although it comes out the tube sort of thick, a little goes a long way and it spreads evenly and sinks right in.  I used it under make up (BB cream) and it melds with the bb cream pretty well.  Love it!</li>
            <li> love how light the cream is</li>
            <li> It goes on quickly and was quite effective with preventing me from tanning on a hot day.  I would have given it more stars if it wasn&#x27;t so drying on my skin.  If I didn&#x27;t put on extra moisturizer before putting on this sunscreen, my face felt quite tight and dry.</li>
            <li> best sunblock. Goes on very light and has a great UV protection</li>
            <li> Awesome sunscreen. Great consistency, no whitecast, no sunscreen smell.</li>
    </ol>
