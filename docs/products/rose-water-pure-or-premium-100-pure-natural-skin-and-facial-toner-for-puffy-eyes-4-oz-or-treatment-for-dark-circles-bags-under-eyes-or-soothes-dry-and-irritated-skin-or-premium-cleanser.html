            <li>smells nice, waiting to see effects</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long-time fan of Rose Water.</li>
            <li>and it applies nicely.</li>
            <li>People say, &amp;#34;You smell so nice.</li>
            <li>so I thought I would give rose water a try</li>
            <li>I use 2 Tbs of rose water per 1 c of water.</li>
            <li>, I thoroughly rinse and then follow up with the rose water mix.</li>

            <li>This is awesome, absolutely doing wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice rose fragrance</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne prone skin and used the rose water as a toner after washing.</li>

            <li>Smells wonderful, leaves my skin soft!</li>

            <li>and he said he liked the feel, but wasn&#x27;t to sure of the smell for a guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use Rose Water for many things like I mix a couple drops of it with a couple drops of Argan oil</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this rose water.</li>
            <li>I love this rose water</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my thirties and it&#x27;s become very important to me to buy the best, most natural products I can find for my face and skin.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and makes your skin feel soooo clean!  </li>
            <li>I like the smell (some Rose Waters are too strong)</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel good while using it, though I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference in my face yet, but no difference is just as good as anything when you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>particularly love this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix</li>
            <li>I got this item for free to try and share my opinion, regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle I sniffed it and really enjoyed the scent.</li>
            <li>Love, love , Love...</li>
            <li>Ordering more bottles now.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my rosacea has been better.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>will order more soon</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels wonderful after I use it, and I plan on keeping it as a must-have in my bathroom and in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>This product is 100% Pure Rose Distillate and it smells incredible (if you like roses, which I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own facial toner using 1/2 oz rose water, 1/2 oz witch hazel and</li>
            <li>I love the strong smell of roses, I love how it refreshes my skin.</li>
            <li>have tried many brands of rose water over the years and I am quite happy with Skin Daily Skincare Solutions Rosewater.</li>
            <li>Best toner for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Don’t discount rose water just because it is technically a byproduct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not as potent as attar of roses, rose water is still valued and prized for its own properties.</li>
            <li>Smell great and my sensitive rosacea skin feels soothed after using.</li>
            <li>My face feels more smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is pure rose water in a glass bottle with nothing added.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it actually felt good!</li>
            <li>use it as a toner but also found that it removes make up easily.</li>
            <li>This is 100% Rose Water; it has exactly what I want, and nothing I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This rose water smells so fresh and made my face feel really clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It is pure rose water.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for Rose Water (pure)...</li>
            <li>This is a great product because it has only 1 ingredient: 100% Pure Rose Distillate.</li>
            <li>I found some great home remedies after being offered this sample of Skin Daily Skincare Solutions Rosewater for testing and review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to one&#x27;s daily cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>use it primarily as a toner in both my morning and evening skincare routines after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>I was compensated for this review with a coupon for a free product.</li>
            <li>This feels like it might be a good natural alternative to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far it feels good and hopefully will have an impact on my skins appearance too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say I have been using this for days on my skin with no sensitive skin reactions.</li>
            <li>I used it to clean my face since it came in the evening post.</li>
            <li>Rose oil, also called attar of roses, was in such demand that a first century Persian chemist worked out the steam distillation method of extracting rose oil for mass production and the rest, as they say, is history.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a dark glass bottle, but I would have liked to have a pump or mist attachment on top.</li>
            <li>The Rose Water soothes my skin, balances it out and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Just as good as a boutique brand rose water I usually purchase.  </li>
            <li>I put a bit on a cotton pad and swiped around on my face and it made it feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Rose water is used in baking, candy making, medicinal tonics and most widely, in cosmetics.</li>
            <li>This toner is extremely gentle and the Rose fragrance so calming and refreshing at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The smell is heavenly and not too strong; My husband really loves it.</li>
            <li>This Rose Water is terrific.</li>
            <li>Love this... better than I expected at this phenominal price.</li>
            <li>And Very Pure.</li>
            <li>I love me some Rose Water and this one that Skin Daily Skincare Solutions sent to review for them not only works</li>
            <li>It doesn’t smell quite as strongly as other brands I have tried but it does have a lovely light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>The first day I got it</li>
            <li>My mother used it mixed with her favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It was very soothing!  </li>
            <li>My only wish is that it came in a bigger size (8 oz would be nice!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really interested in,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve enjoyed making it part of my daily skin routine.</li>
            <li>sure enough it does take that &#x27;hit in the face with a powder puff look away&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this once I&#x27;ve had more long term exposure to the product.</li>
            <li>I read that if I used rose water and almond oil that it would help with the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Rose oil is one of the oldest and most basic scents used for perfumes dating back to medieval times.</li>
            <li>(As with any new skin care treatment, be sure to do a patch test before you start using it on regular basis.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Apply to cotton ball to gently wipe away eye make up.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will keep buying it!</li>
            <li>It really soothes my complection and takes out a lot of the redness on nose and around nose.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li>This really works I can see the difference in a three daya</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Unlike some products out there that are a mixture of some rosewater and a handful of chemicals (and cost 3x the price too), this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I think it really does everything it claims.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>I really like all your products</li>
            <li>Rose Water is the liquid (hydrosol) that is left behind after rose petals have been steam distilled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then I have been using it more as a toner when I get out of the shower in the morning before I put on my daily SPF moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product smells nice, but it dried out the skin on my face.</li>
            <li>I use several products from the Skin Daily Skincare Solutions and love them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it is highly recommended for people with normal to combination skin type.</li>
            <li>Pure Rose Water is one of those skincare products that I would choose to take with me if I could only take a few beauty/skincare items.&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li>I have PCOS with cystic acne and so far I haven&#x27;t found much of anything that can save me from that.</li>
            <li>It simply smells natural and not cloyingly sweet or heavy like so many scents.</li>
            <li>I shampoo and condition my hair like normal</li>
            <li>I am not sure of the medical accuracy of this, but she claims it has helped smooth her skin and reduce fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li>So far I have used this as a toner, it tightens my pores better than more expensive products and leave my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my face very soft.</li>
            <li>I recently tried buying a less expensive brand because I liked the fancy lid with a pump dispenser, but it turned out to be Rose Water Oil and smelled like the Dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Its not such a strong floral smell like some products that send me into an instant sneeze fit but rather just a delicate touch of roses.</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural to spritz on my face after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>After watching Wayne Goss demonstrate spritzing after you&#x27;ve put on your makeup to get a natural look and not powdery.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so cool and refreshed that I often wait 15 minutes before moving on to the next step in my beauty routine, just so I can prolong the feeling for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>so I am always very hesitant to try new beauty products especially from brands I am not familiar with.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great addition to one&#x27;s daily cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> use it primarily as a toner in both my morning and evening skincare routines after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> I was compensated for this review with a coupon for a free product.</li>
            <li> This feels like it might be a good natural alternative to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but so far it feels good and hopefully will have an impact on my skins appearance too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say I have been using this for days on my skin with no sensitive skin reactions.</li>
            <li> I used it to clean my face since it came in the evening post.</li>
            <li> Rose oil, also called attar of roses, was in such demand that a first century Persian chemist worked out the steam distillation method of extracting rose oil for mass production and the rest, as they say, is history.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a dark glass bottle, but I would have liked to have a pump or mist attachment on top.</li>
            <li> The Rose Water soothes my skin, balances it out and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Just as good as a boutique brand rose water I usually purchase.  </li>
            <li> I put a bit on a cotton pad and swiped around on my face and it made it feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Rose water is used in baking, candy making, medicinal tonics and most widely, in cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This toner is extremely gentle and the Rose fragrance so calming and refreshing at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly and not too strong; My husband really loves it.</li>
            <li> This Rose Water is terrific.</li>
            <li> Love this... better than I expected at this phenominal price.</li>
            <li> And Very Pure.</li>
            <li> I love me some Rose Water and this one that Skin Daily Skincare Solutions sent to review for them not only works</li>
            <li> It doesn’t smell quite as strongly as other brands I have tried but it does have a lovely light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> The first day I got it</li>
            <li> My mother used it mixed with her favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It was very soothing!  </li>
            <li> My only wish is that it came in a bigger size (8 oz would be nice!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really interested in,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve enjoyed making it part of my daily skin routine.</li>
            <li> sure enough it does take that &#x27;hit in the face with a powder puff look away&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this once I&#x27;ve had more long term exposure to the product.</li>
            <li> I read that if I used rose water and almond oil that it would help with the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Rose oil is one of the oldest and most basic scents used for perfumes dating back to medieval times.</li>
            <li> (As with any new skin care treatment, be sure to do a patch test before you start using it on regular basis.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Apply to cotton ball to gently wipe away eye make up.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> It really soothes my complection and takes out a lot of the redness on nose and around nose.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> This really works I can see the difference in a three daya</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Unlike some products out there that are a mixture of some rosewater and a handful of chemicals (and cost 3x the price too), this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I think it really does everything it claims.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> I really like all your products</li>
            <li> Rose Water is the liquid (hydrosol) that is left behind after rose petals have been steam distilled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since then I have been using it more as a toner when I get out of the shower in the morning before I put on my daily SPF moisturizer for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The product smells nice, but it dried out the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I use several products from the Skin Daily Skincare Solutions and love them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it is highly recommended for people with normal to combination skin type.</li>
            <li> Pure Rose Water is one of those skincare products that I would choose to take with me if I could only take a few beauty/skincare items.&lt;br /&gt;Pure</li>
            <li> I have PCOS with cystic acne and so far I haven&#x27;t found much of anything that can save me from that.</li>
            <li> It simply smells natural and not cloyingly sweet or heavy like so many scents.</li>
            <li> I shampoo and condition my hair like normal</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the medical accuracy of this, but she claims it has helped smooth her skin and reduce fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this as a toner, it tightens my pores better than more expensive products and leave my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It leaves my face very soft.</li>
            <li> I recently tried buying a less expensive brand because I liked the fancy lid with a pump dispenser, but it turned out to be Rose Water Oil and smelled like the Dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Its not such a strong floral smell like some products that send me into an instant sneeze fit but rather just a delicate touch of roses.</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural to spritz on my face after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> After watching Wayne Goss demonstrate spritzing after you&#x27;ve put on your makeup to get a natural look and not powdery.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so cool and refreshed that I often wait 15 minutes before moving on to the next step in my beauty routine, just so I can prolong the feeling for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> so I am always very hesitant to try new beauty products especially from brands I am not familiar with.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing the long term benefits of rosewater on my skin!  </li>
            <li> It is often found in toners, lotions, and creams because its anti-inflammatory properties soothe dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit curious to see how this works on my skin long term,</li>
            <li> My skin is visibly less oily and red without any dryness.</li>
            <li> I used to use witch hazel to tone my face after cleansing and my skin would always feel so dry and tight</li>
            <li> I put it in the refrigerator as suggested by other users and used it on my puffy eyes this morning.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve even put a little in a spray bottle with some water for putting on my body and hair before I dry off.</li>
            <li> I use a little in the shower before I get out on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> Removes traces of makeup left behind from washing.</li>
            <li> I had gotten very tired of buying expensive products that contain the one ingredient</li>
            <li> I hate when I use some toners and cleaners that have alcohol in them</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> wonderful product love the way this rosewater does wonders for your skin!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. This rose water is so precious to me. I use a little in the shower before I get out on my face and I&#x27;ve even put a little in a spray bottle with some water for putting on my body and hair before I dry off. my face looks and smells great!</li>
            <li> Rose oil is one of the oldest and most basic scents used for perfumes dating back to medieval times. It was big with the ancient Greeks and Cleopatra was a known fan. Rose oil, also called attar of roses, was in such demand that a first century Persian chemist worked out the steam distillation method of extracting rose oil for mass production and the rest, as they say, is history. Rose Water is the liquid (hydrosol) that is left behind after rose petals have been steam distilled. Don’t discount rose water just because it is technically a byproduct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not as potent as attar of roses, rose water is still valued and prized for its own properties. Rose water is used in baking, candy making, medicinal tonics and most widely, in cosmetics. It is often found in toners, lotions, and creams because its anti-inflammatory properties soothe dry itchy skin. I found some great home remedies after being offered this sample of Skin Daily Skincare Solutions Rosewater for testing and review. (All opinions are my own and I was not compensated for this review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly love this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix 1/2 teaspoon of rosewater to 1/2 teaspoon of argan oil and mix well. Apply to cotton ball to gently wipe away eye make up. Rinse well. (As with any new skin care treatment, be sure to do a patch test before you start using it on regular basis.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands of rose water over the years and I am quite happy with Skin Daily Skincare Solutions Rosewater. It doesn’t smell quite as strongly as other brands I have tried but it does have a lovely light fresh scent. It simply smells natural and not cloyingly sweet or heavy like so many scents.</li>
            <li> I got this item for free to try and share my opinion, regardless this is my 100% honest opinion. These are my initial thoughts as I have only been using the product for 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin so I am always very hesitant to try new beauty products especially from brands I am not familiar with. I&#x27;m happy to say I have been using this for days on my skin with no sensitive skin reactions. The first day I got it I used it to clean my face since it came in the evening post. I put a bit on a cotton pad and swiped around on my face and it made it feel clean and fresh. Yes, it actually felt good! I even made hubby let me wipe a bit of his face and he said he liked the feel, but wasn&#x27;t to sure of the smell for a guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have been using it more as a toner when I get out of the shower in the morning before I put on my daily SPF moisturizer for sensitive skin. It does make my skin feel good while using it, though I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference in my face yet, but no difference is just as good as anything when you have sensitive skin! I hate when I use some toners and cleaners that have alcohol in them and they burn when I use them. This feels like it might be a good natural alternative to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this product smells amazing if you like the floral scent of roses! When I opened the bottle I sniffed it and really enjoyed the scent. Its not such a strong floral smell like some products that send me into an instant sneeze fit but rather just a delicate touch of roses. I have the mind to dab this around on things like pillows just to scent them a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit curious to see how this works on my skin long term, but so far it feels good and hopefully will have an impact on my skins appearance too. I have PCOS with cystic acne and so far I haven&#x27;t found much of anything that can save me from that. I&#x27;ll update this once I&#x27;ve had more long term exposure to the product.</li>
            <li> My One and Only Heaven in a bottle. I could use a ton of amazing words to describe this water... This is Heaven in a bottle. And Very Pure. I understand my water. This does not have rose oil... It is pure rose water. Love, love , Love... Ordering more bottles now. If you are looking for Rose Water (pure)...This is it. Love it.</li>
            <li> smells nice, waiting to see effects</li>
            <li> I love this Rose Water! I recently tried buying a less expensive brand because I liked the fancy lid with a pump dispenser, but it turned out to be Rose Water Oil and smelled like the Dentist&#x27;s office. I won&#x27;t stray again! This product is 100% Pure Rose Distillate and it smells incredible (if you like roses, which I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make my own facial toner using 1/2 oz rose water, 1/2 oz witch hazel and a couple drops of NAN Baby Skin essential oil. I have a tiny scar from a clogged pore I messed with and I think this toner is helping it go away since roses are beneficial for treating scar tissue. Highly recommend and will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful toner with delightful smell. Removes traces of makeup left behind from washing. I love the fact that it is pure rose water in a glass bottle with nothing added.  It&#x27;s a great addition to one&#x27;s daily cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time fan of Rose Water. My mother used it mixed with her favorite moisturizer. This Rose Water is terrific. I like the smell (some Rose Waters are too strong) and it applies nicely. I use it on my face, neck, and mix some in with my hair conditioner. It tones and moisturizes, and of course, leaves a wonderful scent. People say, &amp;#34;You smell so nice. What are you wearing?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toner, and it smells like roses!</li>
            <li> Love this... better than I expected at this phenominal price.</li>
            <li> I used it twice, then gave up.  The product smells nice, but it dried out the skin on my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so gooooood! Love the smell and makes my face look and feel its best.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My face feels so refreshed after I use it.  Best toner for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Smells wonderful!  It really soothes my complection and takes out a lot of the redness on nose and around nose.</li>
            <li> Smells nice! I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week. I&#x27;ve noticed my rosacea has been better. It has lessened the redness and my face hasn&#x27;t been itchy. It leaves my face very soft. Would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the skin.</li>
            <li> This rose water smells so fresh and made my face feel really clean and refreshed. I used to use witch hazel to tone my face after cleansing and my skin would always feel so dry and tight and I really didn&#x27;t like that so I thought I would give rose water a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a couple of days ago in the mail and I love it already!  It smells amazing and makes your skin feel soooo clean!  I put it in the refrigerator as suggested by other users and used it on my puffy eyes this morning.  It was very soothing!  So glad I decided to buy this product from this company!  Looking forward to seeing the long term benefits of rosewater on my skin!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This toner is extremely gentle and the Rose fragrance so calming and refreshing at the same time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great great product. My girlfriend loved it!</li>
            <li> This really works I can see the difference in a three daya will order more soon</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells sooooo good! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Unlike some products out there that are a mixture of some rosewater and a handful of chemicals (and cost 3x the price too), this stuff is the real deal. 100% rosewater nothing added. I love that it comes in a dark glass bottle, but I would have liked to have a pump or mist attachment on top. The smell is heavenly and not too strong; My husband really loves it. So far I have used this as a toner, it tightens my pores better than more expensive products and leave my skin baby soft. I will be buying again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! It makes my face feel so cool and refreshed that I often wait 15 minutes before moving on to the next step in my beauty routine, just so I can prolong the feeling for as long as possible. I think it really does everything it claims. My only wish is that it came in a bigger size (8 oz would be nice!). I&#x27;m in my thirties and it&#x27;s become very important to me to buy the best, most natural products I can find for my face and skin. I had gotten very tired of buying expensive products that contain the one ingredient I&#x27;m really interested in, when it suddenly occurred to me that I could skip all the added fillers and save some money by simply buying that one ingredient. This is 100% Rose Water; it has exactly what I want, and nothing I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve just purchased my 2nd bottle, and will continue to buy and use it!</li>
            <li> Refreshing and works perfectly as a toner.</li>
            <li> Works good for baggy eyes I love it</li>
            <li> I use Rose Water for many things like I mix a couple drops of it with a couple drops of Argan oil and it&#x27;s the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever tried. I also like it for a hair rinse I use 2 Tbs of rose water per 1 c of water.I shampoo and condition my hair like normal, I thoroughly rinse and then follow up with the rose water mix. It leaves a great scent in my hair and is great for my skin too. This is a great product because it has only 1 ingredient: 100% Pure Rose Distillate.</li>
            <li> I use several products from the Skin Daily Skincare Solutions and love them. But the Rosewater smells SO amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a toner but also found that it removes make up easily. LOVE</li>
            <li> I love me some Rose Water and this one that Skin Daily Skincare Solutions sent to review for them not only works really well it also smells really amazing!  Pure Rose Water is one of those skincare products that I would choose to take with me if I could only take a few beauty/skincare items.&lt;br /&gt;Pure Rose Water is a multi-tasking product that can cleanse, tone and hydrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it primarily as a toner in both my morning and evening skincare routines after I wash my face.  The Rose Water soothes my skin, balances it out and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Did not help my bags under my eyes, like it promoted it would. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, leaves my skin soft!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product. She uses it as a toner as part of her skincare routine. I am not sure of the medical accuracy of this, but she claims it has helped smooth her skin and reduce fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, absolutely doing wonders on my skin. Love it. 👌</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven and I&#x27;ve enjoyed making it part of my daily skin routine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this rose water. I read that if I used rose water and almond oil that it would help with the dark circles under my eyes. My skin feels wonderful after I use it, and I plan on keeping it as a must-have in my bathroom and in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I really like all your products</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this stuff...love it! Smell great and my sensitive rosacea skin feels soothed after using.</li>
            <li> I love the strong smell of roses, I love how it refreshes my skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural to spritz on my face after cleansing.  This is so nice and has a refreshing rose fragrance.  After watching Wayne Goss demonstrate spritzing after you&#x27;ve put on your makeup to get a natural look and not powdery. So I tried it and sure enough it does take that &#x27;hit in the face with a powder puff look away&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Just as good as a boutique brand rose water I usually purchase.  Bought this bottle instead and refilled my glass spray bottle.  Perfect for refreshing or setting my makeup for the day.</li>
            <li> Value for money for an excellent toner. Nice rose fragrance and it is highly recommended for people with normal to combination skin type.</li>
            <li> This Rose Water is soooo great!! I used this with a vitamin C serum, and after the second use my Mom told me my skin was beautifull. My face feels more smooth after I use it. This company has truly amazing customer service as well!!</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing and feels great on my skin. I have oily, acne prone skin and used the rose water as a toner after washing. My skin is visibly less oily and red without any dryness. The smell is feminine but does not linger once I use moisturizer. I was compensated for this review with a coupon for a free product. All opinions are unbiased and my own.</li>
            <li> I love this rose water</li>
