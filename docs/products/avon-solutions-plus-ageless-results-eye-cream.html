            <li>I have used more eye creams than I should admit and I&#x27;ve found this Avon cream to be the best (so far).  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly, doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for when I exercise, and the cream keeps my eye area soft and pliant even while I break a sweat.  </li>
            <li>Been using for years love it because it works like the company said it would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is ok but a bit sticky.</li>
            <li>It works MUCH BETTER</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I love it before I put on my under eye concealer</li>
            <li>TOP</li>
            <li>Not the best eye cream, but in the better half of everything that&#x27;s out there for this area.</li>
            <li>Love it and will never change UNLESS I find something better, I always experiment for fun</li>
            <li>;) Will let you know if I find something better, until then BUY THIS promise you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>little product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This product is comfortable applied at night to relive skin irritant around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This really does what is says, I&#x27;m loving it.  </li>
            <li>it is cheap and it works.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product.</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream, noticed results right away.</li>
            <li>I have seen a significant change in appearance of crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>: I originally purchased this for just over 20 dollars on Amazon and it now lists for 34.</li>
            <li>The price is right too!  </li>
            <li>My under eyes look so much smoother and the over all appearance looks more even toned.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for many many years and can honestly say have very little number of lines around my eyes even when I smile.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a quality eye cream for a lower price than the high end cosmetic brands that I love like Lancome and Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this super consistently, so I haven&#x27;t seen a huge change yet.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST ONE HANDS DOWN!!!!  </li>
            <li>Of course, Mother Nature doesn&#x27;t fully comply with my desire to banish all wrinkles, but Avon Solutions certainly gives me a good weapon with which to fight back.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s helping my eye wrinkles, but it has a really creamy sensation that really makes your skin feel great!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing though, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this cream help prevent that it also makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time and that morning my husband said,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy that works outside all year long in northern great lake reagion.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>this is a good, moisturizing cream that is not too greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t afford a lot of the higher priced eye creams on the market</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years and love it!  </li>
            <li>The price is certainly affordable and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>but if you really want to tackle existing wrinkles then add a retinol product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;You don&#x27;t get much</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many such products before and feel like I&#x27;m just treading water...holding back the flood of under-eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t try out much stuff on my skin since I have a very sensitive prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>Normal lotions burn around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Love how it feels going on, leaves my eye area soft, doesn&#x27;t soak in totally, can still feel it on my eyes the next morning but still like it.</li>
            <li>Nice, thick, silky texture and works pretty well (visually) around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I have a new baby and haven&#x27;t slept well for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>I didnt use it religious at first for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Its an Avon Product, which is an old and established line of products, so it should work!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Stung my skin, but I do have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can really feel a difference the following day.  </li>
            <li>I have also been using it as a full facial moisturizer (I suffer from extremely sensitive, dry winter skin)</li>
            <li>Really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see much in the way of results.</li>
            <li>No black mascara shadow under my eyes at end of day.</li>
            <li>this little tart in Las Vegas tried to sell me that was made I suppose from Fairy, Unicorn and Dragon tears....which I used for the week in Vegas and returned it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>A must have for dry sensitive skin!</li>

            <li> A must have for dry sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> But with that much usage I notice a slight change and then I was curious to follow it and see the result.</li>
            <li> It is OLD and DRIED UP.</li>
            <li> so in that respect this Avon cream will save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> cause it sinks right in and leaves a smooth matte base.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical with the reviews, first of all because I&#x27;m not a big Avon fan and second</li>
            <li> Unlike other creams, this one actually feels like it&#x27;s doing something!  </li>
            <li> The very little lines I had at the sides of my eyes are gone and I can look at my eyes at 35 years old in a 15 max mirror</li>
            <li> Not the most expensive product in the world, but after a few weeks I see some improvement in the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It does firm and has a dry, matte finish which is a good base for foundation.  </li>
            <li> I contacted them, and they sent another one out immediately, which I received just a few days later.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will completely replace my expensive eye creams, but it will make them last longer as I alternate</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have under eye dark circles.</li>
            <li> But since I never had dark circle, change is not noticable enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with bags, dark circles and puffiness for 10 years and have run the gamut on the products out there.</li>
            <li> ALL MY DARK EYE GO AWAY.&lt;br /&gt;SIMPLY</li>
            <li> I received this product and unfortunately didn&#x27;t open it until 1 month later.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use long enough to see any results, sadly.</li>
            <li> I use to have a little speck of pigmentation from the sun and that is almost gone.</li>
            <li> Some mornings I would wake up with puffiness as if I had been crying all night.</li>
            <li> What I found was an opened jar (no seal to protect the product) with dried up product inside.  </li>
            <li> The product is thick and just a small amount works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I would give them a negative rating if I could.</li>
            <li> And, unfortunately, too late to return it</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m uncomfortable with the amount of pressure I have to use to spread it on the delicate under eye area.</li>
            <li> I try just to pat it  on my undereye area but the stickiness makes this difficult.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical with the reviews, first of all because I&#x27;m not a big Avon fan and second I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams.  THIS IS THE BEST ONE HANDS DOWN!!!!  Thank you Avon!!!!  From now on I will be getting this eye cream.</li>
            <li> 06/28/2013 - I have puffy eyes with crows feet but I don&#x27;t have under eye dark circles. I don&#x27;t try out much stuff on my skin since I have a very sensitive prone to breakouts. Also I don&#x27;t follow anything regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow I thought trying out this undereye cream. I didnt use it religious at first for 2 weeks. But with that much usage I notice a slight change and then I was curious to follow it and see the result. I am into 5th week of using it, I put it on only during nights. I have seen a significant change in appearance of crow&#x27;s feet. But since I never had dark circle, change is not noticable enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use it religious and post my comments again.</li>
            <li> Really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see much in the way of results. I&#x27;ve used many such products before and feel like I&#x27;m just treading water...holding back the flood of under-eye wrinkles. Did think the consistency of this product was a bit &amp;#34;stiffer&amp;#34; than others I&#x27;ve used, i.e. not as creamy. Results....TBD.</li>
            <li> Not the most expensive product in the world, but after a few weeks I see some improvement in the dark circles under my eyes. I think this product is doing the job!</li>
            <li> I turned 38 and started freaking-out about aging gracefully.  I bought this because it wasn&#x27;t a $30 eye cream and I am so happy with it.  It goes on very smoothly, doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes (I&#x27;ve had LASIK), and my eyes look great (not a wrinkle in sight).  I would say this is great as a preventative and as a hydrator  but if you really want to tackle existing wrinkles then add a retinol product.</li>
            <li> This product is the best eye cream ever I&#x27;ve see were it has reduce the darkness and the puffiness. Thanks</li>
            <li> Product has parabens and gets in my eyes during the night. I used maybe twice before I trashed it. Didn&#x27;t use long enough to see any results, sadly.</li>
            <li> I got the best compliment from my husband.  I have a new baby and haven&#x27;t slept well for quite a while.  I used this product for the first time and that morning my husband said, \\&quot;You look well rested.\\&quot;  I totally wasn&#x27;t.  He didn&#x27;t even know I had started using an eye cream.</li>
            <li> Been using for years love it because it works like the company said it would.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all women.</li>
            <li> It is ok but a bit sticky. I try just to pat it  on my undereye area but the stickiness makes this difficult.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these. I didn&#x27;t open the second one until I went on a trip, and packed it. It is OLD and DRIED UP. And, unfortunately, too late to return it. I do not recommend this seller. I reached out to the seller to ask them to resolve it and no reply.</li>
            <li> An in-expensive eye cream that works and doesn&#x27;t burn the eyes when you sweat.  Have used this product for many many years and can honestly say have very little number of lines around my eyes even when I smile.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and love it!  I really can&#x27;t afford a lot of the higher priced eye creams on the market and I like the consistency of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream, noticed results right away. It works MUCH BETTER the $325 eye cream this little tart in Las Vegas tried to sell me that was made I suppose from Fairy, Unicorn and Dragon tears....which I used for the week in Vegas and returned it for a full refund. This eye cream WORKS.</li>
            <li> I have used more eye creams than I should admit and I&#x27;ve found this Avon cream to be the best (so far).  It does firm and has a dry, matte finish which is a good base for foundation.  Good price.  5 stars</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this super consistently, so I haven&#x27;t seen a huge change yet.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing though, and absorbs quickly.  I had a problem initially, in that the seller shipped the item, but I didn&#x27;t get it.  I contacted them, and they sent another one out immediately, which I received just a few days later.  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> Feels really good on your skin.  Will be buying again and again.  Great for the price!  Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Stung my skin, but I do have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream I&#x27;ve used to date. I&#x27;ve battled with bags, dark circles and puffiness for 10 years and have run the gamut on the products out there. Nothing, aside from cosmetic alternatives, is going to take them away. You can treat them, mask them, but not get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little product is wonderful. Some mornings I would wake up with puffiness as if I had been crying all night. Not only does this cream help prevent that it also makes my skin very smooth. I have also been using it as a full facial moisturizer (I suffer from extremely sensitive, dry winter skin) and this is the only thing that works well, especially without irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t get much but you don&#x27;t need much. The product is thick and just a small amount works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I originally purchased this for just over 20 dollars on Amazon and it now lists for 34. Jeez.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have used it for years.  I can really feel a difference the following day.  24 hours later when I am washing my face, I can still feel the moisture around the eyes vs the rest of the face.  I use it daily, and I don&#x27;t have those inevitable crow&#x27;s feet and I am almost 50.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the cost.</li>
            <li> Unlike other creams, this one actually feels like it&#x27;s doing something!  Nice, thick, silky texture and works pretty well (visually) around the eyes. Not the best eye cream, but in the better half of everything that&#x27;s out there for this area.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see results! Its an Avon Product, which is an old and established line of products, so it should work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that works outside all year long in northern great lake reagion. The wind and dust dries my skin out. Normal lotions burn around my eyes. This product is comfortable applied at night to relive skin irritant around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a quality eye cream for a lower price than the high end cosmetic brands that I love like Lancome and Peter Thomas Roth. This is very good quality, is very rich and for the price I will reorder it again. I don&#x27;t know if it will completely replace my expensive eye creams, but it will make them last longer as I alternate so in that respect this Avon cream will save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> This product was bought as a gift, and the recipient loves it. She&#x27;s very happy with the way it works with her skin.</li>
            <li> This really does what is says, I&#x27;m loving it.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again in the future because for me it works</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream..it is cheap and it works. I have tried everything from all the department stores cosmetic lines and this feels the best on my eyes and it works...people tell me all the time, you look 10 years younger!!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. Though inexpensive, it does provide a good moisture for the eye area. I like it.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be a nice quality.  However, I&#x27;m uncomfortable with the amount of pressure I have to use to spread it on the delicate under eye area.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. It has a thicker consistency but I love it before I put on my under eye concealer cause it sinks right in and leaves a smooth matte base. My under eyes look so much smoother and the over all appearance looks more even toned. I use to have a little speck of pigmentation from the sun and that is almost gone. The very little lines I had at the sides of my eyes are gone and I can look at my eyes at 35 years old in a 15 max mirror (that means you can see every pore on your face) and my under eyes look almost PERFECT.. Love it and will never change UNLESS I find something better, I always experiment for fun and I&#x27;m never getting younger..;) Will let you know if I find something better, until then BUY THIS promise you&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I keep one of these in each bathroom and apply the cream around my eyes throughout the day.  It&#x27;s very good for when I exercise, and the cream keeps my eye area soft and pliant even while I break a sweat.  The skin around my eyes does seem smoother and fresher looking.  The price is certainly affordable and I really like this product.  Of course, Mother Nature doesn&#x27;t fully comply with my desire to banish all wrinkles, but Avon Solutions certainly gives me a good weapon with which to fight back.</li>
            <li> I received this product and unfortunately didn&#x27;t open it until 1 month later.  What I found was an opened jar (no seal to protect the product) with dried up product inside.  DON&#x27;T EVERY PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER!!!!  I would give them a negative rating if I could.</li>
            <li> I LKE THIS CREAM, IT MAKE ALL MY DARK EYE GO AWAY.&lt;br /&gt;SIMPLY THE  BEST. I LOVED  THIS CREAM SO MUCH. I USED THIS FOR ALMOST ONE YEAR.&lt;br /&gt; I HAVE TRIED MANY KIND OF OF AGELESS EYE CREAM&lt;br /&gt; NOTHING TOP THIS Wow! EXCEELLENT!&lt;br /&gt;I WILL TELL ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS ABOUT IT.&lt;br /&gt;YES IT WORKS.!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> this is a good, moisturizing cream that is not too greasy or heavy.  The price is right too!  I switched to this from Olay eye cream</li>
            <li> Love how it feels going on, leaves my eye area soft, doesn&#x27;t soak in totally, can still feel it on my eyes the next morning but still like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to everything and this is working well.  I use in the morning before makeup and it smells nice and feels great.  I hope I have reached the word number required.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping my eye wrinkles, but it has a really creamy sensation that really makes your skin feel great!  It doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water either.  No black mascara shadow under my eyes at end of day. It absorbs into my skin very well. I think it has more going for it then some of the expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I like how this feels - so silky.  This is the second time I purchased it and will do so again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he said he doesn&#x27;t see a difference at all. Happy I didn&#x27;t pay a lot.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the great reviews and great price. I am thoroughly impressed with this eye cream. I use this cream morning and night under makeup and before my retin a at night. A must have for dry sensitive skin!</li>
