            <li>This works great and does not smell all girly like some of the more popular pre-bronzer lotions out there.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>So this lotion is amazing, but women should use it with caution.</li>
            <li>The light lotion is great for men who have body hair.</li>
            <li>and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>but nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>My wife also mentioned she liked the smell on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice and gradual without any redness or streaks.. recommended.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The intensifier works better.</li>
            <li>so you know I love it...</li>
            <li>and I thought its scent would be okay.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work ok..</li>
            <li>Much better buy than at the tanning salon....</li>
            <li>Glad to be able to buy it online</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Makes me a bronze, sexy beast.</li>
            <li>I have tattoos and making sure they would not fade when tanning was a priority.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does smell better for guys before and after tanning.</li>
            <li>It should have been better packaged better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good bronzer - the color is light and not fake.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t burn and u can really see a good bronze in my skin.</li>
            <li>Buy it on Amazon, you will spend more than 2x as much for this product at your tanning salon !!!</li>
            <li>I have tried other products and seem to like this one the best.</li>
            <li>Seams to be working fine</li>
            <li>The clients I bought this for were happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;It has a manly smell, absorbs quickly with no oily after feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Natural looking bronzers, not ridiculously dark or streaky.</li>
            <li>My sister actually thinks it smells great.</li>
            <li>Great smell and dry very quick.</li>
            <li>First day I used somebody said I looked healthy and was I away on vacation.</li>
            <li>so he got a nice very natural looking tan</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and isn&#x27;t thick.</li>
            <li>Not to shabby cheap and does the job right</li>
            <li>It is a very clean smell that is very manly</li>
            <li>It works great to get deep color and the tattoo guard really does help to protect tattoos.</li>
            <li>It smells great, the bronzers are natural and not black</li>
            <li>Nice lotion, i&#x27;ve noticed my tan lasts longer while using this over my last lotion.</li>
            <li>So far as its tanning/bronzing effectiveness, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Works ok, doesn&#x27;t really produce much color.</li>
            <li>The lotion works well with a pleasant aroma, it dries fairly well and leaves no greedy residue, I am spanish and naturally tanned, it takes a few sessions before you notice the tan</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth and moist with no extra lotions used despite the fact that I tan 4xs a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tan is just OK with this as well; light brown..not dark at all with this product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been tanning for 6 months or so have tried many different lotions</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, I am a white male in my 20&#x27;s with a rather fair complexion that tans well over time.</li>
            <li>I liked the cologne fragrance however after half way through the bottle; the fragrance gets weaker.</li>
            <li>, my tanning salon wants &amp;#62;30$.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I think it worked, can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>Still some what unclear as to if your really suppose to apply in a tanning bed?</li>
            <li>Not only does it give a deep, nice tan, it smells like I just put on cologne.</li>
            <li>smells subtle but yet still has a nice fresh smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Works great - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>i constantly get complements on my bronze  tan and the color guard really works!</li>
            <li>It is difficult to decide which I like better between this and the black bottle as they are both amazing.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Smells like Obsession and Old Spice.</li>
            <li>My wife actually thought I got a new cologne.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way; the tiny sample packet looked like it wouldn&#x27;t cover my lower body, but ultimately I was able to use about 1.5 Tablespoons to cover my body.</li>
            <li>so you do not have to smell like tanning lotion or worse the perfumed lotions that many women use.</li>
            <li>(smile you&#x27;re darker, believe in me, paramour, hero worship) and was tired of smelling really girly after tanning.</li>
            <li>tan is nice and natural looking (not too dark of fake</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that he goes through it too quickly.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a subtle as it first appeared when I smelled by opening the container.  </li>
            <li> It arrived crushed with the bottom of the tube &amp;#34;blown out&amp;#34; with the lotion smeared throughout the inner plastic bag.</li>
            <li> He refuses to use any other cream accept the occasional tingle which he mixes with this.</li>
            <li> I have used several tanning lotions for men and G-Gentlemen trumps them all, plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> A big mess.</li>

            <li> Paid a lot less on Amazon compared to what you pay at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> However, it did not help me get any darker than I previously was.</li>
            <li> Being a guy, I usually use an unscented tanning/bronzing lotion at the tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> it does produce a subtle glow</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky or too liquidy and smells just a faint like cologne.</li>
            <li> As a man I have had a difficult time finding a bronzer that does not smell girly.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I am the whitest person on earth and this crap didn&#x27;t even give me any color!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> i constantly get complements on my bronze  tan and the color guard really works! this is a must if your wanting to tan and protect your tattos at the same time .</li>
            <li> Love this product. A little goes a long way. Very pleasant smelling. You don&#x27;t smell like a tanning salon. My wife actually thought I got a new cologne.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, i&#x27;ve noticed my tan lasts longer while using this over my last lotion. Good price too, my tanning salon wants &amp;#62;30$.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this bronzer.  It works nicely for him and smells good.  The only complaint is that he goes through it too quickly.</li>
            <li> Best tan lotion ever !!!</li>
            <li> great product, but again, it is bronzer…The intensifier works better.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is amazing. Not only does it give a deep, nice tan, it smells like I just put on cologne. Get this lotion.</li>
            <li> The clients I bought this for were happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;It has a manly smell, absorbs quickly with no oily after feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Natural looking bronzers, not ridiculously dark or streaky.</li>

            <li> Great product.  Paid a lot less on Amazon compared to what you pay at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Great product! I personally use this lotion myself and it is my second bottle so you know I love it...fast shipping, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> makes you smell good not like the burnt smell from a tanning bed</li>
            <li> Being a guy, I usually use an unscented tanning/bronzing lotion at the tanning salon.  I had smelled this lotion and I thought its scent would be okay.  I was wrong.  It wasn&#x27;t a subtle as it first appeared when I smelled by opening the container.  So far as its tanning/bronzing effectiveness, it&#x27;s okay but nothing spectacular.  I will not buy this again because of the scent.  My wife is not a big fan of the scent either.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions. It is difficult to decide which I like better between this and the black bottle as they are both amazing. The smell is the best part. It is a very clean smell that is very manly so you do not have to smell like tanning lotion or worse the perfumed lotions that many women use. It works great to get deep color and the tattoo guard really does help to protect tattoos. I would not recommend this product for women. While it does a good job of penetrating mens tougher skin so it would work great for a woman, I heard a story from a girl at the tanning salon of a girl who used this lotion and ended up breaking up with her boy friend of 2 years because he smelled the lotion on her and thought she was cheating on him and they broke up. So this lotion is amazing, but women should use it with caution.</li>
            <li> I used this when I wanted to go to vegas for a week I got it and used it and must I say I was a bronze GODESS for my fab trip to Vegas.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work ok..Much better buy than at the tanning salon.... Glad to be able to buy it online</li>
            <li> I think it worked, can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li> Works great/smells great</li>
            <li> Great product! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and isn&#x27;t thick. Perfect color afterwards. Perfect for a quick tan then on to another place. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It absorbs really well into my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross greasy feeling. The smell has a slight hint of you&#x27;re average tanning lotion, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. My sister actually thinks it smells great. I definitely reccomend it!</li>
            <li> Makes me a bronze, sexy beast. Smells like Obsession and Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Great smell and dry very quick.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works well. I don&#x27;t burn and u can really see a good bronze in my skin. YOLO</li>
            <li> I have tattoos and making sure they would not fade when tanning was a priority. This works great and does not smell all girly like some of the more popular pre-bronzer lotions out there. It is not sticky or too liquidy and smells just a faint like cologne. The smell is also not very strong or lingers for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought a one-time-use packet of this lotion from my tanning company. The light lotion is great for men who have body hair. A little goes a long way; the tiny sample packet looked like it wouldn&#x27;t cover my lower body, but ultimately I was able to use about 1.5 Tablespoons to cover my body. It&#x27;s a good bronzer - the color is light and not fake. The price for the sample pack was $8, so compared to that, this was a steal.</li>
            <li> Works great - a little goes a long way. I have had multiple compliments from women just on how this smells. Buy it on Amazon, you will spend more than 2x as much for this product at your tanning salon !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product delivered in sealed plastic and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I liked the cologne fragrance however after half way through the bottle; the fragrance gets weaker. The tan is just OK with this as well; light brown..not dark at all with this product.</li>
            <li> What is this JUNK? Its not a self tanning is not a bronzer it isn&#x27;t anything because it doesn&#x27;t even work! I am the whitest person on earth and this crap didn&#x27;t even give me any color!</li>
            <li> I have used several tanning lotions for men and G-Gentlemen trumps them all, plain and simple.  It&#x27;s not a tingler, only a bronzer.  If you are a dude and want tanning lotion that doesnt make you smell like a chick then this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> As a man I have had a difficult time finding a bronzer that does not smell girly.  Really happy with the smell of the G Gentlemen smells subtle but yet still has a nice fresh smell to it.  My wife also mentioned she liked the smell on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tan is nice and natural looking (not too dark of fake looking)and after a month I am dark but so dark that people assume its from a tanning bed.  My skin is very smooth and moist with no extra lotions used despite the fact that I tan 4xs a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is the lotion is water based so you need a lot to cover your body.  I got about 3 weeks use out of my 8.5oz tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price wise great deal from what my tanning place was charging.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been tanning for 6 months or so have tried many different lotions (smile you&#x27;re darker, believe in me, paramour, hero worship) and was tired of smelling really girly after tanning. I chose this product because it is for men and advertised to have a cologne comprable fragrance. Yes, it does smell better for guys before and after tanning. However, it did not help me get any darker than I previously was. Keep in mind, I am a white male in my 20&#x27;s with a rather fair complexion that tans well over time. I probably won&#x27;t buy this product again not that I realize it is essentially just a cologne scented lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion works well with a pleasant aroma, it dries fairly well and leaves no greedy residue, I am spanish and naturally tanned, it takes a few sessions before you notice the tan but it&#x27;s nice and gradual without any redness or streaks.. recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this stuff!!! It smells great, the bronzers are natural and not black so he got a nice very natural looking tan and he felt like a man after because of the smell. He refuses to use any other cream accept the occasional tingle which he mixes with this. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Works ok, doesn&#x27;t really produce much color. First day I used somebody said I looked healthy and was I away on vacation. After that I have received no comments. You need a fair amount to get some color. Still some what unclear as to if your really suppose to apply in a tanning bed? I thought it worked alone. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it does produce a subtle glow but I don&#x27;t do tanning beds. From what I read my understanding was it worked without but have read reviews that mention tanning beds.</li>
            <li> Seams to be working fine</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It gives great color and every woman I know loves the smell...can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> Product was packaged in a bubble pack envelope. It arrived crushed with the bottom of the tube &amp;#34;blown out&amp;#34; with the lotion smeared throughout the inner plastic bag. A big mess. It should have been better packaged better. I will buy somewhere else. I don&#x27;t have time to deal with sending it back!</li>
            <li> Good price and product</li>
            <li> Your skin is the same color with or without it</li>
