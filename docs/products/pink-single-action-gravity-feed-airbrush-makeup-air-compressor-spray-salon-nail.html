            <li>Great price, great machine.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Glam air brush makeup medium set for $39.99 instead of theirs and it works great in the machine and on my face</li>

            <li>The hose that attaches to the gun and machine for the air is a good length.</li>
            <li>This one would let me have the machine a good 4 feet away from the plug if I needed to get into the shower to spray tan and keep my bathroom from getting tan also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works really good</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>

            <li>A flyer about the compressor comes in the box explaining not to use the compressor for more than 20 minutes at a time so it doesn&#x27;t overheat.</li>
            <li>I know I will get better with practice.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>And love those as well.</li>

            <li>It is very quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The gun is easy to hold like a pencil, as the videos say, and the cup holds about a teaspoon of liquid.</li>
            <li>It is so easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works perfect for applying make-up, am currently using Glaimair but not as happy with it as I think i should be, and am looking at other options.</li>
            <li>if you follow these guidlines you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how fabulous I looked.</li>
            <li>Nice and compact, doesnt take up much room in the bathroom at all.</li>
            <li>I did not buy any of the \\&quot;airbrush\\&quot; makeup or kits available online.</li>
            <li>Honestly it works as professional ones but without the huge price tag.</li>
            <li>clean out all the crevisis of the gun using a qtip.</li>
            <li>Totally worth buying.</li>
            <li>Since you are only supposed touse 6 drops for full face foundation, there is plenty of room at the top</li>
            <li>The electric cord is nice &amp; long.</li>
            <li>Love this machine although I had one earlier that quit working pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I just put it on for the first time &amp;</li>
            <li>I have only used my Airbrush machine twice, but I LOVE how my foundation looks.</li>
            <li>The farther back you pull the more liquid sprays out with the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I looked like Boris Karloff from The Mummy.</li>
            <li>The next time I did better.</li>
            <li>Love the color and last of tan.</li>
            <li>So this is my first time I have ever got an airbrush machine for makeup</li>
            <li>Love the different speeds</li>
            <li>Bottle) make sure to remove the needle in the gun (which is removed from the back of the gun not the front)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and the modes work well (high, med, low) for adjusting the airflow.</li>
            <li>I am interested to see how long the compressor lasts but I am glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>It works fantastically and isn&#x27;t super loud.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty nervous to take the risk and spend $$100 on makeup and a compressor based mainly on just reviews, not knowing if it was truly going to work.</li>
            <li>I loveee this sooo much.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Also do not push the air speed button fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this airbrush machine.</li>
            <li>It was cheap enough that I can afford it</li>
            <li>ITS BRAND FRICKIN NEW!</li>
            <li>I love my airbrush makeup machine, I can apply  makeup in half the time it use to take.</li>
            <li>Not only did it do what it is suppose to do, it was very simple to operate and that makes it all the better.</li>
            <li>Even the Hi pressure is not too high for skin.</li>
            <li>I am so sad, I wanted to believe in all these great reviews.</li>
            <li>Just got this new toy and it DOES-NOT-WORK.</li>
            <li>It is small, plastic and has one button on top.</li>
            <li>Also multiple flow powers, high, medium and low for a soft flow of product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering a couple more for my other</li>
            <li>, none of the recipes iv used thus far have been a sucess.</li>
            <li>Shipment was very speedy ( shipped same day my payment was made) that&#x27;s what I call taking care of business....</li>
            <li>The makeup looks just as good as when my friend did it, without the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li>As far as compressors go, this is a very low end one.</li>
            <li>The thing barely blew air through the nozzle.</li>
            <li>This was less expensive and works great.  </li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t afford to spit out $150 right away on the machine and makeup, however a few weeks</li>
            <li>The cord is long enough and the machine itself is small enough to sit on the sink or the counter top.</li>
            <li>To disperse the liquid from the cup you pull back on the lever on the top behind the cup with your index finger.</li>
            <li>:) Oh I have had my machine for about a month in a half and use at least 4x a week and not a problem yet.</li>

            <li> A few tips for make up use : CLEAN YOUR AIRBRUSH AFTER EACH USE, ( with a anti rust formula, preferably something made for sterilizing, or you can purchase cleaner for as little as 5</li>
            <li> The only tanning solution I&#x27;ve used so far is Norvell- Dark Amber.</li>
            <li> Air dry and put back together.</li>
            <li> IN CONCLUSION, KEEP IT CLEAN, USE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE FOR AIRBRUSHING Nothing thick or clumpy, AND DONT OVER WORK THIS LITTLE MOTOR.</li>
            <li> The bottles come a little small but its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> It is not too long that it knocks everything else off my counter, but long enough that I could airbrush other parts of my body without moving the machine around.</li>
            <li> I mixed my own foundation using my mineral makeup &amp; mixing base</li>
            <li> Occasionally makeup solution gets a little \\&quot;clogged\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> NOT TO BURN OUT THIS TINY LITTLE MOTOR .</li>
            <li> Please be careful when ordering this ..</li>
            <li> I spent lots of time online watching</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my other airbrush make up compressor that stopped working</li>
            <li> and you are not able to get your money back</li>
            <li> The button has 2 parts: one in the power on/off, the other is Mode for adjusting the force of the air coming out of the \\&quot;gun\\&quot;(Hi, Med, Lo).</li>
            <li> But seriously, forget your regular makeup.</li>
            <li> I think they are a little heavy for this machine.</li>
            <li> ... waste of my money..</li>
            <li> After a few months of using the item, It stopped working..</li>
            <li> I tried to return it because the product was dead on arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> waste of money, and time.</li>
            <li> IF YOUR AIR BRUSH GUN IS NOT WORKING, YOU MAY BE USING A PRODUCT OF TO THICK CONSISTANCY.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t see any difference from other expensive brand</li>
            <li> I hate those cords that are so short you have to stay in front of a socket.</li>
            <li> But alas, another sob story.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually a little mad</li>
            <li> Then she told me her compressor was over 500 bucks which is wayy too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> THE DIRECTIONS WITH THIS PRODUCT ARE USELESS*  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I loveee this sooo much. Honestly it works as professional ones but without the huge price tag. I use this for airbrush foundation along with GlamAir and wow is wonderful people always love how flawless they look.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my other airbrush make up compressor that stopped working and I&#x27;ve had this one for a couple of months.  It works fantastically and isn&#x27;t super loud.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and the modes work well (high, med, low) for adjusting the airflow.</li>
            <li> Please be careful when ordering this .. i tried to return it bc the makeup i bought for it broke me out ... you CANNOT return airbrush makeup or this airbrush machine ...why do i need an airbrush machine if i cannot wear the makeup ... waste of my money.. it&#x27;s a shame to buy something and you are not able to get your money back</li>
            <li> I love this. I&#x27;m not to thrilled about the makeup, I am still searching for what is suitable for my skin but the application is flawless. I absolutely love it. Before I use to use brushes but now everytime I apply my makeup I use this. It is very quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Clogged all the time.  Save your money and buy a quality one.</li>
            <li> My friend went to school for makeup and she had an airbrush compressor.  She did my makeup one day and I couldn&#x27;t believe how fabulous I looked. Then she told me her compressor was over 500 bucks which is wayy too expensive for me. But luckily, I found this!! I did some research but I gotta say, I was pretty nervous to take the risk and spend $$100 on makeup and a compressor based mainly on just reviews, not knowing if it was truly going to work. But I am SO happy I bought this!!! This works amazing!!! The makeup looks just as good as when my friend did it, without the expensive price tag. I just put it on for the first time &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to flaunt myself to the world, it looks SO great!!! I&#x27;m actually a little mad I didn&#x27;t think of this sooner haha. But seriously, forget your regular makeup. BUY THIS!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you do purchase this, definitely go with the glam air makeup which you can also find on amazon. The bottles come a little small but its totally worth it. Love this so much, so so so happy!! :)</li>
            <li> Have used this almost daily for several weeks and have had no issues with it at all. Works perfect for applying make-up, am currently using Glaimair but not as happy with it as I think i should be, and am looking at other options. The machine works great though!</li>
            <li> So this is a great product for the price. I used it for airbrush makeup. The Temptu Pro Silicon Based Foundations is what I used. I think they are a little heavy for this machine. Water based may work better.</li>
            <li> Arrived quick and works great, just make sure you use the right make up with it. Nice and compact, doesnt take up much room in the bathroom at all.</li>
            <li> After a few months of using the item, It stopped working.. Warning!!</li>
            <li> I tried to return it because the product was dead on arrival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO RETURNS ACCEPTED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete waste of money, and time.</li>
            <li> I have only used my Airbrush machine twice, but I LOVE how my foundation looks. I spent lots of time online watching YouTube \\&quot;How to\\&quot; videos, so I had enough of an idea of how to get started with foundation. I did not buy any of the \\&quot;airbrush\\&quot; makeup or kits available online. I mixed my own foundation using my mineral makeup &amp; mixing base (also found those \\&quot;how to\\&quot; instructions online). Just buying the machine save lots of $. They want a fortune for the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The compressor is just as it appears. It is small, plastic and has one button on top. The button has 2 parts: one in the power on/off, the other is Mode for adjusting the force of the air coming out of the \\&quot;gun\\&quot;(Hi, Med, Lo). A flyer about the compressor comes in the box explaining not to use the compressor for more than 20 minutes at a time so it doesn&#x27;t overheat. Also do not push the air speed button fast. As far as compressors go, this is a very low end one. However, that is all I wanted. I am not a professional makeup artist. I don&#x27;t need some big machine in my bathroom for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The hose that attaches to the gun and machine for the air is a good length. It is not too long that it knocks everything else off my counter, but long enough that I could airbrush other parts of my body without moving the machine around. The electric cord is nice &amp; long. I hate those cords that are so short you have to stay in front of a socket. This one would let me have the machine a good 4 feet away from the plug if I needed to get into the shower to spray tan and keep my bathroom from getting tan also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The gun has a needle already installed and an extra in the kit. There is a diagram about the gun under the foam liner of the plastic case the gun comes in. It is helpful to know the different parts in case I have to take it apart or order a part sometime. The gun is easy to hold like a pencil, as the videos say, and the cup holds about a teaspoon of liquid. Since you are only supposed touse 6 drops for full face foundation, there is plenty of room at the top so I don&#x27;t spill anything when moving the gun around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As soon as you turn on the machine air comes out of the nozzle. To disperse the liquid from the cup you pull back on the lever on the top behind the cup with your index finger. The farther back you pull the more liquid sprays out with the air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I confess I haven&#x27;t played around with the different air pressures. That&#x27;s something I need to do. Even the Hi pressure is not too high for skin. Videos say to practice on a piece of paper. I practiced on my face. The first time I looked like Boris Karloff from The Mummy. I ended up with caked on foundation before I realized it. The next time I did better. I had to remember that the mineral makeup needs to set a short time before you see the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I know I will get better with practice. I am interested to see how long the compressor lasts but I am glad I took the chance. I am very happy with my purchase of the Flawless Airbrush.</li>
            <li> I love my airbrush makeup machine, I can apply  makeup in half the time it use to take. It is so easy.</li>
            <li> Great price, great machine. All around wonderful purchase. Totally worth buying. Still can&#x27;t believe how great the price is! Would purchase again if needed.</li>
            <li> I bought it for airbrush makeup application, but I have began using it for spray tans now too! I absolutely love it. Occasionally makeup solution gets a little \\&quot;clogged\\&quot;. I fix by cleaning it or running some purified water through it. Compared to \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; machines- it&#x27;s equal. Don&#x27;t waste your money!! Get this! I use Belloccio and Fetch make up brands. And love those as well. The only tanning solution I&#x27;ve used so far is Norvell- Dark Amber. Love the color and last of tan. If u want an airbrush machine, get this</li>
            <li> I really like this airbrush machine. Easy to use. I use for my eyebrows only; works great! I recommend for others to try out.</li>
            <li> the unit is very quiet.  That is a big plus. Also multiple flow powers, high, medium and low for a soft flow of product.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering a couple more for my other employees.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> So this is my first time I have ever got an airbrush machine for makeup and I am in love. It was cheap enough that I can afford it and it works great. I can finally wear foundation and you cant even tell. I didn&#x27;t buy the set that comes with the make up just the machine but it works and I got it in like 4 days after ordering it so pleased with it. I didn&#x27;t use their makeup cause I just couldn&#x27;t afford to spit out $150 right away on the machine and makeup, however a few weeks Glam air brush makeup medium set for $39.99 instead of theirs and it works great in the machine and on my face :) Oh I have had my machine for about a month in a half and use at least 4x a week and not a problem yet. I am a very happy camper.. lol</li>
            <li> Had another brand that stopped working.  This was less expensive and works great.  Love the different speeds, really happy I purchased this one</li>
            <li> I purchased this airbrush kit for makeup use.My intentions were to purchase this airbrush system and make my own air brush makeup at home. I advise anyone else with this idea to just go ahead and pay the extra money for a bottle of airbrush makeup, none of the recipes iv used thus far have been a sucess. A few tips for make up use : CLEAN YOUR AIRBRUSH AFTER EACH USE, ( with a anti rust formula, preferably something made for sterilizing, or you can purchase cleaner for as little as 5$ ) THIS WILL LENGHTEN THE LIFE OF YOUR MACHINE,PLUS RID ANY BUILDUP OR BACTERIA. IF YOUR AIR BRUSH GUN IS NOT WORKING, YOU MAY BE USING A PRODUCT OF TO THICK CONSISTANCY. (this is why i recomend purchasing cosmetics made for airbrushing) . I ALSO UNPLUG MY AIRBRUSH MACHINE AFTER IM DONE USING IT, JUST TO BE SURE NOT TO BURN OUT THIS TINY LITTLE MOTOR . *THE DIRECTIONS WITH THIS PRODUCT ARE USELESS*  SO IN CONCLUSION, KEEP IT CLEAN, USE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE FOR AIRBRUSHING Nothing thick or clumpy, AND DONT OVER WORK THIS LITTLE MOTOR. if you follow these guidlines you should be fine.  If you do clog ur airbrush gun, take the GUN apart ( i did it w.o directions b.c it has no information on cleaning this maching ) , i soak my gun in BARBICIDE , (it is a anti rust disinfectant used in salons. It can be purchaced at sally beauty or a beauty supply store 7.99 for a  16oz. Bottle) make sure to remove the needle in the gun (which is removed from the back of the gun not the front)  clean out all the crevisis of the gun using a qtip. Air dry and put back together. I hope this helps another women looking to purchase this for makeup use.</li>
            <li> Love this machine although I had one earlier that quit working pretty quickly.  I bought another one anyway hoping this one will be a better made one.  It works great!</li>
            <li> I love the product ....It was definitely to my liking. Not only did it do what it is suppose to do, it was very simple to operate and that makes it all the better. And let&#x27;s not forget the fact that the shipper was great. Shipment was very speedy ( shipped same day my payment was made) that&#x27;s what I call taking care of business....Will definitely purchase via this shipper again !!!!!</li>
            <li> airbrush compressor- a gift for daughter; well received</li>
            <li> i got this one because i want to use airbrush make up. it works really good i don&#x27;t see any difference from other expensive brand</li>
            <li> This product compares to the more expensive ones shown in the TV and magazine ads. The cord is long enough and the machine itself is small enough to sit on the sink or the counter top.</li>
            <li> I think these reviews are a scam. The thing barely blew air through the nozzle. I tried every which way to de-clog it...it shouldn&#x27;t be clogged- ITS BRAND FRICKIN NEW! But alas, another sob story. Just got this new toy and it DOES-NOT-WORK. If someone can message me to get it to work, please do! I am so sad, I wanted to believe in all these great reviews.</li>
