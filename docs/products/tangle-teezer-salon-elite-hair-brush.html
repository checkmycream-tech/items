            <li>Tangle teezer is the best styling product.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful brush, but the seller needs to change the description and name of the item, because it is the Tangle Teezer Original...not Tangle Teezer Salon Elite.</li>

            <li>This is an excellent tool to get out tangles.</li>
            <li>Also, I find it works best for me on damp hair with some leave in or conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is however still the best detangling tool I have used on my hair tlll date</li>
            <li>, i also use it in the shower to detangle my hair while using conditioner and it  is awesome</li>
            <li>Love this product!!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush!!!</li>
            <li>Very good buy.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s very skittish when it comes to brushing because she sometimes gets a tangle or two and it pulls.</li>
            <li>Or even if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s still the ideal brush.</li>
            <li>I feel its great with no handle.</li>
            <li>well it fits great in your hands</li>
            <li>, it is like the happy ending to a story</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as great as it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great brush.</li>
            <li>Then someone suggested tangle teaser iPod to tell them to go fly a kite.</li>
            <li>Yeah I guess you can tell me to go fly a kite.</li>

            <li>We love our Tangle Teezers!!  </li>
            <li>This brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>and amazingly she didn&#x27;t cry or pull away while getting her hair detangled!  </li>
            <li>This Tangle Teezer is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It is freaking amazing!  </li>
            <li>and this saves me lots of time which is great because even though I want my hair to look good</li>
            <li>Will never use another kind of brush again!</li>
            <li>This brush is best for lightly tangled hair.</li>
            <li>They are both good, but it wasn&#x27;t the one I ordered.</li>
            <li>This brush has made her happy to take care of her own hair and doesn&#x27;t complain about hair fixing.</li>
            <li>She LOVED it.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good brush for the tangles based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>Some people may have good results with this brush, but it was not for me.</li>
            <li>i really loved it, it doesnt pull my hair and doesnt break it</li>
            <li>Very easy on the hair and great for getting out the knots.</li>
            <li>And its very easy to grip, doesn&#x27;t fly out of your hand.</li>
            <li>feels great on scalp going to buy more for me and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this after just 2 uses.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these and also spreading the word to my friends!! :-)</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more just to make sure I have one anytime anywhere!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Will be buying more for gifts!</li>
            <li>Not any more!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a couple more for everyone in my family!</li>
            <li>Love this brush!</li>
            <li>In fact after trying the brush my scalp feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>Also, even as amazing as this brush is at detangling hair, please DO NOT brush your hair from root to tip...</li>
            <li>but it was not as amazing as the people on YouTube made it seem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She can brush her own hair now because of this brush.</li>
            <li>If I have to redo a bun or a braid, I use it to arrange my hair in a nice way.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the Boar bristle brush I own.  </li>
            <li>She took it from me and started brushing her own hair and hasn&#x27;t stopped yet.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled and still in awe</li>
            <li>&amp; my son now combs his own hair without me begging.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a nice brush for my daughter who has ethnic curly/kinky/easily tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>so I could get that nice scalp massage that comes with firmer brushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It would also be nice if it had a handle for easier use.</li>
            <li>I probably would have washed the brush and tried it on my own hair, and if it did work as well as the Tangle Teezer</li>
            <li>She can now comb her own hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve followed ever kind of advice and used every product imaginable to get rid of my tangles.</li>
            <li>The Teezer makes VERY easy work out of the most stubborn of knots!</li>
            <li>Bristles bend too easily but does a fair job of surface detangling.</li>
            <li>My hair gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>It gets out all the tangles very easily and with no pain.</li>
            <li>The shape of the brush fits to the hand, so it is very easy to brush your hair from any angle.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my 5 year old and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this thing!</li>
            <li>When I read the reviews, I did not believe that the Tangle Teezer Original Purple is so good.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great choice for kids because of the fun shape and how easy it is to use</li>
            <li>We love this brush.</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughter and it detangles better then anything I have used before.</li>
            <li>Tangle Teezer is OK</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I have hair extensions and this is the best brush to have that detangles instantly.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo cute</li>
            <li>and I get to keep mine:)</li>
            <li>The handle issue might not bother most people, but for me it&#x27;s just too bothersome.</li>
            <li>I swear no one is ever satisfied with anything</li>
            <li>My wife now uses this more than my daughter and they both claim its the greatest bush they&#x27;ve ever used, especially getting the tangles out.</li>
            <li>For example, I found my hair started behaving a lot more after I switched to SLS-free products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK as a brush, but in my opinion it does not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and it took out all of the tangles pain free!  </li>
            <li>OK, I bought this for my dog.  </li>
            <li>I love it and there is peace in our house again,</li>
            <li>I love it for my hair type</li>
            <li>I have noticed my hair has become more fuzzy at the ends</li>
            <li>and I love this brush for myself as well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li>I am able to reduce the time in detangling with this brush.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Way better than the Denman.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t quite sure about this purchase</li>
            <li>Love it, my daughter handles getting her hair brush much better now</li>
            <li>But overall a great brush!</li>
            <li>I was sure I was buying a product in the ilk of &amp;#34;RONCO&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34</li>
            <li>She has not been able to find anything that does not hurt until now.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it &amp;#34;massages&amp;#34; the scalp while brushing.</li>
            <li>bought 7 more as gifts for my friends and will give them at my bachelorette party :)</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>We have given many as gifts, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>but it comes in many colors, including stickers and sparkles.  </li>
            <li>This one is even better-</li>
            <li>Just wish it was cheaper. :)</li>
            <li>I spend more money on hair detangler than I&#x27;d like to share.</li>
            <li>I saw this product in an annual review of beauty products and thought I&#x27;d give it a chance, I&#x27;m sure glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love the tangle teaser.</li>
            <li>It turned out that this is really a magic comb.</li>
            <li>Received today love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute.  </li>
            <li>Love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more for gifts.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I should sell them :)</li>
            <li>so maybe the material is better than it seems.</li>
            <li>and I love using it.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>Yay :)</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I agree with what most people have said on these reviews.</li>
            <li>and I promise the results will be much better :)</li>
            <li>She calls it &#x27;The Magic Comb&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I need to buy more in case</li>
            <li>It does tend to slip out of my hand though, so you need to make sure you get a grip.  </li>
            <li>so they leave mine alone :)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy :)</li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Possibly the best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>it works miracles I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li>This product was okay.</li>
            <li>Bought more for mom, sister, niece, and girlfriends.</li>
            <li>improvement in being able to brush a wiggly two-year-old&#x27;s hair&lt;</li>
            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Her hair is very fine and tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Two days later, she is brushing her hair on her own without me having to ask, no tears and no fights, just beautiful hair.    </li>
            <li>My husband has long curly hair and he was also impressed by it.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much!</li>
            <li>Worked good at first.</li>
            <li>Best brush for long hair.</li>
            <li>Very nice item, High recommend.</li>
            <li>she knows it is hers and is excited to use it instead of the torture device we had before!  </li>
            <li>It glides with ease, easy clean up just run warm water to help remove excess hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely fine, but I have a lot of it and even with top quality products that I use for shampoo, conditioner, damage repair, etc.</li>
            <li>Perfect for wet hair, also for children too.</li>
            <li>Brushes over tangles and leaves top hair smooth, but tangles are still underneath.</li>
            <li>In this case the claims are true!</li>
            <li>But other than that, this is the best tool has that has ever come to my hair&#x27;s way!</li>
            <li>other than that, it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li>I think becasue the teeth give so easily..  </li>
            <li>and I could see it easily damaging your hair with continued use.</li>
            <li>So far this brush appears to be the best at making it straight through the tangles - hopefully avoiding any matting.</li>
            <li>My hair is medium-long and tangles easy, but it is now actually easy to brush out with the Tangle Teezer.</li>
            <li>This product makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>IT IS EASY TO BRUSH</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair, and the knots that become dreadlocks throughout the day, are easy to get out.  </li>
            <li>Teeth are easily manipulated</li>
            <li>This is easy on my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is hip length and tangled easily.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you have strong hair this will probably be just fine.</li>
            <li>After trying this product out for about a week now, I can honestly say this is the first time brushing my hair</li>
            <li>I suppose if a young child has this used on their fine fair, it would be great because it feels so soft</li>
            <li>This brush cut that time down to 45 minutes, and the best thing is that it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>screams- right after i receive this item i put it on a test right away!!!</li>
            <li>fine tooth comb--&gt;boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li>This works wonders with my fine, tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and the tangle teezer seems to pull fewer hairs out compared to a wide-toothed comb.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is easily cleaned and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>It quickly smoothed out the top if the hair, then I have to lift, separate and search.</li>
            <li>Tangle free, easy to use, light to carry.</li>
            <li>He believes that he is an outdoor dog, so he is constantly getting washed and his fine hair gets tangled!!!  </li>
            <li>especially if it&#x27;s all one length, and extremely fine, do not hesitate to try this out, and it&#x27;s a great value for your money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s ergonomic, light, and that the backing is sturdy</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair very static-y if I don&#x27;t use a detangler spray or some kind of serum.</li>
            <li>This brush really works great to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair without it hurting too much.  </li>
            <li>It really works as described!!!  </li>
            <li>got a different color but its very handy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very efficient, and I love that it&#x27;s all waterproof and easy to remove hair that gets stuck while combing.</li>
            <li>But, this is NOT the Salon Elite version of the tangle teezer - this is the Original tangle teezer.</li>
            <li>it is key to the successful use of it.</li>
            <li>Glad to have this product to battle tangles gently!</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Love to item, it really works!</li>
            <li>The hair loss when I brush my hair is reduced SIGNIFICANTLY.  </li>
            <li>It fits perfectly in our daughters small hand</li>
            <li>And with this Tangle Teezer Original Purple just a miracle happened she prichesyvat hair.</li>
            <li>because I ordered Tangle Teezer Salon Elite, but received Original.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY!  </li>
            <li>Great brush for a daughter with long hair that complains when her dad brushes her hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my youngest who has long, somewhat fine, naturally wavy hair and was impressed to the point of amazement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t vouch for using it on any other hair types, but for fine hair; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft &amp; this is my favorite brush!</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about it, just a piece of plastic, plus</li>
            <li>It does detangle hair more gently than a comb or denman brush.  </li>
            <li>but I like The Wet Brush more as it feels better on scalp and brushes their hair better.</li>
            <li>so i got this cuz it was cheap and looked fun for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>Instead of just catching on them, it passed over them and I completely missed them.</li>
            <li>I love this, My 18month son has a head full of beautiful, thick, Ethiopian pencil curls and this &#x27;brush&#x27; get us through his tangles without any problems or tears.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and curly in which this brush is perfect.</li>
            <li>The fact that both mom and daughter are amazed was good enough for</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>The brush that came in the mail is a beautiful dark purple with sparkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that I ditched my regular hairbrush for this Teezer.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has more tangles than straight</li>
            <li>Good for someone with short hair.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me seconds to comb out her hair, there was no snags, no snarls, just lovely straight hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad brush, but it doesn&#x27;t do for me</li>
            <li>I still have some breakage, but it&#x27;s definitely not as bad as before.</li>
            <li>It is supposed to fit just right in you hand.  </li>
            <li>it would just stick there like super glue.</li>
            <li>I brought several more as gifts and my friends &amp; family enjoyed using the Tangle Teezer also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow - I couldn&#x27;t say enough good about this brush!  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of detangling their long curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and effective on just washed or dry hair.</li>
            <li>i wish i had it last week as i had a huge tangle in my extensions and cost a lot to get out by my hair dresser this combs through my hair  very easily  </li>
            <li>Both my grandson(with very long hair) and my son(also longish)  loved its detangling ability.</li>
            <li>Super fast, super smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fast and easy transaction.  </li>
            <li>If you try to just brush right through, you&#x27;ll get the surface layer and it will quickly tangle again&lt;</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look smooth and shinny, and gently gets rid of tangles.</li>
            <li>So, it won&#x27;t eliminate those steps for me, but it makes it so much easier and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It really detangles and leaves hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Since all the bristles were no longer facing the same way, it didn&#x27;t brush my hair as effectively.</li>
            <li>I use this product for my 5 year old grand daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>it works but it could be better to add some soft material on the tip.</li>
            <li>A lot of people were raving about this thing in the natural hair community, and u can never have too many detangling tools.</li>
            <li>Still worth the money.</li>
            <li>This brush is ok, but I won&#x27;t be using it every day and it won&#x27;t be replacing my old hairbrush.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
            <li>I love my hair; but, as far as tangles are concerned, it is a nightmare.</li>
            <li>To be honest if i had a dog that i brushed its hair</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I work from home so rarely use styling products, hair dryers, curling irons, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Tangle Teezer is able to get out nearly all my tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you try it, you will never go back to a regular brush -- it&#x27;s just that good!  </li>
            <li>I found that my daughter&#x27;s fine hair still tangles enough for it to pull in that sensitive area by the ears, BUT it is so much better now because the rest of the tangles are easily undone</li>
            <li>It actually feels nice on my scalp (and gets rid of dandruff flakes easily), detangles without pulling on my hair or hurting my sensitive scalp, and HEY, it&#x27;s purple!</li>
            <li>It has short bristles, and I felt as if it wasn&#x27;t actually brushing my hair--just the very top layer, even when myhair was already mostly detangled.</li>
            <li>I borrow it sometimes when I have knots and it glides right through.</li>
            <li>this comb came right on time</li>
            <li>I honestly wondered if it was actually going to do what it said in the description, but it really does!</li>
            <li>Heard so many great things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am black with extra kinky hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how easy it went through my hair after washing and applying conditioner.</li>
            <li>This brush works great on my 3 year old daughters very long, tangly hair.</li>
            <li>They are defiantly superior for getting out tangles than your average brush.</li>
            <li>Great for gentle detangling with my daughter&#x27;s tight curly tangly hair.  </li>
            <li>Really lovely  Gently and completely detangles without pain.  </li>
            <li>Wednesday super fast ship</li>
            <li>, it takes me a good 15 minutes to detangle my hair after washing it, and no matter how much time I take and how careful I am, I end up with handfuls, brushfuls, and floor covered in piles of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult whose hair has tangled easily all my life.</li>
            <li>Soft bristled tangle combs will brush the top layer, but can&#x27;t suss out really mangled tangles.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very gentle on hair</li>
            <li>and it is very gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>Ordered &amp;#34;Purple Crush,&amp;#34; excited because purple AND pink are my daughter&#x27;s TWO favorite colors.  </li>
            <li>My 5yo daughter has mixed hair with very tight curls AND tangles very easily!!!  </li>
            <li>I thought I liked this brush on wet hair well enough - but what really settled it for me was that my husband, with a long curly-hair pony, really loved it!  </li>
            <li>it does a quick, good job on the wet hair, but really needs to be followed through with a regular brush with long teeth for best results; and on dry hair this is just a starting point.to get through those top layers and of course on girls with wavy hair</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>This is my second Tangle Teezer and I really love this one.</li>
            <li>Well, I got the tangle teezer, and the first thing I did was cut a gash into my finger on the packaging.</li>
            <li>I when out the next day and bought a couple more, a spare for her and one for a friend of ours.</li>
            <li>I was extremely skeptical before I purchased this item, but I am so very, very happy that I did!!!</li>
            <li>I had first read about this brush in the news on the internet.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I first tried it</li>
            <li>the hype is real!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will reduce the tears of brushing as well as brushed hair more often.  </li>
            <li>This brush has been such a phenomenal help.</li>
            <li>I first bought the orange one for my daughter, and thought it was nonsense.  </li>
            <li>This bursh is so pretty</li>
            <li>The Tangle Teezer works pretty well</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>, didn&#x27;t experience that at all my hand and can be get pretty slippery</li>
            <li>I also read that this was similar to a dog brush, who cares it gets the job done and its cute.</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>This item detangles my hair faster and better than a regular brush.  </li>
            <li>Still I like it better than regular brush/comb.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Tangle Teezer 8 years ago.</li>
            <li>It was okay overall, but would still leave hair semi-tangled.</li>
            <li>It worked like magic, and as a Ph.D., I&#x27;m still puzzled how it can possibly work so well!</li>
            <li>The teeth on mine started to wear out and bend at angles causing more breakage than necessary.</li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t fight me (or scream) as much as she did as of this morning before receiving the tangle teezer!</li>
            <li>FIRST OFF, THE BRUSH I RECEIVED DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE- ITS</li>
            <li>I will most certainly be purchasing others in the future!</li>
            <li>There is no tugging or pulling which is great for delicate wet hair, and it really is so easy, you will wonder why you did not come across it before!</li>
            <li>Not only does it not hurt, it actually feels good.</li>
            <li>Wow, how can something that looks so simple be that effective?</li>
            <li>The handheld brush is very easy to hold and it gets the knots out with minimal pulling and hurting.</li>
            <li>They really do live up to their claims and the brush goes right through your hair even if tangled, without causing damage as most brushes would under similar circumstances.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t as effective as a traditional comb, and so I find it takes more strokes to comb everything out, but the process goes much faster as it breaks down those snarls.</li>
            <li>6-yr-old daughter has very straight, fine, shoulder-length hair which she does like to brush because of the daily and nightly tangles.  </li>
            <li>As a tool, as long as it works well for someone, it&#x27;s worthwhile to have.</li>
            <li>I had heard a lot of good things about this brush and was anxious to try it.</li>
            <li>This works far better than any other brush on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li>it does detangle, but not without pulling and tugging--might work on very fine or wet hair--is not a miracle tool</li>
            <li>I had my doubts but tried the Tangle Teezer because we have tried so many other products, most making similar claims.</li>
            <li>Overall, you can see this brush is better than many other brushes.</li>
            <li>If you use it the way it&#x27;s intended (there is a technique), it will take out your tangles quickly and you will be surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>added bonus is that both my kids (8 and 5) love brushing/combing my hair (I have long straight type 1 hair)....</li>
            <li>If you want to carry it in your purse get the compact tangle teezer so the bristles don&#x27;t get bent and become less effective.</li>
            <li>Once again, it worked and it worked even better than using it on dry hair</li>
            <li>this will cause more frizz, so I would not use at all on dry hair unless you are planning on tying it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it certainly helps with the tangles…</li>
            <li>This process still would leave me with a large mass  of hair in my comb.  </li>
            <li>but I have learned how to section my hair so my sections wouldn&#x27;t be too large.</li>
            <li>Great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>Great for detangling on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great used for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I use it when my hair is both wet and dry, and have experienced no hair breakage.</li>
            <li>It is great on wet or dry hair as well.</li>
            <li>Good to be used only on dry hair.</li>
            <li>It works great with wet hair, but dry makes my daughters&#x27; hair really puffy (afro like).</li>
            <li>You really need to try it as long as you have some hair!! :)</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for it because I had see a video review of the item, and it was highly rated.</li>
            <li>Like some reviews said it only smooth out the hair and doesn&#x27;t really detangle the hair.</li>
            <li>and she does not cry nearly as much when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li>It really works-</li>
            <li>its gentle.</li>
            <li>Not just gentle on hair, but on your scalp as well.  </li>
            <li>My daughter wants mine, so I&#x27;m going to give it to her</li>
            <li>This hair brush really is heaven sent.  </li>
            <li>While this is probably a feature designed to avoid ripping your hair out, it&#x27;s very scratchy</li>
            <li>It really does work and now my granddaughter doesn&#x27;t mind washing her hair.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone who has very curly hair.</li>
            <li>For looser curled hair, or perhaps even straight hair, I&#x27;d give this a go.</li>
            <li>Bristles are gentle and seems like this could use replacing about once a year or so</li>
            <li>It has saved so much time and my hair too.  </li>
            <li>She does not complain as much as she used too</li>
            <li>This brush works so very well.</li>
            <li>It really is the easiest brush I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to comb it while wet</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to spend so much time on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>The brush works even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Works really well for both my daughters and my wife.  </li>
            <li>This works very well on my toddler&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>Fast processing and shipping.</li>
            <li>I read so much hype about this thing that I went ahead and bought it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this tangle teezer, because I was looking for a brush that would gently get knots out without breaking hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok to brush out the knots, however, the brush keep slipping out of my hand when I brush my girls&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go through the hair very well though.  </li>
            <li>If you have thin curly hair this works great</li>
            <li>I don´t really see the functionality of this product, it says no tangles and no teezer</li>
            <li>It really makes what is promised.</li>
            <li>and it removes the tangles very well.</li>
            <li>Getting ready for school in the morning always ended in tears for somebody while attempting to get a brush through their hair.</li>
            <li>Then came the real test.  </li>
            <li>(daughter still complains when brushing), but I&#x27;m REALLY DISSATISFIED with Amazon sellers who DO NOT SEND WHAT IS PICTURED.</li>
            <li>and I notice it does not pull as much out as with a comb.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Has made our morning ritual much quicker.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t even have that much hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this brush for my daughter because she cries so much with her tangles.</li>
            <li>It gently detangles my hair with out breakage.</li>
            <li>Everyone were talking so much about this brush</li>
            <li>Scalp stimulating bristles GENTLY groom your hair, and</li>
            <li>, life is so much easier, combing through her hair releases the tangles with ease.</li>
            <li>It is really a miracle.</li>
            <li>it really does work on hair, extensions, and even wigs.</li>
            <li>This product really helped and now she combs her hair without any fuss.</li>
            <li>It really gets the tangles out.  </li>
            <li>I wish that I would have bought this sooner as it really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>After using this for a week, I really like the tangle teezer.  </li>
            <li>I can see how it teeze the tangles, but it&#x27;s really surface brushing.</li>
            <li>Every brush I have ever tried on my 2A/2B hair has pulled on my hair so much and the amount of shed I would get was so fustrating.  </li>
            <li>It may seem time intensive, but this will really undo all of the tangles.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tangles easily whether it&#x27;s cut short or long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a difference with getting rid of tangles than a brush</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair that often catches a lot of tangles.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really anything to hold on to.  </li>
            <li>It takes out tangles so much easier than anything I have used before.  </li>
            <li>They used to only endorse boar bristle brushes until the last time I was there and saw they were peddling something very similar to this, saying it was great for not causing damage.</li>
            <li>But this one makes things much easier and i am not regret choosing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what exactly makes it so effective in untangling.  </li>
            <li>This works great on my 5 year old AA daughter&#x27;s hair (thick 4b/4c hair).</li>
            <li>Usually after washing my hair, I would require a hand full of conditioner  or more just to get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li>I find myself reaching for my old brush with almost the same effect and better massage on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Of course this brush doesn&#x27;t take out knots, but WOW does it work to keep the knots from ever forming!!!  </li>
            <li>my 9 year old loves it!!!</li>
            <li>I have a large quantity of fine, long hair.</li>
            <li>I was a complete skeptic at first, but with all of the positive online reviews, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Her long hair tangles easily</li>
            <li>I have tons of frizzy long easily knotted wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product for a little one who hates tangles!</li>
            <li>However, there are probably other ways you can try to manage tangly hair they may or may not work better for you.</li>
            <li>(other family members are now eyeballing my brush, so I suspect I may have to purchase more of them</li>
            <li>They are selling &amp;#34;Tangle Teezer Salon Elite Hair Brush, Purple Crush&amp;#34;, but what actually shipped is not the Salon Elite, is The Original.</li>
            <li>It took long time to arrive and it isn&#x27;t inexpensive, however it was totally worth the wait and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>For reference, I have long, fine hair but plenty of it.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been a source of concern because it is thick and fine and tangles really easily.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE LONG BABY FINE HAIR...</li>
            <li>This is the greatest thing that has happened to me since I came out of the womb with a thick head of dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li>Amazing little gadget!  </li>
            <li>My grand daughter doesn&#x27;t like her hair combed after her bath because it usually pulls her hair and the tangle teaser goes right through her hair.</li>
            <li>I have very long thick hair and it works incredibly.</li>
            <li>A great little brush for my 4 year old who cries when her hair is brushed.</li>
            <li>I have very long (almost to my waist) extremely fine hair.</li>
            <li>The tangle teezer is light and ergonomic, which makes it easier to work with for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>works great for my hair, but when wet it does pull out hair only draw back</li>
            <li>I really wish they would put a normal handle on this brush.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to use this until it runs down unless there coming out with a brush even better than this.</li>
            <li>I have fine natuarally wavy hairy that tangles easily, both wet and dry.</li>
            <li>I just love that my time was cut down to more than half and still efficiently detangles her hair.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s a whole new person.  </li>
            <li>You may need more or less silicones, a trim, more deep conditioning, or something else entirely.</li>
            <li>The main point is to store the brush bristles up.</li>
            <li>but I can not necessarily assume it is or isn&#x27;t this product since I have added additional factors to my hair such as heat, and more styling.</li>
            <li>We detangle in sections, and this brush does the job quickly and relatively painlessly.</li>
            <li>This was a waste of effort more for straightened or naturally straight hsir types, I felt like I was ripping my hair</li>
            <li>I got the tangle teezer for my daughter (ok, and my sanity) for her 2nd birthday next week.  </li>
            <li>This is very soft and it really does help with brushing out the swirls and curls.</li>
            <li>your child has very curly hair and a sensitive scalp, do try this brush!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to the kinky curlies out there.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li>She loves it and highly recommends it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My daughter has beautiful, long, thick hair (envious!), but it was always a battle trying to brush/comb it due to so many tangles.  </li>
            <li>She has very long, fine hair that gets tangled easily, but this brush is not enough to get through her hair, even starting at the bottom and working your way up as you get the tangles out at the bottom.</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, this cheap-looking little lump of plastic is pure magic.</li>
            <li>I had to hold my three year old down to brush her hair, so after a rough brushing morning I got on Amazon and purchased this brush , best thing I&#x27;ve done in a long time !  </li>
            <li>wow, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It changed our lives getting my 4 year old daughters hair ready.</li>
            <li>It may sound like it&#x27;s ripping out your hair, but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li>I bought the tangle teezer in hopes of being able to skip a few steps in my detangling routine, and failing that, I wanted something I could bring with me to touch up.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t rip hair out like normal brushes do.</li>
            <li>I got the fun pink and purple color, which is pretty close to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve fought over messy hair for years (mostly because of brushing out the tangles).  </li>
            <li>Bath times are always fine...but combing our wet hair post bath let to crying , grumpy kids - even after I tried every kind of conditioner on the market!  </li>
            <li>just because i live it so much I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It works very well on the messy long hair, very smooth and very gentle.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no hard pokey bristles.  </li>
            <li>This brush takes a little extra work to get all the tangles out, but that&#x27;s ok because she doesn&#x27;t DREAD me brushing her hair anymore!</li>
            <li>When I finally used this I could not believe something so inexpensive, so easy to use, so simple in construction and design could work...</li>
            <li>But..... it does not have a handle, and it is extremely lightweight (too light for my liking); therefore, every time I use it, it goes flying out of my hand</li>
            <li>Read other reviews and thought I would try it after another tear filled morning trying to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>I live this</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure the first time I used the Tangle Teezer due to my very fine, easy to knot hair when wet.  </li>
            <li>It can be difficult to clean this brush, but doing it slowly by hand and picking out the lint is the most effective way I have found.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a month or so now and the only downside is that some of the bristles are starting to bend (they&#x27;re a light plastic)</li>
            <li>It is gentle on hair and does not pull out nearly as much hair as a regular paddle brush.</li>
            <li>You have to gently comb the tangles out from bottom to top especially if you have tightly curly hair.</li>
            <li>My girls have always been very sensitive about getting their hair combed.</li>
            <li>I have 4 girls and 2 of them have very sensitive heads</li>
            <li>I would recommend this very soft brush to help maintain your hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 11 year old great granddaughter, who is mixed race with very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure its safe.</li>
            <li>Although the salon elite and the original are very similar, they are NOT the same brush.</li>
            <li>It has completely cut done on the time to detangle her hair and with NO TEARS!</li>
            <li>This is the second one I buy, mom took my first one.</li>
            <li>Kiddo has had a lot of success with this hairbrush, as long as we replace it when it gets bent bristles.</li>
            <li>(shes 8) and get all the tangles out without asking for help or crying because it pulls!  </li>
            <li>Not so good with really long hair, becomes difficult to hold and arm fatigue sets in rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this soft brush for those transitioning or even those who already have the natural hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair a bit poofy at the roots where m natural hair is growing in, but that just might be me adjusting to my new grade of hair.</li>
            <li>What used to be an unpleasant experience every morning, full of tears &amp; frustration, is now super easy.</li>
            <li>Its worth every single penny you pay for it.</li>
            <li>When I first started to use it I compared it with a variety of styling tools that I previous owed and this brush seems to detangle my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and straight and there is quite a bit of it although I would not say that it is thick overall.</li>
            <li>There is a large likelihood that the bristles will get compressed or outright break, so while the casing is sturdy and functional, the actual brushing bit is not.  </li>
            <li>we have 2 hair types in this house thick curls, and fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>(I literally have a large cardboard box filled with hair products that I purchased to try that did not work and that I&#x27;m stuck with - at least $2k worth!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>--it sounds like your hair is getting ripped out (of course it isn&#x27;t, but the loud noise surprised me)&lt;br /&gt;*awkward to hold in certain positions on head on self and especially when trying to brush someone else&#x27;s hair for them&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I still feel as though another brush or comb would be needed to complete the grooming.</li>
            <li>My daughter(4 yrs old)   </li>
            <li>I use this Tangle Teezer daily for my TBL, straight hair</li>
            <li>But for my adult hair, this can&#x27;t even get the bristles to go through my hair.</li>
            <li>and she said, \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li>My daughter has the thickness hair and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>I use this to detangle my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Holds up well even when we use it frequently in the bathtub with conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Is it completely ouch-free?</li>
            <li>But it results in far fewer complaints.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my 3 year old daughter who&#x27;s hair is always tangled.  </li>
            <li>and it makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles do not snag on my hair, but they do feel flimsy, especially if my hair is very tangled.</li>
            <li>, I have all kinds of brushes and this doesn&#x27;t look that much different from them but the technology into is absolutely brilliant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still have to be somewhat gentle on tangles, but with this brush, I only have to brush a couple of times to get even the nastiest of tangles out.</li>
            <li>It has very bendy bristles that do not hurt and are different sizes in height.</li>
            <li>Review from my 8 year old daughter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has much thinner hair than I do, and she says the same thing.</li>
            <li>She also has a sensitive scalp and dislikes hair brushing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a white girl, it&#x27;s not even like I have very textured hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written because I am THAT passionate about this brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush runs thru with complete ease.</li>
            <li>My daughter has extremely naturally, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>It gets tangles out, nearly tear-free.  </li>
            <li>With my old brush sometimes it would catch in tangles and even break my hair, causing split ends.  </li>
            <li>The plastic brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this upon my entrance to growing my natural hair - 4c 4b type.</li>
            <li>Once brushed, the hair is very silky and stays silky throughout the day.</li>
            <li>and wow...</li>
            <li>I can say this has improved our mornings considerably because it doesn&#x27;t agitate an already sleepy or moody child.  </li>
            <li>As a result, I drop it nearly every time I use it.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old brat likes it.</li>
            <li>I have 4a/b natural hair.</li>
            <li>Normal brushes such as Denmans normally pull out my hair.</li>
            <li>Even after using on wet hair and tying it back; by the time it was dry those snarls were back, more so on the underside where the teeth and not long or strong enough to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure how the teeth in this brush are made,but they easily untangle any knot in hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth buying if you&#x27;ve tried other kinds of combs and brushes for tangled hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say about the tangle teezer is that you have to detangle in small sections to make sure you are getting the ends to the roots detangled.</li>
            <li>Take out the tangles quickly and with a lot less &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>For my fine, curly, prone-to-tangle hair, this product is essentially a curry-brush with soft, rather than stiff, molded plastic bristles.</li>
            <li>Our daughter&#x27;s hair is long and curly, which really equals compliments and difficulty.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this for anyone with long and/or tangle prone hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it on her hair wet</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for to replace another brush for wet hair.  </li>
            <li>My child has so many tangles in her long, fine hair and no matter how hard I try, she always ends up crying and asking me to stop.</li>
            <li>And finding a product that will work that won&#x27;t leave it greasy or weigh it down is extremely rare.</li>
            <li>old daughter has naturally curly hair and constantly plays with it by twisting it with her fingers and causing a rats nest and trying to comb her hair causes her to cry out in pain</li>
            <li>This easily gets out the snarls out of my thick hair.</li>
            <li>It looks like a rip-off when you first open the package because it looks cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I was using a wide tooth comb and it seemed that my hair would just tangle right back up.  </li>
            <li>really does go thru wet hair without major pulling.</li>
            <li>So, I took a chance on the tangle teezer and am shocked to giving this product a great review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 10-year old granddaughter who has long naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>However, when I actually used the Tangle Teezer,  I changed my mind completely.  </li>
            <li>Its so gentle and the hair loss is minimal.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old has waist length hair that seems to get tangled constantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning to natural Hair from permed/processed hair and I definitely needed something to help with the tangles and knots</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to those with natural hair.</li>
            <li>My youngest daughter is only 7 years old.</li>
            <li>I have long coarse hair and this brush makes it so easy for me to brush my hair dry or wet.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>You may still need to untangle bad snarls by hand (as any loving long-haired should!), but overall this brush makes the job of keeping extra long hair so much easier!</li>
            <li>then It gets hard to clean in between the bristles.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it really hurts when I use other combs.</li>
            <li>Easily removing tangles results in less stress on hair and less breakage.  </li>
            <li>This is well known in the African American natural hair community.</li>
            <li>Recieved the hot pink one in the mail from amazon the other day for my 4 year old who has curly hair.</li>
            <li>She actually requests that we use this brush and no other.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was skeptical about all the super claims for this brush.</li>
            <li>I have super coarse, curly hair that usually takes 2 hours to detangle and style.  </li>
            <li>Love that the bristles are not TOO sharp that they are painful to use, but are sharp enough that they give the scalp a kind of &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; when you stroke the brush through your hair.</li>
            <li>My four year old granddaughter has long hair that develops tangles and sometimes knots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important if you have thick hair to separate your hair into 4 to 6 smaller sections and go through each one individually.</li>
            <li>I was really wary of ordering this product, but with very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine hair that is very long.</li>
            <li>the brush works really well, except i ordered a purple one and received a black one.</li>
            <li>This hair brush works very well in terms of untangling my hair (both wet and dry).</li>
            <li>It can detangle loose tangles fairly well, if you isolate the tangle and work from the bottom up in tiny chunks, but I found it to be almost useless for tighter tangles or larger loose tangles.</li>
            <li>But with a little practice, becomes much easier.  </li>
            <li>, she is in her mid 60&#x27;s &amp; has always had combing issues with her fine ultra thin hair, it has always been tangled &amp; my mother sometimes would say \\&quot;I should just shave it</li>
            <li>This little brush really, truly, DOES work (almost instantly) to eliminate tangles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also if you get a tangle spot it helps clear that path with minimal to no hair lost.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Tangle teezer is the best styling product.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful brush, but the seller needs to change the description and name of the item, because it is the Tangle Teezer Original...not Tangle Teezer Salon Elite.</li>

            <li> She&#x27;s very skittish when it comes to brushing because she sometimes gets a tangle or two and it pulls.</li>
            <li> Or even if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s still the ideal brush.</li>
            <li> I feel its great with no handle.</li>
            <li> well it fits great in your hands</li>
            <li> , it is like the happy ending to a story</li>

            <li> but glad I took the chance on this one!!  </li>
            <li> We love our Tangle Teezers!!  </li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> and amazingly she didn&#x27;t cry or pull away while getting her hair detangled!  </li>
            <li> This Tangle Teezer is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It is freaking amazing!  </li>
            <li> and this saves me lots of time which is great because even though I want my hair to look good</li>
            <li> Will never use another kind of brush again!</li>
            <li> This brush is best for lightly tangled hair.</li>
            <li> They are both good, but it wasn&#x27;t the one I ordered.</li>
            <li> This brush has made her happy to take care of her own hair and doesn&#x27;t complain about hair fixing.</li>
            <li> She LOVED it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good brush for the tangles based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> Some people may have good results with this brush, but it was not for me.</li>
            <li> i really loved it, it doesnt pull my hair and doesnt break it</li>
            <li> Very easy on the hair and great for getting out the knots.</li>
            <li> And its very easy to grip, doesn&#x27;t fly out of your hand.</li>
            <li> feels great on scalp going to buy more for me and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this after just 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these and also spreading the word to my friends!! :-)</li>
            <li> I bought 2 more just to make sure I have one anytime anywhere!!</li>

            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a couple more for everyone in my family!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!</li>
            <li> In fact after trying the brush my scalp feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> Also, even as amazing as this brush is at detangling hair, please DO NOT brush your hair from root to tip...</li>
            <li> but it was not as amazing as the people on YouTube made it seem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She can brush her own hair now because of this brush.</li>
            <li> If I have to redo a bun or a braid, I use it to arrange my hair in a nice way.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the Boar bristle brush I own.  </li>
            <li> She took it from me and started brushing her own hair and hasn&#x27;t stopped yet.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled and still in awe</li>
            <li> &amp; my son now combs his own hair without me begging.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a nice brush for my daughter who has ethnic curly/kinky/easily tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> so I could get that nice scalp massage that comes with firmer brushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It would also be nice if it had a handle for easier use.</li>
            <li> I probably would have washed the brush and tried it on my own hair, and if it did work as well as the Tangle Teezer</li>
            <li> She can now comb her own hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed ever kind of advice and used every product imaginable to get rid of my tangles.</li>
            <li> The Teezer makes VERY easy work out of the most stubborn of knots!</li>
            <li> Bristles bend too easily but does a fair job of surface detangling.</li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> It gets out all the tangles very easily and with no pain.</li>
            <li> The shape of the brush fits to the hand, so it is very easy to brush your hair from any angle.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my 5 year old and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this thing!</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews, I did not believe that the Tangle Teezer Original Purple is so good.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great choice for kids because of the fun shape and how easy it is to use</li>
            <li> We love this brush.</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughter and it detangles better then anything I have used before.</li>
            <li> Tangle Teezer is OK</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I have hair extensions and this is the best brush to have that detangles instantly.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo cute</li>
            <li> and I get to keep mine:)</li>
            <li> The handle issue might not bother most people, but for me it&#x27;s just too bothersome.</li>
            <li> I swear no one is ever satisfied with anything</li>
            <li> My wife now uses this more than my daughter and they both claim its the greatest bush they&#x27;ve ever used, especially getting the tangles out.</li>
            <li> For example, I found my hair started behaving a lot more after I switched to SLS-free products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK as a brush, but in my opinion it does not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> and it took out all of the tangles pain free!  </li>
            <li> OK, I bought this for my dog.  </li>
            <li> I love it and there is peace in our house again,</li>
            <li> I love it for my hair type</li>
            <li> I have noticed my hair has become more fuzzy at the ends</li>
            <li> and I love this brush for myself as well.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li> I am able to reduce the time in detangling with this brush.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Way better than the Denman.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t quite sure about this purchase</li>
            <li> Love it, my daughter handles getting her hair brush much better now</li>
            <li> But overall a great brush!</li>
            <li> I was sure I was buying a product in the ilk of &amp;#34;RONCO&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34</li>
            <li> She has not been able to find anything that does not hurt until now.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it &amp;#34;massages&amp;#34; the scalp while brushing.</li>
            <li> bought 7 more as gifts for my friends and will give them at my bachelorette party :)</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> We have given many as gifts, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> but it comes in many colors, including stickers and sparkles.  </li>
            <li> This one is even better-</li>
            <li> Just wish it was cheaper. :)</li>
            <li> I spend more money on hair detangler than I&#x27;d like to share.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in an annual review of beauty products and thought I&#x27;d give it a chance, I&#x27;m sure glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love the tangle teaser.</li>
            <li> It turned out that this is really a magic comb.</li>
            <li> Received today love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute.  </li>
            <li> Love this thing.  </li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more for gifts.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should sell them :)</li>
            <li> so maybe the material is better than it seems.</li>
            <li> and I love using it.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> Yay :)</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I agree with what most people have said on these reviews.</li>
            <li> and I promise the results will be much better :)</li>
            <li> She calls it &#x27;The Magic Comb&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I need to buy more in case</li>
            <li> It does tend to slip out of my hand though, so you need to make sure you get a grip.  </li>
            <li> so they leave mine alone :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy :)</li>
            <li> It is OK.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> it works miracles I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> This product was okay.</li>
            <li> Bought more for mom, sister, niece, and girlfriends.</li>
            <li> improvement in being able to brush a wiggly two-year-old&#x27;s hair&lt;</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Her hair is very fine and tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Two days later, she is brushing her hair on her own without me having to ask, no tears and no fights, just beautiful hair.    </li>
            <li> My husband has long curly hair and he was also impressed by it.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> Worked good at first.</li>
            <li> Best brush for long hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice item, High recommend.</li>
            <li> she knows it is hers and is excited to use it instead of the torture device we had before!  </li>
            <li> It glides with ease, easy clean up just run warm water to help remove excess hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine, but I have a lot of it and even with top quality products that I use for shampoo, conditioner, damage repair, etc.</li>
            <li> Perfect for wet hair, also for children too.</li>
            <li> Brushes over tangles and leaves top hair smooth, but tangles are still underneath.</li>
            <li> In this case the claims are true!</li>
            <li> But other than that, this is the best tool has that has ever come to my hair&#x27;s way!</li>
            <li> other than that, it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> I think becasue the teeth give so easily..  </li>
            <li> and I could see it easily damaging your hair with continued use.</li>
            <li> So far this brush appears to be the best at making it straight through the tangles - hopefully avoiding any matting.</li>
            <li> My hair is medium-long and tangles easy, but it is now actually easy to brush out with the Tangle Teezer.</li>
            <li> This product makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> IT IS EASY TO BRUSH</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair, and the knots that become dreadlocks throughout the day, are easy to get out.  </li>
            <li> Teeth are easily manipulated</li>
            <li> This is easy on my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is hip length and tangled easily.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you have strong hair this will probably be just fine.</li>
            <li> After trying this product out for about a week now, I can honestly say this is the first time brushing my hair</li>
            <li> I suppose if a young child has this used on their fine fair, it would be great because it feels so soft</li>
            <li> This brush cut that time down to 45 minutes, and the best thing is that it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> screams- right after i receive this item i put it on a test right away!!!</li>
            <li> fine tooth comb--&gt;boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> This works wonders with my fine, tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and the tangle teezer seems to pull fewer hairs out compared to a wide-toothed comb.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is easily cleaned and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> It quickly smoothed out the top if the hair, then I have to lift, separate and search.</li>
            <li> Tangle free, easy to use, light to carry.</li>
            <li> He believes that he is an outdoor dog, so he is constantly getting washed and his fine hair gets tangled!!!  </li>
            <li> especially if it&#x27;s all one length, and extremely fine, do not hesitate to try this out, and it&#x27;s a great value for your money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s ergonomic, light, and that the backing is sturdy</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair very static-y if I don&#x27;t use a detangler spray or some kind of serum.</li>
            <li> This brush really works great to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair without it hurting too much.  </li>
            <li> It really works as described!!!  </li>
            <li> got a different color but its very handy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very efficient, and I love that it&#x27;s all waterproof and easy to remove hair that gets stuck while combing.</li>
            <li> But, this is NOT the Salon Elite version of the tangle teezer - this is the Original tangle teezer.</li>
            <li> it is key to the successful use of it.</li>
            <li> Glad to have this product to battle tangles gently!</li>
            <li> but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love to item, it really works!</li>
            <li> The hair loss when I brush my hair is reduced SIGNIFICANTLY.  </li>
            <li> It fits perfectly in our daughters small hand</li>
            <li> And with this Tangle Teezer Original Purple just a miracle happened she prichesyvat hair.</li>
            <li> because I ordered Tangle Teezer Salon Elite, but received Original.</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH THE MONEY!  </li>
            <li> Great brush for a daughter with long hair that complains when her dad brushes her hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my youngest who has long, somewhat fine, naturally wavy hair and was impressed to the point of amazement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for using it on any other hair types, but for fine hair; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft &amp; this is my favorite brush!</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about it, just a piece of plastic, plus</li>
            <li> It does detangle hair more gently than a comb or denman brush.  </li>
            <li> but I like The Wet Brush more as it feels better on scalp and brushes their hair better.</li>
            <li> so i got this cuz it was cheap and looked fun for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> Instead of just catching on them, it passed over them and I completely missed them.</li>
            <li> I love this, My 18month son has a head full of beautiful, thick, Ethiopian pencil curls and this &#x27;brush&#x27; get us through his tangles without any problems or tears.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly in which this brush is perfect.</li>
            <li> The fact that both mom and daughter are amazed was good enough for</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> The brush that came in the mail is a beautiful dark purple with sparkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good that I ditched my regular hairbrush for this Teezer.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has more tangles than straight</li>
            <li> Good for someone with short hair.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me seconds to comb out her hair, there was no snags, no snarls, just lovely straight hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad brush, but it doesn&#x27;t do for me</li>
            <li> I still have some breakage, but it&#x27;s definitely not as bad as before.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to fit just right in you hand.  </li>
            <li> it would just stick there like super glue.</li>
            <li> I brought several more as gifts and my friends &amp; family enjoyed using the Tangle Teezer also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow - I couldn&#x27;t say enough good about this brush!  </li>
            <li> Does a good job of detangling their long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective on just washed or dry hair.</li>
            <li> i wish i had it last week as i had a huge tangle in my extensions and cost a lot to get out by my hair dresser this combs through my hair  very easily  </li>
            <li> Both my grandson(with very long hair) and my son(also longish)  loved its detangling ability.</li>
            <li> Super fast, super smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fast and easy transaction.  </li>
            <li> If you try to just brush right through, you&#x27;ll get the surface layer and it will quickly tangle again&lt;</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look smooth and shinny, and gently gets rid of tangles.</li>
            <li> So, it won&#x27;t eliminate those steps for me, but it makes it so much easier and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It really detangles and leaves hair smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> Since all the bristles were no longer facing the same way, it didn&#x27;t brush my hair as effectively.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my 5 year old grand daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> it works but it could be better to add some soft material on the tip.</li>
            <li> A lot of people were raving about this thing in the natural hair community, and u can never have too many detangling tools.</li>
            <li> Still worth the money.</li>
            <li> This brush is ok, but I won&#x27;t be using it every day and it won&#x27;t be replacing my old hairbrush.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
            <li> I love my hair; but, as far as tangles are concerned, it is a nightmare.</li>
            <li> To be honest if i had a dog that i brushed its hair</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I work from home so rarely use styling products, hair dryers, curling irons, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Tangle Teezer is able to get out nearly all my tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you try it, you will never go back to a regular brush -- it&#x27;s just that good!  </li>
            <li> I found that my daughter&#x27;s fine hair still tangles enough for it to pull in that sensitive area by the ears, BUT it is so much better now because the rest of the tangles are easily undone</li>
            <li> It actually feels nice on my scalp (and gets rid of dandruff flakes easily), detangles without pulling on my hair or hurting my sensitive scalp, and HEY, it&#x27;s purple!</li>
            <li> It has short bristles, and I felt as if it wasn&#x27;t actually brushing my hair--just the very top layer, even when myhair was already mostly detangled.</li>
            <li> I borrow it sometimes when I have knots and it glides right through.</li>
            <li> this comb came right on time</li>
            <li> I honestly wondered if it was actually going to do what it said in the description, but it really does!</li>
            <li> Heard so many great things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am black with extra kinky hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how easy it went through my hair after washing and applying conditioner.</li>
            <li> This brush works great on my 3 year old daughters very long, tangly hair.</li>
            <li> They are defiantly superior for getting out tangles than your average brush.</li>
            <li> Great for gentle detangling with my daughter&#x27;s tight curly tangly hair.  </li>
            <li> Really lovely  Gently and completely detangles without pain.  </li>
            <li> Wednesday super fast ship</li>
            <li> , it takes me a good 15 minutes to detangle my hair after washing it, and no matter how much time I take and how careful I am, I end up with handfuls, brushfuls, and floor covered in piles of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult whose hair has tangled easily all my life.</li>
            <li> Soft bristled tangle combs will brush the top layer, but can&#x27;t suss out really mangled tangles.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very gentle on hair</li>
            <li> and it is very gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered &amp;#34;Purple Crush,&amp;#34; excited because purple AND pink are my daughter&#x27;s TWO favorite colors.  </li>
            <li> My 5yo daughter has mixed hair with very tight curls AND tangles very easily!!!  </li>
            <li> I thought I liked this brush on wet hair well enough - but what really settled it for me was that my husband, with a long curly-hair pony, really loved it!  </li>
            <li> it does a quick, good job on the wet hair, but really needs to be followed through with a regular brush with long teeth for best results; and on dry hair this is just a starting point.to get through those top layers and of course on girls with wavy hair</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> This is my second Tangle Teezer and I really love this one.</li>
            <li> Well, I got the tangle teezer, and the first thing I did was cut a gash into my finger on the packaging.</li>
            <li> I when out the next day and bought a couple more, a spare for her and one for a friend of ours.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical before I purchased this item, but I am so very, very happy that I did!!!</li>
            <li> I had first read about this brush in the news on the internet.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I first tried it</li>
            <li> the hype is real!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will reduce the tears of brushing as well as brushed hair more often.  </li>
            <li> This brush has been such a phenomenal help.</li>
            <li> I first bought the orange one for my daughter, and thought it was nonsense.  </li>
            <li> This bursh is so pretty</li>
            <li> The Tangle Teezer works pretty well</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> , didn&#x27;t experience that at all my hand and can be get pretty slippery</li>
            <li> I also read that this was similar to a dog brush, who cares it gets the job done and its cute.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> This item detangles my hair faster and better than a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> Still I like it better than regular brush/comb.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Tangle Teezer 8 years ago.</li>
            <li> It was okay overall, but would still leave hair semi-tangled.</li>
            <li> It worked like magic, and as a Ph.D., I&#x27;m still puzzled how it can possibly work so well!</li>
            <li> The teeth on mine started to wear out and bend at angles causing more breakage than necessary.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t fight me (or scream) as much as she did as of this morning before receiving the tangle teezer!</li>
            <li> FIRST OFF, THE BRUSH I RECEIVED DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE- ITS</li>
            <li> I will most certainly be purchasing others in the future!</li>
            <li> There is no tugging or pulling which is great for delicate wet hair, and it really is so easy, you will wonder why you did not come across it before!</li>
            <li> Not only does it not hurt, it actually feels good.</li>
            <li> Wow, how can something that looks so simple be that effective?</li>
            <li> The handheld brush is very easy to hold and it gets the knots out with minimal pulling and hurting.</li>
            <li> They really do live up to their claims and the brush goes right through your hair even if tangled, without causing damage as most brushes would under similar circumstances.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t as effective as a traditional comb, and so I find it takes more strokes to comb everything out, but the process goes much faster as it breaks down those snarls.</li>
            <li> 6-yr-old daughter has very straight, fine, shoulder-length hair which she does like to brush because of the daily and nightly tangles.  </li>
            <li> As a tool, as long as it works well for someone, it&#x27;s worthwhile to have.</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot of good things about this brush and was anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> This works far better than any other brush on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li> it does detangle, but not without pulling and tugging--might work on very fine or wet hair--is not a miracle tool</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but tried the Tangle Teezer because we have tried so many other products, most making similar claims.</li>
            <li> Overall, you can see this brush is better than many other brushes.</li>
            <li> If you use it the way it&#x27;s intended (there is a technique), it will take out your tangles quickly and you will be surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> added bonus is that both my kids (8 and 5) love brushing/combing my hair (I have long straight type 1 hair)....</li>
            <li> If you want to carry it in your purse get the compact tangle teezer so the bristles don&#x27;t get bent and become less effective.</li>
            <li> Once again, it worked and it worked even better than using it on dry hair</li>
            <li> this will cause more frizz, so I would not use at all on dry hair unless you are planning on tying it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it certainly helps with the tangles…</li>
            <li> This process still would leave me with a large mass  of hair in my comb.  </li>
            <li> but I have learned how to section my hair so my sections wouldn&#x27;t be too large.</li>
            <li> Great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Great for detangling on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great used for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair is both wet and dry, and have experienced no hair breakage.</li>
            <li> It is great on wet or dry hair as well.</li>
            <li> Good to be used only on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It works great with wet hair, but dry makes my daughters&#x27; hair really puffy (afro like).</li>
            <li> You really need to try it as long as you have some hair!! :)</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for it because I had see a video review of the item, and it was highly rated.</li>
            <li> Like some reviews said it only smooth out the hair and doesn&#x27;t really detangle the hair.</li>
            <li> and she does not cry nearly as much when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li> It really works-</li>
            <li> its gentle.</li>
            <li> Not just gentle on hair, but on your scalp as well.  </li>
            <li> My daughter wants mine, so I&#x27;m going to give it to her</li>
            <li> This hair brush really is heaven sent.  </li>
            <li> While this is probably a feature designed to avoid ripping your hair out, it&#x27;s very scratchy</li>
            <li> It really does work and now my granddaughter doesn&#x27;t mind washing her hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who has very curly hair.</li>
            <li> For looser curled hair, or perhaps even straight hair, I&#x27;d give this a go.</li>
            <li> Bristles are gentle and seems like this could use replacing about once a year or so</li>
            <li> It has saved so much time and my hair too.  </li>
            <li> She does not complain as much as she used too</li>
            <li> This brush works so very well.</li>
            <li> It really is the easiest brush I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to comb it while wet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to spend so much time on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> The brush works even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works really well for both my daughters and my wife.  </li>
            <li> This works very well on my toddler&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> Fast processing and shipping.</li>
            <li> I read so much hype about this thing that I went ahead and bought it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this tangle teezer, because I was looking for a brush that would gently get knots out without breaking hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to brush out the knots, however, the brush keep slipping out of my hand when I brush my girls&#x27; hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go through the hair very well though.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin curly hair this works great</li>
            <li> I don´t really see the functionality of this product, it says no tangles and no teezer</li>
            <li> It really makes what is promised.</li>
            <li> and it removes the tangles very well.</li>
            <li> Getting ready for school in the morning always ended in tears for somebody while attempting to get a brush through their hair.</li>
            <li> Then came the real test.  </li>
            <li> (daughter still complains when brushing), but I&#x27;m REALLY DISSATISFIED with Amazon sellers who DO NOT SEND WHAT IS PICTURED.</li>
            <li> and I notice it does not pull as much out as with a comb.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Has made our morning ritual much quicker.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t even have that much hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for my daughter because she cries so much with her tangles.</li>
            <li> It gently detangles my hair with out breakage.</li>
            <li> Everyone were talking so much about this brush</li>
            <li> Scalp stimulating bristles GENTLY groom your hair, and</li>
            <li> , life is so much easier, combing through her hair releases the tangles with ease.</li>
            <li> It is really a miracle.</li>
            <li> it really does work on hair, extensions, and even wigs.</li>
            <li> This product really helped and now she combs her hair without any fuss.</li>
            <li> It really gets the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> I wish that I would have bought this sooner as it really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week, I really like the tangle teezer.  </li>
            <li> I can see how it teeze the tangles, but it&#x27;s really surface brushing.</li>
            <li> Every brush I have ever tried on my 2A/2B hair has pulled on my hair so much and the amount of shed I would get was so fustrating.  </li>
            <li> It may seem time intensive, but this will really undo all of the tangles.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and tangles easily whether it&#x27;s cut short or long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference with getting rid of tangles than a brush</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair that often catches a lot of tangles.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really anything to hold on to.  </li>
            <li> It takes out tangles so much easier than anything I have used before.  </li>
            <li> They used to only endorse boar bristle brushes until the last time I was there and saw they were peddling something very similar to this, saying it was great for not causing damage.</li>
            <li> But this one makes things much easier and i am not regret choosing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what exactly makes it so effective in untangling.  </li>
            <li> This works great on my 5 year old AA daughter&#x27;s hair (thick 4b/4c hair).</li>
            <li> Usually after washing my hair, I would require a hand full of conditioner  or more just to get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for my old brush with almost the same effect and better massage on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Of course this brush doesn&#x27;t take out knots, but WOW does it work to keep the knots from ever forming!!!  </li>
            <li> my 9 year old loves it!!!</li>
            <li> I have a large quantity of fine, long hair.</li>
            <li> I was a complete skeptic at first, but with all of the positive online reviews, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Her long hair tangles easily</li>
            <li> I have tons of frizzy long easily knotted wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product for a little one who hates tangles!</li>
            <li> However, there are probably other ways you can try to manage tangly hair they may or may not work better for you.</li>
            <li> (other family members are now eyeballing my brush, so I suspect I may have to purchase more of them</li>
            <li> They are selling &amp;#34;Tangle Teezer Salon Elite Hair Brush, Purple Crush&amp;#34;, but what actually shipped is not the Salon Elite, is The Original.</li>
            <li> It took long time to arrive and it isn&#x27;t inexpensive, however it was totally worth the wait and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> For reference, I have long, fine hair but plenty of it.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been a source of concern because it is thick and fine and tangles really easily.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE LONG BABY FINE HAIR...</li>
            <li> This is the greatest thing that has happened to me since I came out of the womb with a thick head of dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> Amazing little gadget!  </li>
            <li> My grand daughter doesn&#x27;t like her hair combed after her bath because it usually pulls her hair and the tangle teaser goes right through her hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair and it works incredibly.</li>
            <li> A great little brush for my 4 year old who cries when her hair is brushed.</li>
            <li> I have very long (almost to my waist) extremely fine hair.</li>
            <li> The tangle teezer is light and ergonomic, which makes it easier to work with for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> works great for my hair, but when wet it does pull out hair only draw back</li>
            <li> I really wish they would put a normal handle on this brush.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to use this until it runs down unless there coming out with a brush even better than this.</li>
            <li> I have fine natuarally wavy hairy that tangles easily, both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I just love that my time was cut down to more than half and still efficiently detangles her hair.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s a whole new person.  </li>
            <li> You may need more or less silicones, a trim, more deep conditioning, or something else entirely.</li>
            <li> The main point is to store the brush bristles up.</li>
            <li> but I can not necessarily assume it is or isn&#x27;t this product since I have added additional factors to my hair such as heat, and more styling.</li>
            <li> We detangle in sections, and this brush does the job quickly and relatively painlessly.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of effort more for straightened or naturally straight hsir types, I felt like I was ripping my hair</li>
            <li> I got the tangle teezer for my daughter (ok, and my sanity) for her 2nd birthday next week.  </li>
            <li> This is very soft and it really does help with brushing out the swirls and curls.</li>
            <li> your child has very curly hair and a sensitive scalp, do try this brush!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to the kinky curlies out there.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have high hopes.</li>
            <li> She loves it and highly recommends it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has beautiful, long, thick hair (envious!), but it was always a battle trying to brush/comb it due to so many tangles.  </li>
            <li> She has very long, fine hair that gets tangled easily, but this brush is not enough to get through her hair, even starting at the bottom and working your way up as you get the tangles out at the bottom.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, this cheap-looking little lump of plastic is pure magic.</li>
            <li> I had to hold my three year old down to brush her hair, so after a rough brushing morning I got on Amazon and purchased this brush , best thing I&#x27;ve done in a long time !  </li>
            <li> wow, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It changed our lives getting my 4 year old daughters hair ready.</li>
            <li> It may sound like it&#x27;s ripping out your hair, but it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> I bought the tangle teezer in hopes of being able to skip a few steps in my detangling routine, and failing that, I wanted something I could bring with me to touch up.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rip hair out like normal brushes do.</li>
            <li> I got the fun pink and purple color, which is pretty close to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve fought over messy hair for years (mostly because of brushing out the tangles).  </li>
            <li> Bath times are always fine...but combing our wet hair post bath let to crying , grumpy kids - even after I tried every kind of conditioner on the market!  </li>
            <li> just because i live it so much I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It works very well on the messy long hair, very smooth and very gentle.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s no hard pokey bristles.  </li>
            <li> This brush takes a little extra work to get all the tangles out, but that&#x27;s ok because she doesn&#x27;t DREAD me brushing her hair anymore!</li>
            <li> When I finally used this I could not believe something so inexpensive, so easy to use, so simple in construction and design could work...</li>
            <li> But..... it does not have a handle, and it is extremely lightweight (too light for my liking); therefore, every time I use it, it goes flying out of my hand</li>
            <li> Read other reviews and thought I would try it after another tear filled morning trying to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I live this</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure the first time I used the Tangle Teezer due to my very fine, easy to knot hair when wet.  </li>
            <li> It can be difficult to clean this brush, but doing it slowly by hand and picking out the lint is the most effective way I have found.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a month or so now and the only downside is that some of the bristles are starting to bend (they&#x27;re a light plastic)</li>
            <li> It is gentle on hair and does not pull out nearly as much hair as a regular paddle brush.</li>
            <li> You have to gently comb the tangles out from bottom to top especially if you have tightly curly hair.</li>
            <li> My girls have always been very sensitive about getting their hair combed.</li>
            <li> I have 4 girls and 2 of them have very sensitive heads</li>
            <li> I would recommend this very soft brush to help maintain your hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 11 year old great granddaughter, who is mixed race with very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure its safe.</li>
            <li> Although the salon elite and the original are very similar, they are NOT the same brush.</li>
            <li> It has completely cut done on the time to detangle her hair and with NO TEARS!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I buy, mom took my first one.</li>
            <li> Kiddo has had a lot of success with this hairbrush, as long as we replace it when it gets bent bristles.</li>
            <li> (shes 8) and get all the tangles out without asking for help or crying because it pulls!  </li>
            <li> Not so good with really long hair, becomes difficult to hold and arm fatigue sets in rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this soft brush for those transitioning or even those who already have the natural hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair a bit poofy at the roots where m natural hair is growing in, but that just might be me adjusting to my new grade of hair.</li>
            <li> What used to be an unpleasant experience every morning, full of tears &amp; frustration, is now super easy.</li>
            <li> Its worth every single penny you pay for it.</li>
            <li> When I first started to use it I compared it with a variety of styling tools that I previous owed and this brush seems to detangle my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and straight and there is quite a bit of it although I would not say that it is thick overall.</li>
            <li> There is a large likelihood that the bristles will get compressed or outright break, so while the casing is sturdy and functional, the actual brushing bit is not.  </li>
            <li> we have 2 hair types in this house thick curls, and fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> (I literally have a large cardboard box filled with hair products that I purchased to try that did not work and that I&#x27;m stuck with - at least $2k worth!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> --it sounds like your hair is getting ripped out (of course it isn&#x27;t, but the loud noise surprised me)&lt;br /&gt;*awkward to hold in certain positions on head on self and especially when trying to brush someone else&#x27;s hair for them&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I still feel as though another brush or comb would be needed to complete the grooming.</li>
            <li> My daughter(4 yrs old)   </li>
            <li> I use this Tangle Teezer daily for my TBL, straight hair</li>
            <li> But for my adult hair, this can&#x27;t even get the bristles to go through my hair.</li>
            <li> and she said, \\&quot;Wow,</li>
            <li> My daughter has the thickness hair and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I use this to detangle my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Holds up well even when we use it frequently in the bathtub with conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Is it completely ouch-free?</li>
            <li> But it results in far fewer complaints.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 3 year old daughter who&#x27;s hair is always tangled.  </li>
            <li> and it makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles do not snag on my hair, but they do feel flimsy, especially if my hair is very tangled.</li>
            <li> , I have all kinds of brushes and this doesn&#x27;t look that much different from them but the technology into is absolutely brilliant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have to be somewhat gentle on tangles, but with this brush, I only have to brush a couple of times to get even the nastiest of tangles out.</li>
            <li> It has very bendy bristles that do not hurt and are different sizes in height.</li>
            <li> Review from my 8 year old daughter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has much thinner hair than I do, and she says the same thing.</li>
            <li> She also has a sensitive scalp and dislikes hair brushing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a white girl, it&#x27;s not even like I have very textured hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written because I am THAT passionate about this brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush runs thru with complete ease.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely naturally, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> It gets tangles out, nearly tear-free.  </li>
            <li> With my old brush sometimes it would catch in tangles and even break my hair, causing split ends.  </li>
            <li> The plastic brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this upon my entrance to growing my natural hair - 4c 4b type.</li>
            <li> Once brushed, the hair is very silky and stays silky throughout the day.</li>
            <li> and wow...</li>
            <li> I can say this has improved our mornings considerably because it doesn&#x27;t agitate an already sleepy or moody child.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I drop it nearly every time I use it.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old brat likes it.</li>
            <li> I have 4a/b natural hair.</li>
            <li> Normal brushes such as Denmans normally pull out my hair.</li>
            <li> Even after using on wet hair and tying it back; by the time it was dry those snarls were back, more so on the underside where the teeth and not long or strong enough to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure how the teeth in this brush are made,but they easily untangle any knot in hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth buying if you&#x27;ve tried other kinds of combs and brushes for tangled hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say about the tangle teezer is that you have to detangle in small sections to make sure you are getting the ends to the roots detangled.</li>
            <li> Take out the tangles quickly and with a lot less &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> For my fine, curly, prone-to-tangle hair, this product is essentially a curry-brush with soft, rather than stiff, molded plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> Our daughter&#x27;s hair is long and curly, which really equals compliments and difficulty.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this for anyone with long and/or tangle prone hair.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it on her hair wet</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to replace another brush for wet hair.  </li>
            <li> My child has so many tangles in her long, fine hair and no matter how hard I try, she always ends up crying and asking me to stop.</li>
            <li> And finding a product that will work that won&#x27;t leave it greasy or weigh it down is extremely rare.</li>
            <li> old daughter has naturally curly hair and constantly plays with it by twisting it with her fingers and causing a rats nest and trying to comb her hair causes her to cry out in pain</li>
            <li> This easily gets out the snarls out of my thick hair.</li>
            <li> It looks like a rip-off when you first open the package because it looks cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I was using a wide tooth comb and it seemed that my hair would just tangle right back up.  </li>
            <li> really does go thru wet hair without major pulling.</li>
            <li> So, I took a chance on the tangle teezer and am shocked to giving this product a great review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 10-year old granddaughter who has long naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> However, when I actually used the Tangle Teezer,  I changed my mind completely.  </li>
            <li> Its so gentle and the hair loss is minimal.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old has waist length hair that seems to get tangled constantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning to natural Hair from permed/processed hair and I definitely needed something to help with the tangles and knots</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to those with natural hair.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter is only 7 years old.</li>
            <li> I have long coarse hair and this brush makes it so easy for me to brush my hair dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> You may still need to untangle bad snarls by hand (as any loving long-haired should!), but overall this brush makes the job of keeping extra long hair so much easier!</li>
            <li> then It gets hard to clean in between the bristles.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it really hurts when I use other combs.</li>
            <li> Easily removing tangles results in less stress on hair and less breakage.  </li>
            <li> This is well known in the African American natural hair community.</li>
            <li> Recieved the hot pink one in the mail from amazon the other day for my 4 year old who has curly hair.</li>
            <li> She actually requests that we use this brush and no other.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about all the super claims for this brush.</li>
            <li> I have super coarse, curly hair that usually takes 2 hours to detangle and style.  </li>
            <li> Love that the bristles are not TOO sharp that they are painful to use, but are sharp enough that they give the scalp a kind of &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; when you stroke the brush through your hair.</li>
            <li> My four year old granddaughter has long hair that develops tangles and sometimes knots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important if you have thick hair to separate your hair into 4 to 6 smaller sections and go through each one individually.</li>
            <li> I was really wary of ordering this product, but with very fine hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine hair that is very long.</li>
            <li> the brush works really well, except i ordered a purple one and received a black one.</li>
            <li> This hair brush works very well in terms of untangling my hair (both wet and dry).</li>
            <li> It can detangle loose tangles fairly well, if you isolate the tangle and work from the bottom up in tiny chunks, but I found it to be almost useless for tighter tangles or larger loose tangles.</li>
            <li> But with a little practice, becomes much easier.  </li>
            <li> , she is in her mid 60&#x27;s &amp; has always had combing issues with her fine ultra thin hair, it has always been tangled &amp; my mother sometimes would say \\&quot;I should just shave it</li>
            <li> This little brush really, truly, DOES work (almost instantly) to eliminate tangles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also if you get a tangle spot it helps clear that path with minimal to no hair lost.</li>
            <li> first used it on my hair dry and not only did it detangle with MUCH less effort than a regular brush (or god forbid a comb, which takes twice as long)</li>
            <li> so now this came in &amp; my mother tried it the 1st time &amp; we were all amazed as how this comb made miracles, no more tangles for her ever since &amp; her hair is fine, nothing bad that we&#x27;ve seen afterwards, i recommend this to people with tangles due to thin ultra fine hair, this tangle teezer comb is amazing.</li>
            <li> Our 7 year old hates to get her hair brushed due to tangles.  </li>
            <li> well okay at least there is no more fighting over brushing tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is short, but long enough to where I have to detangle.</li>
            <li> If you have long tangle prone hair as I do, you&#x27;ll definitely want to pick several of these up and keep them everywhere as I do!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft, so they just push down and don&#x27;t actually comb through hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughters no longer complain about getting their hair brushed, and I find we all experience far less split</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather have her laughing than crying!</li>
            <li> No more tears in the morning getting ready for school.</li>
            <li> Maybe the long and short bristles work at teasing out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, so I have to constantly be watching out for breakage...</li>
            <li> I go to a long air salon that focuses on the health of your hair above the style.</li>
            <li> Despite frequent upkeep, by the end of the day I have knots and nests whenever I wear my hair down.</li>
            <li> My other two girls have super thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde hair that always used to get severely tangled.  </li>
            <li> My only complaints are that is it needlessly expensive probably do to some patent and that it seems to be made out of relatively cheap material.</li>
            <li> No joke I was born looking like a middle aged mexican.  </li>
            <li> Second test was to use it on my wet hair after sleeping all night (hair on back of head gets all matted together when I sleep).</li>
            <li> The next day I used it on her dry hair, and got the same dry eyed results!</li>
            <li> Bristles are only about a cm long, and that is the long bristles!</li>
            <li> Also helped to take out all the leftover sand trapped near her scalp!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on wet hair and decreases breakage (at least it feels this way when compared to a regular paddle brush).  </li>
            <li> My daughter has fine thin hair that seems to tangle as she sits still!  </li>
            <li> It does give a nice scalp massage, but I could also see someone calling it rather painful depending on the sensitivity of their scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has long, 3C/4A curly hair which always tangles at the ends, however after using in her hair I had to order one for myself.  </li>
            <li> It was always a long process to detangle her hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair which of course is tangled after I wash it.  </li>
            <li> How have I worn my hair long without this?  </li>
            <li> My daughter has LONG hair that we braid every day.  </li>
            <li> almost 4 ft. long; I needed something.  </li>
            <li> Works reat, even on long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it gets tangled at the roots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always telling women with long hair about them.  </li>
            <li> Believe the hype because if you have long hair it will change your life.</li>
            <li> She used to cry every time I brushed her hair because no matter how careful I tried to be, it always pulled and hurt her.</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick straight hair and it works wonders for the tangles.  </li>
            <li> It definitely cuts through tangles in less time and with relative ease.</li>
            <li> And it works equally well on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I would put gobs of conditioner and detangler and my hair to try to tame the wild beast.</li>
            <li> I have spent probably thousands of dollars in the last two years trying to find a leave-in conditioner or detangler when I decided to grow my hair out and have only found a FEW products that make it easier to comb out my hair after washing it, and without making it look greasy 12 hours later.</li>
            <li> and I wish the brush was a little smaller, or that it would come in different sizes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to say that I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> One tip, you do need to get untangled hair out of the way so you can work on the tangled areas and brushing more frequently cuts down on the time to work on really bad tangles.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I would seriously recommend this tool, especially to my naturally curly sistas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, what I discovered is even in the finest of hair, this does not go all the way though and remove all snarls on dry hair.</li>
            <li> For normal days, I usually just stick to the wide tooth comb and boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> but I could not see it completely, just a little bit!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those parents who struggle to get a comb through their child&#x27;s thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched that brush just glide through her hair without a single pull or tug.  </li>
            <li> In the shower when my hair is saturated with conditioner, then again after I&#x27;ve applied leave-ins and again when it&#x27;s dry and several times through the day if I&#x27;m wearing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I normally do not believe all the RAVE reviews, but I had to try something, because hair brushing was a nightmare in our home.  </li>
            <li> It is VITAL to start brushing from the tips to the roots in small increments.</li>
            <li> We both have sensitive scalps and and using regular combs made it difficult to complete our hairstyles.</li>
            <li> It gets out my tangles and loose hairs without pulling.  </li>
            <li> if like me you loose a lot of hair when trying to untangle it.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my brushes from the Dollar Store so was a little nervous about spending that much money on a brush.</li>
            <li> Use for my twin daughters&#x27; hair wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I tried it out for about 3 weeks, both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> But there is much less breakage with the Tangle Teezer compared to a regular</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster and hurts less than a regular comb.</li>
            <li> It goes through wet or dry hair and removes tangles without pulling out your hair.</li>
            <li> It works on dry hair, as well as wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Works well on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought this at a local store on clearance for under two dollars; and, even though I truly did not believe that it would work, I thought for less than two bucks I had little to lose by trying it.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I use on my daughters tightly curled hair.</li>
            <li> So not sure how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> Not as i expected.</li>
            <li> Also, after only 3 or 4 uses, a few of the bristles are already bent.  </li>
            <li> and it may slip from time to time if your hair is wet</li>
            <li> wide tooth come--&gt;stiff metal</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hold this against the tangle teezer because I tend to cut myself on things all the time, but...be careful.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t scream anymore but does cry still when it pulls, which is not very often.  </li>
            <li> It would not work with dump or wet hair.</li>
            <li> Once my daughter and I tried a Tangle Teezer we couldn&#x27;t be without one (tried the Wet Brush</li>
            <li> I read that somebody had problems with the brush slipping out of there</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there is absolutely NO reason that I can find for the &#x27;dog-brush&#x27; style shape.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected.</li>
            <li> When I received my Tangle Teezer in the mail, I was skeptical initially because the bristles are so soft and short</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and was a total waste of $ and carbon footprint.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;*doesn&#x27;t get stuck in her hair when she tries it herself&lt;</li>
            <li> Works well on wet hair too.</li>
            <li> As soon as I try to pull this through my long hair, the bristles &amp;#34;crush&amp;#34; down and don&#x27;t serve a purpose.  </li>
            <li> I have long (mid back) thick hair, and I was looking forward to one that stressed my hair less after showering.</li>
            <li> and my 4 year old has had less crying bouts due to the Tangle Teezer!</li>
            <li> I have never found anything other than a pick to ease the tangles out of my very dry processed hair until this</li>
            <li> Also, it is pretty difficult to take out the loose hair that is stuck between the teeth of the brush.</li>
            <li> The other downside to the bristles is that they&#x27;re not very springy.</li>
            <li> For my hair, I think it&#x27;s a little easier to brush when it&#x27;s wet, but the brush works when my hair is dry too.</li>
            <li> I will give it the three stars for the fact that it did go through my hair, wet or dry, without much trouble.</li>
            <li> My hair did not brush out any better or less painfully with this brush than with any other.  </li>
            <li> hair is very long and super thing, it is impossible to comb it while wet, hence I have to blow-dry it for 20 minutes before I can comb it and make it look decent.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough she can use By herself</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but willing to try because of my Grandaughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I would definately add this to your list of items to buy if you have small kids or big kids who whine about how it hurts to brush their hair!</li>
            <li> I will not change this brush for any other.</li>
            <li> what some of the other reviews said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has her hair washed every other night, but you know how hair can become tangled after a day of play.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any breakage, contrary to other reviews.</li>
            <li> It usually takes me about 30-45 minutes to detangle my hair but this cut down my time to only 10 minutes!!</li>
            <li> I wish the brush has a conventional handle, but I guess this design sets it apart from the rest.  </li>
            <li> The tips are a little rough and feel like they might snag the hair.</li>
            <li> (the little pricklies are thinner than I expected, so I worry about bending them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have tried multiple hair brushes and this one hurts the least.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not worth the $12 I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Does not hurt her like the average brush you use at home.  </li>
            <li> I wondered why I had been left out of this secret for so long.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, curly hair and it works for me!</li>
            <li> This, and on occasions when I do end up wearing my hair down in public, causes a few tangles for me, usually closer to the root of my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself using any other brush ever again!</li>
            <li> The size of the brush can make it a little hard to hold in your hand, especially when using with conditioner.</li>
            <li> I find it a little harder to use since you have to grip it with your palm and not have a handle, so the brush will drop on the floor a few times.  </li>
            <li> you have trouble brushing out your hair due to tangles from sleep or washing,</li>
            <li> and I have both long hair dark and thick hair..</li>
            <li> While personal care products depend heavily on the person using them, I feel that my experience should at least be somewhat helpful.  </li>
            <li> While I usually wear it up when going outside or braid it before going to bed, I do admit to being rather lazy while lounging around the house .</li>
            <li> Half like it, half don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> detangle time in half</li>
            <li> I found that I could use half the amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li> and am losing  a lot less hair.</li>
            <li> And there was much less shed hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I lost much less hair than I do when I use a comb to detangle.  </li>
            <li> But with this hairbrush, there is much less snagging.</li>
            <li> I spent a fortune on expensive conditioners and detanglers trying to find one that would allow me to simply comb out my hair after washing without hours spent fussing with snarled and knotted hair.</li>
            <li> so well that I purchased another for my daughter-in-law who has long, thick, uber curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, tangle-prone hair which has always been a pain to brush.</li>
            <li> I seem to have a little less hair come out when I use this brush</li>
            <li> I found a few laying down after continuous brushing.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really tight curls.</li>
            <li> My only slight complaint is that I have small hands</li>
            <li> There are particularly annoying to work out because they tend to be quite tight and not very maneuverable, and if not caught quickly, they will grow.</li>
            <li> it does take out some hair but no more than any other brush I use</li>
            <li> This little gem makes detangling a breeze.</li>
            <li> It took a little to get here</li>
            <li> Anyway this little guy changed my life.  </li>
            <li> There is NO way this little thing is going to work in my hair.</li>
            <li> Upset a little bit...</li>
            <li> a little akward to hold</li>
            <li> I had to replace it because it is a little worn out.</li>
            <li> I do not use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to want it but few want to take care of it.</li>
            <li> I feel that I wasted my money and got sucked in by hype.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and we use them ourselves everyday.</li>
            <li> Others are the wrong size or shape and the bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For its purpose though, bath times end with a few seconds of using this comb through the hair, it basically glides through like butter, with no force to the point my kiddo was asking if I was done already out of shock of feeling nothing.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been hard to brush due to its heavy load.</li>
            <li> I have afro textured hair and it detangles easier than a Denman brush and takes half the time to remove all the knots!</li>
            <li> This little stuff saved my struggle with my little girl&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> The back of my hair is usually the worse to detangle and it was a breeze using this brush.</li>
            <li> It goes through her hair wet and dry with ease and no more pulling (or screaming)!!!</li>
            <li> It is not useful on thick hair....</li>
            <li> She has a very tight curl pattern and it detangled her hair without pulling or tearing.</li>
            <li> This is so gentle and if you use it softly but take your time you can get the worst snarls out without tears.  </li>
            <li> No more tears.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ordinary hair brush</li>
            <li> My usual detangling routine tends to be finger</li>
            <li> No more tears after washing it...</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the hype is about.  </li>
            <li> and there is no more pain</li>
            <li> If you have even moderately thick hair, don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was sent a Tangle Teezer that is PURPLE ONLY.</li>
            <li> Recently it started to form dread locks because I stopped brushing it because it was so difficult to brush.  </li>
            <li> I get sometimes when I&#x27;ve been lazy to take care of my hair.</li>
            <li> No more, is my daughter running away from me, when it&#x27;s time to brush her hair.  </li>
            <li> No More Tears</li>
            <li> I spent less time detangling with the help of tangle teezer!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago for my mom ,who has very long curly hair, when she told me she was unable to brush or comb out knots without tears, a headache or yanking out her hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair that tangles and mats, there are no easy answers, but this product helps.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I was skeptical that this brush would work, but used it on my daughter&#x27;s long hair after a day at the beach</li>
            <li> He used to hate brushing no matter how gently, and now he enjoys it!  </li>
            <li> the bristles bend so no matter how hard you press</li>
            <li> I guess i&#x27;m having a hard time describing this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard on my scalp.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t push hard.  </li>
            <li> If your girl had thick hair this brush is hard for them to use by themselves.</li>
            <li> Detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair and saying sorry with every comb, no matter how careful I was...</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it can get awkward brushing without a handle as it slips out of my hand at times</li>
            <li> In fact, I found it awkward compared to a big brush with a handle.  </li>
            <li> I Cannot give it 5 stars because every time I use it the thing goes flying out of my hand and onto the floor at least 3 times.</li>
            <li> so I was shocked and pleasantly surprised how well it worked.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and is four inches below my bra, so tangles are an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> I have waist length really thick hair.</li>
            <li> You cannot just rip through thick hair and expect no damage.</li>
            <li> Maybe not meant for thick hair?</li>
            <li> Because her hair is so thick hair we do have to break it up into very small sections in order to get it all combed.</li>
            <li> Buy one, see what I mean.</li>
            <li> Overall, I didn&#x27;t find it to be miraculous, but I also didn&#x27;t find it to be bad.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is I wish the one I got had a handle on it,</li>
            <li> I will not be going back to painful combs again.</li>
            <li> It sounds awful to drop it because it&#x27;s hollow, but it&#x27;s actually quite sturdy.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has a lot of tangled hair and it was very hard to comb her hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having a tough time untangling hair underneath because of the contact on the pillow when I sleep.    </li>
            <li> I have very thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> Our daughter is handicapped and has very thick hair.</li>
            <li> but my daughter had very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> i have waist length hair and very thick.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Used on very thick wavy hair, inch longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to learn to use.  </li>
            <li> I end up stopping in the middle because she bloody</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve shared our experience with practically everyone we know and are now ordering another one just in case this one gets lost or broken.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for two years and haven&#x27;t had any broken bristles.</li>
            <li> Tired of pulling at your scalp every morning when untangling.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> Makes brushing much less painful for parent and child.</li>
            <li> Not good for a seller!</li>
            <li> I still need to use my fingers and a wide tooth comb, section by section, especially on tough knots.  </li>
            <li> If you have trouble with bad tangles in your hair like I did....</li>
            <li> It makes brushing her hair &amp;#34;smooth and easy&amp;#34; &#x3D; no more painful tangles.</li>
            <li> Needless to say,</li>
            <li> I think from the looks of the brush, you&#x27;ll be a bit skeptical, too.  </li>
            <li> it is a bit expensive for a brush</li>
            <li> My wife (also skeptical) was also amazed at the effect.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical when buying this brush--I kept telling myself not to get my hopes up because NO brush has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> of difficult to store if you don&#x27;t have a lot of space in your bathroom</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> The Tangle Teezer, despite its stupid name, hardly ever catches or breaks hair.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product.  </li>
            <li> I have 4b / 4c type hair, and was very skeptical about this brush, even after seeing a You Tube video of someone with (what looked like)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for me, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product</li>
            <li> &quot; i felt bad for her</li>
            <li> and she would yell because it hurt so bad.  </li>
            <li> the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a handle makes it very inconvenient to use it.</li>
            <li> Stupid stupid product.</li>
            <li> I have been in a hate relationship with brushing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I got sick of it!</li>
            <li> This is also why it&#x27;s very bad for traveling, unless you have a case.</li>
            <li> Very Bad</li>
            <li> This was very painful for my daughter.</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>
            <li> and of course those are the ones that get terrible tangles.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had this I haven&#x27;t had to use hair detangler once (which is insane).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! But don&#x27;t use it with hairdryer - it can melt...</li>
            <li> We love this brush. It is very gentle. I use it on my daughter and it detangles better then anything I have used before.</li>
            <li> Loveeeeeeeeee the way my hair feels after i brush it with it!!</li>
            <li> The handheld brush is very easy to hold and it gets the knots out with minimal pulling and hurting. I wish they were easier to find in stores rather than purchasing online&amp;#34; it overall meets my expectations</li>
            <li> A great little brush for my 4 year old who cries when her hair is brushed. It&#x27;s small enough she can use By herself and she does not cry nearly as much when I brush her hair. Gets the tangles out!</li>
            <li> Use for my twin daughters&#x27; hair wet and dry. Does a good job of detangling their long curly hair.  No more tears.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  I&#x27;ve bought several of these as gifts now.  If you use it the way it&#x27;s intended (there is a technique), it will take out your tangles quickly and you will be surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> I like the tangle teaser brush.  It does detangle hair more gently than a comb or denman brush.  I dont feel like my hair is thoroughly brushed afterwards.  I think becasue the teeth give so easily..  I do  use it a lot though and would recommend it to be added to anyones grooming routine.  But I still feel as though another brush or comb would be needed to complete the grooming.</li>
            <li> Great on wet or dry hair. My hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair no longer hurts when detangling! I love this brush!</li>
            <li> My daughter(4 yrs old)   and I have both long hair dark and thick hair.. its always a battle to comb my daughter&#x27;s hair. I end up stopping in the middle because she bloody screams- right after i receive this item i put it on a test right away!!! It really works- it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all probably because of the short bristle and close to the scalp make it easier to comb-- its gentle. I even start using it for my hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice item, High recommend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but willing to try because of my Grandaughter&#x27;s hair. This brush is everthing it is advertised to be.</li>
            <li> I thought I liked this brush on wet hair well enough - but what really settled it for me was that my husband, with a long curly-hair pony, really loved it!  Not just gentle on hair, but on your scalp as well.  5-stars!</li>
            <li> I use this Tangle Teezer daily for my TBL, straight hair and I LOVE it!  It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on wet hair and decreases breakage (at least it feels this way when compared to a regular paddle brush).  It takes getting used to, but I would definitely repurchase if something should ever happen to this one!  I have dropped it several times and it&#x27;s survived every fall.  It sounds awful to drop it because it&#x27;s hollow, but it&#x27;s actually quite sturdy.  It can be difficult to clean this brush, but doing it slowly by hand and picking out the lint is the most effective way I have found.  You may still need to untangle bad snarls by hand (as any loving long-haired should!), but overall this brush makes the job of keeping extra long hair so much easier!</li>
            <li> Tangle Teezer is OK but I like The Wet Brush more as it feels better on scalp and brushes their hair better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece who was in tears or sobbing at every hair brushing because of her constant tangles. She can brush her own hair now because of this brush. I borrow it sometimes when I have knots and it glides right through. What a life safer.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It really works! I have hair extensions and this is the best brush to have that detangles instantly.   I tried it on my daughter and she loves it. I just bought for her the kids flowerpot from Tangle Teezer. It&#x27;s soooo cute and I get to keep mine:)</li>
            <li> It definitely cuts through tangles in less time and with relative ease. I&#x27;m just not sure its safe. The tips are a little rough and feel like they might snag the hair. If you have strong hair this will probably be just fine.</li>
            <li> Not as i expected.It&#x27;s an ordinary hair brush</li>
            <li> PROS:  My hair is thick and is four inches below my bra, so tangles are an issue for me.  This little brush really, truly, DOES work (almost instantly) to eliminate tangles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  But..... it does not have a handle, and it is extremely lightweight (too light for my liking); therefore, every time I use it, it goes flying out of my hand or I drop it.  Also, after only 3 or 4 uses, a few of the bristles are already bent.  The handle issue might not bother most people, but for me it&#x27;s just too bothersome. My daughter wants mine, so I&#x27;m going to give it to her and I will use a detangler shower comb with a handle on it.</li>
            <li> Tangle teezer is the best styling product. It glides with ease, easy clean up just run warm water to help remove excess hair. Also if you get a tangle spot it helps clear that path with minimal to no hair lost. I feel its great with no handle. I swear no one is ever satisfied with anything oo well it fits great in your hands and it may slip from time to time if your hair is wet but then again so can a handle brush. All in all try it you will not be disappointed &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> we have 2 hair types in this house thick curls, and fine straight hair. This works well on all of them. the bristles bend so no matter how hard you press it won&#x27;t hurt your scalp. In fact after trying the brush my scalp feels amazing. My husband has long curly hair and he was also impressed by it. It looks like a rip-off when you first open the package because it looks cheaply made. it does take out some hair but no more than any other brush I use and it doesn&#x27;t have any sensation of pulling. Very good buy.</li>
            <li> so i got this cuz it was cheap and looked fun for my daughter.  My wife now uses this more than my daughter and they both claim its the greatest bush they&#x27;ve ever used, especially getting the tangles out.</li>
            <li> This is my second Tangle Teezer and I really love this one. It works very well on the messy long hair, very smooth and very gentle. I would recommend this one to my friends.</li>
            <li> got a different color but its very handy</li>
            <li> I normally do not believe all the RAVE reviews, but I had to try something, because hair brushing was a nightmare in our home.  Our daughter used to scream every time we brushed her hair.  She says, \\&quot;Now that we have the Tangle Teezer, it is like the happy ending to a story book.\\&quot;  My husband threatened to shave her head until we got this.  This hair brush really is heaven sent.  We&#x27;ve shared our experience with practically everyone we know and are now ordering another one just in case this one gets lost or broken.</li>
            <li> While personal care products depend heavily on the person using them, I feel that my experience should at least be somewhat helpful.  I have a large quantity of fine, long hair. At the moment, it touches my tailbone. While I usually wear it up when going outside or braid it before going to bed, I do admit to being rather lazy while lounging around the house . This, and on occasions when I do end up wearing my hair down in public, causes a few tangles for me, usually closer to the root of my hair. There are particularly annoying to work out because they tend to be quite tight and not very maneuverable, and if not caught quickly, they will grow. My usual detangling routine tends to be finger comb--&gt; wide tooth come--&gt;stiff metal hairbrush--&gt; fine tooth comb--&gt;boar bristle brush. For normal days, I usually just stick to the wide tooth comb and boar bristle brush. I bought the tangle teezer in hopes of being able to skip a few steps in my detangling routine, and failing that, I wanted something I could bring with me to touch up.  Well, I got the tangle teezer, and the first thing I did was cut a gash into my finger on the packaging. I don&#x27;t hold this against the tangle teezer because I tend to cut myself on things all the time, but...be careful.  I tried it out for about 3 weeks, both wet and dry.  The tangle teezer is light and ergonomic, which makes it easier to work with for long periods of time. It is solid plastic, and the bristles are also plastic. Overall, I didn&#x27;t find it to be miraculous, but I also didn&#x27;t find it to be bad. It does give a nice scalp massage, but I could also see someone calling it rather painful depending on the sensitivity of their scalp. It can detangle loose tangles fairly well, if you isolate the tangle and work from the bottom up in tiny chunks, but I found it to be almost useless for tighter tangles or larger loose tangles. It has short bristles, and I felt as if it wasn&#x27;t actually brushing my hair--just the very top layer, even when myhair was already mostly detangled. The bristles are flexible, which made it a pain for me to find smaller tangles. Instead of just catching on them, it passed over them and I completely missed them. While this is probably a feature designed to avoid ripping your hair out, it&#x27;s very scratchy and I could see it easily damaging your hair with continued use. The other downside to the bristles is that they&#x27;re not very springy. I found a few laying down after continuous brushing. Since all the bristles were no longer facing the same way, it didn&#x27;t brush my hair as effectively. This is also why it&#x27;s very bad for traveling, unless you have a case. There is a large likelihood that the bristles will get compressed or outright break, so while the casing is sturdy and functional, the actual brushing bit is not.  Basically, I use it for touch ups. If I have to redo a bun or a braid, I use it to arrange my hair in a nice way. I like that it&#x27;s ergonomic, light, and that the backing is sturdy, It&#x27;s compact and fits into my bag well. It&#x27;s not for me, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product--it&#x27;s just fragile and a bit over-hyped.   As a tool, as long as it works well for someone, it&#x27;s worthwhile to have. However, there are probably other ways you can try to manage tangly hair they may or may not work better for you. For example, I found my hair started behaving a lot more after I switched to SLS-free products. You may need more or less silicones, a trim, more deep conditioning, or something else entirely. In all likelihood, it will be a combination of methods or treatments that will help, rather than just relying on one thing.</li>
            <li> For my fine, curly, prone-to-tangle hair, this product is essentially a curry-brush with soft, rather than stiff, molded plastic bristles. It does not mitigate the pain of de-tangling my hair. It&#x27;s just OK as a brush, but in my opinion it does not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this, My 18month son has a head full of beautiful, thick, Ethiopian pencil curls and this &#x27;brush&#x27; get us through his tangles without any problems or tears. I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with bad tangles in your hair like I did....this is a MUST have for you!! I will be buying more of these and also spreading the word to my friends!! :-)</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I brought one for my granddaughter and one for me.  It really does work and now my granddaughter doesn&#x27;t mind washing her hair.  I have very thick and curly hair and it goes through it without a problem.  Really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I would give this brush 5 stars - because it is a GREAT brush.But, this is NOT the Salon Elite version of the tangle teezer - this is the Original tangle teezer. The seller needs to advertise the product correctly. Although the salon elite and the original are very similar, they are NOT the same brush. It is a wonderful brush, but the seller needs to change the description and name of the item, because it is the Tangle Teezer Original...not Tangle Teezer Salon Elite.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about all the super claims for this brush. However, when I actually used the Tangle Teezer,  I changed my mind completely.  The Teezer makes VERY easy work out of the most stubborn of knots! Also, I no longer have to spend $$$ on de tangling products.  And it works equally well on wet or dry hair. Thank you, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> As soon as I try to pull this through my long hair, the bristles &amp;#34;crush&amp;#34; down and don&#x27;t serve a purpose.  I guess i&#x27;m having a hard time describing this.  The bristles are too soft, so they just push down and don&#x27;t actually comb through hair.  I suppose if a young child has this used on their fine fair, it would be great because it feels so soft and there&#x27;s no hard pokey bristles.  But for my adult hair, this can&#x27;t even get the bristles to go through my hair.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I was skeptical that this brush would work, but used it on my daughter&#x27;s long hair after a day at the beach and it took out all of the tangles pain free!  Also helped to take out all the leftover sand trapped near her scalp!</li>
            <li> OK, I bought this for my dog.  He&#x27;s a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, and he doesn&#x27;t know it.  He believes that he is an outdoor dog, so he is constantly getting washed and his fine hair gets tangled!!!  Of course this brush doesn&#x27;t take out knots, but WOW does it work to keep the knots from ever forming!!!  It really works as described!!!  He used to hate brushing no matter how gently, and now he enjoys it!  This is an excellent product!!!</li>
            <li> It brushes the hair but I prefer the Boar bristle brush I own.  I&#x27;ll give this one to my grandson.</li>
            <li> It does what it says, it de-tangles the hair!  I have thick, coarse, curly hair and it works for me!</li>
            <li> Read other reviews and thought I would try it after another tear filled morning trying to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I picked one up at my local Sally&#x27;s Beauty supplies (I just couldn&#x27;t wait for it to ship from Amazon) and brought it home for her to try.  I started brushing her hair and she said, \\&quot;Wow, wow, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.\\&quot; She took it from me and started brushing her own hair and hasn&#x27;t stopped yet. Needless to say, I when out the next day and bought a couple more, a spare for her and one for a friend of ours. Two days later, she is brushing her hair on her own without me having to ask, no tears and no fights, just beautiful hair.    I love it and there is peace in our house again, well okay at least there is no more fighting over brushing tangled hair.  Now if I could only find something that will inspire her to do her homework...</li>
            <li> I love it for my hair type and i have type 4 hair. I would recommend this product for anyone who has very curly hair.</li>
            <li> This little gem makes detangling a breeze. I tried it on my 5 year old and it worked wonderfully. She has a very tight curl pattern and it detangled her hair without pulling or tearing. After I detangled all of her hair,I asked her if she felt any pulling or discomfort and she said no. Then she said that we should buy one for her friend so that her mommy could use it when she did her hair. So we are ordering another one.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! I bought this for my daughter who has long, 3C/4A curly hair which always tangles at the ends, however after using in her hair I had to order one for myself.  The first time I used it on her hair wet and amazingly she didn&#x27;t cry or pull away while getting her hair detangled!  The next day I used it on her dry hair, and got the same dry eyed results! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I think from the looks of the brush, you&#x27;ll be a bit skeptical, too.  I&#x27;m not sure what exactly makes it so effective in untangling.  Maybe the long and short bristles work at teasing out the tangles.  I&#x27;ve been having a tough time untangling hair underneath because of the contact on the pillow when I sleep.    I wish the brush has a conventional handle, but I guess this design sets it apart from the rest.  I was a bit amused by the manual that accompanied the product.  The main point is to store the brush bristles up.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the thickness hair and it&#x27;s natural. It was always a long process to detangle her hair. Her hair is tailbone length and she&#x27;s 7. Detangling my daughter&#x27;s hair and saying sorry with every comb, no matter how careful I was...I got sick of it! I found tangle teezer and it&#x27;s done what it is suppose to. It has completely cut done on the time to detangle her hair and with NO TEARS! The only thing I can say about the tangle teezer is that you have to detangle in small sections to make sure you are getting the ends to the roots detangled. Ensure you are actually getting the tangle teezer to detangle the root of the hair instead of brushing over it is key to the successful use of it. I just love that my time was cut down to more than half and still efficiently detangles her hair. It works great for relaxed her too.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I bought it for my 10-year old granddaughter who has long naturally curly hair.  What a battle it is to brush her hair until we tried the Tangle Teezer!  It took long time to arrive and it isn&#x27;t inexpensive, however it was totally worth the wait and worth every penny.  What a great brush!</li>
            <li> Great for detangling on wet or dry hair. I use this once or twice every day.</li>
            <li> I use this to detangle my natural hair. This is well known in the African American natural hair community. Half like it, half don&#x27;t. Some have said it creates split ends. I am keeping an eye on my hair because it&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve had it, about a two months. I do not use this everyday. I have noticed my hair has become more fuzzy at the ends but I can not necessarily assume it is or isn&#x27;t this product since I have added additional factors to my hair such as heat, and more styling. I will continue to use it on a once in a while basis, but it is something I would keep my eye on. For looser curled hair, or perhaps even straight hair, I&#x27;d give this a go.</li>
            <li> I am &amp;#34;wowed&amp;#34; by this brush.  I was a little unsure the first time I used the Tangle Teezer due to my very fine, easy to knot hair when wet.  It didn&#x27;t take 5 seconds to realize this product is everything it says it is!  I am thrilled and still in awe but glad I took the chance on this one!!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Great for gentle detangling with my daughter&#x27;s tight curly tangly hair.  Holds up well even when we use it frequently in the bathtub with conditioner.  Seems like it would work well with any hair type.  Bristles are gentle and seems like this could use replacing about once a year or so (this is our second one), because the bristles get a bit flimsier over time, but it&#x27;s still useable even at that point.  Glad to have this product to battle tangles gently!</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde hair that always used to get severely tangled.  In fact, it would take me 45 minutes to untangle my hair after each shower (even after deep conditionings).  The Tangle Teezer is the best purchase I have ever made!!! It has saved so much time and my hair too.  I now brush my hair in under four minutes without any struggles or pain.  I was extremely skeptical before I purchased this item, but I am so very, very happy that I did!!!</li>
            <li> My child has so many tangles in her long, fine hair and no matter how hard I try, she always ends up crying and asking me to stop. I took a chance on this brush, based on a recommendation from a friend. Best investment ever! Thank you! Not only does it just glide through the hair, but now my child tells me that brushing her hair actually tickles. I&#x27;d much rather have her laughing than crying!</li>
            <li> A lifesaver if you have children with long/curly/tangly hair. Makes brushing much less painful for parent and child.</li>
            <li> My girls have always been very sensitive about getting their hair combed. This fixes it. Is it completely ouch-free? No. But it results in far fewer complaints. The bristles aren&#x27;t as effective as a traditional comb, and so I find it takes more strokes to comb everything out, but the process goes much faster as it breaks down those snarls. If you&#x27;ve got picky kids, try it.</li>
            <li> this comb came right on time &amp; i ordered it for my mother, she is in her mid 60&#x27;s &amp; has always had combing issues with her fine ultra thin hair, it has always been tangled &amp; my mother sometimes would say \\&quot;I should just shave it all off\\&quot; i felt bad for her so now this came in &amp; my mother tried it the 1st time &amp; we were all amazed as how this comb made miracles, no more tangles for her ever since &amp; her hair is fine, nothing bad that we&#x27;ve seen afterwards, i recommend this to people with tangles due to thin ultra fine hair, this tangle teezer comb is amazing.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my 5 year old grand daughter&#x27;s hair.  It is wonderful and gets the tangles out painlessly.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 3 year old daughter who&#x27;s hair is always tangled.  She does not complain as much as she used too and I love this brush for myself as well.</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect for wet hair, also for children too. Worth every penny and a great stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> This easily gets out the snarls out of my thick hair. Not only does it not hurt, it actually feels good. It&#x27;s like a mini scalp massage every time I brush. I will not be going back to painful combs again.</li>
            <li> it works but it could be better to add some soft material on the tip. It&#x27;s hard on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Like others before me I had my doubts but tried the Tangle Teezer because we have tried so many other products, most making similar claims. In this case the claims are true! Our daughter&#x27;s hair is long and curly, which really equals compliments and difficulty. Everyone seems to want it but few want to take care of it. So far this brush appears to be the best at making it straight through the tangles - hopefully avoiding any matting.</li>
            <li> Both my grandson(with very long hair) and my son(also longish)  loved its detangling ability. Easy to use and effective on just washed or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Daughter doesn&#x27;t mind having her hair combed with this tool.  I find it a little harder to use since you have to grip it with your palm and not have a handle, so the brush will drop on the floor a few times.  It works though!</li>
            <li> It changed our lives getting my 4 year old daughters hair ready. No more tears in the morning getting ready for school. No more tears after washing it... It&#x27;s a miracle.</li>
            <li> This brush works so very well. I have afro textured hair and it detangles easier than a Denman brush and takes half the time to remove all the knots! The only issue I have is that it can get awkward brushing without a handle as it slips out of my hand at times</li>
            <li> We LOVE this brush. This works great on my 5 year old AA daughter&#x27;s hair (thick 4b/4c hair). Because her hair is so thick hair we do have to break it up into very small sections in order to get it all combed. But there is much less breakage with the Tangle Teezer compared to a regular comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus is that both my kids (8 and 5) love brushing/combing my hair (I have long straight type 1 hair).... being kids, with a regular comb or brush anytime there was any knot or tension they would keep pulling and rip my hair out. Ouch. With the Tangle Teezer they can brush my hair for me and not rip out any of it!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sleep on this.  Go ahead and jump on the bandwagon.  This is truly a product made for everyone.  I think it may even get the nod for the Nobel prize.  It&#x27;s just that awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> I had first read about this brush in the news on the internet. Then I looked at the reviews on it. I was convinced, so I bought one for myself ..... and I love it! It really is the easiest brush I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. My hair is medium-long and tangles easy, but it is now actually easy to brush out with the Tangle Teezer. For my hair, I think it&#x27;s a little easier to brush when it&#x27;s wet, but the brush works when my hair is dry too. I seem to have a little less hair come out when I use this brush and it makes it feel soft. My only slight complaint is that I have small hands and I wish the brush was a little smaller, or that it would come in different sizes. But other than that, this is the best tool has that has ever come to my hair&#x27;s way!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and curly in which this brush is perfect. Normal brushes such as Denmans normally pull out my hair. I am able to reduce the time in detangling with this brush. Yes its just a brush but for people who have struggled with tangling hair for all their life.. this brush does wonders for my hair. I spent less time detangling with the help of tangle teezer!!!!</li>
            <li> This Tangle Teezer is AMAZING! A lot of people were raving about this thing in the natural hair community, and u can never have too many detangling tools. I had to give it a try. My hair is short, but long enough to where I have to detangle. This product makes it so easy. It may sound like it&#x27;s ripping out your hair, but it&#x27;s really not. The only bad thing about it is I wish the one I got had a handle on it, but it&#x27;s ok. Still worth the money. Also if you&#x27;re in to the wash, SET, and go, it is PERFECT for defining your curls! Way better than the Denman. I love it!</li>
            <li> For reference, I have long, fine hair but plenty of it. My hair gets tangled very easily. This brush is best for lightly tangled hair. Beyond that, this brush will not do the job. This leaves my hair very static-y if I don&#x27;t use a detangler spray or some kind of serum. The bristles do not snag on my hair, but they do feel flimsy, especially if my hair is very tangled. This brush is ok, but I won&#x27;t be using it every day and it won&#x27;t be replacing my old hairbrush.</li>
            <li> This works wonders with my fine, tangled hair.  Doesn&#x27;t rip hair out like normal brushes do.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER EVER get another hairbrush that is not the Tangle Teezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t quite sure about this purchase but I gave it a go and I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I first tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very long and super thing, it is impossible to comb it while wet, hence I have to blow-dry it for 20 minutes before I can comb it and make it look decent.&lt;br /&gt;With this brush I was able to comb it while wet and this saves me lots of time which is great because even though I want my hair to look good I don&#x27;t want to spend so much time on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how it works, I have all kinds of brushes and this doesn&#x27;t look that much different from them but the technology into is absolutely brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is a bit expensive for a brush but it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This really works. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as great as it does. it is truly life changing. What used to be an unpleasant experience every morning, full of tears &amp; frustration, is now super easy. My daughter doesn&#x27;t cry at all &amp; my son now combs his own hair without me begging. Love, love, love this thing!</li>
            <li> I like this a lot!  I&#x27;ve had it for a month or so now and the only downside is that some of the bristles are starting to bend (they&#x27;re a light plastic) and I don&#x27;t push hard.  So not sure how long it will last.  But I definitely feel like it does the job well.</li>
            <li> I ordered the tangle Elite and received the regular one. They are both good, but it wasn&#x27;t the one I ordered.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and watched the online video demo. The brush works even better than I expected. Now my daughter doesn&#x27;t fuss at all when I need to brush her hair. It&#x27;s definitely worth buying if you&#x27;ve tried other kinds of combs and brushes for tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Recieved the hot pink one in the mail from amazon the other day for my 4 year old who has curly hair. She simply loves it as well as everyone in our family! I would definately add this to your list of items to buy if you have small kids or big kids who whine about how it hurts to brush their hair! Check out my review about it @ www.greenmomreviews.com</li>
            <li> untangles my hair without pulling and breaking it. the hype is real!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft &amp; this is my favorite brush! It took a little to get here but it was worth it</li>
            <li> Works really well for both my daughters and my wife.  Very easy on the hair and great for getting out the knots.</li>
            <li> Love it, my daughter handles getting her hair brush much better now and I even use it myself now. Plus the lady selling it was great!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a nice brush for my daughter who has ethnic curly/kinky/easily tangled hair.  It used to take me over an hour to comb it out and she would yell because it hurt so bad.  This brush is awesome.  It cut the brush/detangle time in half and she said that it didn&#x27;t hurt her at all.  Wonderful product!  Just bought a second one.  Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This works very well on my toddler&#x27;s hair.  I still have to be somewhat gentle on tangles, but with this brush, I only have to brush a couple of times to get even the nastiest of tangles out.</li>
            <li> Will never use another kind of brush again! Love that the bristles are not TOO sharp that they are painful to use, but are sharp enough that they give the scalp a kind of &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; when you stroke the brush through your hair.</li>
            <li> This works really well and I definitely recommend to anyone that has curly hair.  It gets out my tangles and loose hairs without pulling.  I do wish the bristles were a bit longer (or stiffer maybe?) so I could get that nice scalp massage that comes with firmer brushes.  But overall a great brush!</li>
            <li> Love to item, it really works! Got to me in perfect time. No problems and product is just as it&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product.  I was sure I was buying a product in the ilk of &amp;#34;RONCO&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34; too-good-to-be-true products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 6-yr-old daughter has very straight, fine, shoulder-length hair which she does like to brush because of the daily and nightly tangles.  But she also doesn&#x27;t want to cut it.  So, I took a chance on the tangle teezer and am shocked to giving this product a great review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She tried it and said &amp;#34;It&#x27;s great&amp;#34;.  My wife (also skeptical) was also amazed at the effect.  I am hoping that this continues.  Hopefully it will reduce the tears of brushing as well as brushed hair more often.  We shall see.  The fact that both mom and daughter are amazed was good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works for you as well.</li>
            <li> Fast processing and shipping. Had my doubts but the brush works awesome my 9 year old loves it!!! I would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will not change this brush for any other.</li>
            <li> My daughter has beautiful, long, thick hair (envious!), but it was always a battle trying to brush/comb it due to so many tangles.  This brush has solved that problem.  Once you try it, you will never go back to a regular brush -- it&#x27;s just that good!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I read so much hype about this thing that I went ahead and bought it.  I have long hair which of course is tangled after I wash it.  I was not impressed.  I am not sure what the hype is about.  My hair did not brush out any better or less painfully with this brush than with any other.  In fact, I found it awkward compared to a big brush with a handle.  I feel that I wasted my money and got sucked in by hype.  My hair is very fine and straight and there is quite a bit of it although I would not say that it is thick overall.</li>
            <li> Very, Very Good!!  Works Well!!  Bought this for my 11 year old great granddaughter, who is mixed race with very thick hair.  She has not been able to find anything that does not hurt until now.  This works!!</li>
            <li> I did not actually believe this would change my hair brushing experience.  I can&#x27;t see how it works but it does. The hair loss when I brush my hair is reduced SIGNIFICANTLY.  Using this brush also reduced the amount of hair loss when washing my hair. I like it so well that I purchased another for my daughter-in-law who has long, thick, uber curly hair. She hasn&#x27;t gotten it yet but I&#x27;ll try to remember to update once she has used it.</li>
            <li> I bought this tangle teezer, because I was looking for a brush that would gently get knots out without breaking hair. It&#x27;s very efficient, and I love that it&#x27;s all waterproof and easy to remove hair that gets stuck while combing. I also love that it &amp;#34;massages&amp;#34; the scalp while brushing. I have long hair and can&#x27;t live without it now. I have been using it for a few weeks now. I got the fun pink and purple color, which is pretty close to the picture.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 7 more as gifts for my friends and will give them at my bachelorette party :)</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised. My 8 yr. old daughter has naturally curly hair and constantly plays with it by twisting it with her fingers and causing a rats nest and trying to comb her hair causes her to cry out in pain or we have to cut the knots out with scissors.&lt;br /&gt;We bought this brush and there is no more pain and she can comb her hair without any problems or pain. I would recommend this product anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> IT IS EASY TO BRUSH AND IT DEALS WITH TANGLES WHEN I BRUSH MY HAIR GENTLLY WHEN I&#x27;M IN THE SHOWER</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, and that means knots, tangles, and dread locks that appear out of nowhere.  I have been in a hate relationship with brushing my hair.  It consisted of me yelling every time I had to comb my hair in the shower, and threatening, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going to cut it all off, I swear, I will!&amp;#34;  Well, then I stumbled on this product!  OMG! It is freaking amazing!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair, and the knots that become dreadlocks throughout the day, are easy to get out.  Plus, it doesn&#x27;t take forever to brush the knots out anymore!  It would take me 15 minutes to comb out all the knots with a regular comb.  Don&#x27;t think, Just get the brush!  You&#x27;ll be praising it&#x27;s praises, and buying it as gifts for your curly haired friends.  Finally!!! Yeah!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to brush out the knots, however, the brush keep slipping out of my hand when I brush my girls&#x27; hair.  I probably should&#x27;ve gotten the one with the handle.  Maybe that would make a difference!  It works great with wet hair, but dry makes my daughters&#x27; hair really puffy (afro like).</li>
            <li> We have purchased over a dozen of these for gifts and ourselves. Our daughter is handicapped and has very thick hair. This brush has been such a phenomenal help. It goes through her hair wet and dry with ease and no more pulling (or screaming)!!! Love this brush. We have given many as gifts, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This brush is literally the best in the world. It has different rows of teeth that help get out tangles easier. And its very easy to grip, doesn&#x27;t fly out of your hand. It usually takes me about 30-45 minutes to detangle my hair but this cut down my time to only 10 minutes!! My hair type is curly since I am african american. The back of my hair is usually the worse to detangle and it was a breeze using this brush. I purchased it from a store for $16. Its worth every single penny you pay for it. I was very surprised at how easy it went through my hair after washing and applying conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush I use on my daughters tightly curled hair. We detangle in sections, and this brush does the job quickly and relatively painlessly. We&#x27;ve been using it for two years and haven&#x27;t had any broken bristles. Love it!</li>
            <li> How have I worn my hair long without this?  I absolutely recommend this for anyone with long and/or tangle prone hair.  Really lovely  Gently and completely detangles without pain.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My daughter HATES getting her hair brushed. We have tried multiple hair brushes and this one hurts the least. It doesn&#x27;t go through the hair very well though.  She doesn&#x27;t scream anymore but does cry still when it pulls, which is not very often.  It only fits one hair type but it comes in many colors, including stickers and sparkles.  It has very bendy bristles that do not hurt and are different sizes in height. Overall, you can see this brush is better than many other brushes.</li>
            <li> If you have thin curly hair this works great but my daughter had very thick curly hair and it never got the tangles out or really brushed her hair</li>
            <li> Teeth are easily manipulated</li>
            <li> I first bought the orange one for my daughter, and thought it was nonsense.  Then I got the hang of it, and realized I needed another.  This one is even better- it seems the bristles are shorter.&lt;br /&gt;If your child has very curly hair and a sensitive scalp, do try this brush!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair personally, but I don&#x27;t notice a big difference in using this brush vs. others. I have long (mid back) thick hair, and I was looking forward to one that stressed my hair less after showering. This doesn&#x27;t seem to be it. It&#x27;s not a bad brush, but it doesn&#x27;t do for me what some of the other reviews said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would also be nice if it had a handle for easier use.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and it certainly helps with the tangles…It&#x27;s faster and hurts less than a regular comb.</li>
            <li> If you have long tangle prone hair as I do, you&#x27;ll definitely want to pick several of these up and keep them everywhere as I do!  They really do live up to their claims and the brush goes right through your hair even if tangled, without causing damage as most brushes would under similar circumstances.</li>
            <li> This brush is great! I have very long thick hair and it works incredibly. I can&#x27;t see myself using any other brush ever again!</li>
            <li> works great! I have 4 girls and 2 of them have very sensitive heads and of course those are the ones that get terrible tangles. This is so gentle and if you use it softly but take your time you can get the worst snarls out without tears.  My other two girls have super thick hair and you need to section it to use this brush since it doesn&#x27;t reach &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; enough, but they are find with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I don´t really see the functionality of this product, it says no tangles and no teezer but I could not see it completely, just a little bit!</li>
            <li> Review from my 8 year old daughter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great brush. It gets out all the tangles very easily and with no pain. That&#x27;s all!</li>
            <li> Good to be used only on dry hair. It would not work with dump or wet hair. It really makes what is promised. I have very thin hair and it removes the tangles very well. Just wish it was cheaper. :)</li>
            <li> great for curly hair does not pull or brake your hair!! best brush ever</li>
            <li> My daughter has LONG hair that we braid every day.  It is snarl city.  Every morning was a battle trying to get those knots out.  Not anymore!  I start at the bottom and work my way up her hair.  Super fast, super smooth.  This bursh is so pretty she knows it is hers and is excited to use it instead of the torture device we had before!  Will be buying more for gifts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this for any mom/dad with a daughter.  We&#x27;ve fought over messy hair for years (mostly because of brushing out the tangles).  This &#x27;brush&#x27; takes care of that.  It fits perfectly in our daughters small hand and it totally eliminates tangles while brushing.</li>
            <li> I spend more money on hair detangler than I&#x27;d like to share. I saw this product in an annual review of beauty products and thought I&#x27;d give it a chance, I&#x27;m sure glad I did.  Since I&#x27;ve had this I haven&#x27;t had to use hair detangler once (which is insane).  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Comes her hair all the time now. Coundnt get her to do it before asa it always hurt with a brush.</li>
            <li> I love the tangle teaser. i have waist length hair and very thick. I have to admit I am in and out who would actually cry over the thought of washing her hair. My waist length locks would always get tangled up no matter what I did it would just stick there like super glue. I would put gobs of conditioner and detangler and my hair to try to tame the wild beast. Nothing worked. Then someone suggested tangle teaser iPod to tell them to go fly a kite. But I figured I had nothing to lose. And so purchased one. Yeah I guess you can tell me to go fly a kite. If I was going to be on a desert island with nobody I want my tangle teaser!!!!</li>
            <li> Bristles are only about a cm long, and that is the long bristles! It is too short to even touch my scalp, so I have not idea how it feels on the scalp. My daughter has much thinner hair than I do, and she says the same thing. She has very long, fine hair that gets tangled easily, but this brush is not enough to get through her hair, even starting at the bottom and working your way up as you get the tangles out at the bottom. If you have even moderately thick hair, don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. It is like a doll brush that I had as a girl. I give it 2 stars, because it was packaged well, and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews, I did not believe that the Tangle Teezer Original Purple is so good. It turned out that this is really a magic comb. My daughter does not like to brush her ​​hair. And with this Tangle Teezer Original Purple just a miracle happened she prichesyvat hair. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner. I bought one for me (type 4 hair) &amp; one for my daughter (type 3 hair). It works great. Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that, with regular use, the teeth started bending so I try to bend them back in place prior to each use to minimize the possibility of hair breakage.</li>
            <li> works great for my hair, but when wet it does pull out hair only draw back</li>
            <li> Great brush and my daughter loves it! Does a great job with detangling the nest on her head..lol</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughters after reading the reviews. Getting ready for school in the morning always ended in tears for somebody while attempting to get a brush through their hair. Not any more! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has very thick hair.  She also has a sensitive scalp and dislikes hair brushing.  This brush has made her happy to take care of her own hair and doesn&#x27;t complain about hair fixing.</li>
            <li> Received today love it i wish i had it last week as i had a huge tangle in my extensions and cost a lot to get out by my hair dresser this combs through my hair  very easily  feels great on scalp going to buy more for me and my daughter also ordered Monday received today Wednesday super fast ship Amazon great job thank you</li>
            <li> I had to hold my three year old down to brush her hair, so after a rough brushing morning I got on Amazon and purchased this brush , best thing I&#x27;ve done in a long time !  Works great and my daughter asks to have he hair brushed !</li>
            <li> I was really wary of ordering this product, but with very fine hair almost 4 ft. long; I needed something.  I used it the same day I received it. Amazed.  No pulling, no tangling, and no wads of hair left  in the brush.  Then came the real test.  Usually after washing my hair, I would require a hand full of conditioner  or more just to get the tangles out.  This process still would leave me with a large mass  of hair in my comb.  Not with the tangle teaser.  I found that I could use half the amount of conditioner. and am losing  a lot less hair. I absolutely love this brush.  It&#x27;s a little awkward to learn to use.  The size of the brush can make it a little hard to hold in your hand, especially when using with conditioner. But with a little practice, becomes much easier.  I can&#x27;t vouch for using it on any other hair types, but for fine hair; it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great brush! never pulls! Great price. The only brush I use now.</li>
            <li> Works great for like a week then It gets hard to clean in between the bristles. It still pulls hair out and it gets stuck in the bristles. Used on very thick wavy hair, inch longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one the best hair tools ever created! I would seriously recommend this tool, especially to my naturally curly sistas. Its so gentle and the hair loss is minimal. Try it! You won&#x27;t be dissappointed! I promise you...check out tutorial videos on youtube to see how to use it.</li>
            <li> Ordered &amp;#34;Purple Crush,&amp;#34; excited because purple AND pink are my daughter&#x27;s TWO favorite colors.  Unfortunately, I was sent a Tangle Teezer that is PURPLE ONLY. The Tangle Teezer works pretty well (daughter still complains when brushing), but I&#x27;m REALLY DISSATISFIED with Amazon sellers who DO NOT SEND WHAT IS PICTURED.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome for detangling my hair.  I was using a wide tooth comb and it seemed that my hair would just tangle right back up.  This is easy on my hair and I notice it does not pull as much out as with a comb.  I have medium to thick straight hair and it works wonders for the tangles.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I buy, mom took my first one. Great brush if like me you loose a lot of hair when trying to untangle it. Or even if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s still the ideal brush. Every girl needs one, no joke. Tired of pulling at your scalp every morning when untangling. Buy one, see what I mean.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter-in-law for her birthday. She LOVED it. Her long hair tangles easily so this is a miracle for her. It makes brushing her hair &amp;#34;smooth and easy&amp;#34; &#x3D; no more painful tangles.</li>
            <li> Works reat, even on long hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush!!! I love it so much and I will never go back to another brush. It is amazing. Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Arrived well and in time. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old has waist length hair that seems to get tangled constantly. This brush is awesome! Take out the tangles quickly and with a lot less &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34; Has made our morning ritual much quicker.</li>
            <li> Bristles bend too easily but does a fair job of surface detangling. I have long hair and it gets tangled at the roots sometimes so I still have to pull out the denman to get to those areas as the bristles on this brush are short.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest thing that has happened to me since I came out of the womb with a thick head of dark brown hair.  No joke I was born looking like a middle aged mexican.  My hair has always been a source of concern because it is thick and fine and tangles really easily.  Recently it started to form dread locks because I stopped brushing it because it was so difficult to brush.  I&#x27;m just a white girl, it&#x27;s not even like I have very textured hair.  It&#x27;s wavy but there&#x27;s a lot of it.  Anyway this little guy changed my life.  Painless brushing.  It doesn&#x27;t rip hairs out.  It&#x27;s cute.  It literally brushed dread locks out of my hair.  Love this thing.  Highly recommended.  Please buy it.  This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written because I am THAT passionate about this brush.  Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not worth the $12 I paid for it.  It&#x27;s plastic and made like it should be sold at the dollar store.  It is not useful on thick hair....very disappointed</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush.  Does not hurt her like the average brush you use at home.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was very painful for my daughter. Not to mention it couldn&#x27;t even get tangles out once her hair had been washed with conditioner and detangler! She doesn&#x27;t even have that much hair. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Go to Walgreens and by a simple Conair brush.</li>
            <li> I have long coarse hair and this brush makes it so easy for me to brush my hair dry or wet. I brought several more as gifts and my friends &amp; family enjoyed using the Tangle Teezer also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than color I did not experience any difference in the orginal versus the deluxe/professional versions. So save your money and buy the original/regular.</li>
            <li> Once my daughter and I tried a Tangle Teezer we couldn&#x27;t be without one (tried the Wet Brush but it broke our hair).  We now have 4!  One for her, one for me, one for campouts and sleepovers, and one just in case.  Yup!  We love our Tangle Teezers!!  I plan on ordering more for gifts.  I&#x27;m always telling women with long hair about them.  Maybe I should sell them :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning to natural Hair from permed/processed hair and I definitely needed something to help with the tangles and knots I get sometimes when I&#x27;ve been lazy to take care of my hair. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. This is very soft and it really does help with brushing out the swirls and curls. It makes my hair a bit poofy at the roots where m natural hair is growing in, but that just might be me adjusting to my new grade of hair. I would recommend this very soft brush to help maintain your hair. It doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair at all, and I can feel that it places no stress when I use it. I would highly recommend this soft brush for those transitioning or even those who already have the natural hair. It does make it easier to come untamed hair. Definitely!</li>
            <li> I have 4b / 4c type hair, and was very skeptical about this brush, even after seeing a You Tube video of someone with (what looked like) my type of hair use it with ease.  When it finally arrived I was like ha!  There is NO way this little thing is going to work in my hair. Then, to my surprise, it did! And there was much less shed hair. I would definitely recommend this product to those with natural hair.</li>
            <li> This brush works.  However, once the bristles start to bend permanently, replace it.  Kiddo has had a lot of success with this hairbrush, as long as we replace it when it gets bent bristles.</li>
            <li> For years my daughter has tried every brush and comb made in order to untangle her hair, especially after washing.  Nothing would go through her hair without creating some sort of damage.  She was living with perpetual split ends.  Enter the Tangle Teezer and Tangle Teezer Compact and she&#x27;s a whole new person.  I&#x27;ve watched that brush just glide through her hair without a single pull or tug.  I don&#x27;t know how it works, I just know it does and am grateful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best!</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for my daughter because she cries so much with her tangles. This product almost took care of that over night. My only complaints are that is it needlessly expensive probably do to some patent and that it seems to be made out of relatively cheap material. But whatever, it works well and we use them ourselves everyday. It&#x27;s been a while now and no breakages so maybe the material is better than it seems.</li>
            <li> The brush that came in the mail is a beautiful dark purple with sparkles. These brushes are very gentle on hair and I love using it.  They are defiantly superior for getting out tangles than your average brush.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says. It goes through wet or dry hair and removes tangles without pulling out your hair.</li>
            <li> I am african-American woman and have extremely coarse hair. I used the tangle teezer in the shower when conditioning my hair. I am so pleased. It gently detangles my hair with out breakage. Highly recommended to the kinky curlies out there.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter doesn&#x27;t like her hair combed after her bath because it usually pulls her hair and the tangle teaser goes right through her hair. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Everyone were talking so much about this brush so i decided to try it. There is nothing special about it, just a piece of plastic, plus the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a handle makes it very inconvenient to use it. Doesn&#x27;t worth the money and i don&#x27;t recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> I have tons of frizzy long easily knotted wavy hair. This brush has saved me hours. If you want to carry it in your purse get the compact tangle teezer so the bristles don&#x27;t get bent and become less effective. You&#x27;ll want two of these - that&#x27;s how great thy are!!!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at a local store on clearance for under two dollars; and, even though I truly did not believe that it would work, I thought for less than two bucks I had little to lose by trying it. I have very long (almost to my waist) extremely fine hair. I love my hair; but, as far as tangles are concerned, it is a nightmare. I spend several hours every day trying to untangle, unknot, and arrange my hair after sleeping, riding in a car, standing in the wind, wearing any type of jewelry, etc... I spent a fortune on expensive conditioners and detanglers trying to find one that would allow me to simply comb out my hair after washing without hours spent fussing with snarled and knotted hair. When I finally used this I could not believe something so inexpensive, so easy to use, so simple in construction and design could work...but it did. As far as I am concerned, this cheap-looking little lump of plastic is pure magic. Believe the hype because if you have long hair it will change your life.</li>
            <li> Great product! Best hairbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. 4 star because I ordered Tangle Teezer Salon Elite, but received Original. Upset a little bit... Not good for a seller!</li>
            <li> really does go thru wet hair without major pulling. a little akward to hold</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush!!! My 5yo daughter has mixed hair with very tight curls AND tangles very easily!!!  This brush runs thru with complete ease. No tangles and no complaints from my kid. I bought 2 more just to make sure I have one anytime anywhere!! Yay :)</li>
            <li> This tangle teezer is great with removing tangles in my hair. I have an extremely sensitive scalp and experience minimal pain when using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My daughter has extremely naturally, curly hair. After my daughter&#x27;s salon visit, this is what the stylist used to comb through her hair. It was almost like butter. I had to have it immediately and my 4 year old has had less crying bouts due to the Tangle Teezer! Highly recommended for those parents who struggle to get a comb through their child&#x27;s thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use this brush ever time I detangle my hair, so that can tell you that I like it. When I first started to use it I compared it with a variety of styling tools that I previous owed and this brush seems to detangle my hair pretty well. Sometimes when I have a big section I got to get help from my jumbo comb but I have learned how to section my hair so my sections wouldn&#x27;t be too large. I read that somebody had problems with the brush slipping out of there hand when they had conditioner in the hair, didn&#x27;t experience that at all my hand and can be get pretty slippery but I still have control. I also read that this was similar to a dog brush, who cares it gets the job done and its cute. To be honest if i had a dog that i brushed its hair I probably would have washed the brush and tried it on my own hair, and if it did work as well as the Tangle Teezer I probably would have invited this myself before someone else did. I think I&#x27;m going to use this until it runs down unless there coming out with a brush even better than this. I&#x27;m not switching back to my Denman; I haven&#x27;t used it since I bought my Tangle Teezer.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it promises. Tames the tangles without ripping or pulling hair. My daughters no longer complain about getting their hair brushed, and I find we all experience far less split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is absolutely NO reason that I can find for the &#x27;dog-brush&#x27; style shape. I really wish they would put a normal handle on this brush. I Cannot give it 5 stars because every time I use it the thing goes flying out of my hand and onto the floor at least 3 times. Same for the kids.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It detangles my hair so well!!</li>
            <li> it does detangle, but not without pulling and tugging--might work on very fine or wet hair--is not a miracle tool</li>
            <li> Scalp stimulating bristles GENTLY groom your hair, and ohhh it feels so delightful!  Minimizes hair damage.  Wonderful to use as a pre-shampoo massage.</li>
            <li> Wow, how can something that looks so simple be that effective? Unreal. It&#x27;s so good that I ditched my regular hairbrush for this Teezer. I have a sensitive scalp so, this was a total delight!</li>
            <li> My four year old granddaughter has long hair that develops tangles and sometimes knots. She has her hair washed every other night, but you know how hair can become tangled after a day of play. It used to take an argument so that mom could comb out her tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, life is so much easier, combing through her hair releases the tangles with ease. It is really a miracle. She no longer whines when it is time to brush her hair. She can brush some of her hair by herself, and she is so proud of herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how the teeth in this brush are made,but they easily untangle any knot in hair. Everyone should have one. A great stocking stuffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 11-23-14</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  It lives up to the claims, 100%.  It gets tangles out, nearly tear-free.  No more, is my daughter running away from me, when it&#x27;s time to brush her hair.  It works on dry hair, as well as wet hair.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I agree with what most people have said on these reviews. I have long hair, so I have to constantly be watching out for breakage...and I feel like this brush prevents that from happening. I still have some breakage, but it&#x27;s definitely not as bad as before. Also, even as amazing as this brush is at detangling hair, please DO NOT brush your hair from root to tip...that&#x27;s STILL going to cause breakage. Instead, do it from tip to root and I promise the results will be much better :)</li>
            <li> A must have for hair that tangles ...it really does work on hair, extensions, and even wigs. I have never found anything other than a pick to ease the tangles out of my very dry processed hair until this and it is very gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has more tangles than straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;The Tangle Teezer helps her smoothe out her locks with minimum effort.&lt;br /&gt;And she looks good, too!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a lot of tangled hair and it was very hard to comb her hair.  This product really helped and now she combs her hair without any fuss. She calls it &#x27;The Magic Comb&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Good for someone with short hair. Not so good with really long hair, becomes difficult to hold and arm fatigue sets in rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Wow - I couldn&#x27;t say enough good about this brush!  My daughter has fine thin hair that seems to tangle as she sits still!  She was always complaining about my pulling her hair (I promise I wasn&#x27;t) this brush is AMAZING!!!!  She can now comb her own hair (shes 8) and get all the tangles out without asking for help or crying because it pulls!  WELL WORTH THE MONEY!  I need to buy more in case we ever lose this one.</li>
            <li> This brush really works great to brush my daughter&#x27;s hair without it hurting too much.  It really gets the tangles out.  It does tend to slip out of my hand though, so you need to make sure you get a grip.  I wish that I would have bought this sooner as it really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t I have a COVER for the Brush?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected. My daughter has really tight curls. I thought this would be a good brush for the tangles based on the reviews. Doesn&#x27;t work for all hair types.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for to replace another brush for wet hair.  Would consider purchasing another from this site.</li>
            <li> After reading the various reviews about this product, I was a bit nervous about trying it.  But my curiosity won out.  After using this for a week, I really like the tangle teezer.  I have fine hair, and the tangle teezer seems to pull fewer hairs out compared to a wide-toothed comb.  It makes my hair look smooth and shinny, and gently gets rid of tangles.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  Fast and easy transaction.  Arrived promptly.  I was a complete skeptic at first, but with all of the positive online reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It is the best brush I have ever found.  I literally do not leave home without it!  I have fine natuarally wavy hairy that tangles easily, both wet and dry. I will most certainly be purchasing others in the future!</li>
            <li> The comb teeth are dense, not so convient to use.</li>
            <li> I have spent probably thousands of dollars in the last two years trying to find a leave-in conditioner or detangler when I decided to grow my hair out and have only found a FEW products that make it easier to comb out my hair after washing it, and without making it look greasy 12 hours later. My hair is extremely fine, but I have a lot of it and even with top quality products that I use for shampoo, conditioner, damage repair, etc., it takes me a good 15 minutes to detangle my hair after washing it, and no matter how much time I take and how careful I am, I end up with handfuls, brushfuls, and floor covered in piles of hair. And finding a product that will work that won&#x27;t leave it greasy or weigh it down is extremely rare. I work from home so rarely use styling products, hair dryers, curling irons, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read about this in a magazine and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot but I didn&#x27;t have high hopes. (I literally have a large cardboard box filled with hair products that I purchased to try that did not work and that I&#x27;m stuck with - at least $2k worth!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it on my hair dry and not only did it detangle with MUCH less effort than a regular brush (or god forbid a comb, which takes twice as long), it feels GREAT on your scalp. Second test was to use it on my wet hair after sleeping all night (hair on back of head gets all matted together when I sleep). Once again, it worked and it worked even better than using it on dry hair so I was shocked and pleasantly surprised how well it worked. It probably took me 1-2 minutes instead of 15-20 minutes to brush out my hair so I am sold! Did I mention it also feels great on your scalp? (other family members are now eyeballing my brush, so I suspect I may have to purchase more of them so they leave mine alone :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have trouble brushing out your hair due to tangles from sleep or washing, especially if it&#x27;s all one length, and extremely fine, do not hesitate to try this out, and it&#x27;s a great value for your money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Now what do I do with all the high-end products that didn&#x27;t work? eBay? lol)value for your money!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Now what do I do with all the high-end products that didn&#x27;t work? eBay? lol)</li>
            <li> love this hair brush!!!!</li>
            <li> the brush works really well, except i ordered a purple one and received a black one. other than that, it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter is only 7 years old. Her hair is very fine and tangles easily. She hates having her hair brushed, we have tried everything, using conditioners and detanglers were ineffective at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she brushes her own hair, This brush is awesome!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago for my mom ,who has very long curly hair, when she told me she was unable to brush or comb out knots without tears, a headache or yanking out her hair. I recently asked her about it and she said it was AMAZING!!!!! She can brush her hair with great ease and comfort. She loves it and highly recommends it. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy :)</li>
            <li> This item detangles my hair faster and better than a regular brush.  With my old brush sometimes it would catch in tangles and even break my hair, causing split ends.  The Tangle Teezer, despite its stupid name, hardly ever catches or breaks hair.</li>
            <li> It is OK. Like some reviews said it only smooth out the hair and doesn&#x27;t really detangle the hair. Still I like it better than regular brush/comb.</li>
            <li> I can see how it teeze the tangles, but it&#x27;s really surface brushing. I find myself reaching for my old brush with almost the same effect and better massage on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Every brush I have ever tried on my 2A/2B hair has pulled on my hair so much and the amount of shed I would get was so fustrating.  This brush has eliminated both of those issues.  I&#x27;ve always been tender-headed, since childhood,  so I can&#x27;t remember a time where there hasn&#x27;t been some tears when brushing my hair, until now..  I still need to use my fingers and a wide tooth comb, section by section, especially on tough knots.  So, it won&#x27;t eliminate those steps for me, but it makes it so much easier and comfortable.  Finally!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to try this on my stepdaughter&#x27;s 3B hair and will update when I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult whose hair has tangled easily all my life. Despite frequent upkeep, by the end of the day I have knots and nests whenever I wear my hair down. I&#x27;ve followed ever kind of advice and used every product imaginable to get rid of my tangles. I have waist length really thick hair. I get my hair trimmed at a local beauty school and one of the students there told me that  it&#x27;s a genetic condition and like all chronic conditions, it can&#x27;t be cured, but it can be managed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tangle Teezer is a big help to me. There are a lot of products similar to this, but none work as well. Others are the wrong size or shape and the bristles are too soft. Soft bristled tangle combs will brush the top layer, but can&#x27;t suss out really mangled tangles. The Tangle Teezer is able to get out nearly all my tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can&#x27;t just brush through it with ease. If you have thick hair that tangles and mats, there are no easy answers, but this product helps. I use it in stages. In the shower when my hair is saturated with conditioner, then again after I&#x27;ve applied leave-ins and again when it&#x27;s dry and several times through the day if I&#x27;m wearing my hair down. It is VITAL to start brushing from the tips to the roots in small increments. It&#x27;s important if you have thick hair to separate your hair into 4 to 6 smaller sections and go through each one individually. It may seem time intensive, but this will really undo all of the tangles. If you try to just brush right through, you&#x27;ll get the surface layer and it will quickly tangle again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a miracle cure - but it&#x27;s the best product out there for tangles and mats.</li>
            <li> Yes, it gets the tangles out-EVENTUALLY!&lt;br /&gt;This works, I guess, but it takes 1/2 hour of combing to get all the tangles out. It quickly smoothed out the top if the hair, then I have to lift, separate and search. I finish with a regular brush and I ALWAYS hit tons of tangles that I have to work out.</li>
            <li> This hair brush works very well in terms of untangling my hair (both wet and dry). However, I realize that I can&#x27;t wash the brush because the water can go into the brush itself through the crack where the two parts glued together. Also, it is pretty difficult to take out the loose hair that is stuck between the teeth of the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works great on my 3 year old daughters very long, tangly hair. She used to cry every time I brushed her hair because no matter how careful I tried to be, it always pulled and hurt her. This brush takes a little extra work to get all the tangles out, but that&#x27;s ok because she doesn&#x27;t DREAD me brushing her hair anymore! She used to run away when I said it was time to brush her hair, but not anymore, thank goodness! I honestly wondered if it was actually going to do what it said in the description, but it really does!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use a regular brush again. My hair is hip length and tangled easily. This does not pull my hair out!  It&#x27;s great used for wet or dry hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> Not only does it NOT allow you to dantangle your hair, it doesn&#x27;t even brush it. The plastic brushes are too soft. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this upon my entrance to growing my natural hair - 4c 4b type. This was a waste of effort more for straightened or naturally straight hsir types, I felt like I was ripping my hair and this was just gliding over instead of through my hair.</li>
            <li> Possibly the best hair brush I&#x27;ve ever used. Tangle free, easy to use, light to carry. The shape of the brush fits to the hand, so it is very easy to brush your hair from any angle. Once brushed, the hair is very silky and stays silky throughout the day. I love it so much I&#x27;m buying a couple more for everyone in my family!</li>
            <li> We all have varying degrees of curly hair, so this is the perfect tool for detangling. They made great stocking stuffers for my nieces, too.</li>
            <li> Amazing little gadget!  I have super coarse, curly hair that usually takes 2 hours to detangle and style.  This brush cut that time down to 45 minutes, and the best thing is that it didn&#x27;t hurt.  Also, I lost much less hair than I do when I use a comb to detangle.  When I received my Tangle Teezer in the mail, I was skeptical initially because the bristles are so soft and short - I doubted that it would work on my hair.  I&#x27;m glad to say that I was wrong!  From now on, this item is a must-have for me.</li>
            <li> Bath times are always fine...but combing our wet hair post bath let to crying , grumpy kids - even after I tried every kind of conditioner on the market!  My sister in law told me about this and wow...I wished I had known about it sooner. I tried it on my youngest who has long, somewhat fine, naturally wavy hair and was impressed to the point of amazement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me seconds to comb out her hair, there was no snags, no snarls, just lovely straight hair. She was happy, I was happy..I wondered why I had been left out of this secret for so long. Why wasn&#x27;t this in all the kid books / magazines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what I discovered is even in the finest of hair, this does not go all the way though and remove all snarls on dry hair. Even after using on wet hair and tying it back; by the time it was dry those snarls were back, more so on the underside where the teeth and not long or strong enough to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it does a quick, good job on the wet hair, but really needs to be followed through with a regular brush with long teeth for best results; and on dry hair this is just a starting point.to get through those top layers and of course on girls with wavy hair this will cause more frizz, so I would not use at all on dry hair unless you are planning on tying it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For its purpose though, bath times end with a few seconds of using this comb through the hair, it basically glides through like butter, with no force to the point my kiddo was asking if I was done already out of shock of feeling nothing. There is no tugging or pulling which is great for delicate wet hair, and it really is so easy, you will wonder why you did not come across it before! For the price and ease of use, and making bathtimes an easier process, this is an excellent item!</li>
            <li> They should take over the name No More Tears</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical when buying this brush--I kept telling myself not to get my hopes up because NO brush has ever worked for me. In fact, I&#x27;m used to getting tangles out with my fingers (which hurts like hell and takes up a lot of time...not to mention makes you lose all that hair). After trying this product out for about a week now, I can honestly say this is the first time brushing my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like a chore. It actually feels nice on my scalp (and gets rid of dandruff flakes easily), detangles without pulling on my hair or hurting my sensitive scalp, and HEY, it&#x27;s purple!</li>
            <li> Great brush for a daughter with long hair that complains when her dad brushes her hair.  It takes extra time to brush but it makes it a relatively painless experience for her.  I can say this has improved our mornings considerably because it doesn&#x27;t agitate an already sleepy or moody child.  So thankful that it exists.  One tip, you do need to get untangled hair out of the way so you can work on the tangled areas and brushing more frequently cuts down on the time to work on really bad tangles.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Tangle Teezer 8 years ago. My hair is fine and tangles easily whether it&#x27;s cut short or long. Using this brush has saved me time and the pain of combing out knots. It&#x27;s also great at brushing out hairspray. I use it when my hair is both wet and dry, and have experienced no hair breakage. I like that it is easily cleaned and comfortable to hold. Buying my second one now as a spare for when I travel.</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot of good things about this brush and was anxious to try it. I usually buy my brushes from the Dollar Store so was a little nervous about spending that much money on a brush. I will give it the three stars for the fact that it did go through my hair, wet or dry, without much trouble. But I never saw the results of shiny hair, etc. they promised. In addition, I don&#x27;t like not having a handle on my brush - it falls out of my hand every time it catches in my hair. A friend gave my daughter a Conair detangler brush, and I ended up buying one for myself I loved it so much! Some people may have good results with this brush, but it was not for me.</li>
            <li> Worked good at first. If your girl had thick hair this brush is hard for them to use by themselves.</li>
            <li> I live this it works miracles I will be purchasing more just because i live it so much I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference with getting rid of tangles than a brush</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair that often catches a lot of tangles. This product was okay. I had higher expectations for it because I had see a video review of the item, and it was highly rated. It was okay overall, but would still leave hair semi-tangled.</li>
            <li> Our 7 year old hates to get her hair brushed due to tangles.  This brush has been a life saver since we ordered it!  She actually requests that we use this brush and no other.  Works well on wet or dry hair.  The only thing we don&#x27;t like is the way you hold the brush.  It is supposed to fit just right in you hand.  There isn&#x27;t really anything to hold on to.  As a result, I drop it nearly every time I use it. Overall a great product for a little one who hates tangles!</li>
            <li> Stupid stupid product. Doesn&#x27;t work and was a total waste of $ and carbon footprint.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush. It&#x27;s the only thing she will use to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this brush, and it is all she will use now!</li>
            <li> I wish I had known the existence of such hair brushes earlier! It worked like magic, and as a Ph.D., I&#x27;m still puzzled how it can possibly work so well! Seriously! This little stuff saved my struggle with my little girl&#x27;s hair! Even my son likes it because it feels like a &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; when using it! Bought more for mom, sister, niece, and girlfriends. You really need to try it as long as you have some hair!! :)</li>
            <li> My 9 year old brat likes it.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, tangle-prone hair which has always been a pain to brush. But with this hairbrush, there is much less snagging. It is gentle on hair and does not pull out nearly as much hair as a regular paddle brush. It is great on wet or dry hair as well. I think it is a great choice for kids because of the fun shape and how easy it is to use</li>
            <li> This is an excellent tool to get out tangles. I bought this about 2 years ago and it served me well until today. I had to replace it because it is a little worn out. For anyone who has or plan to use this, please take care of it. The teeth on mine started to wear out and bend at angles causing more breakage than necessary. Also, this product is not meant to be a miracle tool. You have to gently comb the tangles out from bottom to top especially if you have tightly curly hair. I have 4a/b natural hair. You cannot just rip through thick hair and expect no damage. Also, I find it works best for me on damp hair with some leave in or conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got the tangle teezer for my daughter (ok, and my sanity) for her 2nd birthday next week.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it, so I tried it this afternoon when I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*significant improvement in being able to brush a wiggly two-year-old&#x27;s hair&lt;br /&gt;*doesn&#x27;t get stuck in her hair when she tries it herself&lt;br /&gt;*bonus head massage while brushing (I had to try it myself, of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*very noisy--it sounds like your hair is getting ripped out (of course it isn&#x27;t, but the loud noise surprised me)&lt;br /&gt;*awkward to hold in certain positions on head on self and especially when trying to brush someone else&#x27;s hair for them&lt;br /&gt;*kind of difficult to store if you don&#x27;t have a lot of space in your bathroom (the little pricklies are thinner than I expected, so I worry about bending them)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this after just 2 uses.  I found that my daughter&#x27;s fine hair still tangles enough for it to pull in that sensitive area by the ears, BUT it is so much better now because the rest of the tangles are easily undone and she doesn&#x27;t fight me (or scream) as much as she did as of this morning before receiving the tangle teezer!</li>
            <li> Heard so many great things about this product.&lt;br /&gt;I am black with extra kinky hair.&lt;br /&gt;This worked well with detangling my hair but it was not as amazing as the people on YouTube made it seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is however still the best detangling tool I have used on my hair tlll date so I will be sticking to it</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, with no handle, but this thing rocks.  It takes out tangles so much easier than anything I have used before.  Easily removing tangles results in less stress on hair and less breakage.  It&#x27;s a win all the way around.</li>
            <li> This works far better than any other brush on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. She&#x27;s very skittish when it comes to brushing because she sometimes gets a tangle or two and it pulls. This helps to minimize the pulling. Works well on wet hair too. I have thick, fine hair that is very long. I go to a long air salon that focuses on the health of your hair above the style. They used to only endorse boar bristle brushes until the last time I was there and saw they were peddling something very similar to this, saying it was great for not causing damage.</li>
            <li> FIRST OFF, THE BRUSH I RECEIVED DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE PICTURE- ITS A SOLID PASTEL LIKE PURPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I FINALLY MADE THIS PURCHASE AFTER MO.S OF BEING LEARY OF IT FROM READING A REVIEW 06/2013 THAT CALLED IT A &#x27;MIRACLE&#x27; IF YOU HAVE LONG BABY FINE HAIR...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT JUST A HUNK A PLASTIC IT STATED. WELL I&#x27;M HERE TO TELL YOU- IT IS &amp; I&#x27;M OUT $18.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! It makes detangling my hair and my nieces hair a breeze! We both have sensitive scalps and and using regular combs made it difficult to complete our hairstyles. I recommended for anyone who has children with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Brushes over tangles and leaves top hair smooth, but tangles are still underneath. Maybe not meant for thick hair?</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> i really loved it, it doesnt pull my hair and doesnt break it, i also use it in the shower to detangle my hair while using conditioner and it  is awesome</li>
            <li> They are selling &amp;#34;Tangle Teezer Salon Elite Hair Brush, Purple Crush&amp;#34;, but what actually shipped is not the Salon Elite, is The Original. They are two different versions! Very Bad</li>
            <li> works great-my 2nd one--daughter has fuzzy hair and this works great</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable.I like it.</li>
            <li> Best brush for long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been hard to brush due to its heavy load. Sometimes it really hurts when I use other combs. But this one makes things much easier and i am not regret choosing it. Great buy.</li>
            <li> It really detangles and leaves hair smooth and silky.  I did not experience any breakage, contrary to other reviews. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. It&#x27;s not for me, for my daughters 6, 10 and a wife. Before this brush it was a battle ground at home when it was time to brush their hair! By the way, I have the honor of brushing their hair after shower - go figure! Wife did not want to be in the same room.&lt;br /&gt;Get your sanity back - get one of these. 😇</li>
