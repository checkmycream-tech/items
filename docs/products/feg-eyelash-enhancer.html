            <li>so it&#x27;s actually great) and not to put it on my lower lashes since putting it on my top lashes before bed</li>
            <li>and I am very very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased</li>
            <li>I have thicker, longer and more lashes than I have ever had in my life!   </li>
            <li>I got a lot more of them!      </li>
            <li>LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>I love everything about RevitaLash!  </li>

            <li>Be vigilant and use every night at first, you will be very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>but my lashes looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>My mom used Latisse and it was amazing</li>
            <li>I own a business and when I am at the desk sitting and checking people out...</li>
            <li>But I just wish I had more lashes quantity wise.</li>
            <li>so you may want to save your money and put it towards a product that is effective as well as FDA approved.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to hear this!!</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited and now I think they are at their maximum growth and my lashes are darker, longer and curl better!!  </li>
            <li>It has not been sufficient time to have full great lashes</li>
            <li>and now I can put it on very easily.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you use it consistently.</li>
            <li>I am glad</li>
            <li>, I have been growing them.\\&quot; :-)</li>
            <li>Be sure to not discontinue the product either....</li>
            <li>especially for how amazing my eyelashes are now!!!! :-)</li>
            <li>It works better than the prescription brand advertised on TV.</li>
            <li>All that requires is one skinny brush stroke along the top lash line</li>
            <li>So simple and the results are remarkable!!!</li>
            <li>for such great pricing!!!</li>
            <li>I wonder if this gives better results...</li>
            <li>anduse my favorite \\&quot;Lancome Booster XL\\&quot; in the morning before my mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the results I posted my pictures on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im still pleased.</li>
            <li>I will let you know more when the 6 weeks are up.</li>
            <li>and I love all of them.  </li>
            <li>I have never been so satisfied with a beauty product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 75 &amp; my lashes (as did my head hair)thinned out, but with the Revitalash they are better than ever.  </li>
            <li>Guess it&#x27;s not received the OK by the FDA</li>
            <li>I just ordered some for her :)</li>
            <li>I believe Latisse might have been the better choice.</li>
            <li>In 6 weeks I was pleased, in 8 weeks</li>
            <li>Maryke says I love it  </li>
            <li>I love it  </li>
            <li>I love it   </li>
            <li>and I began looking for a more permanent solution</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to use it every night but</li>
            <li>But after one more application, there was no way I could continue using it.  </li>
            <li>and I just love the product.</li>
            <li>Overpriced \\&quot;magic beans\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to enhance my lashes prior to my Wedding, and had excellent results.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this in hopes that I will see some improvement as I hear it may take up to 8 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>I am a Nurse Practitioner and I assure you, it&#x27;s safe and will change how you feel about your stubby lashes once they grow longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Revitlash for 15 months now, and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Buying more today.</li>
            <li>I received the best price possible by purchasing it through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes just skip the mascara, especially if I am at home because my eyelashes look great without mascara!  </li>
            <li>Revitalash has worked better than I thought it would in that it has lasted longer than advertised.  </li>
            <li>Best of luck towards not just \\&quot;longer-looking\\&quot; but actually longer lashes!</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>I started to use the product on both eyes because I wanted to be matching:).</li>
            <li>It took a couple more months for the eyelashes to match.</li>
            <li>This product worked and helped me to feel more confident when looking at others.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good at lengthening my lashes.</li>
            <li>And mine didn&#x27;t start out this way before they originally fell out!</li>
            <li>I have tried the Talika Lipocils before but Revitalash is better, talika does makes my lashes longer and thicker but easily fall out while revitalash strengthen lashes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other eyelash treatments and besides Latisse this is the best.</li>
            <li>me, mascara is the most important makeup.</li>
            <li>They also seem to separate better and are more distinct now.</li>
            <li>so this is an easy way to have some of the benefits without the risks.</li>
            <li>Make sure you clean your lids well as you do dip the applicator in and out of the tube increasing the chance of infection</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR the best, my eyelashes grew to very noticeable length in about 3 weeks of nightly use.</li>
            <li>AGAIN I  STRONGLY ADVICE AGAINST THE PURCHASE OF THIS PRODUCT!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I am loving the results and am truly surprised at how effective it is.</li>
            <li>I will update in several weeks time but as of right now I am very happy to already notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Got to say its pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Because I had used this product which I bought from a different seller and it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>After they get to a good length even using every other day keeps them looking good and the product lasts even longer.</li>
            <li>but I recommend this product left and right to everyone because of the fantastic results!!!!</li>
            <li>I cannot see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>, I calmly and happily replied \\&quot;no, they are mine natural lashes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The price is great, it last much longer than the Rx, and I am thrilled that I took the chance to buy it and try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m happy with the results, since my lashes were very short before I started using Revistalash (</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a while now, and have had fabulous results.</li>
            <li>had cancer and experienced the same problem.  </li>
            <li>After three months of Nightly Application my eyelashes filled in and grew in length.</li>
            <li>This review is NOT for the Revitalash Advanced.</li>
            <li>So, if you want beautiful, long eyelashes, this is the product to purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 24 days and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Everyone would say how long and beautiful they were</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>You will have beautiful long lashes in 4 weeks!</li>
            <li>Usually it would say works almost as good, for the money savings, it is good since you are saving money, stuff like that.</li>
            <li>Noticeable results after 3 weeks or more when consistently applied - once nightly.</li>
            <li>It feels great to know that this works, so I don&#x27;t have to spend thousands to maintain long lashes by Latisse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and find that it has made a significant difference in the length of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I originally started using this product when I had surgery</li>
            <li>Try it, it&#x60;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I did not think this product would work as well as it has and it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>quite sure at first if the product would work...sounded \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot;, but some weeks after the first application I started noticing that my eyelashes were getting longer, particularly at the outer corners.</li>
            <li>The kind the FDA HAS OKed, you need to use a new brush every day or so &amp; would take a lot longer to use every day</li>
            <li>As per directions, I use it on clean skin once every night before bed.</li>
            <li>First I learned of Latisse of the many eye lash extension products from the online review, and as many people highly recommended it, I went to the eye doctor&#x27;s office to buy the Latisse.  </li>
            <li>You will NOT be disappointed but happy as can be at the beautiful results!</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply, the formula doesn&#x27;t sting (unless you poke yourself in the eye with the brush!), and I&#x27;m seeing some indication of new lashes in an area of my eyelid where growth is sparce.</li>
            <li>Go for it girls,it&#x27;s worth the price and have fun batting those lushes lashes!</li>
            <li>Have used other brands for eyelash growth with great results.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that happened is that I am pleased beyond measure and how I have lovely longer lashes now.  </li>
            <li>Product was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>My doctor stated that my lashes looked healthy and she could see the new growth.</li>
            <li>They do look longer with mascara and the curl is definitely nice since my lashes are normally stick straight.     </li>
            <li>they look great but with mascara they are fabulous long and lush.  </li>
            <li>Rather than be a 3 month supply, I am still using my first wand after 4 months!  </li>
            <li>I then decided to buy the Revitalash conditioner because it had a huge discount (64%), and didn&#x27;t have much expectations as to whether this will work for me.  </li>
            <li>After 2 months my lashes did grow and now 3 months later I have amazing lashes and people</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>(well worth the wait)</li>
            <li>but I do read all the reviews and extract information and then decide if it is worth a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had to laugh, and thanked them for the compliment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before with success.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the wait</li>
            <li>I replace the product every quarter to assure it&#x27;s fresh and working.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>Very rare do I actually see results the product claims it is supposed to do even when most reviews give it 5 stars</li>
            <li>Right now, I will not be purchasing the product again.</li>
            <li>will post a positive review if it ends up working !</li>
            <li>I am one happy woman who had very little eyelashes three months ago.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work - I even bought it at full price, so</li>
            <li>Revitalash had a great product until the recent lawsuit which the ingredients had to be changed in order to prevent further damage to the eyes.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived super fast, and I am awaiting to see if it works as describe.  </li>
            <li>A little over a year ago I got remarried and decided to get lash extensions to make my eyes pop in wedding pictures - - as my lashes have thinned out throughout the years (I am 40).I loved having fuller lashes</li>
            <li>I decided with the huge amount I am already saving vs retail price, I rather spend another 10 bucks and buy directly from amazon versus amazon</li>
            <li>Fast shipping for this product!</li>
            <li>After two weeks, my eyelashes appeared much longer and it was actually fun to apply mascara.</li>
            <li>This product really doesn&#x27;t work that well at all!  </li>
            <li>First tube lasted about 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the next 3 weeks will produce greater results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I have only been using Revitalash a month and am hoping for even better results as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li>My fiancee was the first one that noticed my eyelashes and commented on the length of my lashes.  </li>
            <li>Revitalash was appealing to me after seeing the commercial</li>
            <li>I say different because I can&#x27;t confirm for sure that they have grown</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in 2 weeks after my first application.</li>
            <li>I use exactly as directed, and have had no side effects at all.</li>
            <li>It took about 5 weeks to see results, with greater results each following week.  </li>
            <li>I have cornea issues and checked with my doctor first</li>
            <li>I first found out about Revitalash through my mom&#x27;s co-worker.  </li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>My lashes are growing and I&#x27;m starting to see more curl in them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for 5 months now (same bottle) and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I was imagining it</li>
            <li>Used this product for 8 months - in 2 months I really saw a difference!</li>
            <li>but I know I still need to give it a couple more months before seeing big results.</li>
            <li>The first result I started noticing was that my eyelashes were curling upwards and I stopped using my eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>&quot; and now he is absolutely AMAZED at how my lashes tripled in length!</li>
            <li>My lashes grow fast!</li>
            <li>Be patient with results and consistent with your application each evening.</li>
            <li>I believe it took me at least 4 months to really be happy with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>plus they are your lashes not fake.</li>
            <li>but it does cause a little more fine hair growth around the eye area where applied.</li>
            <li>My aunt said it took right around 4 months before she saw really noticeable results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d LOVE to have longer lashes and the sparse areas filled in, but not sure this is worth it.</li>
            <li>when I first started using it, it took a good 3 weeks of using it daily on the upper and lower lashes before I saw anything.  </li>
            <li>I loved that you only needed it at night because that meant I could go back</li>
            <li>Also love that Revitalash lasts for a long time, close to a year.</li>
            <li>It is still too early to see the full results.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to be diligent and apply ever single night.</li>
            <li>Actually, at first I only put Revitalash on one eye, to do my own experiment and could definitely see a difference between the two eyes.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants beautiful long and dark eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall out any more and are very soft and actually have a curl to them!  </li>
            <li>I am now just putting it on my upper lashes &amp; it has been fine.</li>
            <li>I am a natural blonde with very light eye lashes so it has always been an issue for me to have lashes that \\&quot;show\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>my eyelashes are long, beautiful, and dark!</li>
            <li>I would love to hear about other products that are not too expensive and are effective!!</li>
            <li>Within 3 months you will notice an absolute difference.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are much longer and are getting thicker.  </li>
            <li>I started doing more research on TALIKA but this time not from the store I purchased it from but from google and spent hours reading reviews.</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend Revitalash to anybody looking for a change in their lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been very hairy and couldn&#x27;t figure out why this was happening, but think it may be the Revitalash.  </li>
            <li>Cant really tell that my lashes are not growing like they use to, but</li>
            <li>A friend of mine used this product for a while and really raved about it, so I&#x27;ll be faithfully applying . . .</li>
            <li>I have to say it DID take 6 weeks to really knock my socks off with the effect</li>
            <li>Based upon what she saw and my personal experience she said she felt comfortable now recommending it to people as she had not met anyone who was using it before but had done her research on it.</li>
            <li>After a couple of months of using this product faithfully every night, I really began to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>Now, after almost three months, I really don&#x27;t even need mascara anymore.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that this really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I really want this for christmas</li>
            <li>It took about 4 months to really notice a change.  </li>
            <li>They look so much longer when I put mascara on.</li>
            <li>but they dont as much anymore.</li>
            <li>Also the length not so much the fullness was noticeable.</li>
            <li>and theres not that much of a difference in thickness</li>
            <li>and I can say that my lashes are absolutely longer than they were when I started.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t buy it there for TWICE as much but saved $$ by buying it on Amazon.com instead.  </li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t seen any results, but I think it takes about 8 weeks before u really start to notice something.</li>
            <li>Product came fast.</li>
            <li>My mother-in-law put this in my xmas stocking 2 years ago, and I was skeptic, but it really works ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for over a 1 1/2 and find it really works for me.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are fuller, longer, darker and they are no longer completely straight.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first about this product considering that the description for the product says that it will \\&quot;help achieve the beautiful LOOK of Longer, Thicker, and Fuller eyelashes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and is so much easier than false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Long, full, just as when I was a teenager!</li>
            <li>Revitalash is simple to use,  Just apply once a day to clean dry eye lashes, and with a little patience, you will see noticeably, beautiful longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure results vary due to ethnicity, age, and lash condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived (although felt like forever, maybe because I was so excited to try it, but wth delivery, it took about 2 weeks) and the formula was completely different then</li>
            <li>But I will tell you this, since I started using the product, my lashes on the bottom and on the top got extremely longer.</li>
            <li>I have used many other lash enhancer products.</li>
            <li>I heard that because of the patents held by Latisse, many manufacturers had to alter the active ingrediants.  </li>
            <li>but this has not happened to me using as clean a technique as I possibly can.  </li>
            <li>They are so thick and beautiful, and finally I have noticable eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical, but decided to purchase and try anyway since I read so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>Am age 41 &amp; my lashes were full but short &amp; unnoticeable without curling them.</li>
            <li>The itch was not bad enough to stop using and didnt result in any redness on the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is new eyelashes!</li>
            <li>Now, I am off to try a new one!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been less than 4 months and my eyelashes are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I am now pregnant and have noticed my eyelids are sore the next morning after applying.</li>
            <li>but as I grew older, they became thinner and shorter</li>
            <li>As I am growing older (50+), my lashes are growing thinner.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was really convinced when I read it had been developed for a man who&#x27;s wife</li>
            <li>I also read in some reviews about the skin around the eyes becoming dark and/or eye pigment changes.</li>
            <li>My lashes are long and full now like when I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>The liquid was kinda thick and it did not make my lashes are nice as the pictures show.</li>
            <li>After using the product for 4 weeks i developed a mild stye or ingrown hair on my upper lid...not noticeable to anybody but me.</li>
            <li>The right eye has been slower to grow, but it is definitely starting.</li>
            <li>Right eye lashes seem longer than left but will keep using &amp; post another review in a month or so</li>
            <li>I like this product because it thickens your eyelashes without making them too super long like latisse.  </li>
            <li>This is my first eyelash conditioner, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and just seeing a little is exciting for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Believe me, skip that new dress, pass up on that new shirt, but trust me, purchase this bottle.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to see some new lashes.  </li>
            <li>and I am already seeing an improvement in the length of my lashes and new growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed new growth and my lashes are getting longer and curling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the new version and will probably try that when I run out.</li>
            <li>I am 36 year old and this product made me look just overnight 30 years older.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and really works!!  </li>
            <li>- they are REALLY long now (after 10 weeks continuous use) and what was most important to me -- LUSH and THICK.</li>
            <li>Believe me, I would not spend the time writing this if it was not for the fact, for the first time ever, there is a product that actually does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>I tried it (somewhat skeptically at first) but found that not only did it work</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this product and within a week had itchy eyes, red too...would not purchase this product again</li>
            <li>I have seen a small difference and am confident this product will do the job.</li>
            <li>I also want to report that when I am not careful or put too much on</li>
            <li>With the other product I used the growth was amazing and not only did my current eyelashes get longer</li>
            <li>eyelashes did grow significantly with this, but the irritation was not worth the price.</li>
            <li>I purchased my bottle from amazon.com (they had the best prices by far unless I wanted to order from some little site that was not made well and made me scared it could be fake).</li>
            <li>I took pictures to document and the before and after progress and was pleasantly surprised when I looked at the photos 4 weeks later and saw much change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, I am 56 years old, if that matters to anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old,</li>
            <li>AfroAmerican with thinning, soft hair.</li>
            <li>again, no where near that.</li>
            <li>Has anyone else had unexpected hair growth?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it about three weeks, so it&#x27;s too soon to really know its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m noticing reslts so far for length so far, but I&#x27;m not seeing any results on thickness.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly 3.5 weeks.</li>
            <li>This happened early on.</li>
            <li>I am seeing thicker lashes, but I am also getting alot of eye boogers (discharge) and my eyes are so sensitive that I have had to take my contacts out some days.</li>
            <li>and wow.   </li>
            <li>but that is natural process.  </li>
            <li>After using Revitalash for several months, mine are much longer and fuller.  </li>
            <li>My eyes aren&#x27;t sensitive</li>
            <li>And the old lash tube still has all the printed words.  </li>
            <li>So far I like this product.</li>
            <li>Then I developed a sensitivity to it.  </li>
            <li>Then in the last 2 weeks they&#x27;ve really started getting longer and stronger.</li>
            <li>The only thing that really works is Latisse which you need a prescription for.   </li>
            <li>I was embarrassed to look at people because my eyelashes were short, straight and sparse.</li>
            <li>It might be because I spent a month on Talika and switched and basically did not start fresh</li>
            <li>When I apply mascara, my lashes look really good but not at a point that people might think that I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li>My left lashes grew quicker than my right, but I definitely saw results after 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li>That said, the product also lasts a really long time, I found using it every few days meant my tube lasted a couple of years which makes the current price even better!</li>
            <li>You can not expect to see results overnight (for those of you that get too anxious and give up easily.)</li>
            <li>I bought this a few years ago after hearing that the product was developed by a gentleman whose wife had gone through chemo due to breast cancer and lost all her hair including eyelashes, the clerk in the store had great eyelashes and said it was due to Revitalash.  </li>
            <li>I have only had it for about 3 weeks, but already I have new eyelash growth!</li>
            <li>I now have lashes long enough to curl and, with the right mascara</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s only week 3 and the conditioner states not to expect results until wk 8, so this is real early for any results.  </li>
            <li>While I doubt that anyone will ever comment about how incredibly long my lashes, I am very</li>
            <li>If you get some in your eyes it does sting a little, but quickly goes away.   </li>
            <li>Now I even have strangers comment on how pretty and long my eyelashes are (daily!).  </li>
            <li>My lashes were thin and short before, and although they still are not really full and lush, they have improved greatly.  </li>
            <li>Other than that the product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>In all fairness, it could just be allergies in general, but the only new thing in my cosmetic routine was the revitalash.</li>
            <li>So as long as your expectations are realistic</li>
            <li>/&gt;Revitalash does what it claims, I am shocked and tell others about my great experience.</li>
            <li>When I stopped, they went back to their short, straight, sparse state, but am now on my second tube and they&#x27;re growing again.  </li>
            <li>I barely need mascara</li>
            <li>I have tried Rapid Lash and it did not work nearly as well, so I went back to Revitalish....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how noticeable it is already, especially with mascara on.</li>
            <li>Trust me, I am a regular old girl and am writing this from my heart.    </li>
            <li>I even started to use it in a bare section of one of my eye brows and there is hairs coming out</li>
            <li>the person doing it both times said I had \\&quot;crazy, good</li>
            <li>It does take a few weeks to see results, but it is worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>My own mother thought I had on false eyelashes!  </li>
            <li>I read other reviews and some women had to cut their lashes because they were so long, sadly I am no where near that</li>
            <li>My wife tried this after first trying several other eyelash conditioners.  </li>
            <li>have new lash growth that is about 1/8\\&quot; long already!</li>
            <li>had no side effects (red line where you apply it or some small bumps that grew for others as I read), it can burn for a second if it gets near the eye, but the burn feeling is mild and goes away in 5 seconds.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really works, I had empty spots in my lashes Constantly and trying to hid it with Mascara and liner.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is my eyes get red and my lids get sensitive.</li>
            <li>Then all of the sudden I noticed  a few lashes getting longer, and then a few more.  </li>
            <li>I have always had long lashes, but they have become very sparse, and in a couple spots were missing completely.</li>
            <li>this product made my eyes a little red (not as much as latisse)</li>

            <li> but my lashes looked amazing.  </li>
            <li> My mom used Latisse and it was amazing</li>
            <li> I own a business and when I am at the desk sitting and checking people out...</li>
            <li> But I just wish I had more lashes quantity wise.</li>
            <li> so you may want to save your money and put it towards a product that is effective as well as FDA approved.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to hear this!!</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited and now I think they are at their maximum growth and my lashes are darker, longer and curl better!!  </li>
            <li> It has not been sufficient time to have full great lashes</li>
            <li> and now I can put it on very easily.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I am glad</li>
            <li> , I have been growing them.\\&quot; :-)</li>
            <li> Be sure to not discontinue the product either....</li>
            <li> especially for how amazing my eyelashes are now!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> It works better than the prescription brand advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> All that requires is one skinny brush stroke along the top lash line</li>
            <li> So simple and the results are remarkable!!!</li>
            <li> for such great pricing!!!</li>
            <li> I wonder if this gives better results...</li>
            <li> anduse my favorite \\&quot;Lancome Booster XL\\&quot; in the morning before my mascara.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the results I posted my pictures on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im still pleased.</li>
            <li> I will let you know more when the 6 weeks are up.</li>
            <li> and I love all of them.  </li>
            <li> I have never been so satisfied with a beauty product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 75 &amp; my lashes (as did my head hair)thinned out, but with the Revitalash they are better than ever.  </li>
            <li> Guess it&#x27;s not received the OK by the FDA</li>
            <li> I just ordered some for her :)</li>
            <li> I believe Latisse might have been the better choice.</li>
            <li> In 6 weeks I was pleased, in 8 weeks</li>
            <li> Maryke says I love it  </li>
            <li> I love it  </li>
            <li> I love it   </li>
            <li> and I began looking for a more permanent solution</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m able to use it every night but</li>
            <li> But after one more application, there was no way I could continue using it.  </li>
            <li> and I just love the product.</li>
            <li> Overpriced \\&quot;magic beans\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to enhance my lashes prior to my Wedding, and had excellent results.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this in hopes that I will see some improvement as I hear it may take up to 8 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> I am a Nurse Practitioner and I assure you, it&#x27;s safe and will change how you feel about your stubby lashes once they grow longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Revitlash for 15 months now, and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Buying more today.</li>
            <li> I received the best price possible by purchasing it through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes just skip the mascara, especially if I am at home because my eyelashes look great without mascara!  </li>
            <li> Revitalash has worked better than I thought it would in that it has lasted longer than advertised.  </li>
            <li> Best of luck towards not just \\&quot;longer-looking\\&quot; but actually longer lashes!</li>
            <li> and I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> I started to use the product on both eyes because I wanted to be matching:).</li>
            <li> It took a couple more months for the eyelashes to match.</li>
            <li> This product worked and helped me to feel more confident when looking at others.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good at lengthening my lashes.</li>
            <li> And mine didn&#x27;t start out this way before they originally fell out!</li>
            <li> I have tried the Talika Lipocils before but Revitalash is better, talika does makes my lashes longer and thicker but easily fall out while revitalash strengthen lashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other eyelash treatments and besides Latisse this is the best.</li>
            <li> me, mascara is the most important makeup.</li>
            <li> They also seem to separate better and are more distinct now.</li>
            <li> so this is an easy way to have some of the benefits without the risks.</li>
            <li> Make sure you clean your lids well as you do dip the applicator in and out of the tube increasing the chance of infection</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best, my eyelashes grew to very noticeable length in about 3 weeks of nightly use.</li>
            <li> AGAIN I  STRONGLY ADVICE AGAINST THE PURCHASE OF THIS PRODUCT!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I am loving the results and am truly surprised at how effective it is.</li>
            <li> I will update in several weeks time but as of right now I am very happy to already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Got to say its pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> Because I had used this product which I bought from a different seller and it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li> After they get to a good length even using every other day keeps them looking good and the product lasts even longer.</li>
            <li> but I recommend this product left and right to everyone because of the fantastic results!!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> , I calmly and happily replied \\&quot;no, they are mine natural lashes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The price is great, it last much longer than the Rx, and I am thrilled that I took the chance to buy it and try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m happy with the results, since my lashes were very short before I started using Revistalash (</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now, and have had fabulous results.</li>
            <li> had cancer and experienced the same problem.  </li>
            <li> After three months of Nightly Application my eyelashes filled in and grew in length.</li>
            <li> This review is NOT for the Revitalash Advanced.</li>
            <li> So, if you want beautiful, long eyelashes, this is the product to purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 24 days and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Everyone would say how long and beautiful they were</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> You will have beautiful long lashes in 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> Usually it would say works almost as good, for the money savings, it is good since you are saving money, stuff like that.</li>
            <li> Noticeable results after 3 weeks or more when consistently applied - once nightly.</li>
            <li> It feels great to know that this works, so I don&#x27;t have to spend thousands to maintain long lashes by Latisse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and find that it has made a significant difference in the length of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I originally started using this product when I had surgery</li>
            <li> Try it, it&#x60;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I did not think this product would work as well as it has and it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> quite sure at first if the product would work...sounded \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot;, but some weeks after the first application I started noticing that my eyelashes were getting longer, particularly at the outer corners.</li>
            <li> The kind the FDA HAS OKed, you need to use a new brush every day or so &amp; would take a lot longer to use every day</li>
            <li> As per directions, I use it on clean skin once every night before bed.</li>
            <li> First I learned of Latisse of the many eye lash extension products from the online review, and as many people highly recommended it, I went to the eye doctor&#x27;s office to buy the Latisse.  </li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed but happy as can be at the beautiful results!</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to apply, the formula doesn&#x27;t sting (unless you poke yourself in the eye with the brush!), and I&#x27;m seeing some indication of new lashes in an area of my eyelid where growth is sparce.</li>
            <li> Go for it girls,it&#x27;s worth the price and have fun batting those lushes lashes!</li>
            <li> Have used other brands for eyelash growth with great results.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that happened is that I am pleased beyond measure and how I have lovely longer lashes now.  </li>
            <li> Product was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> My doctor stated that my lashes looked healthy and she could see the new growth.</li>
            <li> They do look longer with mascara and the curl is definitely nice since my lashes are normally stick straight.     </li>
            <li> they look great but with mascara they are fabulous long and lush.  </li>
            <li> Rather than be a 3 month supply, I am still using my first wand after 4 months!  </li>
            <li> I then decided to buy the Revitalash conditioner because it had a huge discount (64%), and didn&#x27;t have much expectations as to whether this will work for me.  </li>
            <li> After 2 months my lashes did grow and now 3 months later I have amazing lashes and people</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> (well worth the wait)</li>
            <li> but I do read all the reviews and extract information and then decide if it is worth a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had to laugh, and thanked them for the compliment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before with success.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the wait</li>
            <li> I replace the product every quarter to assure it&#x27;s fresh and working.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> well worth the money</li>
            <li> Very rare do I actually see results the product claims it is supposed to do even when most reviews give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Right now, I will not be purchasing the product again.</li>
            <li> will post a positive review if it ends up working !</li>
            <li> I am one happy woman who had very little eyelashes three months ago.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work - I even bought it at full price, so</li>
            <li> Revitalash had a great product until the recent lawsuit which the ingredients had to be changed in order to prevent further damage to the eyes.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived super fast, and I am awaiting to see if it works as describe.  </li>
            <li> A little over a year ago I got remarried and decided to get lash extensions to make my eyes pop in wedding pictures - - as my lashes have thinned out throughout the years (I am 40).I loved having fuller lashes</li>
            <li> I decided with the huge amount I am already saving vs retail price, I rather spend another 10 bucks and buy directly from amazon versus amazon</li>
            <li> Fast shipping for this product!</li>
            <li> After two weeks, my eyelashes appeared much longer and it was actually fun to apply mascara.</li>
            <li> This product really doesn&#x27;t work that well at all!  </li>
            <li> First tube lasted about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the next 3 weeks will produce greater results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I have only been using Revitalash a month and am hoping for even better results as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My fiancee was the first one that noticed my eyelashes and commented on the length of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> Revitalash was appealing to me after seeing the commercial</li>
            <li> I say different because I can&#x27;t confirm for sure that they have grown</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in 2 weeks after my first application.</li>
            <li> I use exactly as directed, and have had no side effects at all.</li>
            <li> It took about 5 weeks to see results, with greater results each following week.  </li>
            <li> I have cornea issues and checked with my doctor first</li>
            <li> I first found out about Revitalash through my mom&#x27;s co-worker.  </li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> My lashes are growing and I&#x27;m starting to see more curl in them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for 5 months now (same bottle) and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I was imagining it</li>
            <li> Used this product for 8 months - in 2 months I really saw a difference!</li>
            <li> but I know I still need to give it a couple more months before seeing big results.</li>
            <li> The first result I started noticing was that my eyelashes were curling upwards and I stopped using my eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> &quot; and now he is absolutely AMAZED at how my lashes tripled in length!</li>
            <li> My lashes grow fast!</li>
            <li> Be patient with results and consistent with your application each evening.</li>
            <li> I believe it took me at least 4 months to really be happy with my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> plus they are your lashes not fake.</li>
            <li> but it does cause a little more fine hair growth around the eye area where applied.</li>
            <li> My aunt said it took right around 4 months before she saw really noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d LOVE to have longer lashes and the sparse areas filled in, but not sure this is worth it.</li>
            <li> when I first started using it, it took a good 3 weeks of using it daily on the upper and lower lashes before I saw anything.  </li>
            <li> I loved that you only needed it at night because that meant I could go back</li>
            <li> Also love that Revitalash lasts for a long time, close to a year.</li>
            <li> It is still too early to see the full results.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to be diligent and apply ever single night.</li>
            <li> Actually, at first I only put Revitalash on one eye, to do my own experiment and could definitely see a difference between the two eyes.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants beautiful long and dark eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall out any more and are very soft and actually have a curl to them!  </li>
            <li> I am now just putting it on my upper lashes &amp; it has been fine.</li>
            <li> I am a natural blonde with very light eye lashes so it has always been an issue for me to have lashes that \\&quot;show\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are long, beautiful, and dark!</li>
            <li> I would love to hear about other products that are not too expensive and are effective!!</li>
            <li> Within 3 months you will notice an absolute difference.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are much longer and are getting thicker.  </li>
            <li> I started doing more research on TALIKA but this time not from the store I purchased it from but from google and spent hours reading reviews.</li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend Revitalash to anybody looking for a change in their lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been very hairy and couldn&#x27;t figure out why this was happening, but think it may be the Revitalash.  </li>
            <li> Cant really tell that my lashes are not growing like they use to, but</li>
            <li> A friend of mine used this product for a while and really raved about it, so I&#x27;ll be faithfully applying . . .</li>
            <li> I have to say it DID take 6 weeks to really knock my socks off with the effect</li>
            <li> Based upon what she saw and my personal experience she said she felt comfortable now recommending it to people as she had not met anyone who was using it before but had done her research on it.</li>
            <li> After a couple of months of using this product faithfully every night, I really began to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> Now, after almost three months, I really don&#x27;t even need mascara anymore.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that this really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I really want this for christmas</li>
            <li> It took about 4 months to really notice a change.  </li>
            <li> They look so much longer when I put mascara on.</li>
            <li> but they dont as much anymore.</li>
            <li> Also the length not so much the fullness was noticeable.</li>
            <li> and theres not that much of a difference in thickness</li>
            <li> and I can say that my lashes are absolutely longer than they were when I started.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t buy it there for TWICE as much but saved $$ by buying it on Amazon.com instead.  </li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t seen any results, but I think it takes about 8 weeks before u really start to notice something.</li>
            <li> Product came fast.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law put this in my xmas stocking 2 years ago, and I was skeptic, but it really works ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for over a 1 1/2 and find it really works for me.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are fuller, longer, darker and they are no longer completely straight.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about this product considering that the description for the product says that it will \\&quot;help achieve the beautiful LOOK of Longer, Thicker, and Fuller eyelashes\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and is so much easier than false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Long, full, just as when I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> Revitalash is simple to use,  Just apply once a day to clean dry eye lashes, and with a little patience, you will see noticeably, beautiful longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure results vary due to ethnicity, age, and lash condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived (although felt like forever, maybe because I was so excited to try it, but wth delivery, it took about 2 weeks) and the formula was completely different then</li>
            <li> But I will tell you this, since I started using the product, my lashes on the bottom and on the top got extremely longer.</li>
            <li> I have used many other lash enhancer products.</li>
            <li> I heard that because of the patents held by Latisse, many manufacturers had to alter the active ingrediants.  </li>
            <li> but this has not happened to me using as clean a technique as I possibly can.  </li>
            <li> They are so thick and beautiful, and finally I have noticable eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but decided to purchase and try anyway since I read so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Am age 41 &amp; my lashes were full but short &amp; unnoticeable without curling them.</li>
            <li> The itch was not bad enough to stop using and didnt result in any redness on the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is new eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Now, I am off to try a new one!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been less than 4 months and my eyelashes are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I am now pregnant and have noticed my eyelids are sore the next morning after applying.</li>
            <li> but as I grew older, they became thinner and shorter</li>
            <li> As I am growing older (50+), my lashes are growing thinner.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was really convinced when I read it had been developed for a man who&#x27;s wife</li>
            <li> I also read in some reviews about the skin around the eyes becoming dark and/or eye pigment changes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are long and full now like when I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> The liquid was kinda thick and it did not make my lashes are nice as the pictures show.</li>
            <li> After using the product for 4 weeks i developed a mild stye or ingrown hair on my upper lid...not noticeable to anybody but me.</li>
            <li> The right eye has been slower to grow, but it is definitely starting.</li>
            <li> Right eye lashes seem longer than left but will keep using &amp; post another review in a month or so</li>
            <li> I like this product because it thickens your eyelashes without making them too super long like latisse.  </li>
            <li> This is my first eyelash conditioner, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and just seeing a little is exciting for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Believe me, skip that new dress, pass up on that new shirt, but trust me, purchase this bottle.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to see some new lashes.  </li>
            <li> and I am already seeing an improvement in the length of my lashes and new growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed new growth and my lashes are getting longer and curling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the new version and will probably try that when I run out.</li>
            <li> I am 36 year old and this product made me look just overnight 30 years older.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and really works!!  </li>
            <li> - they are REALLY long now (after 10 weeks continuous use) and what was most important to me -- LUSH and THICK.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I would not spend the time writing this if it was not for the fact, for the first time ever, there is a product that actually does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I tried it (somewhat skeptically at first) but found that not only did it work</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this product and within a week had itchy eyes, red too...would not purchase this product again</li>
            <li> I have seen a small difference and am confident this product will do the job.</li>
            <li> I also want to report that when I am not careful or put too much on</li>
            <li> With the other product I used the growth was amazing and not only did my current eyelashes get longer</li>
            <li> eyelashes did grow significantly with this, but the irritation was not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased my bottle from amazon.com (they had the best prices by far unless I wanted to order from some little site that was not made well and made me scared it could be fake).</li>
            <li> I took pictures to document and the before and after progress and was pleasantly surprised when I looked at the photos 4 weeks later and saw much change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, I am 56 years old, if that matters to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old,</li>
            <li> AfroAmerican with thinning, soft hair.</li>
            <li> again, no where near that.</li>
            <li> Has anyone else had unexpected hair growth?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it about three weeks, so it&#x27;s too soon to really know its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing reslts so far for length so far, but I&#x27;m not seeing any results on thickness.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly 3.5 weeks.</li>
            <li> This happened early on.</li>
            <li> I am seeing thicker lashes, but I am also getting alot of eye boogers (discharge) and my eyes are so sensitive that I have had to take my contacts out some days.</li>
            <li> and wow.   </li>
            <li> but that is natural process.  </li>
            <li> After using Revitalash for several months, mine are much longer and fuller.  </li>
            <li> My eyes aren&#x27;t sensitive</li>
            <li> And the old lash tube still has all the printed words.  </li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> Then I developed a sensitivity to it.  </li>
            <li> Then in the last 2 weeks they&#x27;ve really started getting longer and stronger.</li>
            <li> The only thing that really works is Latisse which you need a prescription for.   </li>
            <li> I was embarrassed to look at people because my eyelashes were short, straight and sparse.</li>
            <li> It might be because I spent a month on Talika and switched and basically did not start fresh</li>
            <li> When I apply mascara, my lashes look really good but not at a point that people might think that I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes.</li>
            <li> My left lashes grew quicker than my right, but I definitely saw results after 6-8 weeks.</li>
            <li> That said, the product also lasts a really long time, I found using it every few days meant my tube lasted a couple of years which makes the current price even better!</li>
            <li> You can not expect to see results overnight (for those of you that get too anxious and give up easily.)</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago after hearing that the product was developed by a gentleman whose wife had gone through chemo due to breast cancer and lost all her hair including eyelashes, the clerk in the store had great eyelashes and said it was due to Revitalash.  </li>
            <li> I have only had it for about 3 weeks, but already I have new eyelash growth!</li>
            <li> I now have lashes long enough to curl and, with the right mascara</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s only week 3 and the conditioner states not to expect results until wk 8, so this is real early for any results.  </li>
            <li> While I doubt that anyone will ever comment about how incredibly long my lashes, I am very</li>
            <li> If you get some in your eyes it does sting a little, but quickly goes away.   </li>
            <li> Now I even have strangers comment on how pretty and long my eyelashes are (daily!).  </li>
            <li> My lashes were thin and short before, and although they still are not really full and lush, they have improved greatly.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the product does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> In all fairness, it could just be allergies in general, but the only new thing in my cosmetic routine was the revitalash.</li>
            <li> So as long as your expectations are realistic</li>
            <li> /&gt;Revitalash does what it claims, I am shocked and tell others about my great experience.</li>
            <li> When I stopped, they went back to their short, straight, sparse state, but am now on my second tube and they&#x27;re growing again.  </li>
            <li> I barely need mascara</li>
            <li> I have tried Rapid Lash and it did not work nearly as well, so I went back to Revitalish....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how noticeable it is already, especially with mascara on.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I am a regular old girl and am writing this from my heart.    </li>
            <li> I even started to use it in a bare section of one of my eye brows and there is hairs coming out</li>
            <li> the person doing it both times said I had \\&quot;crazy, good</li>
            <li> It does take a few weeks to see results, but it is worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> My own mother thought I had on false eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews and some women had to cut their lashes because they were so long, sadly I am no where near that</li>
            <li> My wife tried this after first trying several other eyelash conditioners.  </li>
            <li> have new lash growth that is about 1/8\\&quot; long already!</li>
            <li> had no side effects (red line where you apply it or some small bumps that grew for others as I read), it can burn for a second if it gets near the eye, but the burn feeling is mild and goes away in 5 seconds.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really works, I had empty spots in my lashes Constantly and trying to hid it with Mascara and liner.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is my eyes get red and my lids get sensitive.</li>
            <li> Then all of the sudden I noticed  a few lashes getting longer, and then a few more.  </li>
            <li> I have always had long lashes, but they have become very sparse, and in a couple spots were missing completely.</li>
            <li> this product made my eyes a little red (not as much as latisse)</li>
            <li> They are not as lush or thick as I would like (thus 4-star rating) but they do appear visibly longer, particularly when I apply mascara.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but really wanted them to grow back to</li>
            <li> I have used both products and found Revitalash to be more expensive, caused eye irritation, and has far less product in the tube.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are so thick -- all the bald spots filled in from wearing single glued on lashes, rough treatment etc.  </li>
            <li> Some people get a sticker shock when in reality as a female, we spend more on other stuff we buy that does not do what it should and let&#x27;s not even talk about the amount we spend on products that sit in our bathroom forever because we feel bad throwing them out after spending so much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long story short.</li>
            <li> I order it on-line at Amazon and because of competition it has come down in price considerably and you don&#x27;t need a prescription.  </li>
            <li> All of a sudden, one morning I was driving and my sunglasses were bothering me because my eyelashes are so long!  </li>
            <li> It took at least 3 months, but I really do think my lashes are longer and possibly thicker than they were before.  </li>
            <li> skin around my eyes became red, dry, and burning.  </li>
            <li> But now a week later the skin is still dry and wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this due to the fact that my lashes were thinning and being asian with already short lashes thinning just made it a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s probably a little early to do this review -</li>
            <li> Believe me, for what this product does, I would accept burning sensation for hours as long as I  could keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is coming from someone who read the reviews and expected results after several weeks if not a couple of months.</li>
            <li> The length could be an illusion caused by the fact that I started using Diorshow mascara at roughly the same time.</li>
            <li> I do however put it on every day to keep my lashes long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for about 3 months now - I did notice that my lashes did get a tad bit longer but not much - I wish they got thicker but definitely have not.  </li>
            <li> so I have to trim the long ones to even them out with the rest of my lashes.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are long and a lot fuller.  </li>
            <li> My lashed stay long.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are really long, curling and there are lots of them.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying this on amazon and because of my desesperation to have long lashes I gave it a try..</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks my lashes were so long that I had to trim some of them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has an issue with their eyelashes or who just wants eyelashes that are gorgeously long and thick.  </li>
            <li> I have always been worried about brown spots, but my green eyes have stayed green as I&#x27;m careful to make sure I don&#x27;t get the product in my eyes and I have not experienced the two major side effects, itchig and burning, which with all of my allergies, it&#x27;s a wonder!  </li>
            <li> , with so many brands out there, it is impossible to know them all, I applaud women that stay current on all the stuff, I don&#x27;t know how they do it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to point out that I followed the directions in the package &amp; in the video on the website, but I found different instructions online (possibly from the previous formula?).</li>
            <li> just like with any other hair growth products, your results will not last</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll give 4 stars to Revitalash, for my long lashes!</li>
            <li> I have blue eyes and have read other reviews that said they noticed brown spots in their irises.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my lashes look longer and fuller, but would rather not have these other side effects.</li>
            <li> Was told about this product from a friend and her lashes are really long!  </li>
            <li> I only use it every other day for maintance now.</li>
            <li> I use both at the same time every other day and pa-pow.</li>
            <li> I only use it every other day or so.  </li>
            <li> I personally have not tried all the other brands because I feel this product does what it says.  </li>
            <li> Even when she showed me the example of her daughter&#x27;s eyelashes, which were very long...</li>
            <li> the highest praise is that, when my tube of Revitash runs dry, I plan to buy another.</li>
            <li> For those who are frustrated it did take more time than what I was told so it could be the same for you.</li>
            <li> and he said the active ingredient is the same in Revitalash as it is in Latisse and also the chemical that is used in Glaucoma drops which causes the eyelashes to grow.  </li>
            <li> Every single day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical due to the reviews about the formula not working the same as it had several years ago, but for me, it is really doing what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> The only other thing I have noticed recently is tiny little hairs growing on the inside corner of my eye....</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this product to other people!</li>
            <li> I have used LiLash previously and was amazed with the results, but after running out I thought I could find a cheaper version of the same thing...</li>
            <li> I find that if I take a break and don&#x27;t use it for a night, the itching is much less the next night when I apply it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week and a half, but my friend has been using it for a while</li>
            <li> BTW - this last bottle was less expensive than the first too!  </li>
            <li> You HAVE to put it on every single night and you cannot forget!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes seem a little longer in addition to definitely being thicker.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really need to have very thick and longer eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> I understand that different people may see different results, but I was expecting at least some results.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of Revitalash and my missing lashes were back in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> but I didnt want to spent $125</li>
            <li> It has been a few weeks since I purchased this and since my initial review.</li>
            <li> This was the expected time to see the maximum results...     </li>
            <li> I have recently had my makeup done a few times and</li>
            <li> It stings if it gets in your eyes though, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> Be careful, check in with your eye doctor if anything comes up.</li>
            <li> In other words absolutely no results at all.</li>
            <li> I use to have really long thick lashes but over the last year they have thinned out dramatically.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is related but don&#x27;t want to take a chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely dissapointed because I wanted eyelashes for my wedding</li>
            <li> and I felt other people should be warned.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product because I was too lazy to get a prescription for Latisse, but both have the same side effects</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one those people that products work for other people, never me.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well with loreal lash serum.</li>
            <li> The fact that amazon is selling this product for fifty percent of what other vendors are concerns me.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes or it will sting (and the warnings say it could change your eye color permanently, which is pretty scary).</li>
            <li> You will notice very minimal growth and a lot of my eyelashes</li>
            <li> However, I started out putting on my upper &amp; lower lashes and it was irritating my eyes and turning them red.  </li>
            <li> Get a slight red line along my eyelid after application, but it&#x27;s usually covered by my eyeliner.      </li>
            <li> only complaint about revitalash is the price tag.</li>
            <li> In researching this further via the internet it seems this is a common side affect for blue/green eyed women.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t darken my iris (dark brown eyes to begin with, so..)</li>
            <li> and a 1oz tube will last for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> A number of the reviewers complained that they did not see the same results as they had before.  </li>
            <li> It also looks like a small container, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> While my lashes are not as thick as I would like, they are definitely longer!  </li>
            <li> If you put it on your lower lashes you may get the additional line down there and maybe some unwanted hair growth.</li>
            <li> I am not huge into eye shadow or any other types of makeup, but putting mascara on (I put on a lot of coats) opens your eyes and changes everything.</li>
            <li> My lashes are slightly longer...</li>
            <li> I used to have eyelash envy and now mine of the subject of envy.  </li>
            <li> I Have been using revitalash for 3 and a half weeks</li>
            <li> (I purchased it here because it was almost half the price than at my Doctor&#x27;s office).  </li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing it just on a whim from Amazon at half the retail price.  </li>
            <li> Not tremendously thicker or darker yet,</li>
            <li> the price was much less.</li>
            <li> I seriously had several areas that had no eyelashes at all not even stubs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that some heavily advertised Rx products can cause permanent staining under the eyes (dark circles)</li>
            <li> My lashes were 2-3x as thick and long.</li>
            <li> is a little bit about my experience: After using the product their was a slight itch on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> At first I saw no difference and even found it slightly annoying because your eyes will hurt and get red when you get the serum in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have had a little itching within the hour after applying, but nothing that I can&#x27;t distract myself from.      </li>
            <li> My husband used to tease me while I applied my mascara saying \\&quot;come out little eye lashes and play\\</li>
            <li> A little stinging at times and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over 3 weeks and can already see results.</li>
            <li> but as with any other beauty product, I am not able to return it.</li>
            <li> This products works but you have to wait a little while.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a month</li>
            <li> but of course if you happen to get it in your eye it burns for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> female with sparse thin lashes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I saw lashes coming in within a few weeks, some fell out as well...</li>
            <li> It does take a few weeks before you notice</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash worked withing a few weeks for me...</li>
            <li> Some of my friends have noticed a difference after using the product for a few weeks but for me, it took about 2 months.  </li>
            <li> I used to have really thin and short lashes.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble putting on mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that my lashes have not fallen out nor broken at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you know how it works out in a few months.....</li>
            <li> So I started using it on Sept. 10, and I wanted to wait a few weeks before posting my review.</li>
            <li> Once my lashes were lengthened, I stopped using the product, and the effect did seem to wear off in a few months.  </li>
            <li> My sister purchased this product for me for my birthday because I was missing eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on others.</li>
            <li> I noticed at about two weeks some small black dots along my lash line.</li>
            <li> They are black and curl so no more lash curlers needed...without mascara</li>
            <li> I had very few, very short and thin eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is once you stop using the product your lashes go back to their \\&quot;natural\\&quot; state in a month or so.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and skin and was really afraid I would have a reaction to this and have not.</li>
            <li> The applicator dispenses very little product.  </li>
            <li> results happened so fast, I was shocked.</li>
            <li> They are unbelievable....</li>
            <li> I am pretty disappointed in these results, and I will no longer be using this product.</li>
            <li> and although I noticed some growth I was not sure of the extent until somebody asked me if I went and got extensions again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had curly eyelashes but not many of them.  </li>
            <li> Now my lashes came back as before I knew about this product because I am using the FAKE one.  </li>
            <li> But, with the escalation in cost, I think Latisse would be comparable if not better.</li>
            <li> I had tried Latisse in the past and although it worked the product effected my eyes.</li>
            <li> The only weird thing I feel in the morning from the use of this product, is that my eyes itch a bit.  </li>
            <li> I use it about 5 times a week and have been for the past 6 months and have had no problems or side effects and would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost six months and it made my lashes twice their usual length after 4 months and is now beginning to fill out the gaps.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on eyelash extensions but they can get irritating to the eye.  </li>
            <li> Started off with a tube of Rapid Lash which, in fairness, I didn&#x27;t use faithfully, but did see some small results from.</li>
            <li> I have a very thin and short, sparce eye lashes</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any breakage and have had very few fall outs.</li>
            <li> One of my eyes was worse than the other</li>
            <li> My daughter in law thought that I had false eyelashes on the other day.</li>
            <li> However, without mascara, one can hardly tell that there is a difference.   </li>
            <li> If I could give it a negative 10 for wasting my time and money I would.  </li>
            <li> AT LEAST 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lash conditioner I bought from FabProducts for months and no effective.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect results before at least 6 weeks though.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work - at least not for me.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to give it a try, and to my disappointment my eyes were bloodshot red from using this.</li>
            <li> I have been using revitalash for at least 3 years...</li>
            <li> When it says apply once day that is all you need and no need to apply thick.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are unbelievable now!  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Revitalash after visiting my aunt and seeing her crazy long, thick eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Some long stranglers have grown, looks awkward</li>
            <li> so why not try the less expensive one first?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Someone asked me if was hard to put on the false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They were shocked that they were actually my lashes.   </li>
            <li> beware of getting it in your eyes - it&#x27;s not a pleasant feeling.  </li>
            <li> In fact the only other review I ever wrote was for a product that was absolutely horrible</li>
            <li> but I definitely haven&#x27;t noticed any length.  :(</li>
            <li> For the first two months I did not notice a difference and was very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Dont beleive the bs or the bad reviews that often people writes (sometimes from other companies) that only want to make it look bad.</li>
            <li> But I have to say, that in the last 3 months, already a year and a half into using Revitalash, my lashes are growing and thickening like crazy now!!!</li>
            <li> They stated to apply like eyeliner, as opposed to above the skin level at the base of the lashes.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product</li>
            <li> I used to apply a base prior to the mascara.  </li>
            <li> I believe it was sooner, but I don&#x27;t want to give false information and claim it worked faster</li>
            <li> Revitalash will not make your lashes look like the false lashes that you see on TV and magazines.</li>
            <li> I had people asking me if I had false lashes or lash extensions.  </li>
            <li> My sister asked if I had on false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Her eyelashes look longer and thicker, although I don&#x27;t think you should expect miracles or the appearance of false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> She said she was not concerned at all about the product except to say that it would leave the line along the lash line (it is very faint and just looks like I have a little eye liner on</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic</li>
            <li> Is it DRAMATIC yet?</li>
            <li> Used only ones and had very bad allergy reaction.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but after a couple of months using Revitalash nightly, I can see noticeable difference in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but tried it after seeing it on The View.</li>
            <li> 6 MONTH REVIEW - Weird things happening.  </li>
            <li> I think FabProducts has sold me a FAKE product.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical.    </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but read the reviews and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> did notice a lot, I have received compliments thinking that I have fake lashes.</li>
            <li> When wearing mascara, I am often am asked if I am wearing false lashes!  </li>
            <li> Three days into using it I could see a dramatic difference!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that is unhappy with the way their lashes look.  </li>
            <li> My eyes swelled up, reddened and itched like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would hurt that.</li>
            <li> After using this product for approximately a year, my lashes are permanently longer - friends ask me whether I have extensions (!!)</li>
            <li> I have at least one person a day ask me if I have fake eyelashes on!!!</li>
            <li> I have used it for four nights and am shocked to see that my lashes are \\&quot;different\\&quot; already.</li>
            <li> They must have messed with the formula because this time I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was desperate!)</li>
            <li> I have also read that a side effect of it can be increased eye pressure which can be very dangerous.</li>
            <li> Too bad for me!</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes are outrageous!</li>
            <li> I looked terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast shipping for this product! I was skeptical due to the reviews about the formula not working the same as it had several years ago, but for me, it is really doing what it says it will do! I have only had it for about 3 weeks, but already I have new eyelash growth! I noticed at about two weeks some small black dots along my lash line. I thought it was some mascara that had gotten on the rim of my upper lashes. HA! It is new eyelashes! I have always had long lashes, but they have become very sparse, and in a couple spots were missing completely. I did not want to go the route of the prescription so I thought I would give this a try. I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have new lash growth that is about 1/8\\&quot; long already! The right eye has been slower to grow, but it is definitely starting. I am totally amazed. The solution does not burn my lids (maybe because I had permanent eyeliner tatooed on, so nothing bothers me!) The price is great, it last much longer than the Rx, and I am thrilled that I took the chance to buy it and try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I am 56 years old, if that matters to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but after a couple of months using Revitalash nightly, I can see noticeable difference in the length of my lashes. They are not as lush or thick as I would like (thus 4-star rating) but they do appear visibly longer, particularly when I apply mascara. I use Revitalash on both upper and lower lids and even the lower lashes are now visible. I also apply Revitalash to my eyebrows. I&#x27;m sure results vary due to ethnicity, age, and lash condition. I&#x27;m 60 years old, AfroAmerican with thinning, soft hair. I would recommend Revitalash.  Noticeable results after 3 weeks or more when consistently applied - once nightly. Shop around for best price - under $60.</li>
            <li> Revitalash is an awesome product that stimulates both eyelash and eyebrow growth. And you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> Rivitalash Eyelash Conditioner is awesome!  Before using it I had very few, very short and thin eyelashes.  Three days into using it I could see a dramatic difference!  I have thicker, longer and more lashes than I have ever had in my life!   I would recommend this to anyone that is unhappy with the way their lashes look.  You will definately get results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for about 1 month. After two weeks, my eyelashes appeared much longer and it was actually fun to apply mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been using revitalash for about 2 to 3 weeka and have noticed great improvement in my lashes.  They are thicker and fuller.  I am very pleased</li>
            <li> I have used LiLash previously and was amazed with the results, but after running out I thought I could find a cheaper version of the same thing... don&#x27;t bother!  This product really doesn&#x27;t work that well at all!  You will notice very minimal growth and a lot of my eyelashes have actually fallen out!  With the other product I used the growth was amazing and not only did my current eyelashes get longer I got a lot more of them!      Pay the extra and get LiLash!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. Noticed thicker, longer lashes in about 4 weeks. LOVE this product!  I am now pregnant and have noticed my eyelids are sore the next morning after applying. Not sure if it is related but don&#x27;t want to take a chance. Will save bottle until after baby is born and go back to using this.</li>
            <li> SEEING A LITTL BIT FULLER LASHES.  WAITING FOR IT  TO KICK IN.  I  HAVE USED IT FOR 3WEEKS NOW</li>
            <li> I began using Revitalash July of 2010. As per directions, I use it on clean skin once every night before bed. Every single day. No big deal...takes an entire 5 seconds to swipe it on my eyelid. You can not expect to see results overnight (for those of you that get too anxious and give up easily.) Within 3 months you will notice an absolute difference. But I have to say, that in the last 3 months, already a year and a half into using Revitalash, my lashes are growing and thickening like crazy now!!! I own a business and when I am at the desk sitting and checking people out...I have at least one person a day ask me if I have fake eyelashes on!!! I love it!!! And I tell them \\&quot;No, I have been growing them.\\&quot; :-) Which confuses them but I recommend this product left and right to everyone because of the fantastic results!!!! I have had no side effects whatsoever...but of course if you happen to get it in your eye it burns for a few seconds. Other than that the product does exactly what it claims to do. Just be sure to be diligent and apply ever single night. Skipping or only doing here and there will not get you the results you are looking for. Be sure to not discontinue the product either....just like with any other hair growth products, your results will not last and you will eventually go back to where you started. The only other thing I have noticed recently is tiny little hairs growing on the inside corner of my eye....no big deal though...no one notices those but me....but it does cause a little more fine hair growth around the eye area where applied. I do not consider this an annoyance...especially for how amazing my eyelashes are now!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this product back in September and have been using religiously ever since.  That&#x27;s over 3 months and it claims to give you results in 10 weeks.  There was NO  lengthening and NO thickening of my eyelashes AT ALL!  They did not change one bit. I&#x27;m extremely dissapointed because I wanted eyelashes for my wedding but now it&#x27;s next week and I don&#x27;t have time to get a product that actually works.  I would NEVER recommend this company for ANY reason.  They&#x27;re product does not do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  If I could give it a negative 10 for wasting my time and money I would.  DO NOT BUY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WORK!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been less than 4 months and my eyelashes are fabulous! Long, full, just as when I was a teenager! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. Two Sellers (this one included) have the best prices. Girls (or guys) ... YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! I kid you not. It works better than the prescription brand advertised on TV. I cannot tell you, enough, how well this product works, you have to try for yourself. And remember, you can always return it. NOTE: You have to apply EVERY night!!! All that requires is one skinny brush stroke along the top lash line and you have to give it AT LEAST 3-4 months. (well worth the wait) That&#x27;s it! So simple and the results are remarkable!!! So, if you want beautiful, long eyelashes, this is the product to purchase. Those I know who have used it, we have all had the same results ... AWESOME!!! Thank you Revitalash and Thank You Seller(s) for such great pricing!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but tried it after seeing it on The View. My left lashes grew quicker than my right, but I definitely saw results after 6-8 weeks. At the 3-month mark, I was convinced, and although I don&#x27;t consider them thicker, they are longer and curlier so I&#x27;m pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to point out that I followed the directions in the package &amp; in the video on the website, but I found different instructions online (possibly from the previous formula?). They stated to apply like eyeliner, as opposed to above the skin level at the base of the lashes. I wonder if this gives better results...</li>
            <li> This product definitely works.  My eyelashes are much longer and are getting thicker.  The only drawback is that Revitalash makes my eyelids itch for about ten minutes after I apply it. I find that if I take a break and don&#x27;t use it for a night, the itching is much less the next night when I apply it. I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash on my upper lashes every night for about 1 year, and I can say my lashes do look longer. But I don&#x27;t see any difference on the amount of lashes, compared to what I used to have before. Using Revitalash I thought I would have longer and fuller lashes, but for me it only worked on the lengthening process. When I apply mascara, my lashes look really good but not at a point that people might think that I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes. But I&#x27;m happy with the results, since my lashes were very short before I started using Revistalash (which by the way, that my be an asian thing). But I just wish I had more lashes quantity wise. I&#x27;m considering using another brand, jan marino maybe.. just to see if there&#x27;s any difference. But I&#x27;ll give 4 stars to Revitalash, for my long lashes!</li>
            <li> I purchase tons of cosmetics but almost never write reviews. In fact the only other review I ever wrote was for a product that was absolutely horrible and I felt other people should be warned. Before I purchase anything, I always read what others have to say. You can&#x27;t make everyone happy and seldom do you find a product that everyone can agree on but I do read all the reviews and extract information and then decide if it is worth a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially tried TALIKA Eyelash Lipocils and I did see results. Nothing incredible but I could see them. Very rare do I actually see results the product claims it is supposed to do even when most reviews give it 5 stars but this product actually worked. My lashes grew a tiny bit and it peeked my curiosity. I started doing more research on TALIKA but this time not from the store I purchased it from but from google and spent hours reading reviews. Quite often Revitalash was mentioned in the reviews. Usually it would say works almost as good, for the money savings, it is good since you are saving money, stuff like that. I suddenly turned around and started reading what this product others spoke about was. Revitalash, a name I have yet to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it, with so many brands out there, it is impossible to know them all, I applaud women that stay current on all the stuff, I don&#x27;t know how they do it! Long story short. I purchased my bottle from amazon.com (they had the best prices by far unless I wanted to order from some little site that was not made well and made me scared it could be fake). I decided with the huge amount I am already saving vs retail price, I rather spend another 10 bucks and buy directly from amazon versus amazon merchant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived (although felt like forever, maybe because I was so excited to try it, but wth delivery, it took about 2 weeks) and the formula was completely different then Talika. I loved that you only needed it at night because that meant I could go back anduse my favorite \\&quot;Lancome Booster XL\\&quot; in the morning before my mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results happened so fast, I was shocked. It might be because I spent a month on Talika and switched and basically did not start fresh but I saw results in 2-3 weeks if that. I believe it was sooner, but I don&#x27;t want to give false information and claim it worked faster then it actually did. 2-3 weeks is about the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, mascara is the most important makeup. I am not huge into eye shadow or any other types of makeup, but putting mascara on (I put on a lot of coats) opens your eyes and changes everything. Believe me, I would not spend the time writing this if it was not for the fact, for the first time ever, there is a product that actually does what it claims to do. I read other reviews and some women had to cut their lashes because they were so long, sadly I am no where near that (although I am keeping my fingers and toes crossed I will be), or that their lashes touch their eyebrows.. again, no where near that. But I will tell you this, since I started using the product, my lashes on the bottom and on the top got extremely longer. I cannot say they are thicker but then again, thickness was never the issue for me, it was length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revitalash does what it claims, I am shocked and tell others about my great experience. Some people get a sticker shock when in reality as a female, we spend more on other stuff we buy that does not do what it should and let&#x27;s not even talk about the amount we spend on products that sit in our bathroom forever because we feel bad throwing them out after spending so much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me, skip that new dress, pass up on that new shirt, but trust me, purchase this bottle. You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no side effects (red line where you apply it or some small bumps that grew for others as I read), it can burn for a second if it gets near the eye, but the burn feeling is mild and goes away in 5 seconds. Believe me, for what this product does, I would accept burning sensation for hours as long as I  could keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this help.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about this product considering that the description for the product says that it will \\&quot;help achieve the beautiful LOOK of Longer, Thicker, and Fuller eyelashes\\&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t actually claim to make them physically longer or thicker. But after using it for 4 weeks I noticed a big difference in the length and condition of my lashes. I took pictures to document and the before and after progress and was pleasantly surprised when I looked at the photos 4 weeks later and saw much change. I was so pleased with the results I posted my pictures on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a little bit about my experience: After using the product their was a slight itch on my eyelids. The itch discontinued after about 1-2 weeks of use. The itch was not bad enough to stop using and didnt result in any redness on the skin around my eyes. After using the product for 4 weeks i developed a mild stye or ingrown hair on my upper lid...not noticeable to anybody but me. The stye disappeared after 3-4 days. The stye may not have had anything to do with revitalash but may have...something to keep in mind for those susceptible to styes. I have blue eyes and have read other reviews that said they noticed brown spots in their irises. I saw no difference whatsoever in the color of my eyes. I have even accidentally got some of the product in my eyes but still saw no difference. I only saw a change in the length and shininess of my lashes not the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about revitalash is the price tag. This product seems to be a glorified hair conditioner. Although the price is steep I have seen enough of a change in my lashes to continue using revitalash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend Revitalash to anybody looking for a change in their lashes. But don&#x27;t expect miracles. Revitalash will not make your lashes look like the false lashes that you see on TV and magazines. So as long as your expectations are realistic I think you will be happy with your purchase, I know I am. Good luck!</li>
            <li> It took about a month to show up, but my lashes definitely got longer and thicker.  When I stopped, they went back to their short, straight, sparse state, but am now on my second tube and they&#x27;re growing again.  First tube lasted about 3 months.  Actually, at first I only put Revitalash on one eye, to do my own experiment and could definitely see a difference between the two eyes.  I haven&#x27;t tried Latisse, so don&#x27;t know how they compare. 6 MONTH REVIEW - Weird things happening.  Besides getting the upper lid discoloration and itchiness, I&#x27;ve noticed that the peach fuzz on my face and hair on my arms is longer and thicker.  I&#x27;ve never been very hairy and couldn&#x27;t figure out why this was happening, but think it may be the Revitalash.  It definitely makes my lashes look longer and fuller, but would rather not have these other side effects. Has anyone else had unexpected hair growth?  And/or found something else that doesn&#x27;t cause the side effects?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the conditioner for 3 weeks. I apply some to my eye brows and to my lash line.  My eye brows seem to be filling in but my lashes are not noticeably thicker or longer.  I will continue using the product until it used up.  Maybe the next 3 weeks will produce greater results.  I will report back.  Right now, I will not be purchasing the product again.</li>
            <li> I use to get Lash Extensions but I was very displeased with my missing lashes becuase of the extensions. I bought a tube of Revitalash and my missing lashes were back in 2 weeks. I was SO RELIEVED! I dont wear extensions anymore. Cant really tell that my lashes are not growing like they use to, but Im still pleased.</li>
            <li> 44 yr. female with sparse thin lashes and eyebrows.  Started using Revitalash a month ago.  Within weeks noticed longer and thicker lashes and eyebrows coming in.  Yet, two days noticed several brown spots on my blue iris&#x27;.  In researching this further via the internet it seems this is a common side affect for blue/green eyed women.  Why doesn&#x27;t Revitalash mention this as a side affect.  Lawsuit???????</li>
            <li> i had used latisse but wanted something that didnt irritate my eyes. this product made my eyes a little red (not as much as latisse) but there was no change in the length or thickness of my eyelashes. i will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> And I can tell that my lashes are coming back in (the ones on the outside corner of my left eye mysteriously disappeared) and they are definitely coming back in curled.     They do look longer with mascara and the curl is definitely nice since my lashes are normally stick straight.     I have had a little itching within the hour after applying, but nothing that I can&#x27;t distract myself from.      I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because I have only been using Revitalash a month and am hoping for even better results as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 24 days and so far so good. Was told about this product from a friend and her lashes are really long!  It takes 6 weeks, so I will let you know more when the 6 weeks are up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product religiously for three weeks and have no results yet. not giving up though! will post a positive review if it ends up working !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 6 weeks - on one eye only - and can&#x27;t yet tell if there&#x27;s a difference in the lashes between the Revitalash eye and the \\&quot;untreated\\&quot; eye.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago after hearing that the product was developed by a gentleman whose wife had gone through chemo due to breast cancer and lost all her hair including eyelashes, the clerk in the store had great eyelashes and said it was due to Revitalash.  I tried it (somewhat skeptically at first) but found that not only did it work but my lashes looked amazing.  I had people asking me if I had false lashes or lash extensions.  The only bad thing is once you stop using the product your lashes go back to their \\&quot;natural\\&quot; state in a month or so.  However, I would totally recommend the product and will continue to use it, plus the price is now a third of what it used to be.  That said, the product also lasts a really long time, I found using it every few days meant my tube lasted a couple of years which makes the current price even better!</li>
            <li> I love everything about RevitaLash!  I use it, RevitaBrow, and their mascara and I love all of them.  I have never been so satisfied with a beauty product.  I would recommend these to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s probably a little early to do this review - I&#x27;ve only been using it about three weeks, so it&#x27;s too soon to really know its effectiveness. HOWEVER - here&#x27;s what I can comment on: it&#x27;s easy to apply, the formula doesn&#x27;t sting (unless you poke yourself in the eye with the brush!), and I&#x27;m seeing some indication of new lashes in an area of my eyelid where growth is sparce. A friend of mine used this product for a while and really raved about it, so I&#x27;ll be faithfully applying . . .</li>
            <li> I started using Revitalash on May 1st. At first I saw no difference and even found it slightly annoying because your eyes will hurt and get red when you get the serum in your eyes. You HAVE to put it on every single night and you cannot forget! So this becomes apart of your nightly routine after you put on your face and body lotion. I wanted to try this product because I was too lazy to get a prescription for Latisse, but both have the same side effects so why not try the less expensive one first?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now July 5th and my eyelashes are outrageous! They are so thick and beautiful, and finally I have noticable eyelashes! My fiancee was the first one that noticed my eyelashes and commented on the length of my lashes.  It feels great to know that this works, so I don&#x27;t have to spend thousands to maintain long lashes by Latisse. I am not comparing the outcome of Latisse, I am just stating that if you don&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend on eyelash conditioner this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you use it consistently. You will have beautiful long lashes in 4 weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years &amp; am now on maintenance, just once or twice a week. I&#x27;m 75 &amp; my lashes (as did my head hair)thinned out, but with the Revitalash they are better than ever.  Guess it&#x27;s not received the OK by the FDA but I&#x27;ve never had a problem. However, if you use it &amp; your eyes become irritated, I&#x27;d stop using it.  The kind the FDA HAS OKed, you need to use a new brush every day or so &amp; would take a lot longer to use every day so I decided not to switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and find that it has made a significant difference in the length of my eyelashes.  You just have to remember to apply every night.  One more thing to do, but this one does work!</li>
            <li> My mom used Latisse and it was amazing but I didnt want to spent $125 so I tried Revitalash.  I have to say it DID take 6 weeks to really knock my socks off with the effect but boy, did it.  My lashes are so thick -- all the bald spots filled in from wearing single glued on lashes, rough treatment etc.  I barely need mascara - they are REALLY long now (after 10 weeks continuous use) and what was most important to me -- LUSH and THICK. And unlike Latisse no darkening problems.  My Mom is going to quit Latisse and starting using this now I just ordered some for her :)</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously for 8 weeks, as prescribed, but I did not see any change whatsoever. I understand that different people may see different results, but I was expecting at least some results. No difference in my lashes. I stopped using it after 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased Revitalash in October and I have used it religiously since it arrived, which is now over two months. I might as well be putting water on my lashes for the affect I have gotten. In other words absolutely no results at all. Do not waste your money on this product. If you are going to spend the money you might as well go with Latisse. I know that it is a lot more expensive but you get proven and guaranteed results. You also need a prescription so you know that a doctor will be monitoring you when you use Latisse. AGAIN I  STRONGLY ADVICE AGAINST THE PURCHASE OF THIS PRODUCT!![[ASIN:B0014WJLPS Revitalash Eyelash Conditioner, 4.1-mL/0.139-Fluid Ounces]]</li>
            <li> Revitalash was appealing to me after seeing the commercial but I do not feel it worked that well for me. The liquid was kinda thick and it did not make my lashes are nice as the pictures show.</li>
            <li> It has been a few weeks since I purchased this and since my initial review. I went to my eye doctor for my annual review and told her what I was doing. She said she was not concerned at all about the product except to say that it would leave the line along the lash line (it is very faint and just looks like I have a little eye liner on so it&#x27;s actually great) and not to put it on my lower lashes since putting it on my top lashes before bed would help it also go to my bottom lashes while I was sleeping. If you put it on your lower lashes you may get the additional line down there and maybe some unwanted hair growth. My doctor stated that my lashes looked healthy and she could see the new growth. Based upon what she saw and my personal experience she said she felt comfortable now recommending it to people as she had not met anyone who was using it before but had done her research on it. People have started commenting that I looked \\&quot;different\\&quot; and wanted to know what it was. Once I pointed out what I was doing that was the difference they were noticing but couldn&#x27;t put their finger on it. I have very sensitive eyes and skin and was really afraid I would have a reaction to this and have not. I am loving the results and am truly surprised at how effective it is. I would highly recommend.    I am a natural blonde with very light eye lashes so it has always been an issue for me to have lashes that \\&quot;show\\&quot;. Nothing dramatic but if I didn&#x27;t have mascara on my eyelashes would disappear. I have used it for four nights and am shocked to see that my lashes are \\&quot;different\\&quot; already. I say different because I can&#x27;t confirm for sure that they have grown BUT they appear longer (as commented on by others) and they feel thicker when I use my curler on them. They also seem to separate better and are more distinct now. This is coming from someone who read the reviews and expected results after several weeks if not a couple of months. Is it DRAMATIC yet? No but I definitely can tell and mydaughter and friends have commented on it so I know it is not just in my head. I will update in several weeks time but as of right now I am very happy to already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the beginning of week 3 and I&#x27;m already seeing results.  This is my first eyelash conditioner, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and just seeing a little is exciting for me.  I&#x27;m noticing reslts so far for length so far, but I&#x27;m not seeing any results on thickness.  Again, it&#x27;s only week 3 and the conditioner states not to expect results until wk 8, so this is real early for any results.  So far I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly 3.5 weeks. I cannot see a huge difference. I believe Latisse might have been the better choice. the product did darken the above eyelash area so it does appear to look like eyeliner. This happened early on. For anyone considering any type of eyelash enhancer I would choose Latisse. It is FDA approved.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month and I&#x27;ve applied this stuff every night.  Sometimes in the morning too (which the label doesn&#x27;t recommend).  I think I may have noticed a thickening but I definitely haven&#x27;t noticed any length.  :(</li>
            <li> I am seeing thicker lashes, but I am also getting alot of eye boogers (discharge) and my eyes are so sensitive that I have had to take my contacts out some days. My eyelashes seem a little longer in addition to definitely being thicker. The length could be an illusion caused by the fact that I started using Diorshow mascara at roughly the same time. That&#x27;s incredible mascara.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really works, I had empty spots in my lashes Constantly and trying to hid it with Mascara and liner.  My lashes are long and full now like when I was a teenager.  I have not had any adverse reations not changes in eye or skin color.  I only use it every other day for maintance now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Revitalash for 3 years now and I am extremely happy with the way my lashes have grown. I noticed a difference in 2 weeks after my first application. This is I think the 3rd tube I&#x27;ve purchased or 4th and I&#x27;ll buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now, and have had fabulous results. Someone asked me if was hard to put on the false eyelashes. I had to laugh, and thanked them for the compliment. They were shocked that they were actually my lashes.   I use exactly as directed, and have had no side effects at all. I did bring the product to my eye doctor who had no reservations about the ingredients. Amazon has the best prices on Revitalash, so why go anywhere else??</li>
            <li> It has been about 3 weeks and my lashes seem fuller and longer.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in the next two months.</li>
            <li> I was expecting to see some new lashes.  I&#x27;ve used this product before with success.  They must have messed with the formula because this time I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Revitalash had a great product until the recent lawsuit which the ingredients had to be changed in order to prevent further damage to the eyes.  It had an ingredient which would damage the color of the eye (not fda approved).  Now the product is not working.  They are still in a lawsuit.</li>
            <li> My sister&#x27;s friend told her about this product a several years ago and it worked for her so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m one those people that products work for other people, never me. For whatever reason my lashes stopped growing in my 20&#x27;s. I am 50 now and wow.   This products works. When it says apply once day that is all you need and no need to apply thick. Be patient. I noticed length in 3 weeks and in 4 weeks they are longer yet. My sister also bought the product and it is working for her. I have never wrote a review on any product so thank you Amazon for giving me the opportunity to say: Go for it girls,it&#x27;s worth the price and have fun batting those lushes lashes! And thank you Revitalash!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but decided to purchase and try anyway since I read so many good reviews.  My eyelashes are unbelievable now!  It took about 5 weeks to see results, with greater results each following week.  Now I even have strangers comment on how pretty and long my eyelashes are (daily!).  My own mother thought I had on false eyelashes!  I highly recommend it.  This is one product that actually does what it says it will do!  I&#x27;m hooked forever....I just love it!</li>
            <li> I originally started using this product when I had surgery and my eyelashes fell out.  I was skeptical at first but really wanted them to grow back to I gave it a try and you wouldn&#x27;t believe them now!  I was really convinced when I read it had been developed for a man who&#x27;s wife had cancer and experienced the same problem.  I order it on-line at Amazon and because of competition it has come down in price considerably and you don&#x27;t need a prescription.  I have cornea issues and checked with my doctor first and he said the active ingredient is the same in Revitalash as it is in Latisse and also the chemical that is used in Glaucoma drops which causes the eyelashes to grow.  I have always been worried about brown spots, but my green eyes have stayed green as I&#x27;m careful to make sure I don&#x27;t get the product in my eyes and I have not experienced the two major side effects, itchig and burning, which with all of my allergies, it&#x27;s a wonder!  I would recommend this product to anyone who has an issue with their eyelashes or who just wants eyelashes that are gorgeously long and thick.  And mine didn&#x27;t start out this way before they originally fell out!</li>
            <li> I saw lashes coming in within a few weeks, some fell out as well... but that is natural process.  In 6 weeks I was pleased, in 8 weeks I was extremely excited and now I think they are at their maximum growth and my lashes are darker, longer and curl better!!  They are unbelievable.... I never thought they could be this nice again!!  I want to try the head hair growth but not a lot of good reviews about it..... there is nothing to lose though (except the big $) but if it works, woohoooo! that would be great!</li>
            <li> Maryke says I love it  I love it  I love it   _  It works for both eyebrows and eye lashes and is one third the price at my beautician</li>
            <li> I have been using Revitalash now for 4 months.  This was the expected time to see the maximum results...     I didn&#x27;t have any issues with irritation or discoloration.  There are some changes. My lashes are slightly longer... they don&#x27;t seem any thicker, fuller, or darker. However, without mascara, one can hardly tell that there is a difference.   I am pretty disappointed in these results, and I will no longer be using this product. Now, I am off to try a new one!</li>
            <li> Started using this product and loved the results.  It does take a few weeks before you notice but I saw quite a difference.</li>
            <li> I was prepared to wait 6-8 weeks to see growth and I did see some. This is pretty good at lengthening my lashes. It didn&#x27;t darken my iris (dark brown eyes to begin with, so..) and it didn&#x27;t darken my eyelid. It works extremely well with loreal lash serum. I use both at the same time every other day and pa-pow. Love them lashes!</li>
            <li> I have used both products and found Revitalash to be more expensive, caused eye irritation, and has far less product in the tube.  The applicator dispenses very little product.  Rapid Lash worked withing a few weeks for me...</li>
            <li> I have a very thin and short, sparce eye lashes and I always wanted to have longer eye lashes.  First I learned of Latisse of the many eye lash extension products from the online review, and as many people highly recommended it, I went to the eye doctor&#x27;s office to buy the Latisse.  The nurse from the office told me that it costs almost $200 and that you have to keep using it to maintain the eye lashes once grown.  I didn&#x27;t really need to have very thick and longer eye lashes.  I then decided to buy the Revitalash conditioner because it had a huge discount (64%), and didn&#x27;t have much expectations as to whether this will work for me.  Now, I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 weeks and I am very very satisfied with this product.  I feel that my eye lashes get somewhat thicker and longer than before.  Every morning I can see my eyes look bigger!  I will keep using the Latisse eyelash conditioner and will try mascara once I use it up.</li>
            <li> This product works well....I have tried Rapid Lash and it did not work nearly as well, so I went back to Revitalish....I do however put it on every day to keep my lashes long. It takes several weeks for it to work but if you put it on faithfuly you will see results.</li>
            <li> A little over a year ago I got remarried and decided to get lash extensions to make my eyes pop in wedding pictures - - as my lashes have thinned out throughout the years (I am 40).I loved having fuller lashes and I began looking for a more permanent solution, I tried a different product before Revitalash and did not see any changes, I started using Revitalash 3 months ago and although I noticed some growth I was not sure of the extent until somebody asked me if I went and got extensions again, I calmly and happily replied \\&quot;no, they are mine natural lashes\\&quot;.I was so excited to hear this!! Love this product and will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I used to have eyelash envy and now mine of the subject of envy.  I&#x27;ve always had curly eyelashes but not many of them.  After using Revitalash for several months, mine are much longer and fuller.  When wearing mascara, I am often am asked if I am wearing false lashes!  My eyes aren&#x27;t sensitive so I&#x27;m able to use it every night but beware of getting it in your eyes - it&#x27;s not a pleasant feeling.  Some of my friends have noticed a difference after using the product for a few weeks but for me, it took about 2 months.  It was well worth the wait and a 1oz tube will last for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I first found out about Revitalash through my mom&#x27;s co-worker.  After looking around, I found that the best deal was through Amazon. I started noticing that my eyelashes were longer, thicker, and fuller after 2 weeks.  I used to have really thin and short lashes. I always had trouble putting on mascara and now I can put it on very easily.  I would totally recommend this product to other people!</li>
            <li> Actually I want to comment on the seller FabProducts, not the product.  But I couldn&#x27;t find how to do it, so I write it here.    I&#x27;ve been using this lash conditioner I bought from FabProducts for months and no effective.  Recently the words printed on the tube came off.  I think FabProducts has sold me a FAKE product.  Because I had used this product which I bought from a different seller and it worked beautifully.  The result could be seen obviously; my lashes grew longer and thicker.  And the old lash tube still has all the printed words.  Now my lashes came back as before I knew about this product because I am using the FAKE one.  DON&#x27;T BUY STUFF FROM FabProducts!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x60;t quite sure at first if the product would work...sounded \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot;, but some weeks after the first application I started noticing that my eyelashes were getting longer, particularly at the outer corners. Try it, it&#x60;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I always wanted fuller, longer lashes but had to rely on mascara until I tried Revitalash.  After a couple of months of using this product faithfully every night, I really began to notice a difference.  Now, after almost three months, I really don&#x27;t even need mascara anymore.  With just a touch of mascara, it looks like I have lash extensions.  Revitalash is a product that actually does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for 4 months now.  Eyelashes definitely longer.  I only use it every other day or so.  Get a slight red line along my eyelid after application, but it&#x27;s usually covered by my eyeliner.      I&#x27;ll continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Revitalash for about 4 years.  It lasts for 3-6 months although at the 6 month point my lashes start diminishing.  Really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for about 3 months now - I did notice that my lashes did get a tad bit longer but not much - I wish they got thicker but definitely have not.  Some long stranglers have grown, looks awkward so I have to trim the long ones to even them out with the rest of my lashes.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this again though.</li>
            <li> Ordered this due to the fact that my lashes were thinning and being asian with already short lashes thinning just made it a nightmare.  I am on my 4th month using this every night and I have to say that this really worked for me.  My lashes are long and a lot fuller.  Its been so impressive my friends and family purchased it and are extremely happy with their results also.  Got to say its pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product. My lashes are growing and I&#x27;m starting to see more curl in them. It&#x27;s only been 4 weeks and I know it takes longer so we shall see.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing,  The fact that amazon is selling this product for fifty percent of what other vendors are concerns me. It causes me to question the credibility of the source. Can someone please help ease my mind? I really want this for christmas but I want it to be the official brand.   THank you</li>
            <li> I have used Revitalash Conditioner for a couple of years.  It took about 4 months to really notice a change.  My lashes were thin and short before, and although they still are not really full and lush, they have improved greatly.  My sister asked if I had on false eyelashes.  Also love that Revitalash lasts for a long time, close to a year.</li>
            <li> I Have been using revitalash for 3 and a half weeks and I am already seeing an improvement in the length of my lashes and new growth. I cant wait to see what happends in the next couple weeks. So far so good!! I would reccomend this product to people wanting to grow their lashes thicker longer and fuller.[[ASIN:B0014WJLPS Revitalash Eyelash Conditioner, 4.1-mL/0.139-Fluid Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for about a month. I&#x27;ve always had short lashes which either broke or fell out all the time. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that my lashes have not fallen out nor broken at all. I&#x27;ve noticed new growth and my lashes are getting longer and curling. They look so much longer when I put mascara on. I&#x27;ll let you know how it works out in a few months.....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for 5 months now (same bottle) and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results. My lashes are longer. I haven&#x27;t had any breakage and have had very few fall outs. I would definitely recommend. I&#x27;ve seen the new version and will probably try that when I run out.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it thickens your eyelashes without making them too super long like latisse.  However, I started out putting on my upper &amp; lower lashes and it was irritating my eyes and turning them red.  I am now just putting it on my upper lashes &amp; it has been fine.</li>
            <li> A number of the reviewers complained that they did not see the same results as they had before.  I heard that because of the patents held by Latisse, many manufacturers had to alter the active ingrediants.  I purchased this product in November 2010, after any formulation change, and it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did, however, take about 12 weeks of daily application to see a change.  At first I thought I was imagining it but, yes, my lashes were getting longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Revitalash for 5 months now.  While I doubt that anyone will ever comment about how incredibly long my lashes, I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the highest praise is that, when my tube of Revitash runs dry, I plan to buy another.</li>
            <li> Have used other brands for eyelash growth with great results.  This is the first time I have used this product and within a week had itchy eyes, red too...would not purchase this product again</li>
            <li> I was hesitant on buying this product since its rather pricey but after continued use on a daily basis i have noticed a change in my lash length &amp; also strength. My lashes used to fall out when I would wash my face but they dont as much anymore. Also the length not so much the fullness was noticeable.</li>
            <li> I used to have the longest eye lashes when I was growing up.  Everyone would say how long and beautiful they were but as I grew older, they became thinner and shorter so when I saw this product at my Doctors office I decided to give it a try (I purchased it here because it was almost half the price than at my Doctor&#x27;s office).  I put it on every night as part of my rutine and my eyelashes are back!  And it&#x27;s a difference you can see.  All of a sudden, one morning I was driving and my sunglasses were bothering me because my eyelashes are so long!  It&#x27;s actually a pain while I&#x27;m driving but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser tried to sell me this once and I didn&#x27;t spring for it because she was selling it for $125.  Even when she showed me the example of her daughter&#x27;s eyelashes, which were very long...I was skeptical.    I ended up purchasing it just on a whim from Amazon at half the retail price.  It took at least 3 months, but I really do think my lashes are longer and possibly thicker than they were before.  I have recently had my makeup done a few times and the person doing it both times said I had \\&quot;crazy, good lashes\\&quot;.  Trust me on this one:  I&#x27;m 47 and no one has ever complimented me in that way before...so I guess it works.    Give it a try. I&#x27;ve heard that some heavily advertised Rx products can cause permanent staining under the eyes (dark circles) so this is an easy way to have some of the benefits without the risks.</li>
            <li> I used Revitalash for six months.  It took awhile to notice a difference, but my lashes were definitely thicker and longer.  Then I developed a sensitivity to it.  My eyes swelled up, reddened and itched like crazy.  I discontinued the product for several weeks hoping it was something else that caused the problem.  But after one more application, there was no way I could continue using it.  Again, my eyes puffed up and itched.  My eyes are paramount, so I will not ever use it again.  Too bad for me!</li>
            <li> I use to have really long thick lashes but over the last year they have thinned out dramatically.  I thought this would be the perfect product for me because of all the good reviews and its somewhat affordable price.  I have been using it for a month now and theres not that much of a difference in thickness but i do think it is helping to stop my lashes from falling out. I am beginning to notice a purple/brown line is appearing where i apply it by my lash line. I have also read that a side effect of it can be increased eye pressure which can be very dangerous. I have decided to discontinue use until i consult my doctor at which time i am going to ask for a prescription for latisse.</li>
            <li> This is the third one of these Revitalash Eyelash Conditioners I have purchased. They seem to last me about 6-7 months. It works extremely well and I just love the product. I&#x27;ll buy again in another 6 months!</li>
            <li> Used this product for 8 months - in 2 months I really saw a difference! My lashes were 2-3x as thick and long. Then they started to fall out. I looked like a chemo patient. People started inquiring about my health. I mentioned the problems to my dermatologist and she said that this happens to some people, and I just need to keep using it - my lashes should come back even thicker and longer than before. So I bought ANOTHER tube and used it for 8 months - my lashes NEVER came back! I was so depressed. After a year I finally decided to try another product - Enormous Lash. After 3 months my lashes have come back to where they were before the Revitalash, but I have to use it every day to maintain the lashes I started with.</li>
            <li> Received item and have been using nightly as instructed for 3 weeks.  Have not noticed ANY difference.  Also, it burns the eyes when you put it on.  Overpriced \\&quot;magic beans\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Revitalash after visiting my aunt and seeing her crazy long, thick eyelashes. She&#x27;s been using the product for a couple of years and swears by it. So I started using it on Sept. 10, and I wanted to wait a few weeks before posting my review. My aunt said it took right around 4 months before she saw really noticeable results. It&#x27;s been 6 weeks since I started using it and I can say that my lashes are absolutely longer than they were when I started. Not tremendously thicker or darker yet, but I know I still need to give it a couple more months before seeing big results. The first result I started noticing was that my eyelashes were curling upwards and I stopped using my eyelash curler. That was at around the 4-week mark. Then in the last 2 weeks they&#x27;ve really started getting longer and stronger. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting longer lashes. I&#x27;m surprised how noticeable it is already, especially with mascara on. I can&#x27;t wait to see what they look like by the end of December!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to enhance my lashes prior to my Wedding, and had excellent results.  My lashes were longer than ever before, and comparable to my friends&#x27; lashes (who uses Latisse).  No change in the fullness, however.  It does take a few weeks to see results, but it is worth the wait.  Once my lashes were lengthened, I stopped using the product, and the effect did seem to wear off in a few months.  I have since started using it again, and am already seeing results once again.  If the price were lower (as it was around $54 when I purchased it), I would recommend this over Latisse.  But, with the escalation in cost, I think Latisse would be comparable if not better. That is the opinion of a physician...</li>
            <li> Well that is all I have to say is that it works and I&#x27;m happy. It is a good price and a lot cheaper than the competition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 7 weeks now and have yet to see any results. My eyelashes haven&#x27;t grown any longer. I&#x27;ve read that it can take up to 8 weeks for it to work in some cases, so will continue to use it until it is all gone and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for over 3 weeks and see no thickening or growth of my eyelashes.  I will continue to use this in hopes that I will see some improvement as I hear it may take up to 8 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Revitalash is simple to use,  Just apply once a day to clean dry eye lashes, and with a little patience, you will see noticeably, beautiful longer eyelashes. I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> All my life my lashes were short and stubby until my doctor&#x27;s office started to sell Revitalash but I didn&#x27;t buy it there for TWICE as much but saved $$ by buying it on Amazon.com instead.  My lashes were so damaged from having semi-permanent (not!) lashes applied every 2 weeks for almost 2 years that I began to have bald spots on my lids where no lashes grew after a while at all!  After using this product for about 6 weeks there was a noticeable change with lashes filling in and elongating, NO JOKE!  My husband used to tease me while I applied my mascara saying \\&quot;come out little eye lashes and play\\&quot; and now he is absolutely AMAZED at how my lashes tripled in length! I am a Nurse Practitioner and I assure you, it&#x27;s safe and will change how you feel about your stubby lashes once they grow longer and thicker.  A little stinging at times and the literature says one may get brown spots on lids but the later has not happened.  The only thing that happened is that I am pleased beyond measure and how I have lovely longer lashes now.  You do have to use it regularly for maintenance but it takes no time at all.  Make sure you clean your lids well as you do dip the applicator in and out of the tube increasing the chance of infection but this has not happened to me using as clean a technique as I possibly can.  I replace the product every quarter to assure it&#x27;s fresh and working. And what a cost savings!  I used to pay $55 every 2 weeks (ouch! but I was desperate!) to have individual lashes attached to my stubby ones and now I pay $70ish and it lasts 4 months!  You will NOT be disappointed but happy as can be at the beautiful results!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other eyelash treatments and besides Latisse this is the best. My lashes grow fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over 3 weeks and can already see results. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does after another month or so.   I would recommend this product, as it seems to be doing what it says it does. If you get some in your eyes it does sting a little, but quickly goes away.   I like it and will continue to use it and looking forward to the end results.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Lots of people say it works - just did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> after using this product a couple of times, I noticed that I have red eyes and eyelids  I am not happy with this product but as with any other beauty product, I am not able to return it.</li>
            <li> It works! I have been using Revitlash for 15 months now, and absolutely love it. It takes about 4-6 weeks before you see the results. My lashes are about 1/3 longer by using Revitlash. I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I had tried Latisse in the past and although it worked the product effected my eyes. Revitalash is a great product and I don&#x27;t have the side effects. After menapause, I noticed that my eyelashes and eyebrows were getting sparse. I use Revitalash on both and it works. My daughter in law thought that I had false eyelashes on the other day. Plan on purchasing several as Christmas gifts for my girlfriends. Great product.[[ASIN:B0014WJLPS Revitalash Eyelash Conditioner, 4.1-mL/0.139-Fluid Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I went in to a salon to have eyelash extensions put on my lashes before a big event because I have the shortest, stubbiest eyelashes ever.  I would have paid the same price for a temporary fix but the girls at the salon talked me in to trying this.  I now have lashes long enough to curl and, with the right mascara, I look just like the models in magazines.  Trust me, I am a regular old girl and am writing this from my heart.    This stuff really does work - I even bought it at full price, so seeing it at $89 is a treat for me!  Buying more today.</li>
            <li> This procduct was reviewed on the tv show The doctors.  I received the best price possible by purchasing it through Amazon.com.  It is still too early to see the full results.  So far so good.  I have seen a small difference and am confident this product will do the job.</li>
            <li> I have been using Revitalash for over a year now.  I personally have not tried all the other brands because I feel this product does what it says.  I apply it 1 - 2 times a week now and a tube last over 6 months.  My lashed stay long.  It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for one month. I still haven&#x27;t seen any results, but I think it takes about 8 weeks before u really start to notice something. So i&#x27;m gonna hang in there and see.  The only weird thing I feel in the morning from the use of this product, is that my eyes itch a bit.  But that&#x27;s about it. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all when I put it on at night, only in the morning.</li>
            <li> As I am growing older (50+), my lashes are growing thinner.  This product has done what it says it will do.  I am impressed.</li>
            <li> It has not been sufficient time to have full great lashes but I can tell the difference ... it is working. I would purchase it again ..... I even started to use it in a bare section of one of my eye brows and there is hairs coming out where there were none before!!!!</li>
            <li> Revitalish Eylelash Conditioner works....my eyelashes are long, beautiful, and dark! I sometimes just skip the mascara, especially if I am at home because my eyelashes look great without mascara!  They don&#x27;t fall out any more and are very soft and actually have a curl to them!  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants beautiful long and dark eyelashes.  I am 67 years of age!</li>
            <li> Product was shipped quickly.  This is the second tube that I have bought in just over a year!  It lasts a long time and really works!!  BTW - this last bottle was less expensive than the first too!  Extra bonus!</li>
            <li> After using this product for approximately a year, my lashes are permanently longer - friends ask me whether I have extensions (!!) - will continue using.[[ASIN:B0014WJLPS Revitalash Eyelash Conditioner, 4.1-mL/0.139-Fluid Ounces]</li>
            <li> Product came fast. Used only ones and had very bad allergy reaction. I used it at night as was directed and by the end of next day skin around my eyes became red, dry, and burning.  I was taking Benadryl for 2 days and redness went away.  But now a week later the skin is still dry and wrinkled.  I am 36 year old and this product made me look just overnight 30 years older.  \\&quot;Allergy tested. Non-Irritating \\&quot; is listed on the box. I sent email to the seller today requesting a return authorization.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law put this in my xmas stocking 2 years ago, and I was skeptic, but it really works ... don&#x27;t expect results before at least 6 weeks though.</li>
            <li> Revitalash has worked better than I thought it would in that it has lasted longer than advertised.  While my lashes are not as thick as I would like, they are definitely longer!  Rather than be a 3 month supply, I am still using my first wand after 4 months!  This second order from Amazon is unopened.[[ASIN:B0014WJLPS Revitalash Eyelash Conditioner, 4.1-mL/0.139-Fluid Ounces]]</li>
            <li> Revitalash does make your lashes longer and darker. It definitely takes a month or two and I noticed that they reached a longer length 3-4 months into using it. I use it about 5 times a week and have been for the past 6 months and have had no problems or side effects and would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but read the reviews and decided to try it.  It took three weeks and then the results were AMAZING!  I just purchased my second bottle!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost six months and it made my lashes twice their usual length after 4 months and is now beginning to fill out the gaps.  I did not think this product would work as well as it has and it is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This products works but you have to wait a little while.  You have to use this product every night for about 3 weeks to start to see signs of lash length.  I have been using this for a little over a month and my lashes have grown longer not thiker though.  It stings if it gets in your eyes though, so be careful.  Overall though I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now.  Each morning when I put on my make-up I marvel at the length of my lashes.  I used to apply a base prior to the mascara.  No longer!  My lashes were short and sparse and now are longer and fuller.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for over a 1 1/2 and find it really works for me.  I use it 3-4x a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and have experienced no results yet. I will return if nothing happens soon.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work - at least not for me.  I&#x27;ve spent lots of money on eyelash extensions but they can get irritating to the eye.  I&#x27;ve tried Revitalash as well as NeuLash. The only thing that really works is Latisse which you need a prescription for.   Just wanted let you know so you may want to save your money and put it towards a product that is effective as well as FDA approved.  Best of luck towards not just \\&quot;longer-looking\\&quot; but actually longer lashes!</li>
            <li> Started off with a tube of Rapid Lash which, in fairness, I didn&#x27;t use faithfully, but did see some small results from. Purchased Revitalash and faithfully used for about 6 weeks before seeing truly noticeable results. My lashes are really long, curling and there are lots of them. Very pleased and I will be buying more soon. Would definitely recommend. Be patient with results and consistent with your application each evening.</li>
            <li> I am one happy woman who had very little eyelashes three months ago. I did a lot of research before buying this on amazon and because of my desesperation to have long lashes I gave it a try.. Dont beleive the bs or the bad reviews that often people writes (sometimes from other companies) that only want to make it look bad. After 2 months my lashes did grow and now 3 months later I have amazing lashes and people did notice a lot, I have received compliments thinking that I have fake lashes. I am really happy because of relitalash and I will recomend the product to every woman who needs it. As a plus I would recomend you to use lancome Hypnose drama mascara to enhace your looks, you&#x27;ll thank me forever!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about 5-6 weeks. The product does work, my lashes have grown and look great. People have noticed the diffenence and asked what I did . The only problem is my eyes get red and my lids get sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a cheaper alternative to Lilash, and a girlfriend of mine was raving about Revitalash and the price was much less. So I decided to give it a try, and to my disappointment my eyes were bloodshot red from using this. The direction says to apply it before going to bed, which I did. However, I woked up with bloodshot eyes, and because I had LASIK done I was afraid it would hurt that. So I stopped using it and went back to Lilash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes did grow significantly with this, but the irritation was not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Used Revitalash for about 6 weeks, and Revitabrow. hadn&#x27;t noticed a big difference in growth yet, but did develop allergic conjunctivitis. In all fairness, it could just be allergies in general, but the only new thing in my cosmetic routine was the revitalash. I&#x27;d LOVE to have longer lashes and the sparse areas filled in, but not sure this is worth it. Be careful, check in with your eye doctor if anything comes up.</li>
            <li> My sister purchased this product for me for my birthday because I was missing eyelashes. I was embarrassed to look at people because my eyelashes were short, straight and sparse. I seriously had several areas that had no eyelashes at all not even stubs! I looked terrible. One of my eyes was worse than the other so I thought I would put the product on one eye only. For the first two months I did not notice a difference and was very disappointed!! After some encouragement from my sister, I decided to continue using the product since I had a six month supply. After three months of Nightly Application my eyelashes filled in and grew in length. My friends and family noticed a difference between the two eyes. I was a walking advertisement for awhile with my eyelashes being so different. I started to use the product on both eyes because I wanted to be matching:). It took a couple more months for the eyelashes to match. This product worked even though it did take longer than I would have liked! Now, there are days I choose not to even wear mascara. My eyelashes are fuller, longer, darker and they are no longer completely straight. My eyes look great and I feel prettier! For those who are frustrated it did take more time than what I was told so it could be the same for you. I believe it took me at least 4 months to really be happy with my eyelashes. I also want to report that when I am not careful or put too much on it ends up getting in my eye causing it to sting. The stinging does go away after a couple of minutes. I also read in some reviews about the skin around the eyes becoming dark and/or eye pigment changes. I did not have this experience. I have blue/grey eyes and they now look great. This review is NOT for the Revitalash Advanced. I have not used that product. I used the Revitalash Eyelash Conditioner 4.10ml/0.139. This product worked and helped me to feel more confident when looking at others. I will definitely purchase this product again! Good Luck on finding theproduct that works for you. I would love to hear about other products that are not too expensive and are effective!!</li>
            <li> My wife tried this after first trying several other eyelash conditioners.  She has never tried LATISSE (which requires a prescription) but likes this one best amongst those that do not require a prescription.  Her eyelashes look longer and thicker, although I don&#x27;t think you should expect miracles or the appearance of false eyelashes.  It is pricey, but it seems to last for about 6 months.  Overall a good product.  Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes or it will sting (and the warnings say it could change your eye color permanently, which is pretty scary).</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and is so much easier than false eyelashes.  After they get to a good length even using every other day keeps them looking good and the product lasts even longer.</li>
            <li> It worked. I have been using it for 2 weeks and my lashes look longer and thicker. I have tried the Talika Lipocils before but Revitalash is better, talika does makes my lashes longer and thicker but easily fall out while revitalash strengthen lashes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now &amp; am already seeing a difference. They are deffinatly longer! Am age 41 &amp; my lashes were full but short &amp; unnoticeable without curling them. Now I can see them as soon as I put mascara on. Right eye lashes seem longer than left but will keep using &amp; post another review in a month or so</li>
            <li> This product arrived super fast, and I am awaiting to see if it works as describe.  I have only been using it for a week and a half, but my friend has been using it for a while and she swears by it.</li>
            <li> I have used many other lash enhancer products. This is BY FAR the best, my eyelashes grew to very noticeable length in about 3 weeks of nightly use. I would highly recommend this product. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money on others. It also looks like a small container, but lasts a long time. Be vigilant and use every night at first, you will be very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using revitalash for at least 3 years...when I first started using it, it took a good 3 weeks of using it daily on the upper and lower lashes before I saw anything.  Then all of the sudden I noticed  a few lashes getting longer, and then a few more.  After 5 weeks my lashes were so long that I had to trim some of them. They are black and curl so no more lash curlers needed...without mascara they look great but with mascara they are fabulous long and lush.  I will never stop using this product.  I have had no side affects, no darkened skin or eye color change.  You can go to ebay and get a tube for approx. $69.00 and it lasts up to 8 months...well worth the money plus they are your lashes not fake.</li>
