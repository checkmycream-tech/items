            <li>I have gotten more compliments on this cologne than anything else.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend will love this one.</li>
            <li>My favorite of all seduction  line..</li>
            <li>sweet smell and soft, but durable, excellent price and presentation.</li>
            <li>Pretty good size bottle for the price can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>but I still got exactly what I wanted in good time.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated this product, good price for a fantastic fragance my wife love it</li>
            <li>In my opinion its not too strong, however it is longing.</li>
            <li>Amazingly strong and seductive.</li>
            <li>I chose &#x27;free super saver shipping&#x27; and it was here in three days!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY clean and fresh smelling as well.</li>
            <li>I have never had such a delightful reaction from buying a new cologne.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells great and the scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Try those first they smell better and are cheaper.</li>
            <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li>I THEN CARRY OTHER COLONES AND PUT ON COOL WATER (WHICH THEY LOVED)!  </li>
            <li>To me it smells sweet yet tangy.</li>
            <li>this smells so good and girls actually like it!</li>
            <li>i bought it couple of weeks ago, and i was expecting much more that it really was....</li>
            <li>and he wear it all full day.</li>
            <li>But overall, a good product, not too perfumy, so</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and really like it and receive many compliments.</li>
            <li>Some colognes other men wear kind of make you choke when you get near but not this one lol.</li>
            <li>Positives: Citrus based cologne that is light and crisp.</li>
            <li>Love this item, it is a great, subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t assault your senses, but rather &amp;#34;seduces&amp;#34; them.</li>
            <li>i have gotten so many compliments on the cologne, it has a smell that is just right not to strong and not to light, and the scent feels expansive since it also lasts long.</li>
            <li>This is a fresh &amp; citris scent, if you like fresh scents like aqua di gio you will like this one.</li>
            <li>It was well worth it</li>
            <li>It was at a very reasonable price, and was shipped right away.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong, not too soft.</li>
            <li>This is definitely his favorite scent, so much of a favorite that he only wears it on date nights!</li>
            <li>Any age can wear it, within the first 30 min of wearing it, a few girls in my class told me I smelled good.</li>
            <li>and I instantly fell in love with this cologne.</li>
            <li>really hot iteam</li>
            <li>They sold exactly what I was looking for and got it to me as soon as they could.</li>
            <li>So, I first smelled another friends cologne after  I broke into his room to pull a prank.</li>
            <li>Even after wearing only this cologne for the last six months they still comment on how good it smells.</li>
            <li>I like it, nice everyday lounging scent or fresh out the shower spray but don&#x27;t expect women to be crowding around you asking what cologne are you wearing.</li>
            <li>I have never had such a strong (and positive) response from so many different people before.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, along with Seduction in Black, because it is one of his favorite scents!</li>
            <li>I have always received positive comments comments about it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen such a strong reaction from women to a cologne before.</li>
            <li>This is a great men&#x27;s cologne but it is very hard to find in the retail outlets.  </li>
            <li>Light scent and most of all it last long!</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband and was really wowed by it.</li>
            <li>It lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this for me, and now she wants me to wear it every day, all the time...</li>
            <li>It really does match the name.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast and just like I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Feeling very seductive..</li>
            <li>I am very accordant with purchase</li>
            <li>Every girl I talk to or stand near moves extremely close to me and tells me I smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Great scent, A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that you give this a try.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for any discerning gentleman.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you want attention from women.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised on how fast the product arrived.  </li>
            <li>it is more masculine as it dries down.</li>
            <li>He had tried the Seduction in Black and really liked it, so I thought he might like the BLue Seduction as well</li>
            <li>-Try to smell it in person first obviously</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was that this is the only cologne that people have asked about.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a little more expensive, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and sort of fruity, but at the same time really not that fruity.</li>
            <li>Her comment was, \\&quot;Wow, what&#x27;s that smell.</li>
            <li>This is actually a reasonably priced cologne for daily wear as well!</li>
            <li>it is soft and it will fade ~5 to 6 hours.</li>
            <li>All these reviews seem so professional and kinda overdone.</li>
            <li>So heres one from a 22 year old guy.</li>
            <li>As I went through the rest of my day all I could think was \\&quot;WoW</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been able to find it on Amazon or other similar sites.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure this one is fake</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Junior in high school and a vast majority of the girls,</li>
            <li>but I actually like Nautica voyayage or even Nautica blue a little better now</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and it is hard to find in stores now!</li>
            <li>and was exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li>if not all, prefer this scent over AXE or any other cheap body spray or cologne, but that should be expected.</li>
            <li>Go ahead and get the bigger bottle, you will definitely use it (even though it lasts a pretty long time).</li>
            <li>It is definitely not overpowering, yet is enough that you can actually smell it when you come near him.</li>
            <li>Be warned, it is strong when it goes on, and I usually only use 1 to 2 sprays, about an hour before going out, to give it time to tame down.  </li>
            <li>I love this cologne on him, it&#x27;s subtle, not overpowering like other colognes.</li>
            <li>But not long lasting...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love wearing this perfume and steal any woman&#x27;s heart like Zorro.</li>
            <li> As for the ladies, they love it.</li>

            <li> I love it also.  </li>
            <li> But warning upon using this product I have started to become more rugged</li>
            <li> I have gotten more compliments on this cologne than anything else.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend will love this one.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all seduction  line..</li>
            <li> sweet smell and soft, but durable, excellent price and presentation.</li>
            <li> Pretty good size bottle for the price can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> but I still got exactly what I wanted in good time.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated this product, good price for a fantastic fragance my wife love it</li>
            <li> In my opinion its not too strong, however it is longing.</li>
            <li> Amazingly strong and seductive.</li>
            <li> I chose &#x27;free super saver shipping&#x27; and it was here in three days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY clean and fresh smelling as well.</li>
            <li> I have never had such a delightful reaction from buying a new cologne.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great and the scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Try those first they smell better and are cheaper.</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li> I THEN CARRY OTHER COLONES AND PUT ON COOL WATER (WHICH THEY LOVED)!  </li>
            <li> To me it smells sweet yet tangy.</li>
            <li> this smells so good and girls actually like it!</li>
            <li> i bought it couple of weeks ago, and i was expecting much more that it really was....</li>
            <li> and he wear it all full day.</li>
            <li> But overall, a good product, not too perfumy, so</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and really like it and receive many compliments.</li>
            <li> Some colognes other men wear kind of make you choke when you get near but not this one lol.</li>
            <li> Positives: Citrus based cologne that is light and crisp.</li>
            <li> Love this item, it is a great, subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t assault your senses, but rather &amp;#34;seduces&amp;#34; them.</li>
            <li> i have gotten so many compliments on the cologne, it has a smell that is just right not to strong and not to light, and the scent feels expansive since it also lasts long.</li>
            <li> This is a fresh &amp; citris scent, if you like fresh scents like aqua di gio you will like this one.</li>
            <li> It was well worth it</li>
            <li> It was at a very reasonable price, and was shipped right away.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong, not too soft.</li>
            <li> This is definitely his favorite scent, so much of a favorite that he only wears it on date nights!</li>
            <li> Any age can wear it, within the first 30 min of wearing it, a few girls in my class told me I smelled good.</li>
            <li> and I instantly fell in love with this cologne.</li>
            <li> really hot iteam</li>
            <li> They sold exactly what I was looking for and got it to me as soon as they could.</li>
            <li> So, I first smelled another friends cologne after  I broke into his room to pull a prank.</li>
            <li> Even after wearing only this cologne for the last six months they still comment on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> I like it, nice everyday lounging scent or fresh out the shower spray but don&#x27;t expect women to be crowding around you asking what cologne are you wearing.</li>
            <li> I have never had such a strong (and positive) response from so many different people before.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, along with Seduction in Black, because it is one of his favorite scents!</li>
            <li> I have always received positive comments comments about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen such a strong reaction from women to a cologne before.</li>
            <li> This is a great men&#x27;s cologne but it is very hard to find in the retail outlets.  </li>
            <li> Light scent and most of all it last long!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and was really wowed by it.</li>
            <li> It lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me, and now she wants me to wear it every day, all the time...</li>
            <li> It really does match the name.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and just like I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Feeling very seductive..</li>
            <li> I am very accordant with purchase</li>
            <li> Every girl I talk to or stand near moves extremely close to me and tells me I smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Great scent, A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for any discerning gentleman.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you want attention from women.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised on how fast the product arrived.  </li>
            <li> it is more masculine as it dries down.</li>
            <li> He had tried the Seduction in Black and really liked it, so I thought he might like the BLue Seduction as well</li>
            <li> -Try to smell it in person first obviously</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was that this is the only cologne that people have asked about.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a little more expensive, but it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and sort of fruity, but at the same time really not that fruity.</li>
            <li> Her comment was, \\&quot;Wow, what&#x27;s that smell.</li>
            <li> This is actually a reasonably priced cologne for daily wear as well!</li>
            <li> it is soft and it will fade ~5 to 6 hours.</li>
            <li> All these reviews seem so professional and kinda overdone.</li>
            <li> So heres one from a 22 year old guy.</li>
            <li> As I went through the rest of my day all I could think was \\&quot;WoW</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been able to find it on Amazon or other similar sites.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure this one is fake</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Junior in high school and a vast majority of the girls,</li>
            <li> but I actually like Nautica voyayage or even Nautica blue a little better now</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it is hard to find in stores now!</li>
            <li> and was exactly what I expected!  </li>
            <li> if not all, prefer this scent over AXE or any other cheap body spray or cologne, but that should be expected.</li>
            <li> Go ahead and get the bigger bottle, you will definitely use it (even though it lasts a pretty long time).</li>
            <li> It is definitely not overpowering, yet is enough that you can actually smell it when you come near him.</li>
            <li> Be warned, it is strong when it goes on, and I usually only use 1 to 2 sprays, about an hour before going out, to give it time to tame down.  </li>
            <li> I love this cologne on him, it&#x27;s subtle, not overpowering like other colognes.</li>
            <li> But not long lasting...</li>
            <li> As with all colognes i would suggest at least smelling it first before buying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negatives: Does not last long.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A ROTEN LONG LASTING SMELL WHICH</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the sprayer ejects too much perfume with a single press.</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I tried this about nine months ago along with several other colognes.</li>
            <li> And, it lasts a long time, usually 8 hours later I can still smell it.  </li>
            <li> My grandma got me this for one christmas a few years ago and its the only cologne i like.</li>
            <li> I HAD TO WASH OFF BECAUSE OF COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical with this being my first time ordering something online</li>
            <li> but it came faster than expected!</li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s not worth 27</li>
            <li> My son and I had previously used since then has not let buy</li>
            <li> In store the bottle half this size goes for $22 + Tax.</li>
            <li> But the previous reviews were encouraging.</li>
            <li> smells like it&#x27;s not original.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It will fade in just a few hours.</li>
            <li> Recieved one of the bottles with some missing out of one of the bottles i bought</li>
            <li> and it is not strong.</li>
            <li> Men that are into spending a small fortune ask and well as the ladies.  </li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> I met my boyfriend when he used to wear this cologne and it absolutely drove me crazy!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere but Amazon, although I didn&#x27;t look too hard.</li>
            <li> I have not grown tired of the fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a little disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> the smell does get a little annoying if you over wear it</li>
            <li> this is fake one.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong size</li>
            <li> I put some on because I was bored.</li>
            <li> its crazy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As a woman, I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years. I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how good it smells. Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and was really wowed by it. The fragrance is just wonderful. My daughter walked in the room one night just as he left to go to work, so he had just put it on but had already left the room. Her comment was, \\&quot;Wow, what&#x27;s that smell. It smells good in here!\\&quot; That smell was Blue Seduction by Antonio Banderas for Men.     I have not grown tired of the fragrance at all. I love when we go out and I have the confidence that he is the best smelling man in the room. It is definitely not overpowering, yet is enough that you can actually smell it when you come near him. It is a really pleasant fragrance.    I would definitely recommend this for all men. I love the product and will be buying it again and again for my husband.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scent that women love. It lasts the whole day. To me it smells sweet yet tangy.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to receive this item on December 1 but I received it 3 days of my purchase. My bf loved it and it was a great size for a great price, I will definitely be buying from you guys again</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, along with Seduction in Black, because it is one of his favorite scents! This is definitely his favorite scent, so much of a favorite that he only wears it on date nights! We both can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes in the market</li>
            <li> My Boyfriend loves this cologne and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it for ao cheap!!! The department stores want an arm leg and some fingers for it</li>
            <li> excellent product, magnifico. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My son has been wearing this cologne for years.  He loves it, so he&#x27;s getting it for Christmas 2010!</li>
            <li> Great perfume....... Love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen such a strong reaction from women to a cologne before. I&#x27;ve had several women tell me how this scent puts them in the mood. Its not too strong of a stench either, its perfect. I highly recommend that you give this a try.</li>
            <li> Love this item, it is a great, subtle scent that doesn&#x27;t assault your senses, but rather &amp;#34;seduces&amp;#34; them. I highly recommend this for any discerning gentleman.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me, and now she wants me to wear it every day, all the time... I keep telling her I can&#x27;t! I want to save it! - not finish it in weeks!</li>
            <li> This smell is awesome. It&#x27;s light and sort of fruity, but at the same time really not that fruity. It really does match the name. It smells like a like blue seduction flower. It&#x27;s VERY clean and fresh smelling as well. The only thing is I feel like I have to spray a lot or else it does not stick. But that&#x27;s okay because this REALLY is a great deal. I chose &#x27;free super saver shipping&#x27; and it was here in three days! AWESOME! Go buy it! -Try to smell it in person first obviously</li>
            <li> this smells so good and girls actually like it! the smell does get a little annoying if you over wear it but the smell is lovely.</li>
            <li> Smells really great. I love wearing this perfume and steal any woman&#x27;s heart like Zorro.</li>
            <li> Daughter said it smells really good! :)</li>
            <li> I tried this about nine months ago along with several other colognes. The first thing I noticed was that this is the only cologne that people have asked about. My male friends have even asked me where they can get it. As for the ladies, they love it. Even after wearing only this cologne for the last six months they still comment on how good it smells. I have never had such a strong (and positive) response from so many different people before.</li>
            <li> The best smell I have found for cologne!</li>
            <li> this is fake one. it is just blue water.</li>
            <li> excelente delivery time</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my bf and he loves it!...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a little disappointed with this. i bought it couple of weeks ago, and i was expecting much more that it really was.... i think it&#x27;s not worth 27 $. Antonio Banderas Spirit is much better.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband I love the way it smells on him. Pretty good size bottle for the price can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. All I smell is alcohol 👎👎</li>
            <li> I have used this for two years now, and get asked all the time what I am wearing.  Men that are into spending a small fortune ask and well as the ladies.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a great men&#x27;s cologne but it is very hard to find in the retail outlets.  I&#x27;ve only been able to find it on Amazon or other similar sites.</li>
            <li> I always wear this perfume, four star from me. I love it. Women love to smell me. I call it &amp;#34;Morning freshness smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Although it does not have the best performance as far as longevity, projection, and sillage, this fragrance smells so good!! Highyl recommended especially if you can find a bargain !</li>
            <li> excellent product I use regularly,gives a very good flavor, this is the best rate, 100% recommended for all users running amazon.com</li>
            <li> Positives: Citrus based cologne that is light and crisp. Projection won&#x27;t offend people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: Does not last long. Even on my oily skin, it only last about 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Cologne is perfect for office staff meetings and crowd situations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great man&#x27;s cologne!  I have always received positive comments comments about it</li>
            <li> This is a fresh &amp; citris scent, if you like fresh scents like aqua di gio you will like this one. It&#x27;s affordable &amp; I honestly get 7 to 10 hours on my skin! I didn&#x27;t expect that at all. Any age can wear it, within the first 30 min of wearing it, a few girls in my class told me I smelled good. It&#x27;s a great cologne!</li>
            <li> excelente producto recomendado</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great and the scent lasts a long time. My only complaint is that the sprayer ejects too much perfume with a single press.</li>
            <li> its the only fragrances my man will use.the  girls in the office love it.</li>
            <li> I buy this perfume for my husband, and he loves it, It is really good, have good price and he wear it all full day. thanks</li>
            <li> My favorite. Cant always find in stores.</li>
            <li> It was great. I ordered the wrong size but I still got exactly what I wanted in good time.</li>
            <li> Great product! I really appreciated this product, good price for a fantastic fragance my wife love it I&#x27;m enjoying  tkx</li>
            <li> I found this last year at a discount store and decided to give it as a gift to the spouse. He really liked it and asked for it again this year. I couldn&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere but Amazon, although I didn&#x27;t look too hard. It&#x27;s a nice cologne at a nice price.</li>
            <li> Product in perfect condition and this rating is for the high quality product, perfect condition, good condition, the product is 100% recommended by me, and recommend it to all ................</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and I love the smell of it on him. It makes him smell Yummy!</li>
            <li> Best purchase by far! Great product for its value! Great for summer! Light scent and most of all it last long!</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and just like I ordered it. It was well worth it and I am so glad I went through with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I like that this cologne smells very good. Does not smell like a $20 cologne, that&#x27;s for sure!!!! I would recommend to any cologne user.!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a Christmas present.  It was at a very reasonable price, and was shipped right away.  I was really surprised on how fast the product arrived.  I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Very good product, recommended !!</li>
            <li> This fragrance was made to turn around and make all women fall at your feet. It&#x27;s just perfect</li>
            <li> ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION, YOU RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> The product fulfilled expectations. excellent</li>
            <li> I like it, nice everyday lounging scent or fresh out the shower spray but don&#x27;t expect women to be crowding around you asking what cologne are you wearing. Your woman should appreciate it when she is close up on you but I actually like Nautica voyayage or even Nautica blue a little better now that I think of it. Try those first they smell better and are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I like it, is a very good fragrance, the smell is very nice and durable. The bottle has a good design.</li>
            <li> The best smell ever!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling cologne. I took a sniff of one from Dillards and I instantly fell in love with this cologne. It is perfect for anyone.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. But I&#x27;ve bought the store bottle before. I am pretty sure this one is fake</li>
            <li> My husband said that he saw this cologne in an airport in Germany and said that it smelled great.  I was like sure it does lol, I looked it up on here (amazon) and ordered it for him and so glad I did.  It smells AMAZING! I love this cologne on him, it&#x27;s subtle, not overpowering like other colognes. Some colognes other men wear kind of make you choke when you get near but not this one lol.</li>
            <li> smells like it&#x27;s not original.</li>
            <li> excellent .. such to that offered by the seller, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Awesome buy! In store the bottle half this size goes for $22 + Tax.</li>
            <li> and I have the product in my hands. all in perfect condition .thanks</li>
            <li> This is actually a reasonably priced cologne for daily wear as well! Good price and smells great! I&#x27;ve gotten some good compliments from this and it&#x27;s a good cologne to my collection!</li>
            <li> Smells good it is soft and it will fade ~5 to 6 hours. I like it and would buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> It is amazing!!! Everywhere I go people ask what amm I wearing! So many people...its crazy. I just love it...really hot iteam</li>
            <li> I have never had such a delightful reaction from buying a new cologne. I&#x27;m a Junior in high school and a vast majority of the girls, if not all, prefer this scent over AXE or any other cheap body spray or cologne, but that should be expected. Every girl I talk to or stand near moves extremely close to me and tells me I smell amazing. I believe I am inlove with this.   I highly recommend it if you want attention from women.</li>
            <li> All these reviews seem so professional and kinda overdone. So heres one from a 22 year old guy. My grandma got me this for one christmas a few years ago and its the only cologne i like. In my opinion its not too strong, however it is longing. Its not musky or fruity, its a mans cologne. As with all colognes i would suggest at least smelling it first before buying.</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
            <li> Amazingly strong and seductive. I gave it to a friend on his birthday, and he was uber happy and kept saying &amp;#34;omg, I myself feel seduced&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the best modern scents that I have used.  And, it lasts a long time, usually 8 hours later I can still smell it.  Be warned, it is strong when it goes on, and I usually only use 1 to 2 sprays, about an hour before going out, to give it time to tame down.  But overall, a good product, not too perfumy, so it is more masculine as it dries down.</li>
            <li> I WILL NEVER USE THIS COLONE AGAIN IT HAS A ROTEN LONG LASTING SMELL WHICH I HAD TO WASH OFF BECAUSE OF COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS.  I THEN CARRY OTHER COLONES AND PUT ON COOL WATER (WHICH THEY LOVED)!  I WOULD&#x27;T USE THIS AND GAVE IT AWAY TO A HOMELESS MAN WHO COULD USE IT INSTEAD OF SHOWERING! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with this being my first time ordering something online but it came faster than expected! and was exactly what I expected!  Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cologne and I save a lot of money using Amazon. It is great paired with the Flo Refillable Atomizer for cologne on the go.</li>
            <li> The perfume came in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years now and really like it and receive many compliments. The company did an excellent job with my order and shipped it almost immediately. I don&#x27;t have any problem recommending the product or the company selling it. They sold exactly what I was looking for and got it to me as soon as they could. Can&#x27;t ask for anything more than that. Thanks.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO GRACIAS AMAZON</li>
            <li> this is a great product for the price, some are so overpriced, and this one is a good fallback one for day to day use.</li>
            <li> He did it again nice product</li>
            <li> Magnificent Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Excellent flavor, a scent that gives an impressive feeling that allows to feel the presence of a mild flavor, captivating and seductive. Aquirir recommend the product for its features</li>
            <li> I was just browsing and came across this advertisement. I never ordered cologne online. But the previous reviews were encouraging. I placed my order, recevied a notification on when the product was to arrive within 48 hours. I was greatly impressed. The scent is excellent.</li>
            <li> Smells good for the price i paid!</li>
            <li> i have gotten so many compliments on the cologne, it has a smell that is just right not to strong and not to light, and the scent feels expansive since it also lasts long.</li>
            <li> great , I love it , I ordered one more</li>
            <li> Excellent very responsible</li>
            <li> Bought it for husband..Liked the fragrance..But not long lasting...&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if i would buy it again..&lt;br /&gt;Then i am even considering to stop buying fragrances online..</li>
            <li> So, I first smelled another friends cologne after  I broke into his room to pull a prank. I put some on because I was bored. As I went through the rest of my day all I could think was \\&quot;WoW I smell good\\&quot; Its the only thing that was on my mind. Before wearing this I never had a girl comment on my cologne. Now I get compliments all the time. girls will demand to find where that great smell is coming from.</li>
            <li> Just had one spray of my friends bottle and went to work, I work at Pizza Hut and I smelt this all day! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son.  He had tried the Seduction in Black and really liked it, so I thought he might like the BLue Seduction as well and he did.  I love it also.  It smells great.</li>
            <li> Great scent, A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> But warning upon using this product I have started to become more rugged and I now speak with a Spaniard accent.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a little more expensive, but it is well worth it. If you want to be the best smelling person anywhere you go, you NEED this. I have gotten more compliments on this cologne than anything else. Go ahead and get the bigger bottle, you will definitely use it (even though it lasts a pretty long time). As far as the scent goes, I can&#x27;t even smell it on myself anymore, but it was never overpowering and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great perfume for the price way cheaper than macy&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Feeling very seductive.. chances of successful seduction has increased/improved by 50%.. :L)</li>
            <li> llego el producto en la fecha acordada en buen estado y si me enviaron lo que pedi  recomiendo  al vendedor</li>
            <li> My girlfriend will love this one. Great smell. Great product. Not too strong, not too soft. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> This was my go-to for 3 plus years. Everyone loved it and I had to tell them not to steal my scent. My only qualm is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other ones I&#x27;ve had. It will fade in just a few hours.</li>
            <li> This was a gift but I know that it is one of my favorite fragrances because it smells nice and it is not strong.</li>
            <li> Scent lasts 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I am very accordant with purchase</li>
            <li> I met my boyfriend when he used to wear this cologne and it absolutely drove me crazy! It smelled so good I couldn&#x27;t stay away, and after almost a year he finally told me it was Blue Seduction and now I want to buy it for him since I haven&#x27;t smelled it on him in months. This stuff is insanely amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Excelent perfum by Antonio Banderas. My favorite of all seduction  line..</li>
            <li> Recieved one of the bottles with some missing out of one of the bottles i bought</li>
            <li> muy buena colonia por poco dinero, el perfume dura por horas, excelente calidad la recomiendo muy buena, gracias por un excelente servicio.</li>
            <li> great, delivered on time</li>
