            <li>Ok guys...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very full but manageable.</li>
            <li>c: it doesn&#x27;t shed easily at all, so there&#x27;s no need to worry about that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>came in quite early, and I honestly like this wig alot!</li>
            <li>The bangs come down perfectly to my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still good as new.</li>
            <li>Super cute wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute on it</li>
            <li>Super fun, nice quality.</li>
            <li>this wig is so soft and fun, i bought it for cosplay because it matches monster high&#x27;s RIver Styxx perfectly!!</li>
            <li>The colors are super cute and pastel and the texture is nice, the only thing I found hard is that the curls get tangled quite easy, but other then that it is wonderful and super cute for a kawaii princess look ♥</li>
            <li>This wig is adorable, and actually pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li>The Wig is a really great quality, Although the bangs were a bit to long for me..</li>
            <li>Regardless of the long wait...this wig is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Super cuuuute</li>
            <li>Super cute and soft.</li>
            <li>The colors are a bit less saturated than the picture, but it&#x27;s still a very nice pastel themed wig.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>forever to come in but was worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly great for how little it costs!</li>
            <li>It came with a black wig cap, but you could probably get a better one in a better color (it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to have one that matched your skin, no?).  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and pastel.</li>
            <li>its not a fake synthetic</li>
            <li>it looks real!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for pictures and if you wanna go out you should probably wear a beanie because it&#x27;s too thin!</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s cute, pretty natural looking as far as cotton-candy hair goes, and the curls are nice!&lt;br</li>
            <li>to much to cover all of my black&lt;br /&gt;hair</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t tangle easily, provided you&#x27;re not constantly playing around with it, and it&#x27;s really soft !</li>
            <li>I have bought other cheap wings and just sitting in the closet had made them frizz and tangle</li>
            <li>the bangs were nice but a little long for me, but this wig cuts easily, so it wasn&#x27;t difficult to modify it :]</li>
            <li>Styled bangs &amp; costume complete!</li>
            <li>I have very dark hair and have been fine with it.</li>
            <li>It came really early also</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t super super thick, but it&#x27;s thick enough that you shouldn&#x27;t be able to see thru it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super shiny and the colors are true.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to trim them at all!&lt;br /&gt;Though, the wig can get tangled if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I wore the wig all Halloween night and it was barely even tangled when I got home.</li>
            <li>you can barely see it</li>
            <li>It fits quite nicely, and it&#x27;s not itchy or uncomfortable at all.</li>
            <li>it was small thin and got tangled super easy,</li>

            <li> it was small thin and got tangled super easy,</li>
            <li> Its a great wig but the wig might be a but thin in the back and the cap is a little small so for me its a bit of a struggle to keep centered</li>
            <li> just got a little tangled too fast and the curls didn&#x27;t last long either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little thin by the bangs area, but easily able to cover up.</li>
            <li> Hair is a little thin, but not bad!!</li>
            <li> Overall, the wig is a little thin, the scalp area was covered just fine, but the longer portions of the wig (not the bangs) does not really have enough to cover your back, so you can only part the hair to the sides, or</li>
            <li> Took a long time to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Came in about 3 weeks, earlier than expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> It was shipped from China within 2 weeks, but It took just wayyyyy too long at the Canadian border.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with this wig and it&#x27;ll last you a really long time.</li>
            <li> you can see the netting and the cap has an awkward fit</li>
            <li> I have had it a few months now and (although I have only worn it twice)</li>
            <li> /&gt; isnt as blended in with the purple and pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this wig over numerous occasions the past few months</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a deal you can&#x27;t turn down.</li>
            <li> The issue is it&#x27;s really thin in the back</li>
            <li> thin in the back.</li>
            <li> The hair isn&#x27;t super shiny, so it doesn&#x27;t look really fake or cheesy.  </li>
            <li> But I usually wear my wigs with a beanie anyways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review if it&#x27;s hard to maintain or de-tangle.</li>
            <li> The hair doesn&#x27;t look fake at all and blends well.</li>
            <li> Also for the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>

            <li> Super cute wig. This wig is adorable, and actually pretty comfortable. The issue is it&#x27;s really thin in the back and I have to wear it with a hat. But I usually wear my wigs with a beanie anyways. It&#x27;s not super shiny and the colors are true.</li>
            <li> Super fun, nice quality. Took a long time to arrive.  Styled bangs &amp; costume complete! Beautiful color.</li>
            <li> beautiful!! this wig is so soft and fun, i bought it for cosplay because it matches monster high&#x27;s RIver Styxx perfectly!! i love this wig, the seller even included a wig cap which is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> i love these colors! thin in the back. almost perfect.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful wig and perfect for styles like fairy kei or decora. It isn&#x27;t super super thick, but it&#x27;s thick enough that you shouldn&#x27;t be able to see thru it. I have very dark hair and have been fine with it. Also for the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Super cute and soft. Love it! Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Came in about 3 weeks, earlier than expected delivery date. The hair doesn&#x27;t look fake at all and blends well. It&#x27;s just a little thin by the bangs area, but easily able to cover up. Deff recommend(:</li>
            <li> absolutely love this wig. I&#x27;ve used it for multiple shoots and every day life. It&#x27;s very full but manageable. the bangs were nice but a little long for me, but this wig cuts easily, so it wasn&#x27;t difficult to modify it :] definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> This wig is actually pretty good quality for the price!  The hair isn&#x27;t super shiny, so it doesn&#x27;t look really fake or cheesy.  It came with a black wig cap, but you could probably get a better one in a better color (it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to have one that matched your skin, no?).  Anyway, it&#x27;s cute, pretty natural looking as far as cotton-candy hair goes, and the curls are nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t worn it out yet.  I&#x27;ll update my review if it&#x27;s hard to maintain or de-tangle.</li>
            <li> The bangs are not going to eat your face like the photo would lead you to believe. The wig color I received matches the colors in the photo. It&#x27;s super cute on it just got a little tangled too fast and the curls didn&#x27;t last long either.</li>
            <li> you can see the netting and the cap has an awkward fit</li>
            <li> Nice wing, doesn&#x27;t tangle easily. I have had it a few months now and (although I have only worn it twice) since I have owned it the wing has not tangled or matted. I have bought other cheap wings and just sitting in the closet had made them frizz and tangle but this one has not. The colors are pretty and pastel.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it. Makes me look gorgeous.</li>
            <li> The Wig is a really great quality, Although the bangs were a bit to long for me..but then again i&#x27;ve never had a wig with bangs like these but i love the wig ! It came really early also</li>
            <li> This wig is positively wonderful! I love it. The colours perfectly match the ones shown in the pictures. It fits quite nicely, and it&#x27;s not itchy or uncomfortable at all. The bangs come down perfectly to my eyebrows. I didn&#x27;t have to trim them at all!&lt;br /&gt;Though, the wig can get tangled if you&#x27;re not careful. I wore the wig all Halloween night and it was barely even tangled when I got home. c: it doesn&#x27;t shed easily at all, so there&#x27;s no need to worry about that.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this wig.

            <li> this wig (along with anouther I ordered from this user) came in quite early, and I honestly like this wig alot! The colors are super cute and pastel and the texture is nice, the only thing I found hard is that the curls get tangled quite easy, but other then that it is wonderful and super cute for a kawaii princess look ♥</li>
            <li> Super cuuuute the bangs are a bit in your face but not bothersome at all</li>
            <li> soo kawaii:3&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;took forever to come in but was worth it&lt;br /&gt;the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the tracks&lt;br /&gt;weren&#x27;t to much to cover all of my black&lt;br /&gt;hair you can barely see it but still it bugs me&lt;br /&gt;but this wig is just beautiful the curls bounce and the blue&lt;br /&gt; isnt as blended in with the purple and pink but sure looks great Id say its&lt;br /&gt;good for the price. its not a fake synthetic it looks real! smooth and nice cx&lt;br /&gt;came in safe too I would recommend it&lt;br /&gt;this seller has plenty of good wigs and I have bought 2 others from them&lt;br /&gt;and im very satisfied. Just order these a month ahead of time if you plan to wear it somewhere&lt;br /&gt;it takes almost 3-4 weeks to come in</li>
            <li> Beautiful and soft, it makes me feel like a beautiful fairy princess! Hair is a little thin, but not bad!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for pictures and if you wanna go out you should probably wear a beanie because it&#x27;s too thin! That&#x27;s my only con!!! If this wig was thicker to where you could wear it out without some sort of hat it would be total 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> it was small thin and got tangled super easy,</li>
            <li> Its a great wig but the wig might be a but thin in the back and the cap is a little small so for me its a bit of a struggle to keep centered</li>
            <li> Ok guys... I waited 5 weeks for this. It was shipped from China within 2 weeks, but It took just wayyyyy too long at the Canadian border. Regardless of the long wait...this wig is AMAZING! The colours are even nicer than the picture and OMG it&#x27;s so soofftt!! I will take good care of it because I am really impressed with the quality for the price. LOVE IT!</li>
