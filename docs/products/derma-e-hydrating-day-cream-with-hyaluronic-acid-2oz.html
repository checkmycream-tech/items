            <li>When I was using this product I liked it.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it had an SPF</li>

            <li>Products I&#x27;ve tried and loved:     Microdermabrasion Scrub - Salon Quality exfoliation right in your own home!  </li>
            <li>And if I have to apply more - then it is not cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Very fine product.</li>
            <li>Not greasy but very light.</li>
            <li>along with top lid..</li>
            <li>which is what healthy skin is supposed to look like.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are what I love the most.</li>
            <li>I also use one of their night creams, and can&#x27;t wait to try more Derma e&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>anyway, I use it in my hands and is ok</li>
            <li>and I love it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It would be an even better product without the scent.</li>
            <li>Their whole line of products are great.  </li>

            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>It just lays there on top.</li>
            <li>Love It .</li>
            <li>I have fussy skin, and it is gentle and smells really great (not too strong or perfumy)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve been the most happy with thus far.</li>
            <li>Light but penetrating non-greasy moisturizer works perfectly for daily use alone or under make-up.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and light, does a great job and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and my skin looks a thousand times better than it did before.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for my very sensitive and very allergic skin.</li>

            <li>Very nice under makeup and skin stays soft and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>The taste becomes very mild after about two weeks.</li>
            <li>The taste becomes very mild after about two weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s longlasting and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make me break out or irritate my sensitive skin and nicely moisturizes!</li>
            <li>Well, since it seems to plump up the skin a bit in a noticeable way, you will want to use this cream in areas where you want to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I like the day creme much better than the night creme; it is lighter and is absorbed very quickly with no greasy-feeling residue.</li>
            <li>i liked their hydrating day creme so much that i ordered one from amazon on nov 23rd and is delivered on</li>
            <li>and E are antioxidants which protect from free radicals which are harmful to the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently this \\&quot;HA\\&quot; is also now available as a dietary supplement.</li>
            <li>I actually have grown rather fond of the taste of Aloe Vera after seeing great results.me.     </li>
            <li>I actually have grown rather fond of the taste of Aloe Vera after seeing great results.</li>
            <li>Glides on, is absorbed and doesn&#x27;t lay on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>Might as well put water on face runny too light does not moisturizer feels like nothing on skin threw out</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and dewy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and moisturizing but it doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy.  </li>
            <li>Light, greaseless works well under makeup</li>
            <li>bought derma e cleanser and overnight peel from amazon and doesnt have any complaints and loved them so far..</li>
            <li>First, I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li>The people in Japan who eat a sticky gelatinous root vegetable instead of rice have smooth skin, flexible joints and full heads of hair</li>
            <li>While many so-called moisturizing cr&amp;egrave;mes (at a much higher price) promise to plump skin and diminish wrinkles, Hyaluraonic Acid Day</li>
            <li>Great for dry aging skin.</li>
            <li>Skin stays soft all day and it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>this does not irritate my skin and feels cool when applied to skin.</li>
            <li>well however it is twice the price and half as much, so if this cream works for you it is the best for the price.</li>
            <li>, I took a second look in the mirror and my skin was literally \\&quot;plumper\\&quot; as if it was more hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li>Derma-e makes a cream that is absorbed easily, even in the hot and humid summer time.  </li>
            <li>Results are normal:) I think my skin stays neutral, if its helps...</li>
            <li>Derma e hyaluronic acid day creme is the first moisturizer I have found that works for me!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this creme at Natural Grocers but decided to leave a review because I love it.</li>
            <li>I use this for my forehead, my neck and my laugh lines.  </li>
            <li>My only fault with it is that it did not moisturize my skin effectively.  </li>
            <li>My favorite so far of all the Derma e moisturizers that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Returned this item, vendor kind to take back.  </li>
            <li>I paid $24 for it there, but I thought if it works it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and no signal of age on my face so far!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure that this product is also going to be new to her.</li>
            <li>In the years of youth the human body abundantly produces a special water-gelling molecule called HA that is largely responsible for producing these visible signs of youthfulness.</li>
            <li>I am purchasing some of this right away</li>
            <li>Took years of trial (and much error) to find the perfect, light facial cream for everyday, under-makeup wear.  </li>
            <li>normally use this cream in combination with the DMAE Source Eternal serum (at nights) and my skin become really smooth and</li>
            <li>Besides, it is so pleasant to apply -- is is light and has a magnificently subtle scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff has worked awesome, and I&#x27;ve only used it a few days.  </li>
            <li>I paid much higher prices and didn&#x27;t get the results like I have with this.</li>
            <li>I had to to apply more an hour later, and that was with using in conjunction with the hydrating serum.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Dermae night and day products for several years and love them both.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My friend is happy with it, unfortunately it was too strong</li>
            <li>Fortunately Derma-E is producing wonderful antiaging products that have dramatic results in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>perhaps i would be able to tell you how i liked this product if it had been sent to me, i attempted to order it from DIRECT SUPER CENTER out of Arizona, but they sent me a different type of derma e cream, so i just kept it not wanting the hassle of a return</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic, and I thought the fragrance was light, although a little more \\&quot;fruitier\\&quot; than I prefer.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change as far as the wrinkles, but I like the texture and smell of the cream</li>
            <li>The company is pretty straight forward in telling you what exactly you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is a powerful moisturizer, and this is a very economical way to buy it, especially at subscribe &amp; save discounted prices.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I was amazed how well it moisturized my very oily skin without make it greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I don&#x27;t really feel moisturized after using this.  </li>
            <li>I already use it and really like it.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive</li>
            <li>My skin seemed to react very well to this product.</li>
            <li>Really, my skin seems smoother and plumper.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>I have an allergic reaction of swelling which is what I&#x27;m really trying to avoid.</li>
            <li>I really notice when I miss a day or forget to bring it on trips and have to use something else.</li>
            <li>I found it very drying and wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>so my make up looked very scaly and patchy.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the night one, but since it was so much cheaper here I decided to order it and try it also.</li>
            <li>Smooths on very nice and need use only a little bit.  </li>
            <li>scent is little strong but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out with acne, like most other moisturizer do.  </li>
            <li>, as a self-recognized product junkie as I am, I replaced this day moisturizer for another brand and my older broke out face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used creams much more expensive than this (Creme de la Mer) and think that Derma-e Hyauronic Acid Day Cream is even better.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>However, I found a product I like a little better for now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how much I like this.  </li>
            <li>From the moment this cr&amp;egrave;me goes on the skin feels &#x60;different&#x27; - fresh, non-saggy, plumped up.</li>
            <li>I recommend their Hyaluronic eye cream as well as their new Hyaluronic face wash and their Hyaluronic moisturizing</li>
            <li>I have medication induced Sjrogrens and I live in Phoenix, so I need all the hydration I can get.</li>
            <li>This is my new day time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>definitely keeps your skin hydrated, and after a few days my skin felt nice</li>
            <li>However, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I never have an issue when using Derma E products.</li>
            <li>My face feels very soft and moisturized when I use this product.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to apply a small amount after cleansing while your skin is still damp.</li>
            <li>of a professional product cannot be beat!  </li>
            <li>I usually use Skyn Iceland products which I love</li>
            <li>this is the way to go as well as all natural ingredients!  </li>
            <li>It even makes the fine lines less noticeable and evens out my complextion.  </li>
            <li>Taking HA internally also helps your skin and really helps me sleep well at night for some reason and helps with joint pain and stiffness.  </li>
            <li>even when they are quite old.</li>
            <li>Derma E is a line of natural skin care products that visibly change your appearance in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li>Derma E is a line of natural skin care products that visibly change your appearance in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a cheaper natural product.</li>
            <li>I exfoliate religiously which really helps this absorb.  </li>
            <li>So far I probably went through about 15 jars.</li>
            <li>Then I found this product at the natural grocery and thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li>Researchers have finally concluded that they have unusually high levels of hyaluronic acid in their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may switch back and forth between new product and this one.</li>
            <li>The lines seem to dissapear from my forehead and my laugh lines are a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture for my skin, it&#x27;s supple and slightly dewy</li>
            <li>That is because HA, a key component of collagen, is the body&#x27;s natural \\&quot;space-filling\\&quot; molecule... ~Bill</li>
            <li>These amazing discoveries seem to take years and years to filter down through our society and the fact that the product works so well, should mean everyone in the skin care industry is talking about it.</li>
            <li>My skin is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li>This cream is normal to dry, but it&#x27;s just not working for me.  </li>
            <li>If you have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>, her skin was dry like it normally is.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry facial skin, and live in a dry part of the country.  </li>

            <li> I love everything about this product and the seller is wonderful about getting it out to you right away...</li>
            <li> Beautiful, light cream that hydrates better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Products I&#x27;ve tried and loved:     Microdermabrasion Scrub - Salon Quality exfoliation right in your own home!  </li>
            <li> And if I have to apply more - then it is not cost effective.  </li>
            <li> Very fine product.</li>
            <li> Not greasy but very light.</li>
            <li> along with top lid..</li>
            <li> which is what healthy skin is supposed to look like.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are what I love the most.</li>
            <li> I also use one of their night creams, and can&#x27;t wait to try more Derma e&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> anyway, I use it in my hands and is ok</li>
            <li> and I love it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It would be an even better product without the scent.</li>
            <li> Their whole line of products are great.  </li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels and looks after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I returned it immediately the fragrance was overwhelming and caused allergic reaction</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day and love it</li>
            <li> This cream seems to keep my complexion more moist, has no odor, and isn&#x27;t oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> I love Derma E products.</li>
            <li> This is a great price and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Love derma-e.  </li>
            <li> L love it.</li>
            <li> Another Derma E product I love.</li>
            <li> and I just love everything about it.</li>
            <li> This product does more than hydrate- it brightens your skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> It just lays there on top.</li>
            <li> Love It .</li>
            <li> I have fussy skin, and it is gentle and smells really great (not too strong or perfumy)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve been the most happy with thus far.</li>
            <li> Light but penetrating non-greasy moisturizer works perfectly for daily use alone or under make-up.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and light, does a great job and lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and my skin looks a thousand times better than it did before.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for my very sensitive and very allergic skin.</li>

            <li> Very nice under makeup and skin stays soft and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> The taste becomes very mild after about two weeks.</li>
            <li> The taste becomes very mild after about two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s longlasting and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make me break out or irritate my sensitive skin and nicely moisturizes!</li>
            <li> Well, since it seems to plump up the skin a bit in a noticeable way, you will want to use this cream in areas where you want to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I like the day creme much better than the night creme; it is lighter and is absorbed very quickly with no greasy-feeling residue.</li>
            <li> i liked their hydrating day creme so much that i ordered one from amazon on nov 23rd and is delivered on</li>
            <li> and E are antioxidants which protect from free radicals which are harmful to the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently this \\&quot;HA\\&quot; is also now available as a dietary supplement.</li>

            <li> I actually have grown rather fond of the taste of Aloe Vera after seeing great results.</li>
            <li> Glides on, is absorbed and doesn&#x27;t lay on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> Might as well put water on face runny too light does not moisturizer feels like nothing on skin threw out</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and dewy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and moisturizing but it doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy.  </li>
            <li> Light, greaseless works well under makeup</li>
            <li> bought derma e cleanser and overnight peel from amazon and doesnt have any complaints and loved them so far..</li>
            <li> First, I love the ingredients.</li>
            <li> The people in Japan who eat a sticky gelatinous root vegetable instead of rice have smooth skin, flexible joints and full heads of hair</li>
            <li> While many so-called moisturizing cr&amp;egrave;mes (at a much higher price) promise to plump skin and diminish wrinkles, Hyaluraonic Acid Day</li>
            <li> Great for dry aging skin.</li>
            <li> Skin stays soft all day and it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> this does not irritate my skin and feels cool when applied to skin.</li>
            <li> well however it is twice the price and half as much, so if this cream works for you it is the best for the price.</li>
            <li> , I took a second look in the mirror and my skin was literally \\&quot;plumper\\&quot; as if it was more hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li> Derma-e makes a cream that is absorbed easily, even in the hot and humid summer time.  </li>
            <li> Results are normal:) I think my skin stays neutral, if its helps...</li>
            <li> Derma e hyaluronic acid day creme is the first moisturizer I have found that works for me!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this creme at Natural Grocers but decided to leave a review because I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this for my forehead, my neck and my laugh lines.  </li>
            <li> My only fault with it is that it did not moisturize my skin effectively.  </li>
            <li> My favorite so far of all the Derma e moisturizers that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Returned this item, vendor kind to take back.  </li>
            <li> I paid $24 for it there, but I thought if it works it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and no signal of age on my face so far!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure that this product is also going to be new to her.</li>
            <li> In the years of youth the human body abundantly produces a special water-gelling molecule called HA that is largely responsible for producing these visible signs of youthfulness.</li>
            <li> I am purchasing some of this right away</li>
            <li> Took years of trial (and much error) to find the perfect, light facial cream for everyday, under-makeup wear.  </li>
            <li> normally use this cream in combination with the DMAE Source Eternal serum (at nights) and my skin become really smooth and</li>
            <li> Besides, it is so pleasant to apply -- is is light and has a magnificently subtle scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked awesome, and I&#x27;ve only used it a few days.  </li>
            <li> I paid much higher prices and didn&#x27;t get the results like I have with this.</li>
            <li> I had to to apply more an hour later, and that was with using in conjunction with the hydrating serum.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Dermae night and day products for several years and love them both.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My friend is happy with it, unfortunately it was too strong</li>
            <li> Fortunately Derma-E is producing wonderful antiaging products that have dramatic results in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> perhaps i would be able to tell you how i liked this product if it had been sent to me, i attempted to order it from DIRECT SUPER CENTER out of Arizona, but they sent me a different type of derma e cream, so i just kept it not wanting the hassle of a return</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic, and I thought the fragrance was light, although a little more \\&quot;fruitier\\&quot; than I prefer.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change as far as the wrinkles, but I like the texture and smell of the cream</li>
            <li> The company is pretty straight forward in telling you what exactly you&#x27;re getting.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a powerful moisturizer, and this is a very economical way to buy it, especially at subscribe &amp; save discounted prices.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I was amazed how well it moisturized my very oily skin without make it greasy.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t oily.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I don&#x27;t really feel moisturized after using this.  </li>
            <li> I already use it and really like it.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive</li>
            <li> My skin seemed to react very well to this product.</li>
            <li> Really, my skin seems smoother and plumper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> I have an allergic reaction of swelling which is what I&#x27;m really trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> I really notice when I miss a day or forget to bring it on trips and have to use something else.</li>
            <li> I found it very drying and wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> so my make up looked very scaly and patchy.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the night one, but since it was so much cheaper here I decided to order it and try it also.</li>
            <li> Smooths on very nice and need use only a little bit.  </li>
            <li> scent is little strong but dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out with acne, like most other moisturizer do.  </li>
            <li> , as a self-recognized product junkie as I am, I replaced this day moisturizer for another brand and my older broke out face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used creams much more expensive than this (Creme de la Mer) and think that Derma-e Hyauronic Acid Day Cream is even better.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> However, I found a product I like a little better for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how much I like this.  </li>
            <li> From the moment this cr&amp;egrave;me goes on the skin feels &#x60;different&#x27; - fresh, non-saggy, plumped up.</li>
            <li> I recommend their Hyaluronic eye cream as well as their new Hyaluronic face wash and their Hyaluronic moisturizing</li>
            <li> I have medication induced Sjrogrens and I live in Phoenix, so I need all the hydration I can get.</li>
            <li> This is my new day time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> definitely keeps your skin hydrated, and after a few days my skin felt nice</li>
            <li> However, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I never have an issue when using Derma E products.</li>
            <li> My face feels very soft and moisturized when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to apply a small amount after cleansing while your skin is still damp.</li>
            <li> of a professional product cannot be beat!  </li>
            <li> I usually use Skyn Iceland products which I love</li>
            <li> this is the way to go as well as all natural ingredients!  </li>
            <li> It even makes the fine lines less noticeable and evens out my complextion.  </li>
            <li> Taking HA internally also helps your skin and really helps me sleep well at night for some reason and helps with joint pain and stiffness.  </li>
            <li> even when they are quite old.</li>
            <li> Derma E is a line of natural skin care products that visibly change your appearance in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> Derma E is a line of natural skin care products that visibly change your appearance in a matter of weeks.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a cheaper natural product.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate religiously which really helps this absorb.  </li>
            <li> So far I probably went through about 15 jars.</li>
            <li> Then I found this product at the natural grocery and thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> Researchers have finally concluded that they have unusually high levels of hyaluronic acid in their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may switch back and forth between new product and this one.</li>
            <li> The lines seem to dissapear from my forehead and my laugh lines are a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture for my skin, it&#x27;s supple and slightly dewy</li>
            <li> That is because HA, a key component of collagen, is the body&#x27;s natural \\&quot;space-filling\\&quot; molecule... ~Bill</li>
            <li> These amazing discoveries seem to take years and years to filter down through our society and the fact that the product works so well, should mean everyone in the skin care industry is talking about it.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal to dry.  </li>
            <li> This cream is normal to dry, but it&#x27;s just not working for me.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> , her skin was dry like it normally is.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry facial skin, and live in a dry part of the country.  </li>
            <li> he&#x27;s sensitive to fragrance and other additives that makes him break out</li>
            <li> super expensive creams that don&#x27;t do nearly 1/4 of what this cream does for my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and no matter how hard I try to deny it, my skin is starting to show the first hints of aging.  </li>
            <li> was using a sample of the Derma E Hyaluronic cream and had really never heard of hyaluronic acid, although I had heard of a village in Japan where people live for an especially long time.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy but still hydrates well, is unscented and cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> She could not apply enough to satisfy my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> , then i attempted to once again order the correct cream and direct super center struck again and sent me the wrong product again, this time a pimple cream...</li>
            <li> I was of course skeptical that this would do anything other than moisturize my skin, but it does much more.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I can only use a very small amount of this Derma E at a time because I&#x27;ll use it up too fast.</li>
            <li> Aloe and Jojoba Oil neutralize the skin, Green Tea calms, Hylauronic acid moisturizes and plumps, witch hazel is a natural astringent and promotes healing and vitamin A</li>
            <li> The cr&amp;egrave;me lasts all day long without the need for re-application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as Derma e keeps producing it.</li>
            <li> I am using derma e along with other products and in only 3 weeks I have seen a turn around in my complexion.  </li>
            <li> Derma e has made a life long user out of me!  </li>
            <li> The month before she said my skin was so dry that it just soaked up the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> In fact tends to make my skin feel dry, hence it is drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and Rosacea</li>
            <li> My dry skin feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> I can use it in dry winter and humid summer, and it works well in both seasons.  </li>
            <li> I know that her skin is extremely dry.</li>
            <li> After a single  use, my friends remarked on how my skin was glowing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels dry when purchasing this from Amazon!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and works well on both the dry areas and the oily T-Zone (don&#x27;t know how they do that!).  </li>
            <li> my skin is really not that dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and largish pores around my nose and lines under my eyes - both problems were erased by this cream.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY thing missing from this product is that it does not have sun protection.</li>
            <li> Then a few days later I remembered that the difference was I started using this Derma E hydrating cream.  </li>
            <li> About a week later, an article about hyaluronic acid appeared (as articles often do when looking for answers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma-E has a few products that are ahead of their time.</li>
            <li> I hate the fragrance, but this product makes my skin feel so soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of expensive creams and feel that this one is right on par with them.</li>
            <li> skin has been VERY dry because of the acne products I&#x27;ve been using and this has been my skin&#x27;s savior!</li>
            <li> It was a lot less dry and had a smoothing effect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s NOT greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> other in gredients in this cr&amp;egrave;me are Water (Aqua),</li>
            <li> do not order from them be very careful</li>
            <li> It actually was worse than my regular cremes.</li>
            <li> Your skin will take on a smoother appearance and you might also find yourself hunting down the Pycnogenol and Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying some of their other products!</li>
            <li> Only problem I had with it was it was a little thick for a day cream for me.</li>
            <li> I tryed for the reviews that I sow and really my rosacea begun to acting up in a bad manner...</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight, but I don&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;aahhhh&amp;#34; feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She said that it helped a little, but after a couple of hrs.</li>
            <li> This is truly a miracle because nothing else has been helping me and the whole aging thing was really depressing me.  </li>
            <li> After a few days using it my skin is brighter, and clearer.</li>
            <li> Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Hamamelis Virginiana</li>
            <li> that is when I noticed some dramatic aging - started again recently).  </li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> looks fake and not the actual derma e cream...</li>
            <li> This is the solution that is put on the skin before facials in a salon, usually followed by some form of penetration enhancement.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed it clears the skin when a small pimple or blemish is in sight.  </li>
            <li> Left a matte finish to my skin, wasn&#x27;t crazy about that.</li>
            <li> After  a while the creme loses moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so tired of putting on my makeup and having tons of clumps of dried skin coming through it</li>
            <li> There are  actually 2 thin lids (?)</li>
            <li> Not experienced any benefits.</li>
            <li> I get that expensive lotions and cosmetics in very small but expensive containers is the norm</li>
            <li> I also take hyaluronic acid tablets (I had stopped for awhile because they can be expensive and</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re a bit expensive</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this brand is too aggressive for my skin.</li>
            <li> IT ARRIVED DAMAGED, AND WAS DISAPPOINTED BY ITS PERFORMANCE</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Cream doesnt melt in and my skin broke out very badly and it burnt ...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not sure. Bought it for my son who lives in another state. He likes it.</li>
            <li> Seems to make my skin smoother and clearer, I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is nice stuff. A little goes a long way and it&#x27;s NOT greasy. Skin stays soft all day and it has a nice scent. Second time I&#x27;ve ordered and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Pro: Good for T-zone as it dries matte&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I don&#x27;t really feel moisturized after using this.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight, but I don&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;aahhhh&amp;#34; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not repurchase, but I haven&#x27;t thrown it away.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and was amazed by how well it worked immediately!  I have very dry skin and largish pores around my nose and lines under my eyes - both problems were erased by this cream.  My face was glowing and beautiful like I had lost 10 years of aging.  This is truly a miracle because nothing else has been helping me and the whole aging thing was really depressing me.  My boyfriend couldn&#x27;t get over how lovely I looked and asked me: \\&quot;what did you do?!  You look so beautiful!\\&quot;  I am purchasing some of this right away and maybe the night cream, too.  I also take hyaluronic acid tablets (I had stopped for awhile because they can be expensive and that is when I noticed some dramatic aging - started again recently).  Taking HA internally also helps your skin and really helps me sleep well at night for some reason and helps with joint pain and stiffness.  It is a wonderous element that I am happy to re-discover!</li>
            <li> I like this cream. I have fussy skin, and it is gentle and smells really great (not too strong or perfumy)</li>
            <li> My friend is happy with it, unfortunately it was too strong and I got spot where 24 hour lift H cream works reall well however it is twice the price and half as much, so if this cream works for you it is the best for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered samples from derma e 3 weeks ago.. i liked their hydrating day creme so much that i ordered one from amazon on nov 23rd and is delivered on dec 2.&lt;br /&gt;However when i opened the package , it looked as if bottle is opened and repacked..  There are  actually 2 thin lids (?) along with top lid.. i anyhow applied the cream and that didnt feel like the sample i received from derma e at ALL..&lt;br /&gt;Cream doesnt melt in and my skin broke out very badly and it burnt ... i stopped using it and didnt apply again.&lt;br /&gt;This looks fake and not the actual derma e cream...&lt;br /&gt;I bought derma e cleanser and overnight peel from amazon and doesnt have any complaints and loved them so far..&lt;br /&gt;Amazon team please look into it..</li>
            <li> I purchased this creme at Natural Grocers but decided to leave a review because I love it. First, I love the ingredients. Aloe and Jojoba Oil neutralize the skin, Green Tea calms, Hylauronic acid moisturizes and plumps, witch hazel is a natural astringent and promotes healing and vitamin A and E are antioxidants which protect from free radicals which are harmful to the skin. The ONLY thing missing from this product is that it does not have sun protection. It would&#x27;ve been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been VERY dry because of the acne products I&#x27;ve been using and this has been my skin&#x27;s savior! It doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It&#x27;s just the right amount of moisture for my skin, it&#x27;s supple and slightly dewy which is what healthy skin is supposed to look like. The ingredients are what I love the most. Make sure to apply a small amount after cleansing while your skin is still damp. Thank you derma e.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. I already use it and really like it. I have used a lot of expensive creams and feel that this one is right on par with them.</li>
            <li> I have two brands of day creme that I use-rotating each.  This combined with a daily capsule of Hyaluronic Acid supplements has provided noticeable results on my skin-especially baggy eyes.  I do recommend this creme.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.  After using this hydrating cream I went for my monthly facial.  The month before she said my skin was so dry that it just soaked up the moisturizer.  She could not apply enough to satisfy my dry skin.  The next appointment she asked what I&#x27;ve been using because my skin was so hydrated such a difference from my last visit.  I said nothing that I could think of.  Then a few days later I remembered that the difference was I started using this Derma E hydrating cream.  I&#x27;m a believer and will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Great for dry aging skin. Not greasy at all. Very nice under makeup and skin stays soft and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> In the years of youth the human body abundantly produces a special water-gelling molecule called HA that is largely responsible for producing these visible signs of youthfulness. That is because HA, a key component of collagen, is the body&#x27;s natural \\&quot;space-filling\\&quot; molecule... ~Bill Sardi, researcher and author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using a sample of the Derma E Hyaluronic cream and had really never heard of hyaluronic acid, although I had heard of a village in Japan where people live for an especially long time. So, I was using this cream on a daily basis and after about a week, I took a second look in the mirror and my skin was literally \\&quot;plumper\\&quot; as if it was more hydrated and healthy. About a week later, an article about hyaluronic acid appeared (as articles often do when looking for answers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derma-E has a few products that are ahead of their time. My esthetician had not even heard of pycnogenol and I&#x27;m pretty sure that this product is also going to be new to her. These amazing discoveries seem to take years and years to filter down through our society and the fact that the product works so well, should mean everyone in the skin care industry is talking about it. Fortunately Derma-E is producing wonderful antiaging products that have dramatic results in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently this \\&quot;HA\\&quot; is also now available as a dietary supplement. The people in Japan who eat a sticky gelatinous root vegetable instead of rice have smooth skin, flexible joints and full heads of hair even when they are quite old. Researchers have finally concluded that they have unusually high levels of hyaluronic acid in their bodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what will this cream do for you? Well, since it seems to plump up the skin a bit in a noticeable way, you will want to use this cream in areas where you want to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Your skin will take on a smoother appearance and you might also find yourself hunting down the Pycnogenol and Hyaluronic Acid Eye Cr&amp;egrave;me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has taken me years to finally find products that promise and deliver and Derma E is a line of natural skin care products that visibly change your appearance in a matter of weeks.

            <li> The first time I used this product, I was amazed how well it moisturized my very oily skin without make it greasy.Then, when my sudden break outs disappeared...I was delighted!&lt;br /&gt;I normally use this cream in combination with the DMAE Source Eternal serum (at nights) and my skin become really smooth and zits-free.&lt;br /&gt;Once, as a self-recognized product junkie as I am, I replaced this day moisturizer for another brand and my older broke out face came back....that was the moment when I realized that this is an excellent product for my skin (and maybe others on the greasy side).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a devotee of this product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am definitely impressed with Derma e&#x27;s products. After a few days using it my skin is brighter, and clearer. I reach the end of the day without the T-oiliness I used to have, and no pacthes of dryness either. It also holds perfectly any make-up. Besides, it is so pleasant to apply -- is is light and has a magnificently subtle scent. I also use one of their night creams, and can&#x27;t wait to try more Derma e&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Light but penetrating non-greasy moisturizer works perfectly for daily use alone or under make-up.  I only wish it came with a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This creme is so wonderful.  Glides on, is absorbed and doesn&#x27;t lay on top of the skin. The price is wonderful as well.  I paid much higher prices and didn&#x27;t get the results like I have with this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the formula in stores! My skin feels dry when purchasing this from Amazon! It&#x27;s different than the formula purchased at ulta</li>
            <li> I tryed for the reviews that I sow and really my rosacea begun to acting up in a bad manner... anyway, I use it in my hands and is ok</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very inexpensive</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with the Hydrating Serum, this is a great combo. After using for two weeks I&#x27;m noticing that my skin looks fresher and younger.</li>
            <li> Might as well put water on face runny too light does not moisturizer feels like nothing on skin threw out</li>
            <li> My skin seemed to react very well to this product. It was a lot less dry and had a smoothing effect on wrinkles. I will continue using this product</li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars because of the fragrance...too floral for me but it works great and I love it on my skin.</li>
            <li> This daycream is terrific. It leaves your skin smooth and healthy looking. I use this during the day and the night cream at night and I couldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Had to return. Didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Left a matte finish to my skin, wasn&#x27;t crazy about that.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I was of course skeptical that this would do anything other than moisturize my skin, but it does much more.  I use this for my forehead, my neck and my laugh lines.  The lines seem to dissapear from my forehead and my laugh lines are a lot less noticeable. It softens the depth of my neck lines and tightens the skin. Really, my skin seems smoother and plumper.  Its inexpensive and it works.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed Sr. skin therapist in Va.  The ingredients in this product are great.  It&#x27;s organic, and I thought the fragrance was light, although a little more \\&quot;fruitier\\&quot; than I prefer.  The price for 2oz. of a professional product cannot be beat!  My only fault with it is that it did not moisturize my skin effectively.  I had to to apply more an hour later, and that was with using in conjunction with the hydrating serum.  My skin is normal to dry.  This cream is normal to dry, but it&#x27;s just not working for me.  And if I have to apply more - then it is not cost effective.  I will have to return this one and get samples for products at the mall.</li>
            <li> Derma e products are great and I noticed improvement in skin tone and smoothness after 4 weeks! I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is little strong but dissipates quickly. It would be an even better product without the scent.</li>
            <li> Not experienced any benefits. In fact tends to make my skin feel dry, hence it is drying to the skin. This is supposed to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li> If you have normal to dry skin. Nice fresh smell.  I am using this cream under the makeup. Results are normal:) I think my skin stays neutral, if its helps...</li>
            <li> I have used the Dermae night and day products for several years and love them both. The only prob&lt;br /&gt;Em with the day cream is you have to use a sun protection product over it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product for its moistuizing abilities.  However, I have very sensitive skin and if I get it too close to my eyes I have an allergic reaction of swelling which is what I&#x27;m really trying to avoid.</li>
            <li> I usually use Skyn Iceland products which I love but they&#x27;re a bit expensive and I was looking for a cheaper natural product. This is great. I have dry skin and Rosacea this does not irritate my skin and feels cool when applied to skin.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this creme it doesn&#x27;t make him break out,  he&#x27;s sensitive to fragrance and other additives that makes him break out so I have to search and use a lot of face creme before sticking with this one.  Their whole line of products are great.  I have it on subscription so we don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Smooths on very nice and need use only a little bit.  Love the way my skin feels and looks after using this product.  My dry skin feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this product and the seller is wonderful about getting it out to you right away... And the price is great.</li>
            <li> I returned it immediately the fragrance was overwhelming and caused allergic reaction</li>
            <li> After  a while the creme loses moisture.</li>
            <li> definitely keeps your skin hydrated, and after a few days my skin felt nice, i would definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> While many so-called moisturizing cr&amp;egrave;mes (at a much higher price) promise to plump skin and diminish wrinkles, Hyaluraonic Acid Day Cr&amp;egrave;me does just that. This is the solution that is put on the skin before facials in a salon, usually followed by some form of penetration enhancement. From the moment this cr&amp;egrave;me goes on the skin feels &#x60;different&#x27; - fresh, non-saggy, plumped up. The cr&amp;egrave;me lasts all day long without the need for re-application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other in gredients in this cr&amp;egrave;me are Water (Aqua), Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Extract, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Ceteareth 20, Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Sodium Hyaluronate (Hyaluronic Acid; Actimoist Bio-2), Calcium Ascorbate (Ester-C), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Polysorbate, Dimethicone, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl. The company is pretty straight forward in telling you what exactly you&#x27;re getting.  And with daily uses it works to freshen aging skin. Very fine product. Grady Harp, July 13</li>
            <li> Dr. oz recommended hyaluranic acid to combat skin distress &amp; aging--so I bought this.  I say with confidence, this is the last day creme I&#x27;ll ever  buy.  Took years of trial (and much error) to find the perfect, light facial cream for everyday, under-makeup wear.  What a gem Derma e day cr&amp;egrave;me is.</li>
            <li> Derma-e makes a cream that is absorbed easily, even in the hot and humid summer time.  It&#x27;s non-greasy, and a little goes a long way.  It doesn&#x27;t clog pores and works well on both the dry areas and the oily T-Zone (don&#x27;t know how they do that!).  I can use it in dry winter and humid summer, and it works well in both seasons.  I&#x27;ve used creams much more expensive than this (Creme de la Mer) and think that Derma-e Hyauronic Acid Day Cream is even better.  My skin is smooth and dewy.  Love it.  The smell is wonderful too.</li>
            <li> Mi skin loves this product. My skin feels smooth and no signal of age on my face so far!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Love how it feels, and the fragrance is wonderful!  However, it&#x27;s too expensive.  A tiny jar....over $20.00.  I get that expensive lotions and cosmetics in very small but expensive containers is the norm now,,,but it shouldn&#x27;t be. I feel like I can only use a very small amount of this Derma E at a time because I&#x27;ll use it up too fast. This is how these industries treat women😕</li>
            <li> this product wasn&#x27;t secured properly and the cream was all over the box when it arrived. not to mention it didnt even have the cover between the lid and the actual cream which made me think this was used already because all dermaE products come with a protective cover between the lid and the product. will not order from here again</li>
            <li> I use this every day and love it</li>
            <li> perhaps i would be able to tell you how i liked this product if it had been sent to me, i attempted to order it from DIRECT SUPER CENTER out of Arizona, but they sent me a different type of derma e cream, so i just kept it not wanting the hassle of a return, then i attempted to once again order the correct cream and direct super center struck again and sent me the wrong product again, this time a pimple cream...do not order from them be very careful</li>
            <li> Product provides great moisture. I recommend using this product along with the cleanser, toner and night cream moisturizer for maximum benefits.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to keep my complexion more moist, has no odor, and isn&#x27;t oily or greasy. I like it and intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far of all the Derma e moisturizers that I have tried. It is smooth and light, does a great job and lasts a reasonable amount of time. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a moisturizer that&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy but still hydrates well, is unscented and cruelty free.  This product fits the bill to a T.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as Derma e keeps producing it.</li>
            <li> I love Derma E products. My skin is very sensitive and I never have an issue when using Derma E products. And they are inexpensive and work great!</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  I have already gone through one jar of the daytime cream and am still working through the nighttime cream.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change as far as the wrinkles, but I like the texture and smell of the cream and I believe that all women should wear cream of some kind each day.  I&#x27;m gong to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and all Derma e products!  This is a great price and fast shipping.  I recommend their Hyaluronic eye cream as well as their new Hyaluronic face wash and their Hyaluronic moisturizing face mist!  If you have oily skin and want moisture without oil this is the way to go as well as all natural ingredients!  I&#x27;m a fan of this product for life!</li>
            <li> I love this product the price is great and I like the way it smell. It goes on smooth and my skin looks a thousand times better than it did before. I am using derma e along with other products and in only 3 weeks I have seen a turn around in my complexion.  Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> This creme left a residue on my face after use. It actually was worse than my regular cremes. I gave it to my mother b/c I know that her skin is extremely dry. After reading all the great reviews, I thought that it should surely help her b/c my skin is really not that dry. She said that it helped a little, but after a couple of hrs., her skin was dry like it normally is. I gave it one star b/c the smell was pleasant.</li>
            <li> My face feels very soft and moisturized when I use this product.  I really notice when I miss a day or forget to bring it on trips and have to use something else.</li>
            <li> Very good for you skin!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a powerful moisturizer, and this is a very economical way to buy it, especially at subscribe &amp; save discounted prices. I like the day creme much better than the night creme; it is lighter and is absorbed very quickly with no greasy-feeling residue.</li>
            <li> This day creme is great, love the fragrance and the fact it has NO parabens!!!!  I highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> Product never arrived.they give a refund,but I want the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how much I like this.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and been unimpressed.  This is a good product, worth the money.  I&#x27;m happy with the results, and I will order more.</li>
            <li> Definitely hydrates.  Love derma-e.  I switched from the derma-e Hydrating creams to the derma-e firming creams a while back, but noticed my skin was drier.  So I immediately switched back.  I exfoliate religiously which really helps this absorb.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I have medication induced Sjrogrens and I live in Phoenix, so I need all the hydration I can get.</li>
            <li> This product works great for my combination skin.  It keeps it evenly hydrated and I&#x27;ve noticed it clears the skin when a small pimple or blemish is in sight.  When it finishes on me, I am definately purchasing another one.  This is my new day time moisturizer. Bye Bye super expensive creams that don&#x27;t do nearly 1/4 of what this cream does for my skin!</li>
            <li> Returned this item, vendor kind to take back.  I found it very drying and wouldn&#x27;t buy again. It&#x27;s up to you!</li>
            <li> L love it. Not greasy but very light.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It&#x27;s smooth and moisturizing but it doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy.  I also like that the product contains hyaluronic acid for preventing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Takes years off your face with an added smoothness to the skin.</li>
            <li> Another Derma E product I love. It leaves your skin glowing and evens out imperfections. I use it daily, and even under makeup. It also doesn&#x27;t make me break out or irritate my sensitive skin and nicely moisturizes!</li>
            <li> Feels great on your face - will be ordering more for sure!</li>
            <li> This product is very nice and is not greasy. It&#x27;s longlasting and spreads easily.</li>
            <li> I find this cream to be a perfect weight and a perfect price. I wear it at night and day and even put it around my eyes. So far I probably went through about 15 jars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (and the night cream) for several years now and I just love everything about it.</li>
            <li> When I was using this product I liked it. However, I found a product I like a little better for now. I may switch back and forth between new product and this one. Only problem I had with it was it was a little thick for a day cream for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried anything and everything to find something that works.  I have extremely dry facial skin, and live in a dry part of the country.  I drink tons of water also, but nothing helped.  Then I found this product at the natural grocery and thought I&#x27;d try it.  I paid $24 for it there, but I thought if it works it would be worth it.  I&#x27;ve been so tired of putting on my makeup and having tons of clumps of dried skin coming through it so my make up looked very scaly and patchy.  This stuff has worked awesome, and I&#x27;ve only used it a few days.  I use it twice a day.  I haven&#x27;t tried the night one, but since it was so much cheaper here I decided to order it and try it also.</li>
            <li> This product does more than hydrate- it brightens your skin. After a single  use, my friends remarked on how my skin was glowing. It&#x27;s not *the* best moisturizer out there (I&#x27;m still searching for it!) but it&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve been the most happy with thus far.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, light cream that hydrates better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Found it when I lived in Arizona and my skin was parched.</li>
            <li> Light, greaseless works well under makeup</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BEEN USING FOR YEARS ESSENTIAL TO PLUMO YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this brand is too aggressive for my skin. I&#x27;ve tried this product and another one, but both times I break out. I find the products to be well made, despite the rash, and I would keep buying if I could.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin soft and smooth.  I am not an expert, but people tell me my skin looks great.  I will continue to purchase derma e.</li>
            <li> All we use, it keeps our faces hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and no matter how hard I try to deny it, my skin is starting to show the first hints of aging.  Derma e hyaluronic acid day creme is the first moisturizer I have found that works for me!  It doesn&#x27;t make my face break out with acne, like most other moisturizer do.  In fact, it controls my acne.  I ordered this at the last minute and went for about a week without it.  During that time, I started to break out.  It makes my skin so soft, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t oily.  It even makes the fine lines less noticeable and evens out my complextion.  Derma e has made a life long user out of me!  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying some of their other products!</li>
            <li> I hate the fragrance, but this product makes my skin feel so soft and comfortable. It would be nice if it had an SPF</li>
            <li> Excellent for my very sensitive and very allergic skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff does NOT absorb into my skin. It just lays there on top. Had to wipe it off to put my make up on.</li>
            <li> Really Good !!!! Love It .</li>
            <li> Good price. Delivered promptly</li>
            <li> IT ARRIVED DAMAGED, AND WAS DISAPPOINTED BY ITS PERFORMANCE</li>
    </ol>
