            <li> this product used to make my eyes stand out and help the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> This cream does subtly help to brighten under my eyes, and it last all day.</li>
            <li> So my main question/feeling is the product that I received is a fake...</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Despite the package being sealed as it usually is.  </li>
            <li> Over the past 20 days I can already see improvement in my undereye area.</li>
            <li> Which is not good!  </li>
            <li> This product was a disappointment.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize I liked this product as much as I do until I didn&#x27;t have it for a while.  Even though it is not a miracle cream given my sun exposure and age, it does help the appearance.  I use it every morning.</li>
            <li> I really like SkinMedica.  Their products are absorbed into the skin so quickly.  So many other products just lay on top of the skin and are greasy.  This was 1/2 the price of what I paid at a MedSpa.  Plus free shipping and No Tax.  What a deal!</li>
            <li> Great love this.  Removes all traces of makeup and leaves skin smooth not dry</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer that gives noticeable smoothness to the eye area.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it was the better online price than my doctor, but the pump sticks &amp; cosmetic plastic bottom piece soon came off.  Despite the package being sealed as it usually is.  I assume the product itself is of same quality as my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Creamy, goes on smooth for instant results.  Over the past 20 days I can already see improvement in my undereye area.</li>
            <li> Recieved a sample at my Dr&#x27;s office.Went back the next week and bought the full size along with the facial cleanser (I&#x27;m a cheapskate, so this says a lot). I was getting fine lines on my eyelids and between the eyes and they are virtually gone now. I have very sensitive skin and both of these products have been great! No breakouts, no itching. My skin glows.  Love it!</li>
            <li> this product used to make my eyes stand out and help the dark circles.  It does nothing now. Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good price, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> . Really reduces any  fine lines around your eyes and brightens the area. I love it !  It easily absorbs into your skin without any residue. Leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before from my dermatologist and loved it.  However, when I ordered it online from Amazon, when applying the product on my skin I felt a burning sensation.  Which is not good!  So my main question/feeling is the product that I received is a fake...</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream that I&#x27;ve used and seen actual results. Great product!</li>
            <li> I got the sample of this and it is amazing!! Dark circles have definitely lightened. Get this product it actually works</li>
            <li> The pump didn&#x27;t work.  The bottle half empty.</li>
            <li> This is good in my eye area. Not sticky, no irritation. Doesn&#x27;t make it perfect but it helps.</li>
            <li> This cream does subtly help to brighten under my eyes, and it last all day. However, it does tend to cake when I add concealer and powder. Perhaps I need to use a thinner layer of the cream?</li>
            <li> Love this product for my eyes. If I miss even a day, I start seeing lines under my eye.</li>
            <li> Works great. Works great. Works great&lt;br /&gt;For woman age 48 . Great product to use for under eye . Gets rid of lines tempory . I&#x27;m 48 I wear every morning .</li>
            <li> I like this creme light, but soaks in.</li>
            <li> This product was a disappointment. It is not emollient at all and I see no difference after 4 weeks of use.</li>
