            <li> I get more compliments from women on this aroma than any other aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend it...women love it!</li>
            <li> Quality product, good price, great service.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the best aftershave I&#x27;ve been able to find. Stings a bit, but then leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> This is Good stuff; not your grandfathers smelly aftershave. Light fresh fragrance, that is soothing to the face. Works well with electrical shaver.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to get this off Amazon since my local CVS and even CVS.com was sold out of this product. It always works the best for me over any other aftershave in minimizing razor burn and bumps.</li>
            <li> Strong scent. Pretty clean smelling. Has that fake chemical smell which I love.</li>
            <li> I really like this Adidas aftershave  It has a pleasing clean scent which lasts a good long time. It compliments my favorite men&#x27;s cologne well. Too bad I have to now resort to ordering it online. I used to be able to buy it at CVS, Rite Aid or even at the supermarket. But it just disappeared from the shelves.</li>
            <li> I hope there is more left when I run out of the bottles I purchased.  I can&#x27;t find this on the shelf anywhere now.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase. It has a very manly fragrance. I would recommend this product. I need aftershave, as shaving is very hard on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;gets wife off back.  pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best aftershave for under $10.00! It smells really good and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skins afterward.  It actually moisturizes your face for a long period of time which is a good thing! Recommended it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Best smelling aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Out of the under $10 aftershaves that are common on shelves, Dynamic pulse is one of my least liked.  That said, its not a bad after shave and contains conditioners and other good stuff.  I just don&#x27;t go for that chemical sport smell.  If I wanted something fresh I&#x27;d go Aqua Velva or something tingly like Proraso aftershave.</li>
            <li> Great deal, great product, all the way from Europe in  just a few days time. Thanks, i will ordere from you again and recommend you to other buyers.</li>
            <li> As a user of many aftershaves (at drugstores) I gotta say I like this stuff. I have to visit a few different stores to smell all the flavors but this one I really enjoy. It has menthol and rivals my proraso aftershave which is more than double the price. I found a winner. There&#x27;s no description of the different scents so I suggest you visit a few stores and smell them out. I&#x27;m trying to find the fresh impact (freshest). The Victory league is supposed to be very \\&quot;intense\\&quot; so I assume that means more cologne like. Maybe more lingering?&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a trick. drop some dpg (dipropolene glycol) in the bottle, 10 -30 drops. shake rigorously. shake before each use. aftershave lingers a bit more. dpg is safe for use on skin and found in everyday moisturizers and scented products.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Wal-Mart for $4.56, along with some Gillette G3 aftershave for the same price, and I gotta say, it&#x27;s pretty good. It just doesn&#x27;t have staying power and no sting, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Over my lifetime I have used numerous after shave lotion brands.  Some were expensive and sweet smelling and some were reasonably priced brands.  I liked most brands of after shave lotion but my all-time favorite brand for the price is Adidas Dynamic Pulse after shave lotion put out by Coty.  It has a clean fresh smell without being too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I not only love this product, my wife also likes the scent of this after shave lotion because of its mild and clean smell.  The label also claims this Adidas after shave lotion was “developed with athletes.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are seeking a quality product at a reasonable price (Look around for the best price) that is a great smelling after shave lotion, you should check out Adidas Dynamic Pulse.  Personally, I love it and recommend it to anyone who uses an after shave lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author:  The Samurai Soul: An old warrior’s poetic tribute).</li>
            <li> Once again another spur of the moment buy from my side, and shoudl have know better that Adidas aftershave is a no go, while the rest of the gear is great aftershave is not one of there strong points - stay clear</li>
            <li> It has become difficult to find this great value of an after shave in stores. I have received a lot of compliments from my wife and people that I kiss or hug, so it is not strong but has a mild, manly &amp; refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> One of the best aftershaves I have smelled in years and sadley is not sold on the market any more!</li>
