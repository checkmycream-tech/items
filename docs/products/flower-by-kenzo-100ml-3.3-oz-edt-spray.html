            <li>Beautiful bottle that looks like a single flower in a crystal vase!</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance, and the shipping time was very swift.</li>
            <li>I kind of like the scent, but it is loud and overbearing</li>
            <li>It did come in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li>This is one of her favorite perfumes and she usually only gets it as a gift.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent on a woman has been Jovan Musk for the last 30 years.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>When I first the product I was happy,but after I put it on the scent faded in like an hour</li>
            <li>really liked it due to the benefits</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even think straight.</li>
            <li>she is very picky when comes to perfum.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying from this company!</li>
            <li>and I like it so much - I am thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a low price!</li>
            <li>By morning, my bathrooms have a light fresh floral smell, but not really TOO loud (except for one sister, but she seldom spends the night</li>
            <li>Friends just &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; when I have it on; family is &#x27;bold&#x27; enough to tell that that it&#x27;s taking their breath away.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Today, my wife came home with a new scent on her</li>
            <li>Worth it, folks!&lt;br /&gt;It is subtle and yet keeps you pleasantly fresh through the day.</li>
            <li>Long lasting scent but light enough to wear at the hospital.</li>
            <li>The perfume is much more expensive because it&#x27;s a much higher quality and concentration then the toilette.</li>
            <li>I now use it only as a bathroom freshener: I spay one time directly into all the bathrooms after everyone has gone to bed, and then shut the door.</li>

            <li> Great price...quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Its Okay but seems a bit un-fresh to me. I like the Flower in the Air much better.  It did come in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li> You will LOVE Flower if you love BonBon perfume.  It&#x27;s got the same candy-sweet scent with a touch of something fruity.  Very feminine, very sexy!</li>
            <li> Totally loved by recipient.  This is one of her favorite perfumes and she usually only gets it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Miss the sampler for free</li>
            <li> I love it.... Thank you</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance, and the shipping time was very swift.</li>
            <li> Me encanto el,perfume, exquisito olor, rápida entrega y espectacular la presentación, gracias por todo : ) seguro comprare mas, pues me encanto</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful fragrance for ladies. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> This is a lot of perfume... and I like it so much - I am thrilled to find it on Amazon for such a low price! Worth it, folks!&lt;br /&gt;It is subtle and yet keeps you pleasantly fresh through the day.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent on a woman has been Jovan Musk for the last 30 years.  Today, my wife came home with a new scent on her and it drove me \\&quot;nuts\\&quot;.  She said one of her clients (she cleans houses) had thrown it in the trash can, so she took it and tried it on to see if I would like it.  LIKE IT??!!!!  She had sprayed some between her breasts and said: \\&quot;hey, smell this!\\&quot;  When I did....I was lost in passion.  I couldn&#x27;t even think straight. I couldn&#x27;t even remember my name! She caught me at the desk on the computer, and needless to say, that was the end of my desk work.  For the next hour and a half we were lost in passionate sex like we hadn&#x27;t had in over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if the passion is out of your marriage; buy FlowerByKenzo, spray it between your breasts, and then go up to your husband and say: \\&quot;hey, smell this and tell me what you think of it!\\&quot;  If this doesn&#x27;t ignite him, then he&#x27;s probably hopeless.</li>
            <li> I love the scent but it doesn&#x27;t last long. For the price, the fragrance could at least last 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I kind of like the scent, but it is loud and overbearing; no one around me likes it b/c of that. Friends just &amp;#34;move&amp;#34; when I have it on; family is &#x27;bold&#x27; enough to tell that that it&#x27;s taking their breath away. I now use it only as a bathroom freshener: I spay one time directly into all the bathrooms after everyone has gone to bed, and then shut the door. By morning, my bathrooms have a light fresh floral smell, but not really TOO loud (except for one sister, but she seldom spends the night and I know now not to use it when she&#x27;s here). Nice that way, but expensive to use as a ROOM FRESHENER! ;)</li>
            <li> SE LOS RECOMIENDO TODO LLEGO EN EXCELENTES CONDICIONES, SON RESPONSABLES Y ENVIAN CON PRONTITUD Y MUY BUEN PROTEGIDOS LOS PRODUCTOS</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful floral!</li>
            <li> This is really nice. My wife loves the smell of it. I will recommend this to every one. Enjoy it.</li>
            <li> the wife loves it. she is very picky when comes to perfum. so it has to be good....&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend.....</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Kenzo Flower for almost 6 years now and love it.  It is wonderful, stays with me and smells heavenly.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it due to the benefits are incredible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the price is too low. Perfect !</li>
            <li> Received from my son and fiance&#x27; for Mother&#x27;s Day. Long lasting scent but light enough to wear at the hospital. Beautiful bottle that looks like a single flower in a crystal vase! HEAVENLY!</li>
            <li> When I first the product I was happy,but after I put it on the scent faded in like an hour think I got a FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> This company was a pleasure to deal with. They ran out of the product I ordered and instead of waiting until they had it in stock they called and asked my permission to send me the perfume instead of the eau de toilette. The perfume is much more expensive because it&#x27;s a much higher quality and concentration then the toilette. Who does that! I highly recommend buying from this company! They&#x27;re great!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and wow, she smells rich!!! She is so happy and so am I. This is a very sofisticated fragance for people with great taste for aromas.</li>
