            <li>This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with my purchase of this argan oil!</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li>also love that this product is produced by a woman&#x27;s cooperative.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of this</li>
            <li>So glad my wife shared her discovery with me.</li>
            <li>Next I tried it on my skin, and this is where I was really impressed!!  </li>
            <li>Since I started using this, my skin looks and feels so much more healthy.  </li>
            <li>and I have been trying so many brands but</li>
            <li>Love that this product is Organic.</li>
            <li>This Argan Oil feels lovely and smoothing going on.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of things to love about this product.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li>It really is a great product for skin, particularly the face...but when winter rolls around I will also be using it on my hands to help fight cracks and dryness.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully on my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a free bottle of this oil in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li>In my baby&#x27;s hair and in my own hair as a natural treatment (the hair looks so healthy and shiny).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This argan oil also has no scent and seems very fresh.</li>
            <li>Then my daughter tried it for the contact dermatitis on her hands and also experienced considerable relief after the first application, when even hydrocortisone cream wasn’t helping.  </li>
            <li>Kioba&#x27;s Argan Oil is the best I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tested a bunch of argan oils this past year.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find any noticeable differences in the oils themselves, which leads me to believe that this one really is 100% pure as advertised, and it&#x27;s just as good as the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brand.</li>
            <li>It just wipes right off!</li>
            <li>and I knew that they are all full of chemicals and non-natural things...</li>
            <li>The oil is almost immediately absorbed in my face and hair and leaves both face and hair feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>This oil absorbs quickly, moisturizes well, and does not have a scent.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s super absorbent and has no added fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Most readers of this review will be satisfied with the almost universal praise for this product found on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>When I was offered this item for review, I noticed it seems to have many useful functions, most related to skin and hair.</li>
            <li>This is our second bottle and I&#x27;ll buy it again, particularly as most of it is going on my husband, daughter, and granddaughter!</li>
            <li>This is very important since I try hard to take good care of my health</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not surprised to hear this since I did the research I recommended all do before buying and learned that this isn&#x27;t some new or controversial material but one proved to be useful and effective for a variety of purposes including that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now able to use only a light dusting of powder and blush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely worth checking out.  </li>
            <li>Being a skin care professional, I know how important it is to use high quality, natural products for optimum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pure, clean organic goodness.</li>
            <li>I just got my argan oil a few days ago and I am already loving it!  </li>
            <li>I found I needed more oil when I first started using it, but can use less now that my skin is more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>This elevates this product well above the crowd in it being both as good a quality as possible but at a cost significantly lower than its competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never liked the oily feeling of most lotions and this has kind of an oily/soft feeling, but I find I have gotten used to it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li>I have been using this oil since the first week of March</li>
            <li>This argan oil is not at all greasy and makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using Argan Oil for about 6 months and was interested to see how it compares to the brand I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil sell for as much as $35 / oz or many times the cost of this specific product.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>will definitely continue to use this product after my free sample runs out!</li>
            <li>Begin using it the same night, the oil is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>When my skin is usually dry, flaky and itchy this time of year, it is smooth and soft and I love that I am not scratching all the time anymore.  </li>
            <li>Kioba is straight argan oil, organic, without additives, which is so crucial considering that many additives are endocrine disrupters or carcinogenic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can easily get the exact amount that you need, whether it&#x27;s just one drop or multiple drops.</li>
            <li>This is great, as Argan oil needs to be stored in a dark bottle because light can break down the properties of the oil.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is 100% pure certified Organic and comes from Morocco.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is 100% pure and organic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure Argan oil, and proceeds help support women in the Argran growing region of Morocco.</li>
            <li>Before saying yes to the request, I first did some research on the uses of Argan Oil and discovered that it is a highly prized food and also a skin care aid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in the amount of acne scars on my skin, as well as just in the overall evenness of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Received the oil fast.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then, after a recommendation from my hair stylist who suggested that I use organic (she really stressed to use the organic stuff) oils on my hair, I began using it to help rid myself of split ends.</li>
            <li>I really like the effects of the oil on my skin.  </li>
            <li>The eye dropper works very well for dispensing the oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>So this is very protective.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very well without an oily residue.</li>
            <li>It is light enough that I don&#x27;t have to wash my face after I remove my make up.</li>
            <li>but I still can only recommend this guardedly.</li>
            <li>At this price, the Argan Oil doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a bargain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than other Argan Hair products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I noticed how shiny and healthy my wife&#x27;s full head of thick hair looked and asked her what she was using</li>
            <li>I have naturally spongy hair and live in an extremely humid climate, so having nice hair always seemed like a losing battle.  </li>
            <li>instructions are to put a small amount of oil in the plam of your hand to help warm the oil.  </li>
            <li>This ancient Berber oil (it&#x27;s organic and has no additives) is almost miraculous on the skin and seems to make my tan last much linger -- plus, my skin no longer dries out after a day of fun in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased Kioba argan oil as a gift for my pregnant girlfriend and she loves it.</li>
            <li>This oil is right on par with another high quality pure Argan oil that I used prior to this one.</li>
            <li>Yes, when I use it daily, the dry skin looks and feels better ...</li>
            <li>The product claims to be effective for both hair and skin, and the first thing I did was try a few drops on my very dry naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I also use it as a facial moisturizer and even in hot, humid weather it doesn’t leave any oily residue which is a HUGE plus, since this was a problem I had encountered with a lot of other face oils when I tried using them under my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received it and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts (I have very sensitive skin) and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Soaks in very quickly, without leaving a sticky mess on your skin.</li>
            <li>first started by using it on my skin because I read somewhere that it helps to not only moisturize but help fade acne scars.</li>
            <li>The color is a light gold, and the scent (only discernible if you put it right up to your nose) is very slightly nutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time at the beach and in the pool during summer and even though I tan easily and rarely burn, I always apply a thin layer of Kioba Argan Oil on my skin and and through my hair before I dive in</li>
            <li>Only been using for a little over a week cannot say that I see a difference yet, but really love the way it absorbs in the skin.</li>
            <li>also like the fact that Kioba is a totally natural, organic product.  </li>
            <li>That soft feeling lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no waste because you have complete control over the eye</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only real issues are cost and details.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit more expensive than the other brand, just under $5 more at this time.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is, &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; - my hair was soft and friz free without getting a greasy feel, as some other oils have left my hair.  </li>
            <li>dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually considering switching to this brand as my main source for Argan.</li>
            <li>am glad that I have finally found a product that is real argan oil, I have had trouble in the past finding autgentic 100% pure argan oils.</li>
            <li>This one absorbs very well and also works well for dry cuticles and parched hands.</li>
            <li>She said that after a few weeks&#x27; twice daily application of this oil, she sees a significant improvement in her complexion.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this alone, but I think I will also mix a few drops in with other styling products when I need more texture</li>
            <li>My impression is that it is anti-wrinkle and anti-aging, at least when I look at my wife&#x27;s smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>my naturally curly hair is finally tamed, my nails aren&#x27;t brittle &amp; cracking anymore &amp; my skin feels like silk.  </li>
            <li>I tried Kioba for the first time to see if it would help with the rough, bumpy skin on my forehead and the crepe-papery, blotchy skin on my upper chest, and saw a noticeable improvement in both areas within days.  </li>
            <li>I have mild psoriasis, and my legs have always looked a little scaly - especially in the winter time.  </li>
            <li>I like how the oil is not greasy and quickly soaks in to the skin, and at the same time it&#x27;s gentle enough for delicate areas such as around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I mix it with my other body lotions and face products like it recommends, and the texture and tone of my skin has really improved.  </li>
            <li>I have completely taken it in as a regular part of my daily routine!</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado, where our climate is very dry -</li>
            <li>I live in a semi-arid climate and constantly struggle with dry scalp/skin.</li>
            <li>So far I have just used it on my legs and heels which usually are very dry no matter what lotion I use or how much water I drink!!.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers and recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m not worried about my hair, but I have a dry patch of skin that never seems to clear.</li>
            <li>It has helped my 95 year old father with the dry skin on his feet, as well.  </li>
            <li>but the effects are no better and last no longer than pretty much any other moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my hair when it was clean and slightly damp, and used a few drops, especially on the ends of my hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely worth checking out.  </li>
            <li> Being a skin care professional, I know how important it is to use high quality, natural products for optimum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pure, clean organic goodness.</li>
            <li> I just got my argan oil a few days ago and I am already loving it!  </li>
            <li> I found I needed more oil when I first started using it, but can use less now that my skin is more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> This elevates this product well above the crowd in it being both as good a quality as possible but at a cost significantly lower than its competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never liked the oily feeling of most lotions and this has kind of an oily/soft feeling, but I find I have gotten used to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil since the first week of March</li>
            <li> This argan oil is not at all greasy and makes my skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for about 6 months and was interested to see how it compares to the brand I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil sell for as much as $35 / oz or many times the cost of this specific product.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> will definitely continue to use this product after my free sample runs out!</li>
            <li> Begin using it the same night, the oil is light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> When my skin is usually dry, flaky and itchy this time of year, it is smooth and soft and I love that I am not scratching all the time anymore.  </li>
            <li> Kioba is straight argan oil, organic, without additives, which is so crucial considering that many additives are endocrine disrupters or carcinogenic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can easily get the exact amount that you need, whether it&#x27;s just one drop or multiple drops.</li>
            <li> This is great, as Argan oil needs to be stored in a dark bottle because light can break down the properties of the oil.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is 100% pure certified Organic and comes from Morocco.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is 100% pure and organic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure Argan oil, and proceeds help support women in the Argran growing region of Morocco.</li>
            <li> Before saying yes to the request, I first did some research on the uses of Argan Oil and discovered that it is a highly prized food and also a skin care aid.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in the amount of acne scars on my skin, as well as just in the overall evenness of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Received the oil fast.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, after a recommendation from my hair stylist who suggested that I use organic (she really stressed to use the organic stuff) oils on my hair, I began using it to help rid myself of split ends.</li>
            <li> I really like the effects of the oil on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The eye dropper works very well for dispensing the oil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So this is very protective.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very well without an oily residue.</li>
            <li> It is light enough that I don&#x27;t have to wash my face after I remove my make up.</li>
            <li> but I still can only recommend this guardedly.</li>
            <li> At this price, the Argan Oil doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a bargain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than other Argan Hair products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I noticed how shiny and healthy my wife&#x27;s full head of thick hair looked and asked her what she was using</li>
            <li> I have naturally spongy hair and live in an extremely humid climate, so having nice hair always seemed like a losing battle.  </li>
            <li> instructions are to put a small amount of oil in the plam of your hand to help warm the oil.  </li>
            <li> This ancient Berber oil (it&#x27;s organic and has no additives) is almost miraculous on the skin and seems to make my tan last much linger -- plus, my skin no longer dries out after a day of fun in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased Kioba argan oil as a gift for my pregnant girlfriend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This oil is right on par with another high quality pure Argan oil that I used prior to this one.</li>
            <li> Yes, when I use it daily, the dry skin looks and feels better ...</li>
            <li> The product claims to be effective for both hair and skin, and the first thing I did was try a few drops on my very dry naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I also use it as a facial moisturizer and even in hot, humid weather it doesn’t leave any oily residue which is a HUGE plus, since this was a problem I had encountered with a lot of other face oils when I tried using them under my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received it and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts (I have very sensitive skin) and isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Soaks in very quickly, without leaving a sticky mess on your skin.</li>
            <li> first started by using it on my skin because I read somewhere that it helps to not only moisturize but help fade acne scars.</li>
            <li> The color is a light gold, and the scent (only discernible if you put it right up to your nose) is very slightly nutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time at the beach and in the pool during summer and even though I tan easily and rarely burn, I always apply a thin layer of Kioba Argan Oil on my skin and and through my hair before I dive in</li>
            <li> Only been using for a little over a week cannot say that I see a difference yet, but really love the way it absorbs in the skin.</li>
            <li> also like the fact that Kioba is a totally natural, organic product.  </li>
            <li> That soft feeling lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no waste because you have complete control over the eye</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only real issues are cost and details.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit more expensive than the other brand, just under $5 more at this time.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is, &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; - my hair was soft and friz free without getting a greasy feel, as some other oils have left my hair.  </li>
            <li> dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually considering switching to this brand as my main source for Argan.</li>
            <li> am glad that I have finally found a product that is real argan oil, I have had trouble in the past finding autgentic 100% pure argan oils.</li>
            <li> This one absorbs very well and also works well for dry cuticles and parched hands.</li>
            <li> She said that after a few weeks&#x27; twice daily application of this oil, she sees a significant improvement in her complexion.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this alone, but I think I will also mix a few drops in with other styling products when I need more texture</li>
            <li> My impression is that it is anti-wrinkle and anti-aging, at least when I look at my wife&#x27;s smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> my naturally curly hair is finally tamed, my nails aren&#x27;t brittle &amp; cracking anymore &amp; my skin feels like silk.  </li>
            <li> I tried Kioba for the first time to see if it would help with the rough, bumpy skin on my forehead and the crepe-papery, blotchy skin on my upper chest, and saw a noticeable improvement in both areas within days.  </li>
            <li> I have mild psoriasis, and my legs have always looked a little scaly - especially in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> I like how the oil is not greasy and quickly soaks in to the skin, and at the same time it&#x27;s gentle enough for delicate areas such as around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my other body lotions and face products like it recommends, and the texture and tone of my skin has really improved.  </li>
            <li> I have completely taken it in as a regular part of my daily routine!</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado, where our climate is very dry -</li>
            <li> I live in a semi-arid climate and constantly struggle with dry scalp/skin.</li>
            <li> So far I have just used it on my legs and heels which usually are very dry no matter what lotion I use or how much water I drink!!.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers and recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not worried about my hair, but I have a dry patch of skin that never seems to clear.</li>
            <li> It has helped my 95 year old father with the dry skin on his feet, as well.  </li>
            <li> but the effects are no better and last no longer than pretty much any other moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my hair when it was clean and slightly damp, and used a few drops, especially on the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> bottle of this should last quite a while because a tiny amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had been using a Nerium product that left deep dry cuts around my mouth an eyes.  </li>
            <li> After months of dealing with a very stubborn belly button piercing, I started using this stuff after my usual cleaning routine and it has done wonders for promoting healing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, buy some Kioba Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I use the Kioba Argan Oil on my hair before styling with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> It has especially helped the dry skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I have notice the lines around my eyes and mouth are diminishing and the dark spots on the back of my hands are barely noticeable now.  </li>
            <li> I have processed hair, I get highlights and low lights and my hair is very long, so the ends sometimes become dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> put the oil on my face twice daily, and I know it&#x27;s working because I can always tell if I forget or miss an application by the way my face feels later (slightly tight).</li>
            <li> brand is the same as the other brand I have tried.  </li>
            <li> My sister suggested Kioba for the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I felt that my skin was too dry</li>
            <li> Some products that advertise themselves as Argan Oil are impure or contain little of the essential oil, unlike Kioba Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my legs are softer and my heels are already not so rough.</li>
            <li> I place 12 drops in the palm of my hand and then carefully apply the oil to irritated spots on my face</li>
            <li> She believes her pores are too wide or something (I can&#x27;t see a problem).</li>
            <li> I used to have to use a lint remover to get all the little blond hairs off my black works shirts after braiding and now there is barely any!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lesser quality oil such as 75% or even 60% may sell for this amount elsewhere but not necessarily fair trade or organic.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> dark bottle with an eye dropper to carefully dispense the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the oil after showering in the evening on my face and hair.  </li>
            <li> Rather than go into the benefits of Argan Oil here, I&#x27;ll refer you to do the usual Internet searches from neutral sites which don&#x27;t sell the same stuff as they claim to review.</li>
            <li> Previous to this I was using make up remover towelettes</li>
            <li> brown glass bottle is very slightly darker than other brands that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Now I apply a few drops of argan oil after blow-drying and before ironing my hair and everyone thinks I’ve just come from the beauty salon.</li>
            <li> and I always felt like they left something behind on my face</li>
            <li> Since I started applying this to my hair after I get out of the shower I have noticed that there is 90% less breakage of my hair when I braid it for work!</li>
            <li> what it does have is just slightly nut like, at least to me.  </li>
            <li> She gave me a small sample bottle and within hours I was feeling relief.  </li>
            <li> Not much more one can ask for.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination, but I feel like the oil makes zits--particularly the underground type--look less angry and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> this argan oil is thick smell not good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see how it works in the very dry cold winter.</li>
            <li> and she shared her secret.  </li>
            <li> When they would get moisture on them, it was uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure is organic... :(</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Received the oil fast. Begin using it the same night, the oil is light and absorbs quickly. Only been using for a little over a week cannot say that I see a difference yet, but really love the way it absorbs in the skin. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> My whole family loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m so happy to find this argan oil available online, because everyone in my family uses it and we go through a lot.  I tried Kioba for the first time to see if it would help with the rough, bumpy skin on my forehead and the crepe-papery, blotchy skin on my upper chest, and saw a noticeable improvement in both areas within days.  Then my daughter tried it for the contact dermatitis on her hands and also experienced considerable relief after the first application, when even hydrocortisone cream wasn’t helping.  Next, my dad tried it for the scaly, red patches all over his forehead and within a week they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, and I have to say, this stuff is AMAZING for frizzy hair.  I have naturally spongy hair and live in an extremely humid climate, so having nice hair always seemed like a losing battle.  Now I apply a few drops of argan oil after blow-drying and before ironing my hair and everyone thinks I’ve just come from the beauty salon. I also use it as a facial moisturizer and even in hot, humid weather it doesn’t leave any oily residue which is a HUGE plus, since this was a problem I had encountered with a lot of other face oils when I tried using them under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that Kioba is a totally natural, organic product.  This is very important since I try hard to take good care of my health and I’m trying to weed my makeup bag of all that commercial stuff with ingredients you can’t pronounce.</li>
            <li> I use the Kioba Argan Oil on my hair before styling with my flat iron. I apply it to the ends and keeps the freeze under control.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my fingernails, and my daughter uses it on her back to improve her skin condition. It has many uses and we think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple of months ago and let me tell you I have put it to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started by using it on my skin because I read somewhere that it helps to not only moisturize but help fade acne scars. After using it on both my face and upper back I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in the amount of acne scars on my skin, as well as just in the overall evenness of my skin tone. Then, after a recommendation from my hair stylist who suggested that I use organic (she really stressed to use the organic stuff) oils on my hair, I began using it to help rid myself of split ends. My hair feels amazing every time I use this stuff. And lastly, this stuff even works to help healing piercings! After months of dealing with a very stubborn belly button piercing, I started using this stuff after my usual cleaning routine and it has done wonders for promoting healing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, buy some Kioba Argan oil. It&#x27;s organic, fair trade and has tons of great benefits for your hair and skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have used several brands of Argan oil and will definitely use this one again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil since the first week of March and I love it.  I mix it with my other body lotions and face products like it recommends, and the texture and tone of my skin has really improved.  I stopped using my foundation and concealer a week ago.  I am now able to use only a light dusting of powder and blush.  I have notice the lines around my eyes and mouth are diminishing and the dark spots on the back of my hands are barely noticeable now.  When my skin is usually dry, flaky and itchy this time of year, it is smooth and soft and I love that I am not scratching all the time anymore.  This product does everything it says!</li>
            <li> I had been using a Nerium product that left deep dry cuts around my mouth an eyes.  When they would get moisture on them, it was uncomfortable.  My sister suggested Kioba for the dry skin.  She gave me a small sample bottle and within hours I was feeling relief.  I found it on Amazon and ordered a bottle.  I use it on my hands, face, and hair.  It has really revitalized my skin and the few wrinkles seem softer.</li>
            <li> I received it and it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts (I have very sensitive skin) and isn&#x27;t greasy.  Feels nice - I&#x27;m waiting to see how it works in the very dry cold winter.</li>
            <li> I just got my argan oil a few days ago and I am already loving it!  So far I have just used it on my legs and heels which usually are very dry no matter what lotion I use or how much water I drink!!. I have noticed that my legs are softer and my heels are already not so rough. This argan oil is not at all greasy and makes my skin feel smooth and soft. I will continue to use it and recommend it to all my friends. Thank you for such a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> I was recently contacted by the manufacturer to try their product and received a bottle for no charge.  I have been using Argan Oil for about 6 months and was interested to see how it compares to the brand I had been using.  I really like the effects of the oil on my skin.  It has especially helped the dry skin on my feet.  It has helped my 95 year old father with the dry skin on his feet, as well.  I tried it in my hair, but found it became too oily, so I quit doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are to put a small amount of oil in the plam of your hand to help warm the oil.  This works well.  I found I needed more oil when I first started using it, but can use less now that my skin is more hydrated.  I have never liked the oily feeling of most lotions and this has kind of an oily/soft feeling, but I find I have gotten used to it and actually like the way it feels.  That soft feeling lasts throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is the same as the other brand I have tried.  There is no offensive odor, but it also isn&#x27;t a fragrant smell, either.  It comes in a 2 oz glass bottle with a glass dropper.  It is a bit more expensive than the other brand, just under $5 more at this time.  Both qualify for Prime, at this time, as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this oil! I live in a semi-arid climate and constantly struggle with dry scalp/skin. This oil absorbs quickly, moisturizes well, and does not have a scent. Kioba is straight argan oil, organic, without additives, which is so crucial considering that many additives are endocrine disrupters or carcinogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bottle of this should last quite a while because a tiny amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this product is produced by a woman&#x27;s cooperative. Argan oil is an eco alternative to moisturizers because it is a sustainable practice (harvesting seeds from a tree) and improves the lives of woman in Morocco. I will be purchasing more of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a</li>
            <li> This oil is right on par with another high quality pure Argan oil that I used prior to this one. I can&#x27;t find any noticeable differences in the oils themselves, which leads me to believe that this one really is 100% pure as advertised, and it&#x27;s just as good as the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brand. The color is a light gold, and the scent (only discernible if you put it right up to your nose) is very slightly nutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the oil on my face twice daily, and I know it&#x27;s working because I can always tell if I forget or miss an application by the way my face feels later (slightly tight). I like how the oil is not greasy and quickly soaks in to the skin, and at the same time it&#x27;s gentle enough for delicate areas such as around the eyes. I put it all over my face and sometimes even on my neck if I get a pesky breakout in the area. Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination, but I feel like the oil makes zits--particularly the underground type--look less angry and less noticeable. And that is a VERY good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brown glass bottle is very slightly darker than other brands that I&#x27;ve used. This is great, as Argan oil needs to be stored in a dark bottle because light can break down the properties of the oil. The eye dropper works very well for dispensing the oil. You can easily get the exact amount that you need, whether it&#x27;s just one drop or multiple drops. There&#x27;s no waste because you have complete control over the eye dropper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am actually considering switching to this brand as my main source for Argan. I&#x27;ve had nothing but a good experience with it. It really is a great product for skin, particularly the face...but when winter rolls around I will also be using it on my hands to help fight cracks and dryness. A review sample was provided in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time at the beach and in the pool during summer and even though I tan easily and rarely burn, I always apply a thin layer of Kioba Argan Oil on my skin and and through my hair before I dive in and after I rinse off.  I noticed how shiny and healthy my wife&#x27;s full head of thick hair looked and asked her what she was using and she shared her secret.  This ancient Berber oil (it&#x27;s organic and has no additives) is almost miraculous on the skin and seems to make my tan last much linger -- plus, my skin no longer dries out after a day of fun in the sun.  I like that it&#x27;s super absorbent and has no added fragrance.  My impression is that it is anti-wrinkle and anti-aging, at least when I look at my wife&#x27;s smooth skin.  I now understand why it&#x27;s been used for eons in Morocco as a protection from wind and sun.  It works.  So glad my wife shared her discovery with me.</li>
            <li> I did not know anything about Argan Oil until Kioba asked me to do a review on this product.  Before saying yes to the request, I first did some research on the uses of Argan Oil and discovered that it is a highly prized food and also a skin care aid.  However, further research educated me to the fact that not all Argan Oils are created equal.  Some products that advertise themselves as Argan Oil are impure or contain little of the essential oil, unlike Kioba Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kioba Argan Oil is 100% pure certified Organic and comes from Morocco.  The box containing the oil tells us that there are no additives and traditional methods have been used to produce the oil.  It comes packaged in a 2 oz. dark bottle with an eye dropper to carefully dispense the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the oil after showering in the evening on my face and hair.  I place 12 drops in the palm of my hand and then carefully apply the oil to irritated spots on my face and then I massage the leftover oil in my hands and rub it in my damp hair and finally rub my entire face with my hands.  The oil has almost no smell -- what it does have is just slightly nut like, at least to me.  The oil is almost immediately absorbed in my face and hair and leaves both face and hair feeling clean and refreshed.  The oil definitely helps to heal any irritations on the face, just as promised by Kioba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kioba has an impressive site on the Internet http://www.kiobaarganoil.com/ for those who want to know more about this company and product.  Most readers of this review will be satisfied with the almost universal praise for this product found on Amazon.  I agree with the other reviewers and recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Rather than go into the benefits of Argan Oil here, I&#x27;ll refer you to do the usual Internet searches from neutral sites which don&#x27;t sell the same stuff as they claim to review. You&#x27;ll find that this is a proven material for a variety of purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our case, my wife wanted to try this to enhance her facial skin. She believes her pores are too wide or something (I can&#x27;t see a problem). She said that after a few weeks&#x27; twice daily application of this oil, she sees a significant improvement in her complexion. I&#x27;m not surprised to hear this since I did the research I recommended all do before buying and learned that this isn&#x27;t some new or controversial material but one proved to be useful and effective for a variety of purposes including that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real issues are cost and details. I&#x27;ve seen this amount of this quality (organic, fair trade, 100% virgin) Argan Oil sell for as much as $35 / oz or many times the cost of this specific product. Lesser quality oil such as 75% or even 60% may sell for this amount elsewhere but not necessarily fair trade or organic. This elevates this product well above the crowd in it being both as good a quality as possible but at a cost significantly lower than its competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highest quality, effective and at a great price. Not much more one can ask for.</li>
            <li> Wow.  This oil is something that I will use for the rest of my life.  The product claims to be effective for both hair and skin, and the first thing I did was try a few drops on my very dry naturally curly hair.  I applied it to my hair when it was clean and slightly damp, and used a few drops, especially on the ends of my hair.  All I can say is, &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; - my hair was soft and friz free without getting a greasy feel, as some other oils have left my hair.  I will continue to use this alone, but I think I will also mix a few drops in with other styling products when I need more texture, it will be the perfect component to my &amp;#34;styling cocktails&amp;#34; - that curly hair seems to always require.  Next I tried it on my skin, and this is where I was really impressed!!  I have mild psoriasis, and my legs have always looked a little scaly - especially in the winter time.  Since I started using this, my skin looks and feels so much more healthy.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with my purchase of this argan oil! It does exactly what it says it is supposed to do. I use it on my face, hands, and hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I have finally found a product that is real argan oil, I have had trouble in the past finding autgentic 100% pure argan oils.</li>
            <li> I consider Argan oil one of the best oils in the market and I have been trying so many brands but the quality of this one is AMAZING! I use it as:&lt;br /&gt;- Make up remover (when I used to get the traditional make up remover that you buy at the pharmacy I felt that my skin was too dry and I knew that they are all full of chemicals and non-natural things...The difference with this Argan Oil is HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;- Before my make up (it is amazing how your skin change when you put argan oil before make up).&lt;br /&gt;- In my baby&#x27;s hair and in my own hair as a natural treatment (the hair looks so healthy and shiny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really in love with Kioba Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Pure, clean organic goodness. Superb for skin and hair. Grateful to have found such a quality and affordable Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and just love it!  Good for hair, face nails probably any place you need some help with.  I will buy this product again because of the quality!!</li>
            <li> i like organ oil product but this argan oil is thick smell not good</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Kioba argan oil as a gift for my pregnant girlfriend and she loves it. Has been using it daily for her growing belly and (with the oil being 100% organic) there are no harmful chemicals to be weary of. It&#x27;s absolutely worth checking out.  I hope you give this amazing product a try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Love that this product is Organic. This is a very light Argan oil that feels amazing on the face! Works wonderfully on my hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and it keeps the frizz away. It&#x27;s better than other Argan Hair products I&#x27;ve used. Will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I am not sure is organic... :(</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil is absolutely amazing!  I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair, nails &amp; skin and I the difference in hydration is wonderful!  I live in Colorado, where our climate is very dry - my naturally curly hair is finally tamed, my nails aren&#x27;t brittle &amp; cracking anymore &amp; my skin feels like silk.  Being a skin care professional, I know how important it is to use high quality, natural products for optimum health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this product again &amp; recommend it to my all my friends &amp; clients!</li>
            <li> Kioba&#x27;s Argan Oil is the best I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tested a bunch of argan oils this past year. This one absorbs very well and also works well for dry cuticles and parched hands. I like using one dropperful for back massage. A little bit goes a long way. This argan oil also has no scent and seems very fresh. I like that it is 100% pure and organic. This is also a fair trade product! If you use this on your hands you will notice the water beading off your hands the next time you wash them. So this is very protective. It also makes my nails shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free bottle of this oil in exchange for a review. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil feels lovely and smoothing going on. It also has no smell to speak of, which my nose appreciates.&lt;br /&gt;Soaks in very quickly, without leaving a sticky mess on your skin. This is our second bottle and I&#x27;ll buy it again, particularly as most of it is going on my husband, daughter, and granddaughter!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of things to love about this product. It&#x27;s pure Argan oil, and proceeds help support women in the Argran growing region of Morocco. It absorbs very well without an oily residue. I use it daily and my nails and skin are already showing signs of improvement. I&#x27;ve yet to try it on my hair but plan to do so. Sunspots are fading, wrinkles are not as visible. You couldn&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li> I received this item in exchange for a fair and honest review. I have completely taken it in as a regular part of my daily routine! I use it nightly to remove my make up. It&#x27;s very gentle and I don&#x27;t have to scrub at waterproof mascara and eyeliner. It just wipes right off! It is light enough that I don&#x27;t have to wash my face after I remove my make up. Previous to this I was using make up remover towelettes and I always felt like they left something behind on my face so I&#x27;d have to remove my make up then wash the remover residue off my face. Not so with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this on my hair while it&#x27;s still damp, after I get out of the shower. I have processed hair, I get highlights and low lights and my hair is very long, so the ends sometimes become dry and brittle. I also have to braid my hair daily for work reasons. Since I started applying this to my hair after I get out of the shower I have noticed that there is 90% less breakage of my hair when I braid it for work! I used to have to use a lint remover to get all the little blond hairs off my black works shirts after braiding and now there is barely any!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product after my free sample runs out!</li>
            <li> When I was offered this item for review, I noticed it seems to have many useful functions, most related to skin and hair. Well, I&#x27;m not worried about my hair, but I have a dry patch of skin that never seems to clear. What could it hurt, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it works ... but I still can only recommend this guardedly. Yes, when I use it daily, the dry skin looks and feels better ... but the effects are no better and last no longer than pretty much any other moisturizing lotion I&#x27;ve tried. At this price, the Argan Oil doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a bargain.</li>
