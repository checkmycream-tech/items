            <li>This is my ALL time favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm ever.</li>
            <li>I love the Mongongo in Vanilla Coconut Cream for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and richer than most chapstick-type lip balms.  </li>
            <li>** for an even better deal, go to jerseyshoresun.com, the .15 oz size is $5.50 for orange ginger or vanilla coconut.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and leaves my lips silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I searched Amazon because i will be repurchasing as soon as I am out.</li>
            <li>but this isn&#x27;t overwhelming and almost smells like ginger ale.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite (beauty) product of the year.</li>
            <li>I reminds me of citron peel--so refreshing.</li>
            <li>A great new product!  </li>
            <li>Forget all those other lip balms--this one is the best!  </li>
            <li>and I got mine from IPSY too originally and ordered more through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to find an inexpensive product that you really like!</li>
            <li>Great product, except that the image shows 5 and they actually only send one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and comforting!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t LOVE the smell/scent of this particular one</li>
            <li>New favorite, here.</li>
            <li>This is way different and way better!</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s worth the price.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>, I had to buy another one right away</li>
            <li>It smells delicious (contains ginger and lime essential oils) with a slight lime taste but not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>Great slick consistency, though.</li>
            <li>so I use a damp washcloth to wipe it off and any flaky skin is gone, revealing smooth, new skin.  </li>
            <li>I goes on smoothly and has this amazing citrusy scent as it is made of mandarin green orange essence.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips feel so soft amd smooth.</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, protected lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick or sticky, and tastes great too.</li>
            <li>Use it year round to keep my lips in good condition.</li>
            <li>This product is like no other, I enjoy this everything about it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to apply it very often.  </li>
            <li>I really like the packaging, too.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky texture like some other lip balms can.</li>
            <li>This is hands down one of the most moisturizing lip conditioners that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s one item that you buy for yourself this winter, I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally like citrus smelling things</li>
            <li>Soft lips!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Seriously, it makes my lips so smooth and moisturizes so much that I don&#x27;t have to reapply!</li>
            <li>I always applied regular chapstick straight out of the shower and had to re-apply at some point.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my lips feeling so soft and silky</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lip balm connoisseur and this is by far one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I received this all natural lip balm as part of my Ipsy beauty subscription one month and didn&#x27;t even think anything of it until I tried it recently.</li>
            <li>Plus, if they were really chapped, my lips would get a little film (skin sloughing?).</li>

            <li> Favorite chap-stick EVER.</li>
            <li> I too got this in my Ipsy bag and LOVE it! I always applied regular chapstick straight out of the shower and had to re-apply at some point. Plus, if they were really chapped, my lips would get a little film (skin sloughing?). This is way different and way better! Seriously, it makes my lips so smooth and moisturizes so much that I don&#x27;t have to reapply! And my lips definitely don&#x27;t get the film on them. I love this stuff and won&#x27;t be using anything else.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes my lips feel so soft amd smooth. Use it year round to keep my lips in good condition.</li>
            <li> Totally not what I had expected...a little too greasy for my liking.  And it didn&#x27;t last as long as ANY other brand.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST ever!  I put it on my lips before bed and when I wake up in the morning, it feels like some of it is still on. Soft lips!  What can I say. I works!  Buy it!</li>
            <li> This product is like no other, I enjoy this everything about it. Every day do I make sure it&#x27;s on my lips after I wake up and before I sleep. It&#x27;s not waxy, it moisterizes perfectly. I yet to find another like it. I am SOLD!!!</li>
            <li> This is my ALL time favorite lip balm. The scent is a wonderful lime-citrus and it keeps my lips moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip balm ever. The only product out of 6 that calmed a burning lip condition. So conditioning and soothing.</li>
            <li> Great product, except that the image shows 5 and they actually only send one. $9 for a lip balm? No.</li>
            <li> Forget all those other lip balms--this one is the best!  Soft, smooth, protected lips.  Just ordered my second one and one for my daughter.  It&#x27;s nice to find an inexpensive product that you really like!</li>
            <li> Smells very strongly of ginger. Great slick consistency, though.</li>
            <li> I have been a chapstick addict for at least 15 years. I have tried different brands and applicators, balm, gloss, etc. I love the Mongongo in Vanilla Coconut Cream for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell is delicious and makes me want to eat it. It reminds me of a mixture of coconut cream pie and tanning lotion. It&#x27;s sweet and comforting!&lt;br /&gt;2. The texture is really creamy and doesn&#x27;t make my lips feel like they have a heavy coating of gunk on them.&lt;br /&gt;3. It&#x27;s organic and I can proudly pronounce everything on the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;4. The tube fits perfectly in my pocket, which means I can always carry it with me wherever I go.</li>
            <li> Finally found a lip balm that seems to actually heal my Arizona dry lips.  I don&#x27;t need to apply it very often.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Got this in my Ipsy bag and was not expecting it to be any different than my usual lip balm (softlips).  It&#x27;s thicker and richer than most chapstick-type lip balms.  I only have the one tube which is by my bedside.  I put it on before bed and by morning my lips still feel moist.  It seems to have some sort of exfoliating effect so I use a damp washcloth to wipe it off and any flaky skin is gone, revealing smooth, new skin.  A little goes a long way so I think it&#x27;s worth the price.    **1/31/15 update** for an even better deal, go to jerseyshoresun.com, the .15 oz size is $5.50 for orange ginger or vanilla coconut.  I used the coupon code SUPERIOR for 25% off and FREE SHIPPING.</li>

            <li> New favorite, here. I got this in my ipsy bag and I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to be awesome... but it leaves my lips feeling so soft and silky, I had to buy another one right away so I always have it! It&#x27;s not too thick or sticky, and tastes great too. Definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> I got this in one of my monthly beauty subscriptions and fell in love! I&#x27;m glad I searched Amazon because i will be repurchasing as soon as I am out.

            <li> Love this stuff!  I got in an ipsy bag and thought was great so ordered more from Amazon!  Can&#x27;t imagine anyone not thinking this stuff is most awesome!</li>

I want to try the Vanilla coconut kind they have on their website, but this deal for two is a better price so I&#x27;m just going to suck it up and deal with the scent.</li>
            <li> Wow! If you have chapped lips you won&#x27;t anymore! This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I only wish I could get this at the stores.  My wife got it in an Ipsy bag, and I love it!  Try this stuff out- it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> WHERE did this come from?  I never heard of it, but I tried it today and it is awesome!  It feels so moisturizing without being sticky, thick or heavy.  It smells delicious (contains ginger and lime essential oils) with a slight lime taste but not overpowering at all.  I really like the packaging, too.  A great new product!  I recommend it.</li>
