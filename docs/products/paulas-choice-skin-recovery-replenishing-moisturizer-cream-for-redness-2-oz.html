    <ol>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>The best skin care at an great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer</li>
            <li>A reaction but good communication</li>
            <li>Love Paula&#x27;s choice products!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is amazing and I will never try anything else.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight which is nice</li>
            <li>Very very happy, will definitely be my new go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizer for sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>What I love about this unique moisturizer is my pores aren&#x27;t so noticeable, it preps my face for makeup and it looks so good</li>
            <li>It has an interesting consistency.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the most moisturizing.</li>
            <li>, why would you buy this on Amazon when you can get it MUCH cheaper with great customer service on Paula Begouns&#x27;s website?</li>
            <li>I loved this at first</li>
            <li>It may be because of my new skincare combo ( Image Skincare Ormedic Cleanser and this moisturizer), but I am one happy camper.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping and fresh product for a great price</li>
            <li>your first order http://goo.gl/J5uNbc enjoy! :)</li>
            <li>Within the first application, my skin was so much better.  </li>
            <li>yes genetics play a part, but these products keep my skin looking vibrant and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost a month now and it has reduced the redness tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I believe the moisture boost works for my skin type (combination, sometimes dry) much better.</li>
            <li>Not the greatest &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; because Paula doesn&#x27;t add any additiional artificial fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>After only a few days of using this product day and night the dry patches were gone and the best thing is that I have not had a single blemish since using this product.  </li>
            <li>I am greatly disappointed in this supposedly &#x27;wonderful&#x27; moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I consistently have people ask me what skin regime I have because my skin looks younger than my 47 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many bottles of this moisturizer in the past</li>
            <li>and I know this is not how it is supposed to smell (usually no scent at all).</li>
            <li>Softer, less red, and even my makeup looks better with this underneath.</li>
            <li>the reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because my skin is not dry.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and this product is what I use for moisturizing at night.  </li>

            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and this product is what I use for moisturizing at night.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but very rich cream.</li>
            <li> In the winter months, with the dry, inside air.. I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 60s and have been told that I look at least 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> I have dryish skin, but not peeling or rough.  </li>
            <li> It works extremely well as a night cream, too.</li>
            <li> this lotion did not hydrate my skin at all, my face feels dry and flaky within a few hours  of applying it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product worked for me for when my face gets very dry during winter or when I am trying to dry out a small pimple.</li>
            <li> This is usually a good moisturizer, however the tube I got was so out of date that it had a disgusting rancid smell.</li>
            <li> , however, I don&#x27;t see any difference in others I&#x27;ve used at much less cost.</li>
            <li> so it is less than optimal during the day.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an odd question to ask.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this purchase was a complete waste of money, I couldn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with dry, sensitive, acne prone skin which has made it nearly impossible to find anything that will work on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Smearing rancid smelly cream all over your face is not appealing, no matter how well the product works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used clinique moisturizers for years and years, but with this past dry winter, clinique just wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> So disappointed :(</li>
            <li> but it clogged my pores something terrible.</li>

            <li> I am greatly disappointed in this supposedly &#x27;wonderful&#x27; moisturizer.  It is lightweight which is nice, however, I don&#x27;t see any difference in others I&#x27;ve used at much less cost.</li>
            <li> I loved this at first but it clogged my pores something terrible. So disappointed :( I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used clinique moisturizers for years and years, but with this past dry winter, clinique just wasn&#x27;t cutting it. This brand was recomended by a youtuber, so i decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!! Within the first application, my skin was so much better.  Softer, less red, and even my makeup looks better with this underneath. Very very happy, will definitely be my new go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but very rich cream.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this product worked for me for when my face gets very dry during winter or when I am trying to dry out a small pimple. I recommend using this code to get $10OFF your first order http://goo.gl/J5uNbc enjoy! :)</li>
            <li> The best skin care at an great price.</li>
            <li> It has an interesting consistency. It isn&#x27;t the most moisturizing. I believe the moisture boost works for my skin type (combination, sometimes dry) much better.</li>
            <li> I have dryish skin, but not peeling or rough.  I have been using this cream at night only - it does not have a sunscreen so it is less than optimal during the day.  Not greasy, works well.  Not the greatest &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; because Paula doesn&#x27;t add any additiional artificial fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have reviewed the product, why would you buy this on Amazon when you can get it MUCH cheaper with great customer service on Paula Begouns&#x27;s website?</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Paula&#x27;s Choice for over 10 years. I consistently have people ask me what skin regime I have because my skin looks younger than my 47 years.  People think I&#x27;m 30.. yes genetics play a part, but these products keep my skin looking vibrant and healthy.  I have dry, sensitive skin and this product is what I use for moisturizing at night.  In the winter months, with the dry, inside air.. I use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s an odd question to ask. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and I have been using it for over 10 years. I started using it in 2002 after battling with rosacea for 2 years. Within 1 week the rosacea disappeared. You don&#x27;t need to buy a separate eye cream. It works extremely well as a night cream, too. I am in my early 60s and have been told that I look at least 20 years younger. I credit it to Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li> this lotion did not hydrate my skin at all, my face feels dry and flaky within a few hours  of applying it. I feel like it actually feels dryer after using this than without it.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I have Oily skin and got this for wearing at nighttime. It didn&#x27;t leave my face greasy at all even though it is for&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Dry Skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and fresh product for a great price</li>
            <li> What I love about this unique moisturizer is my pores aren&#x27;t so noticeable, it preps my face for makeup and it looks so good, I don&#x27;t feel that I have to wear any makeup at all!!</li>
            <li> This is usually a good moisturizer, however the tube I got was so out of date that it had a disgusting rancid smell. I&#x27;ve bought many bottles of this moisturizer in the past and I know this is not how it is supposed to smell (usually no scent at all).

            <li> I .think the reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because my skin is not dry.  This product leaves me a bit oily</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with dry, sensitive, acne prone skin which has made it nearly impossible to find anything that will work on my skin.  This moisturizer is amazing and I will never try anything else.  I have been using it for almost a month now and it has reduced the redness tremendously.

It may be because of my new skincare combo ( Image Skincare Ormedic Cleanser and this moisturizer), but I am one happy camper.  I could have saved thousands of dollars and time over the years had I known about these products.</li>
