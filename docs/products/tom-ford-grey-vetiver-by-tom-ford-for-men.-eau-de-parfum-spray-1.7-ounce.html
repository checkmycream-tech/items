            <li>version is like jeans a nice button up shirt.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance not to sweet</li>
            <li>It has a good dose of ISO-E-Super, gives it a very fresh, sparkly edge that balances out the musky,  woody vetiver aspect nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a country folk kind of smell.</li>
            <li>While most reviewers suggest Spring and Summer for wear, given the &amp;#34;outdoorsy&amp;#34; notes of vetiver,</li>
            <li>I respectfully disagree -</li>
            <li>I just love TF&#x27;s take on vetiver in this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I did not get my bottle from Amazon, so make sure</li>
            <li>It&#x27;is refreshing and attracts attention from everyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Exotic smell,</li>
            <li>Tom Ford will last the work day and the happy hour time too!</li>
            <li>Tom Ford&#x27;s version is more like a silk suit and tie.</li>
            <li>Just got my bottle of this grand cologne.</li>
            <li>I Love it..</li>
            <li>and I have many top quality fragrances I will grab more of Tom Ford Products</li>
            <li>Very pleasant scent, however it is very light and does not stay long on the skin.</li>
            <li>Creed&#x27;s &amp;#34;Original Vetiver&amp;#34; is probably better for someone starting out, and is very good in its own right.</li>
            <li>It was love at first sniff for me, but I could see how others may need to warm up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and not too strong of a scent</li>
            <li>GV provides great flexibility - I am comfortable wearing daily in the office</li>
            <li>Light Citrus Vetiver perfection blended.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne, very fast delivery</li>
            <li>My product arrived promptly and came in the original box.</li>
            <li>I have The House of Creed Original Vetiver.</li>
            <li>I read a ton of reviews where people said it smelled sweet like a citrus, no way.</li>
            <li>It was fairly filled to the top, but was not in new condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;TFGV is a clean, fresh, and &amp;#34;outdoorsy&amp;#34; fragrance that portrays class, eloquence, and masculinity.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with overall purchasing experience of product.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day, just the right amount of projection.</li>
            <li>Smells real nice and subtle..</li>
            <li>After sampling literally every men&#x27;s cologne at Sephora, and going through nearly every scent I can get my hands on from the House of Creed (including &amp;#34;Original Vetiver&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Vetiver (1948), aka JFK&#x27;s Vetiver&amp;#34;), I can say without a doubt that Tom Ford&#x27;s &amp;#34;Grey Vetiver&amp;#34; is astonishingly great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is for a man who actually has a job, has accomplished something and has some nice clothes.  </li>
            <li>This is top shelf hunting oil too be brought out for those times you are in a social event and as we say suited and booted for the occasion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the only scent I bought two full bottles of, because if it is ever retired, it would easily go for triple the retail price on eBay.</li>
            <li>bottle and packaging are first class.  </li>
            <li>This is a first class scent that everyone should have in their collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is more with such a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>Tom Ford&#x27;s version is more like a silk suit and tie.much younger, and not at all offensive in any way.</li>
            <li>My first compliment was from an equestrian that said my smell reminded her of a horse.</li>
            <li>Ready to order again!</li>
            <li>the actual bottle itself are all top notch.</li>
            <li>Very eloquent scent that is much different than most of the colognes on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen it happen before, and I always want the option of wearing &amp;#34;Grey Vetiver&amp;#34; for special occasions or busy days at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sillage is high for the first hour or two.</li>
            <li>I really like this parfume.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you are going to blow out the noses of anyone sharing an elevator with you, and you will ruin it for the rest of us.</li>
            <li>I believe this is a real product.</li>
            <li>But it appears to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>More of an everyday all day fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this fragrance..</li>
            <li>For the cost not an everyday cologne unless you have the money to spend for more.</li>
            <li>this much cheaper if it is an actual real product.</li>
            <li>I recommend it though cos the smell is very mature.</li>
            <li>For those looking for an entry level niche fragrance, look no more - TF Grey Vetiver is a great starting point.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it arrived promptly and was thoroughly enjoyed for the short time it lasted!</li>
            <li>Creed Vetiver is very different more citrus and does not last very long on my skin.</li>
            <li>sillage is modest, however, this might not be a bad thing - my girlfriend loves the fragrance and frequently suggests that she only smells it when she enters &amp;#34;my space&amp;#34; - I am totally good with her being in &amp;#34;my space&amp;#34;..!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Vetiver is a very well-known classical frangnance plant..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent, but was disappointed to see that the bottle that was shipped to me was clearly labeled \\&quot;TESTER\\&quot; and was not 100% full.  </li>
            <li>base notes remind me of the earthy smell of sweet tobacco in very fine cigars, old oak houses which gives off a faint vanilla, and that lovely smokey vetiver grass dry</li>
            <li>I may get a few hours, certainly it does not last a work day on me.</li>

            <li> final tally for Tom Ford&#x27;s Grey Vetiver is 4.5 stars out of 5.  </li>
            <li> It is manly and last all day long</li>
            <li> This product is fake and smells cheap.</li>
            <li> Grey Vetiver provides above average longevity, lasting about 6 to 8 hours on my skin, and even longer on clothing.  </li>
            <li> Plus the price of this parfume is half to a third of the Creed which allows me to purchase another fragrance of my choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but well worth it IMO.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle, masculinely adult and earthy.</li>
            <li> I like Creed&#x27;s version very much as well, and I do wear it for casual events.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like Creed&#x27;s version very much as well, and I do wear it for casual events.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not Exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> While probably still at the lower end of niche fragrances, the price/value is below average, but I would suggest that you cannot place a value on compliments and confidence while wearing the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The imitation vertiver fades away in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had posted the question about this being a real product or a fake.</li>
            <li> Or you have previous experience with it</li>
            <li> After the dry down, it stays close to the skin, at least it does on my skin.</li>
            <li> opening notes are piercing, with a lot of sour citrus and of course, that green grassy vetiver.</li>
            <li> I wasted my $128 purchasing a crab.&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend it to antbody.</li>
            <li> I can still smell a hint of it late evening.</li>
            <li> You are trying to draw in attention from those close to you, not leave a wake of grapefruit and green grass behind you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anything the size was too big... got sick of it after a while, kna mean?  </li>
            <li> placing order through Amazon prime, I thought I was secured, but I was proved wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive though</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Tom Ford anything.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t be a jobless moron and put this cologne on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy about this!</li>
            <li> perfume  was very annoying and caused me a headache&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy it again</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells real nice and subtle..</li>
            <li> awesome fragrance.it makes me feel so good when i wear it. its sure for the matured minds not boys.its so great</li>
            <li> I was very pleased. My product arrived promptly and came in the original box. The fragrance is subtle, masculinely adult and earthy.</li>
            <li> For those looking for an entry level niche fragrance, look no more - TF Grey Vetiver is a great starting point.  That was me about a year ago when I took that &amp;#34;leap of faith&amp;#34;, not to mention, paying the extra $$$ (USD), for Tom Ford&#x27;s Noir.  I haven&#x27;t looked back..!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TFGV is a clean, fresh, and &amp;#34;outdoorsy&amp;#34; fragrance that portrays class, eloquence, and masculinity. Grey Vetiver provides above average longevity, lasting about 6 to 8 hours on my skin, and even longer on clothing.  The projection/sillage is modest, however, this might not be a bad thing - my girlfriend loves the fragrance and frequently suggests that she only smells it when she enters &amp;#34;my space&amp;#34; - I am totally good with her being in &amp;#34;my space&amp;#34;..!!  Additionally, this might work out well in an office environment where the is no danger of the fragrance being offensive.  GV provides great flexibility - I am comfortable wearing daily in the office (yes, I do wear a suit and tie..), to more formal events, or even the casual outings.  While most reviewers suggest Spring and Summer for wear, given the &amp;#34;outdoorsy&amp;#34; notes of vetiver, I respectfully disagree - I like it in Fall and Winter (too..).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and packaging are first class.  I am especially fond of the bottle - something about it that exudes confidence.  Well done, Mr. Ford.  While probably still at the lower end of niche fragrances, the price/value is below average, but I would suggest that you cannot place a value on compliments and confidence while wearing the fragrance.  You will not be disappointed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Tom Ford&#x27;s Grey Vetiver is 4.5 stars out of 5.  This is a first class scent that everyone should have in their collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy your day and make it count... Invest your time rather than wasting it..</li>
            <li> I just love TF&#x27;s take on vetiver in this fragrance. It has a good dose of ISO-E-Super, gives it a very fresh, sparkly edge that balances out the musky,  woody vetiver aspect nicely. Lasts all day, just the right amount of projection. (Btw- don&#x27;t know why there is a picture of a Tommy Halfiger product here-- I did not get my bottle from Amazon, so make sure you know what you are getting).</li>
            <li> If anything the size was too big... got sick of it after a while, kna mean?  Great smelling scent though.  Tom Ford!</li>
            <li> Love this cologne,this one of his best! once you smell this you&#x27;ll fall in love with it.!!!! and not too strong of a scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;is refreshing and attracts attention from everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Vetiver is a very well-known classical frangnance plant..&lt;br /&gt;But this formula contains some igredients which balances its&lt;br /&gt;strong effect..&lt;br /&gt;It is especially preferrable for daytime use even in summer time..</li>
            <li> Very pleasant scent, however it is very light and does not stay long on the skin. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> good product and service</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t be a jobless moron and put this cologne on. It is for a man who actually has a job, has accomplished something and has some nice clothes.  Scent last for hours. It&#x27;s expensive but well worth it IMO. An elite cologne.</li>
            <li> This product is fake and smells cheap. The imitation vertiver fades away in less than 10 minutes. placing order through Amazon prime, I thought I was secured, but I was proved wrong. I wasted my $128 purchasing a crab.&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend it to antbody.</li>
            <li> Great product it was excellent smell Great for day time or night time use but it&lt;br /&gt; does not smell like a men fragnance</li>
            <li> Not Exactly what I was expecting but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Exotic smell, but I&#x27;m still wondering if bit lasts. I recommend it though cos the smell is very mature. It&#x27;s a bit expensive though</li>
            <li> I really like this parfume. It is manly and last all day long and then some. I can still smell a hint of it late evening. Others have described the notes so I have left that out. I have The House of Creed Original Vetiver. Creed Vetiver is very different more citrus and does not last very long on my skin. I may get a few hours, certainly it does not last a work day on me. Tom Ford will last the work day and the happy hour time too! Plus the price of this parfume is half to a third of the Creed which allows me to purchase another fragrance of my choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with overall purchasing experience of product. Great buy when you compare price of product versus quality of product..</li>
            <li> After sampling literally every men&#x27;s cologne at Sephora, and going through nearly every scent I can get my hands on from the House of Creed (including &amp;#34;Original Vetiver&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Vetiver (1948), aka JFK&#x27;s Vetiver&amp;#34;), I can say without a doubt that Tom Ford&#x27;s &amp;#34;Grey Vetiver&amp;#34; is astonishingly great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening notes are piercing, with a lot of sour citrus and of course, that green grassy vetiver. It may turn some people off, but give it a chance. It was love at first sniff for me, but I could see how others may need to warm up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base notes remind me of the earthy smell of sweet tobacco in very fine cigars, old oak houses which gives off a faint vanilla, and that lovely smokey vetiver grass dry down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sillage is high for the first hour or two. After the dry down, it stays close to the skin, at least it does on my skin. Resist the temptation to over indulge, two sprays is probably all you will need for an entire work day or night out. If you use too much, you are going to blow out the noses of anyone sharing an elevator with you, and you will ruin it for the rest of us. Don&#x27;t be that guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less is more with such a &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; scent. You are trying to draw in attention from those close to you, not leave a wake of grapefruit and green grass behind you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only scent I bought two full bottles of, because if it is ever retired, it would easily go for triple the retail price on eBay. I&#x27;ve seen it happen before, and I always want the option of wearing &amp;#34;Grey Vetiver&amp;#34; for special occasions or busy days at the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to abuse this scent because you want to reek like what you think a fancy guy would smell like, and spray it all over your body, please do everyone a favor and buy something else. This EDP is not for beginners. Creed&#x27;s &amp;#34;Original Vetiver&amp;#34; is probably better for someone starting out, and is very good in its own right. It&#x27;s much younger, and not at all offensive in any way. I like Creed&#x27;s version very much as well, and I do wear it for casual events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creed&#x27;s version is like jeans a nice button up shirt. Tom Ford&#x27;s version is more like a silk suit and tie.much younger, and not at all offensive in any way.

            <li> Just got my bottle of this grand cologne. Very eloquent scent that is much different than most of the colognes on the market. It has a sophistication about it that makes it regal. Ladies will turn their heads and stare with wanton eyes, so be on alert. This has moved ahead of Acqua Di Gio, John Varvatos, Guicci, D&amp;G the one in my opinion, oh well you get the point. This is top shelf hunting oil too be brought out for those times you are in a social event and as we say suited and booted for the occasion. For the cost not an everyday cologne unless you have the money to spend for more. If this cologne had a lower pricing point it would be the #1 cologne for men.</li>
            <li> Awesome! smells so good</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance after I read the comments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip :&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy any perfume Without  smell it  Or you have previous experience with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume  was very annoying and caused me a headache&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy it again</li>
            <li> My son does not like the scent, and I was not allowed to return it, even though it was unopened and un used.  I&#x27;m very unhappy about this!</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne, very fast delivery</li>
            <li> I Love it..It&#x27;s as it was to be.......</li>
            <li> Anything and everything Tom Ford.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  More of an everyday all day fresh scent. Light Citrus Vetiver perfection blended.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent, but was disappointed to see that the bottle that was shipped to me was clearly labeled \\&quot;TESTER\\&quot; and was not 100% full.  It was fairly filled to the top, but was not in new condition. Other than that, it arrived promptly and was thoroughly enjoyed for the short time it lasted!</li>
            <li> My first compliment was from an equestrian that said my smell reminded her of a horse. Lol. It&#x27;s more of a country folk kind of smell. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this if I lived in a city. I read a ton of reviews where people said it smelled sweet like a citrus, no way. This smells like leather that you would put on a horse.....</li>
            <li> Smells great!!! I bought this for my husband and we both love it!!!! Ready to order again!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Tom Ford anything.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance not to sweet, I like it but have only received one complement wearing it.</li>
            <li> I had posted the question about this being a real product or a fake. My wife went ahead and ordered it for me and I now have it. I believe this is a real product. The box it came in and the actual bottle itself are all top notch. The product smells just like the test sample I got from Nordstrom men section. I just don&#x27;t understand how Amazon is getting it this much cheaper if it is an actual real product. Maybe they are defectives? Or display models? I don&#x27;t know. But it appears to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> The best perfum for men.</li>
            <li> Best fragrance I&#x27;ve had in a while and I have many top quality fragrances I will grab more of Tom Ford Products I would highly recommend this fragrance..</li>
