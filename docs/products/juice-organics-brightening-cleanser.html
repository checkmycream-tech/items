            <li>Cleans makeup off &amp; skin looks great!</li>
            <li>A very good face wash, cleanses well without stripping your skin, but my skin tends to be a bit oily at times.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful with a wonderful scent and is paraben free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need a lot, it rinses off with no residue, and best of all it really made a difference in lightening my blotches.</li>
            <li>Its perfect for skin that is sensitive like mine.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and bright.  </li>
            <li>best part is that it was not harsh.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re not awful either</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>No nasty smell and</li>

            <li>I love the scent, and I love their moisturizer too.</li>
            <li>I love this and all the Juice Organics vitamin C products.  </li>
            <li>and I am noticing that my tone is becoming more even.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really not the best one to give a review.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and skin feels smooth and brighter, fresher looking.</li>
            <li>Knowing that I am not slathering a lot of chemicals on my skin is a huge bonus.  </li>
            <li>Your brightening cleanser is fabulous-</li>
            <li>Lathers up well and does clean off the make-up.</li>
            <li>Love this product so much I ordered another couple bottles.</li>
            <li>excellent customer service, make my face feel so clean and it lasts a long time I love this item and hope it will always be available as it is hard to find elsewhere</li>

            <li>It calms my skin and absolutely no allergic reaction of any kind.</li>
            <li>I love this product it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>

            <li>It really helps to know your ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Being that I have eczema, my skin is very sensitive but neither of these products break me out and they leave my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>If you have really sensitive skin or any less than happy skin, I would maybe start with the smaller trial size that comes with the moisturizer .</li>
            <li>So mild on my skin and rejuvenating at the same time.</li>
            <li>non-drying, even skin tone as stated on the product, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do however have quite sensitive skin, and I found it to be a bit much</li>
            <li>On to trying a new one when I use this one up.</li>
            <li>Other cleansers required me to really rub, or I had to use baby oil first before I applied the soap)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive mature acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It completely cleans my skin (even if I wear waterproof mascara, it takes it all off.  </li>
            <li>yet it is so gentle that I can open my eyes</li>
            <li>Check the whole line, I&#x27;m guessing same.</li>
            <li>IF IT DOESN&#x27;T STATE 100% NATURAL, you can probably bet there are man made ingredients.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the bottle and no real fragrance</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry and aging :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product had done what it said it would do. I love this product it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I am noticing that my tone is becoming more even. I have freckles so my skin can have a blotchy look sometime. This product is changing that. I have been using it on my body and I am noticing a difference there too. Its perfect for skin that is sensitive like mine.</li>
            <li> I actually like this product a lot. I use this at night and the Alba Botanica Pineapple Enzyme Facial Cleanser in the morning. Being that I have eczema, my skin is very sensitive but neither of these products break me out and they leave my skin feeling clean and soft. They both smell alike to me. Given they&#x27;re no Victoria&#x27;s Secret soaps but they&#x27;re not awful either and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger. The packaging was great. No leaking and arrived earlier than expected. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive mature acne prone skin. Plus it is winter so that adds to the dryness factor. This cleanser does not strip or dry out my skin. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I will not use anything on my face but Juice Organics products.  It is the only skin care line that actually works for me.  Knowing that I am not slathering a lot of chemicals on my skin is a huge bonus.  My skin is smooth and bright.  You&#x27;ve got to try Juice Organics products!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Love this product. So easy to use and skin feels smooth and brighter, fresher looking. Friends ask me what my secret is because they say I look so &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;. Bought the moisturizer also. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> excellent customer service, make my face feel so clean and it lasts a long time I love this item and hope it will always be available as it is hard to find elsewhere</li>
            <li> This product has worked great! Really cleansers and brightens my skin. It smells just like a tangerine. Wakes me up each and every morning.</li>
            <li> Used this as a morning cleanser while using The Body Shop Vitamin C Facial Radiance Powder and the combination worked wonders. I have the problem of picking at my face, and not getting enough sleep. I have to say I kept get questions about my glow and liveliness while using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it was not harsh. Does have a weird smell but it goes away once you rinse your face off.</li>
            <li> A very good face wash, cleanses well without stripping your skin, but my skin tends to be a bit oily at times.  No nasty smell and it is organic.</li>
            <li> This product burns my eyes and my face broke out. This product is to harsh for my skin. Will not use or buy again.</li>
            <li> non-drying, even skin tone as stated on the product, highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I am expecting even better result giving it more time.</li>
            <li> I have combination/oily skin and it is the only thing that didn&#x27;t cause blackheads and has cleared my skin and blemishes. It&#x27;s wonderful with a wonderful scent and is paraben free. IT doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out either so the moisturizer really isn&#x27;t necessary but it does make your face alot smoother and softer</li>
            <li> Love this product so much I ordered another couple bottles. Cleans makeup off &amp; skin looks great! Love the smell too :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cleanser for almost 4 years now (ever since I discovered it).  It completely cleans my skin (even if I wear waterproof mascara, it takes it all off.  Other cleansers required me to really rub, or I had to use baby oil first before I applied the soap) yet it is so gentle that I can open my eyes and it does not sting.  It&#x27;s not easy to find locally, so I have to purchase online. I only wish Amazon would keep it in stock, it seems like it&#x27;s hit or miss as to whether or not I can purchase it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of trying a gel cleanser, I usually like cream or oil cleansers, but I really like this. It rinses well, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dried out. I do however have quite sensitive skin, and I found it to be a bit much (I think the citrus) for use twice a day. I would have some redder spots after using, but it is always the same spots. I think that area was already irritated, and it says on the product not to use on irritated skin. I started using it once a day, usually at night, and I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Cream Cleanser or diluted Dr Bronner&#x27;s in the morning. No problems with irritation using it once a day. I love the scent, and I love their moisturizer too. I would recommend this. If you have really sensitive skin or any less than happy skin, I would maybe start with the smaller trial size that comes with the moisturizer .</li>
            <li> This removes all my makeup and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or dry.  Perfect for dry and aging :( skin.</li>
            <li> So mild on my skin and rejuvenating at the same time.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have raised brown patches on my skin from the sun. I was using a cleanser priced 3 times higher than this one. Your brightening cleanser is fabulous-I don&#x27;t need a lot, it rinses off with no residue, and best of all it really made a difference in lightening my blotches.Overall, my pores look smaller and I look rested.&lt;br /&gt; Also,some products make me itch and this did not.I am a fan!</li>
            <li> This product IS 20% SYNTHETIC MAN MADE PRODUCTS.  Check the whole line, I&#x27;m guessing same. I don&#x27;t know about you, but am REALLY tired of companies that try to mislead the public into believing a product is something that it is CLEARLY NOT.  It really helps to know your ingredients.  Go to EWG.ORG or any ingredient definition website can let you know which companies are pulling this stunt.  IF IT DOESN&#x27;T STATE 100% NATURAL, you can probably bet there are man made ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly changing cleaners so I&#x27;m really not the best one to give a review. That said, I&#x27;m trying to get into organic products and I do like this one. Lathers up well and does clean off the make-up. Not crazy about the bottle and no real fragrance (but I guess that&#x27;s what you get with Organic products. On to trying a new one when I use this one up.</li>
            <li> I love this and all the Juice Organics vitamin C products.  It calms my skin and absolutely no allergic reaction of any kind.</li>
