    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I  bought ones of these to frreshen the cig smell in my house, and it is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>These are the best candles.  </li>
            <li>The candle burns wonderfully, BUT.....</li>
            <li>It was a very good price, so I added it to my order.  </li>
            <li>Its great.</li>
            <li>and the house smelt great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely great for removing smoke, pet and cooking odors.  </li>
            <li>They work great.</li>
            <li>I am probably going to be ordering more!!  </li>
            <li>does a good job of eliminating smoke odor without adding scent to the household.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with these candles.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the ones not in the jar, but still quite effective.  </li>
            <li>They Work, OK!  </li>
            <li>She reports that it is a nice candle but did nothing to help the cigarette odor or smoke in her apartment.</li>
            <li>nice product</li>
            <li>I like the scent citrus and wood oils, this is one nice candle  </li>
            <li>But I sure am enjoying not having to listen to my family whining!</li>
            <li>Works great when first lit but losses potency after 3 hours of being lit.</li>
            <li>better than this candle.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so let&#x27;s just put it out there.</li>
            <li>Tried Febreeze Air Effects (both the spray and the machine with the disks), Lysol Air Sanitizer and Renuzit and this one candle worked better in 20 minutes than all the air fresheners, etc.</li>
            <li>Its a scented candle, and nothing more.  </li>
            <li>These candles work good for me,but there is no way they are worth the RIP OFF prices online</li>
            <li>I just love them.</li>
            <li>I personally love this candle with its clean smell and is effective on removing smoke odor in small/medium spaces.</li>
            <li>, The scent is a nice clean cedar and citrus and burns for about 48 hours or so.</li>
            <li>It does not remove all the smell of smoke, but it does work pretty good.</li>
            <li>They burn  forever and give off a pleasant scent that makes everything fresh and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure this is a fine product, and would probably have done the job quite well for a smoker who has a reduced ability to smell, I was looking for something to help with the smell of my roommate&#x27;s smoking.  </li>
            <li>well, success brings it own burdens along with it&#x27;s rewards.</li>
            <li>Yes it doesnt have a strong fragrance</li>
            <li>It gives off a light scent...</li>
            <li>But when I light this candle, I do not smell smoke anymore.</li>
            <li>Works best in small rooms when not smoking.</li>
            <li>Your home will smell fresh and clean with no cover up odor.</li>
            <li>It is a clean and fresh smell without perfumes.</li>
            <li>I recomend this candle to ANYONE who wants to say &#x27;I&#x27;m not standing out there in that weather ANYMORE to enjoy what I enjoy&#x27; and buy this.</li>
            <li>and it went right into the trash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only downside is that similar to another reviewer i can now smell the smoke residue on my clothes and furniture which is, I suppose, the best sign of success for my three-step smoke elimination program but will entail more money being spent on fabric deodorizers - oh</li>
            <li>I was able to open up my door not even 3 minutes after I was through smoking</li>
            <li>They are selling this too high!!</li>
            <li>and she was absolutely astounded that it didn&#x27;t smell at all!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a confirmed smoker and recently realized that i was also an inconsiderate one when my neighbors across the hallway mentioned that they had experienced problems with my smoke not only seeping into the hallway but actually making it into their apartment as well.</li>
            <li>Has a cedar/citrus smell almost like citronella but not as strong and a bit different.</li>
            <li>however this candle(1) is tough enough to handle my 730/sq/ft condo, you guys are awesome!</li>
            <li>The bigger candle isn&#x27;t made to cover cigarette odors, but the scent is powerful enough that it does (without being overwhelming). . .</li>
            <li>and OMG my whole room smelt like mint.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li>Between the three of them I think I&#x27;ve cleared up both the air in the apartment and the relationship with my neighbors, so a real win-win to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works really well in the bathroom, but do prefer the vanilla scented smokers candle.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything more to mask odors in my home than your average match.  </li>
            <li>Will remove any odor particular, seafood or fried food orders in your house.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly if you are a smoker or need to get rid of kitchen,pet, and smoke odors.  </li>
            <li>The light of a live flame and the soft fragrance of wood oils candles are sensual, but add to the atmosphere of a family meal or a dinner party just as much as to a romantic dinner for two.</li>
            <li>&quot; that are a part of the \\&quot;magic green dot\\</li>
            <li>When the candle is on a flat candle holder it doesn&#x27;t ever drip wax, it usually burns a hole perfectly in the middle of the candle almost like the outside of the candle is a candle holder.</li>
            <li>and I can smell smoke right outside the door.</li>
            <li>For half the price of this I bought a candle in a jar that is four times bigger and has a much better scent.</li>
            <li>These candles are hard to find, so I was really glad when I found them on-line.  </li>
            <li>but it completely eliminated it.</li>
            <li>I had a smoke in my bedroom near the lit candle.</li>
            <li>Time for action methinks and started with the search for odor eliminator candles rather than the scented</li>
            <li>In conclusion: another $10 down the drain because I believed the positive reviews I read here instead of the more realistic negative reviews.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last very long considering their size ,but they do work very well while they last!</li>
            <li>Smell is not overwhelming but keeps room smelling fresh.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I suggest to put the candle on a flat candle holder if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> This candle does work but it has to be burning a long time.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical, but it really does work!!!  </li>
            <li> It has an artificial scent like most other \\&quot;scented\\&quot; candles.  </li>
            <li> They work better than any candles I&#x27;ve ever used to get rid of bad smells.</li>
            <li> and we get that wet dog smell some days.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t try it for eliminating other odors.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy this again - will choose other scent.</li>
            <li> I had placed an order for other items and this was a &amp;#</li>
            <li> No better than a low quality scented candle</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried a couple of them by other manufacturers and these have come out tops for effectiveness and value; mind you, the candles are used in a three step process that also uses a smokeless ashtray and a True-Air air cleaner with smoke killer filters.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty unpleasant outside.</li>
            <li> not really worth purchasing online, however, as the shipping doubles the price</li>
            <li> Helps cut down on the tobacco smell in a smoking room.</li>
            <li> might work for other people, but I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> So I came across this little genius of a candle at Walmart (now they don&#x27;t sell them anymore)</li>
            <li> And they came a little dented...</li>
            <li> I do not react to real essential oils, only to artificial fragrances.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well these candles would work in a heavy smoking area</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have that heavy choking smell that scented candles or sprays have.</li>
            <li> If you are a smoker, you definitely need to get at least one of these candles!!</li>
            <li> This little candle seriously saved my butt quite a few times.</li>
            <li> As a non smoker, I am also chemically sensitive and react to artificial fragrances.  </li>
            <li> the packaging was not as thorough as usual with Amazon products.</li>
            <li> sometimes you can hardly smell it.</li>
            <li> there is hardly any smell from it ever, and as for hiding odors...</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> You would be silly not to at least try it.</li>
            <li> I secretly tried it out on my husband and he didn&#x27;t smell the cigarettes either.</li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY,  DOES NOT BURN EVENLY,  DOES NOT GET RID</li>
            <li> Ive found putting it in a candle holder that the candle completly seats in like a hurricane candle holder it burns sloppy for some reason it tends to start folding in and melting.</li>
            <li> I bought a Smoker&#x27;s Candle and although I was skeptical, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Didnt work as well as i thought, and too expensive.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;It stinks in here!\\</li>
            <li> My husband and 16-year-old daughter hate my smoking.</li>
            <li> Within about 15 minutes of opening the package I had a nasty headache from the \\&quot;aromatherapy oils\\</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works well.  not really worth purchasing online, however, as the shipping doubles the price</li>
            <li> The candle helps with the smoke in the house. It is smaller than anticipated though. Works great when first lit but losses potency after 3 hours of being lit.</li>
            <li> 1) It doesn&#x27;t do anything for the smell of smoke. I left it burning for two hours after I smoked one cigarette in the room and it still smelled when I came back.  2) The oils that are supposed to mix with the wax and eliminate the odor make me lightheaded and give me a headache.  3) For half the price of this I bought a candle in a jar that is four times bigger and has a much better scent. The bigger candle isn&#x27;t made to cover cigarette odors, but the scent is powerful enough that it does (without being overwhelming). . . better than this candle.  In conclusion: another $10 down the drain because I believed the positive reviews I read here instead of the more realistic negative reviews.</li>
            <li> This candle does work but it has to be burning a long time. It gives off a light scent...sometimes you can hardly smell it. But it does do the job. My husband smokes in our bedroom and I can smell smoke right outside the door. But when I light this candle, I do not smell smoke anymore. Its great.</li>
            <li> I got this candle for a friend. She reports that it is a nice candle but did nothing to help the cigarette odor or smoke in her apartment.</li>
            <li> 2 of the candles i purchased split and all of the wax and oil leaked out.</li>
            <li> Okay, so let&#x27;s just put it out there. I smoke, just not tobacco. So I was in the market for things that would even just &#x27;cover up&#x27; the smell. My spouse HATES the smell of the stuff and therefore I&#x27;m always stuck outside, no matter the weather or people around. So I came across this little genius of a candle at Walmart (now they don&#x27;t sell them anymore) and OMG my whole room smelt like mint. And THATS IT. Just mint. There was no lingering residue or anything. So not only did this candle &#x27;cover up&#x27; the smell but it completely eliminated it. With a dabble of room spray I was able to open up my door not even 3 minutes after I was through smoking and the house smelt great. This little candle seriously saved my butt quite a few times. You would be silly not to at least try it. It&#x27;s $10.00 here but at Walmart they sell the same brand for about $4.00 (if you can find it). I recomend this candle to ANYONE who wants to say &#x27;I&#x27;m not standing out there in that weather ANYMORE to enjoy what I enjoy&#x27; and buy this. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I  bought ones of these to frreshen the cig smell in my house, and it is wonderful!  They burn  forever and give off a pleasant scent that makes everything fresh and clean smelling.  I found mine a Walmart for $3.84 and bought a box of 12 because they worked so well.  Recommend highly if you are a smoker or need to get rid of kitchen,pet, and smoke odors.  Would be grat for bathroom, too.</li>
            <li> Works best in small rooms when not smoking. Has a cedar/citrus smell almost like citronella but not as strong and a bit different. Does seem to neutralize odors but I would prefer it in a tin as tins release fragrance stronger.</li>
            <li> I personally love this candle with its clean smell and is effective on removing smoke odor in small/medium spaces. Yes it doesnt have a strong fragrance but it works but I suggest to put the candle on a flat candle holder if that makes sense. I&#x27;ve noticed with using this candle over 2 years it will burn a lot cleaner. Ive found putting it in a candle holder that the candle completly seats in like a hurricane candle holder it burns sloppy for some reason it tends to start folding in and melting. Just my review though. When the candle is on a flat candle holder it doesn&#x27;t ever drip wax, it usually burns a hole perfectly in the middle of the candle almost like the outside of the candle is a candle holder. and it burns the to the bottom instead of wasting a lot of the candle.&lt;br /&gt;CON: They are selling this too high!! As some WalMart stores &amp; Some online stores sells them for $4.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, The scent is a nice clean cedar and citrus and burns for about 48 hours or so.</li>
            <li> My husband and 16-year-old daughter hate my smoking. If I smoke in the house they complain for days, \\&quot;It stinks in here!\\&quot; so I smoke outside on my patio. Well, it&#x27;s summer in Florida and let me tell you, it&#x27;s pretty unpleasant outside. I bought a Smoker&#x27;s Candle and although I was skeptical, I gave it a try. I had a smoke in my bedroom near the lit candle. About 10 minutes after I finished, my daughter came in my room to tell me something. She didn&#x27;t say a word about the \\&quot;stink\\&quot;. I told her that I had just smoked in here and she was absolutely astounded that it didn&#x27;t smell at all! I secretly tried it out on my husband and he didn&#x27;t smell the cigarettes either. Now keep in mind that this is one person having an occasional smoke in a big house. I don&#x27;t know how well these candles would work in a heavy smoking area and I didn&#x27;t try it for eliminating other odors. But I sure am enjoying not having to listen to my family whining! I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> POOR QUALITY,  DOES NOT BURN EVENLY,  DOES NOT GET RID&lt;br /&gt;OF SMOTE ODOR</li>
            <li> These are the best candles.  Will remove any odor particular, seafood or fried food orders in your house.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great for removing smoke, pet and cooking odors.  Tried Febreeze Air Effects (both the spray and the machine with the disks), Lysol Air Sanitizer and Renuzit and this one candle worked better in 20 minutes than all the air fresheners, etc. that I tried.  If you smoke and don&#x27;t want your house to smell like you do, this is the candle for you!!  Your home will smell fresh and clean with no cover up odor.</li>
            <li> no scent.  does a good job of eliminating smoke odor without adding scent to the household.  also eliminates frying/baking odors in kitchen.  nice product</li>
            <li> The candle burns wonderfully, BUT.....there is hardly any smell from it ever, and as for hiding odors...NOT, a definate no! I was very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I used these when I used to smoke years ago. I started using them again because we have dogs and we get that wet dog smell some days. They work great. They don&#x27;t have that heavy choking smell that scented candles or sprays have.</li>
            <li> These candles are hard to find, so I was really glad when I found them on-line.  They work better than any candles I&#x27;ve ever used to get rid of bad smells.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the ones not in the jar, but still quite effective.  We have cats and it works quite well with pet odor.</li>
            <li> Didnt work as well as i thought, and too expensive.</li>
            <li> Works well for the house. It does not remove all the smell of smoke, but it does work pretty good. I reccommend this candle to my friends. But it is cheaper at walmart!</li>
            <li> Its a scented candle, and nothing more.  It didn&#x27;t do anything more to mask odors in my home than your average match.  It has an artificial scent like most other \\&quot;scented\\&quot; candles.  I found the scent made me nauseous after a short time burning.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure this is a fine product, and would probably have done the job quite well for a smoker who has a reduced ability to smell, I was looking for something to help with the smell of my roommate&#x27;s smoking.  As a non smoker, I am also chemically sensitive and react to artificial fragrances.  Within about 15 minutes of opening the package I had a nasty headache from the \\&quot;aromatherapy oils\\&quot; that are a part of the \\&quot;magic green dot\\&quot; in this product.  I didn&#x27;t even get around to lighting the darn thing to see if it worked.  I had to wrap it in a plactic bag to cut the smell and it went right into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;This might work for other people, but I wasted my money.  I do not react to real essential oils, only to artificial fragrances.  Maybe some people don&#x27;t know the difference.</li>
            <li> And they came a little dented...the packaging was not as thorough as usual with Amazon products. I won&#x27;t buy this again - will choose other scent.</li>
            <li> I had placed an order for other items and this was a &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; item.  It was a very good price, so I added it to my order.  I am a smoker, and it stated that it removes tobacco odors.  I have to admit I was skeptical, but it really does work!!!  I am probably going to be ordering more!!  If you are a smoker, you definitely need to get at least one of these candles!!</li>
            <li> I like the scent citrus and wood oils, this is one nice candle  The light of a live flame and the soft fragrance of wood oils candles are sensual, but add to the atmosphere of a family meal or a dinner party just as much as to a romantic dinner for two.</li>
            <li> No better than a low quality scented candle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a confirmed smoker and recently realized that i was also an inconsiderate one when my neighbors across the hallway mentioned that they had experienced problems with my smoke not only seeping into the hallway but actually making it into their apartment as well. Time for action methinks and started with the search for odor eliminator candles rather than the scented ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried a couple of them by other manufacturers and these have come out tops for effectiveness and value; mind you, the candles are used in a three step process that also uses a smokeless ashtray and a True-Air air cleaner with smoke killer filters. Between the three of them I think I&#x27;ve cleared up both the air in the apartment and the relationship with my neighbors, so a real win-win to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that similar to another reviewer i can now smell the smoke residue on my clothes and furniture which is, I suppose, the best sign of success for my three-step smoke elimination program but will entail more money being spent on fabric deodorizers - oh well, success brings it own burdens along with it&#x27;s rewards.</li>
            <li> Helps cut down on the tobacco smell in a smoking room.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with these candles. Smell is not overwhelming but keeps room smelling fresh. Even helps eliminate dog odors. I will keep using.</li>
            <li> These candles work good for me,but there is no way they are worth the RIP OFF prices online, i got them at the dollar tree for a dollar a piece,but dollar tree only has them sometimes.</li>
            <li> Items work well.  A bit pricey...shop around.</li>
            <li> They Work, OK!  They don&#x27;t last very long considering their size ,but they do work very well while they last!</li>
            <li> I smoke, my girlfriend smokes, my roommate smokes, eeehh... however this candle(1) is tough enough to handle my 730/sq/ft condo, you guys are awesome!</li>
            <li> Definitely remove the odor of cigarettes. It is a clean and fresh smell without perfumes. I just love them. I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Works really well in the bathroom, but do prefer the vanilla scented smokers candle.</li>
