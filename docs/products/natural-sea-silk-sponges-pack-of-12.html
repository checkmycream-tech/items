            <li>I love these sea sponges, they work amazing</li>
            <li>They are the exact sponges at a much better price!!</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like these.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a makeup sponge to replace the Max Factor one that is no longer on the market and these have worked out even better.  </li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>SO glad I can save money.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t need to toss a bunch of tampons in the trash when I get my period, I can just wash and reuse these.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to change and sanitize as needed.</li>
            <li>I love the sea sponges.</li>
            <li>One broke after washing it but 1 out of 12 is ok.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find these as MF sponges have almost disappeared.</li>
            <li>I dont know what more I can say I will buy more if I need some bye bye.</li>
            <li>They work best if you wet them with warm water, towel dry and then put your toner on them, they are perfect.</li>
            <li>These were of a good size and very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>These soft sea sponges are an excellent alternative to tampons, and work far better for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>They are more flexible, get into nooks and crannies better, and clean up easier.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better for applying makeup smoothly.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for helping us find good products!-------But now</li>
            <li>They rinse out and clean up much better than the Max Factor sponge as well.</li>
            <li>Showed a couple of friends how easily foundation was to apply using this item, now I&#x27;ll have to order again.</li>
            <li>all sponges meet my expectations and are easy to use</li>
            <li>While that shape is pretty much perfect to use as a tampon, I will not be putting that sponge in my vagina!&lt;br /&gt;The majority of the sea sponge tampons I received were very flat.</li>
            <li>but they are no longer available.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for &#x27;natural sea sponge&#x27; makeup sponges for many years now, so I was thrilled when I saw these available.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, I am a repeat customer, always fast shipping too :-)</li>
            <li>These do such a nice job of applying makeup sheerly; I&#x27;m thrilled to have found them.</li>
            <li>Maintaining and sanitizing the sponges is easy; I found 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar to 8oz of warm water to be an easy and inexpensive way to sanitize them, and they have stayed soft and adsorbent through washes.  </li>
            <li>These little sponges are the perfect size for applying makeup and are such a good price, even with the added shipping cost.  </li>
            <li>You can use a baking soda and water soak or a vinegar and water soak to do this and they will be clean cause vinegar and baking soda</li>
            <li>You can clean these sponges this way even if you are using them for make up purposes and not as sea sponge tampons.</li>
            <li>It looks like they took perfectly good sea sponges and cut them up into tiny 1&amp;#34; sponges.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>they were the right size to apply liquid make-up and smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>These sponges are exactly what they claim to be and are fine for what I ordered them for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for makeup applications with a particularly crappy foundation that I thought would be better</li>
            <li>These are great little sea sponges.  </li>
            <li>Just moisten them up a little and it works great to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>I was going to return them, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it because I would have to pay the postage for the return.</li>
            <li>So far I love them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the deal is, but first the Max Factor sponges started having huge holes in them so that they&#x27;d break apart easily, and then they just seemed to be completely unavailable.</li>
            <li>Other than that they were a good size &amp;</li>
            <li>they worked great, came in pretty much the right size and shape already so minimal trimming.</li>
            <li>These were just what I wanted - the right size and texture.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>moistened, they are very soft and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Perfect for their tiny little fingers!</li>
            <li>These sponges were exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>so they need to be cleaned out first.</li>
            <li>overall I would recommend these sponges to someone who could get more use out of them than I.</li>
            <li>I soak mine in vinegar and hot water to sanitize them before using.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to disinfect properly before usage.  </li>
            <li>I find it harder and harder to find these cosmetic sea sponges around town and to be able to buy them in bulk at a good price is a plus.  </li>
            <li>have yet to disinfect my sponges, but right now there are a lot of debris on and in them and it is very unappealing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just what I was looking for a soft natural sea sponge. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried this with meow cosmetics (AMAZING BRAND) minerals foundation, just slightly damp, and it works well.</li>
            <li>Excellent cosmetic sponges - very hard to find locally.</li>
            <li>I will never go back, so comfortable.  </li>
            <li>They might work better if you get them wet.  </li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that&#x27;s not what they are really made for?</li>
            <li>They came fast, package looked like the picture.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others (and already have!).</li>
            <li>As are many other reviewers, I am using these as tampons.</li>
            <li>The level of comfort is unbelievable, and they are so absorbent that you can even dare to wear your favorite undies!  </li>
            <li>I boiled them first and so far</li>
            <li>Upon arrival I noticed that many had flat, straight edges, or facets, indicating they were sliced into peices from one larger sponge.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and comfortable when wet and very absorbent.</li>
            <li>These sponges would be good if they were larger, but they are just too small and not convenient to use.  </li>
            <li>I did receive 12, as advertised, of varying sizes, but definitely enough of the right size for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were none of these to be found in the town where I live so</li>
            <li>did soak mine in warm water and Melaleuca (Green Tea Tree) essential oil for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Ordered these because can no longer get Max Factor natural makeup sponges.  </li>
            <li>These range from soft to firmer in texture depending on the sponge.</li>
            <li>cause these were once alive they may have dirt, grit, or what not in them</li>
            <li>have anti microbial and anti fungal properties so you can naturally sanitize your sponges without chemicals.</li>
            <li>They were so soft after being soaked and sanitized.</li>
            <li>I even started to use them with a homemade spermicide as a natural contraceptive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use some whole and some I have sliced with a bread knife to make a flat pad for cosmetic toner.  </li>
            <li>so I essentially bought two years worth of the equate of sea pearls for only ten bucks.</li>
            <li>You cant like put them in dry or use them straight away</li>
            <li>This might be kind of weird, but I use these sea sponges as a natural, reusable alternative to tampons.</li>
            <li>My advise is that if you are using them in place of sea pearl sponge tampons is to sanitize them and you have to wet them and wring them out as much as you can before use so they are soft.</li>
            <li>I soaked these in hot vinegar water and let air dry and divided them up into 3s to store for later.</li>
            <li>4 of which are big and round enough to use as a natural tampon (size mini to light).</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because some of the sponges had some funky looking stuff on the ends, which is natural.</li>
            <li>These Natural Sea Silk Sponges are much different.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that these may shred or tear easy, but I&#x27;ve been presently surprised how tough they are.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy these again next year when I need more, since they last for at least a year when used properly.</li>
            <li>This month is the first time I&#x27;ve ever shopped online, so I was a little nervous about ordering.  </li>
            <li>out of the 12, I think there were about 8 that were the right size and not too holey or small.</li>
            <li>These are tiny, almost too small to be useful.  </li>

            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others (and already have!).</li>
            <li> As are many other reviewers, I am using these as tampons.</li>
            <li> The level of comfort is unbelievable, and they are so absorbent that you can even dare to wear your favorite undies!  </li>
            <li> I boiled them first and so far</li>
            <li> Upon arrival I noticed that many had flat, straight edges, or facets, indicating they were sliced into peices from one larger sponge.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and comfortable when wet and very absorbent.</li>
            <li> These sponges would be good if they were larger, but they are just too small and not convenient to use.  </li>
            <li> I did receive 12, as advertised, of varying sizes, but definitely enough of the right size for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were none of these to be found in the town where I live so</li>
            <li> did soak mine in warm water and Melaleuca (Green Tea Tree) essential oil for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Ordered these because can no longer get Max Factor natural makeup sponges.  </li>
            <li> These range from soft to firmer in texture depending on the sponge.</li>
            <li> cause these were once alive they may have dirt, grit, or what not in them</li>
            <li> have anti microbial and anti fungal properties so you can naturally sanitize your sponges without chemicals.</li>
            <li> They were so soft after being soaked and sanitized.</li>
            <li> I even started to use them with a homemade spermicide as a natural contraceptive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use some whole and some I have sliced with a bread knife to make a flat pad for cosmetic toner.  </li>
            <li> so I essentially bought two years worth of the equate of sea pearls for only ten bucks.</li>
            <li> You cant like put them in dry or use them straight away</li>
            <li> This might be kind of weird, but I use these sea sponges as a natural, reusable alternative to tampons.</li>
            <li> My advise is that if you are using them in place of sea pearl sponge tampons is to sanitize them and you have to wet them and wring them out as much as you can before use so they are soft.</li>
            <li> I soaked these in hot vinegar water and let air dry and divided them up into 3s to store for later.</li>
            <li> 4 of which are big and round enough to use as a natural tampon (size mini to light).</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because some of the sponges had some funky looking stuff on the ends, which is natural.</li>
            <li> These Natural Sea Silk Sponges are much different.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that these may shred or tear easy, but I&#x27;ve been presently surprised how tough they are.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy these again next year when I need more, since they last for at least a year when used properly.</li>
            <li> This month is the first time I&#x27;ve ever shopped online, so I was a little nervous about ordering.  </li>
            <li> out of the 12, I think there were about 8 that were the right size and not too holey or small.</li>
            <li> These are tiny, almost too small to be useful.  </li>
            <li> One sponge was a very very odd shape and texture, im going to guess it was either man made or just really jacked up.</li>
            <li> These were flat and tiny: think cotton disc in sponge form.</li>
            <li> But I personally have no use for the flat ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also not natural,, just bigger sponges cut into pieces.</li>
            <li> A complete let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a menstrual cup for years, but unlike a cup, these sponges are easy to insert and don&#x27;t run the risk of shifting into an uncomfortable angle if you are jogging or working out.</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t bother me as much as how firm and scratchy they remain when wet...</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as sea sponge tampons because of their low price for 12 sponges and other people were doing it also.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive 12 songes total.</li>
            <li> The picture shows each sponge as a naturally curved individual piece (like a small plant).</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a make-up sponge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these, as they are impossible to find in local stores.    </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected!</li>
            <li> These are small and soft, but the batch I recieved had these gross black creatures/specks in three of the sponges.</li>
            <li> Way too rough for my skin.  </li>
            <li> They are quite rough.  </li>
            <li> I use wet to apply make up.</li>
            <li> Small pieces cut from a larger sponge.  </li>
            <li> The silk sponges are too small to hold the water necessary to apply water based make-up evenly.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting cylindrical or spherical shape like every other sponge I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> One package contained 9 and the other 11.</li>
            <li> I am not willing to use any of them, because I don&#x27;t know what these things a</li>
            <li> Very rough.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that neither package had 12 in it.</li>
            <li> im talking less then a inch</li>
            <li> Like how firm they are.</li>
            <li> It was very rough, hard and in the shape of a beer barrel.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately what I received was 12 pieces of a larger cut up sponge.  </li>
            <li> Small, but not too small.</li>
            <li> They are stiff and hard and hurt my face.</li>
            <li> i have ordered these before from a different seller and the quality was very poor.  </li>
            <li> They are approximately 2 inches by 1 inch by 1/2 inch (average).</li>
            <li> No nice rounded corners or anything.</li>
            <li> so basically I got four sets of &#x27; sea pearls&#x27; for about 2.50 a set when you break it down whereas a package of sea pearls which come in twos cost over 30 dollars which is stupid, and sea pearls are suppose to last you about 3-6 months</li>
            <li> Quality not good for cosmetic use.</li>
            <li> Useless,, too small.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the response from the vendor, I feel their customer service needs work.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find them in the stores that used to sell them.</li>
            <li> These are outrageously expensive to purchase in stores, if you can even find them.  </li>
            <li> I used these as sea sponge tampons cause those sea pearls are expensive as eff.</li>
            <li> My mom drove me crazy when Maybelline stopped selling these.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product, I am a repeat customer, always fast shipping too :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these for something that requires the sponges each be aesthetically pleasing. The picture shows each sponge as a naturally curved individual piece (like a small plant). Unfortunately what I received was 12 pieces of a larger cut up sponge.  Well, I could have done that! Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a make-up sponge for a long time. wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like these. But I love them !! They are just what I need. Small, but not too small. Perfect.!!</li>
            <li> These are great little sea sponges.  Not only can you use them to apply makeup, but they work well when you are working clay (hand building or wheel throwing).  Update in response to question/comment:  They are approximately 2 inches by 1 inch by 1/2 inch (average).</li>
            <li> I use these instead of microfiber and/or non-natural sponges. They are more flexible, get into nooks and crannies better, and clean up easier. I was concerned that these may shred or tear easy, but I&#x27;ve been presently surprised how tough they are. They feel good in the hand and they&#x27;re cute!</li>
            <li> Received very quickly, in perfect condition.  I bought these to replace all those cotton balls I&#x27;m throwing away ( several a day ).  I&#x27;ve use some whole and some I have sliced with a bread knife to make a flat pad for cosmetic toner.  They work best if you wet them with warm water, towel dry and then put your toner on them, they are perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as sea sponge tampons. I sterilized them using directions from Jade and Pearl (which is where I used to get sea sponge tampons) and they worked great! out of the 12, I think there were about 8 that were the right size and not too holey or small. Can&#x27;t get a better deal for this!</li>
            <li> Small pieces cut from a larger sponge.  Junk.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for wedding spa favors. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because some of the sponges had some funky looking stuff on the ends, which is natural. I just cut it off and that worked, but you could tell. Other than that they were a good size &amp; just what I was looking for a soft natural sea sponge. :-)</li>
            <li> Excellent cosmetic sponges - very hard to find locally. Super fast shipping. Used to purchase MaxFactor sponges but they are no longer available.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these sponges!!  I was searching for a makeup sponge to replace the Max Factor one that is no longer on the market and these have worked out even better.  Just moisten them up a little and it works great to apply makeup.  They rinse out and clean up much better than the Max Factor sponge as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my soap making...</li>
            <li> Useless,, too small. Also not natural,, just bigger sponges cut into pieces. No nice rounded corners or anything. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> Quality not good for cosmetic use.</li>
            <li> The silk sponges are too small to hold the water necessary to apply water based make-up evenly.  I&#x27;ve been using this same make for thirty-five years.  The original Max Factor sponges were/are the best.  But since being manufactured in Japan the $$$ is out of sight!</li>
            <li> Good for arts and crafts projects.</li>
            <li> I was expecting cylindrical or spherical shape like every other sponge I&#x27;ve ever seen. These were flat and tiny: think cotton disc in sponge form.</li>
            <li> beautiful sea sponges just as in the photo</li>
            <li> These are tiny, almost too small to be useful.  It looks like they took perfectly good sea sponges and cut them up into tiny 1&amp;#34; sponges. I had expected natural sea sponges, not chopped up ones.  A complete let down.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for applying makeup.  Way too rough for my skin.  I contacted the vendor with my concern.  I was not happy with the response from the vendor, I feel their customer service needs work. I was going to return them, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it because I would have to pay the postage for the return.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the deal is, but first the Max Factor sponges started having huge holes in them so that they&#x27;d break apart easily, and then they just seemed to be completely unavailable. I&#x27;ve been buying art sponges and making do with those, but these are *so* much better (and cheaper)! These do such a nice job of applying makeup sheerly; I&#x27;m thrilled to have found them.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges, they are great to use in application of my foundation makeup.&lt;br /&gt;When moistened, they are very soft and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> These sponges were exactly what I was looking for. There is nothing better for applying makeup smoothly. I was unable to find them in the stores that used to sell them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  I i have ordered these before from a different seller and the quality was very poor.  These are perfect.  Love them.  Shared with my daughter.</li>
            <li> I got these as sea sponge tampons as well. I boiled them first and so far so good. SO glad I can save money.</li>
            <li> These are the best, I use them instead of tampons.  I will never go back, so comfortable.  Don&#x27;t even know they are there.</li>
            <li> These sponges are exactly what they claim to be and are fine for what I ordered them for. My only complaint is that neither package had 12 in it. One package contained 9 and the other 11. For a total of 20 sponges. Oh well-that&#x27;s plenty. I won&#x27;t need to order them again for awhile so I can shop around.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the Max Factor sponges I used to use but can no longer find. I used these sponges to blend my foundation. These Natural Sea Silk Sponges are much different.  They are stiff and hard and hurt my face. They might work better if you get them wet.  I ended up getting a Beauty Blender instead.  It&#x27;s more expensive but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Great for applying makeup</li>
            <li> These are outrageously expensive to purchase in stores, if you can even find them.  These were of a good size and very reasonably priced.  Showed a couple of friends how easily foundation was to apply using this item, now I&#x27;ll have to order again.</li>
            <li> Best deal I have ever found. Product is great.</li>
            <li> I use these sponges for applying makeup and they do a great job.  There were none of these to be found in the town where I live so it was so great to be able to get them via internet.</li>
            <li> This might be kind of weird, but I use these sea sponges as a natural, reusable alternative to tampons. They work great! They are soft and comfortable when wet and very absorbent. I love that I don&#x27;t need to toss a bunch of tampons in the trash when I get my period, I can just wash and reuse these.</li>
            <li> These little sponges are the perfect size for applying makeup and are such a good price, even with the added shipping cost.  I&#x27;m so glad I found these, as they are impossible to find in local stores.    This month is the first time I&#x27;ve ever shopped online, so I was a little nervous about ordering.  The written reviews helped me decide which ones to get and I&#x27;m so happy I chose these.  I have no complaints, whatsoever, on this order.  It arrived on the third day from the order date!  Thanks to Amazon for helping us find good products!-------But now, I have to fight the constant urge to shop online!  I may be an addict already.  HELP!!!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and great quality.</li>
            <li> Great for use during &amp;#34;intimate times&amp;#34; and instead of a tampon. Just be sure to change and sanitize as needed. I recommend thoroughly washing out the sponge, leaving it a bit damp and then boiling or microwaving it for 1min to kill bacteria.</li>
            <li> what i received was def synthetic. They are also incredibly tiny im talking less then a inch ^2...I am not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> These sponges would be good if they were larger, but they are just too small and not convenient to use.  I would not order them again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used these before for make up but saw a post where someone in the theatre recommended them.  I used them for my halloween makeup.  They are quite rough.  They did the job tho.  Perhaps that&#x27;s not what they are really made for?</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried sea sponge tampons, they are life changing!</li>
            <li> Ordered these because can no longer get Max Factor natural makeup sponges.  Just received them, am waiting to see if the hold up well.  Like how firm they are.</li>
            <li> I love the sea sponges. I use them instead of tampons, and absolutely love them!! Work great and have excellent absorbancy!</li>
            <li> They came fast, package looked like the picture. I used these as sea sponge tampons cause those sea pearls are expensive as eff. These range from soft to firmer in texture depending on the sponge. I soaked these in hot vinegar water and let air dry and divided them up into 3s to store for later. I treat these like sea pearls so basically I got four sets of &#x27; sea pearls&#x27; for about 2.50 a set when you break it down whereas a package of sea pearls which come in twos cost over 30 dollars which is stupid, and sea pearls are suppose to last you about 3-6 months so I essentially bought two years worth of the equate of sea pearls for only ten bucks. Not bad at all. My advise is that if you are using them in place of sea pearl sponge tampons is to sanitize them and you have to wet them and wring them out as much as you can before use so they are soft. You cant like put them in dry or use them straight away cause these were once alive they may have dirt, grit, or what not in them so they need to be cleaned out first. You can use a baking soda and water soak or a vinegar and water soak to do this and they will be clean cause vinegar and baking soda have anti microbial and anti fungal properties so you can naturally sanitize your sponges without chemicals. You can clean these sponges this way even if you are using them for make up purposes and not as sea sponge tampons. But regardless of inital use these are a very good buy.</li>
            <li> So far I love them. One broke after washing it but 1 out of 12 is ok. Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as sea sponge tampons because of their low price for 12 sponges and other people were doing it also.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive 12 songes total. 4 of which are big and round enough to use as a natural tampon (size mini to light). Two were of decent size but it was obvious they were once one big sponge and then cut in half. One sponge was a very very odd shape and texture, im going to guess it was either man made or just really jacked up. It was very rough, hard and in the shape of a beer barrel. While that shape is pretty much perfect to use as a tampon, I will not be putting that sponge in my vagina!&lt;br /&gt;The majority of the sea sponge tampons I received were very flat. Perfect for applying toner to ones face. But I personally have no use for the flat ones.&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to disinfect my sponges, but right now there are a lot of debris on and in them and it is very unappealing.&lt;br /&gt;But overall I would recommend these sponges to someone who could get more use out of them than I. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Nice for cleaning face</li>
            <li> Sponges I&#x27;ve had before hold moisture and are soft when wet. I use wet to apply make up. Soaked them in water, then put lotion on them. Very rough. Just threw them away.</li>
            <li> I love these sea sponges, they work amazing and you don&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
            <li> My mom drove me crazy when Maybelline stopped selling these. We looked everywhere! Now i can just re-order and not worry about going to 10 different stores trying to find them. They are the exact sponges at a much better price!!</li>
            <li> As are many other reviewers, I am using these as tampons. I am SO impressed. I have been intrigued to use sea sponges for this purpose, but those marketed as such are much more expensive. I was impressed with the affordability of this package. I did receive 12, as advertised, of varying sizes, but definitely enough of the right size for my purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did soak mine in warm water and Melaleuca (Green Tea Tree) essential oil for a couple of hours. They were so soft after being soaked and sanitized. They serve their purpose well for a fraction of the cost. I would highly recommend this product to others (and already have!).</li>
            <li> These soft sea sponges are an excellent alternative to tampons, and work far better for a fraction of the cost! I&#x27;ve used a menstrual cup for years, but unlike a cup, these sponges are easy to insert and don&#x27;t run the risk of shifting into an uncomfortable angle if you are jogging or working out. The level of comfort is unbelievable, and they are so absorbent that you can even dare to wear your favorite undies!  Maintaining and sanitizing the sponges is easy; I found 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar to 8oz of warm water to be an easy and inexpensive way to sanitize them, and they have stayed soft and adsorbent through washes.  Quality: 5/5 Durability: 3/5 Price: 5/5</li>
            <li> I have been searching for &#x27;natural sea sponge&#x27; makeup sponges for many years now, so I was thrilled when I saw these available.  Upon arrival I noticed that many had flat, straight edges, or facets, indicating they were sliced into peices from one larger sponge.  That didn&#x27;t bother me as much as how firm and scratchy they remain when wet...applying makeup with these sponges was a disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to donate them to my kindergarten class for sponge painting.  Perfect for their tiny little fingers!</li>
            <li> they were the right size to apply liquid make-up and smooth it out.  good quality sponges.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find these as MF sponges have almost disappeared. These seem like they will last longer and 12 in a pack may be a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> Just as described, fast ship, great quality and fair pricing.  Did quite a bit a research on this product and this one was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use as sea sponge tampons when I got my IUD taken out and started menstruating again. they worked great, came in pretty much the right size and shape already so minimal trimming. I soak mine in vinegar and hot water to sanitize them before using. I even started to use them with a homemade spermicide as a natural contraceptive. I will definitely buy these again next year when I need more, since they last for at least a year when used properly. for more info on sea sponge tampons there are lots of how tos on you tube!</li>
            <li> You put it in water, it absorbs it, you squeeze it out. What&#x27;s not to like? I&#x27;ve used it for makeup applications with a particularly crappy foundation that I thought would be better but it wasn&#x27;t good. I&#x27;ve also tried this with meow cosmetics (AMAZING BRAND) minerals foundation, just slightly damp, and it works well. If only it kept me company like Spongebob.</li>
            <li> Like others, I use these as tampons, they are cost effective and the perfect size.  Just make sure to disinfect properly before usage.  I soak them for about a week in hydrogen peroxide to soften them up and disinfect before use.</li>
            <li> all sponges meet my expectations and are easy to use dont have 10 mors words to talk about this product</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected!</li>
            <li> they worked good  I dont know what more I can say I will buy more if I need some bye bye.</li>
            <li> These are small and soft, but the batch I recieved had these gross black creatures/specks in three of the sponges. I am not willing to use any of them, because I don&#x27;t know what these things a</li>
            <li> I find it harder and harder to find these cosmetic sea sponges around town and to be able to buy them in bulk at a good price is a plus.  These were just what I wanted - the right size and texture.  I&#x27;ll be ordering these again (but not too soon *wink* I&#x27;v got 12!)</li>
