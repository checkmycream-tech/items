            <li>These curlers worked great and I loved the results.</li>
            <li>Curls come out flawlessly, make sure you have some sort of setting lotion.</li>
            <li>However, if you are more concerned with results than efficiency, these are great!  </li>

            <li>They were very easy to use and made the cutest spiral curls!</li>
            <li>Amazing product, great price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use as yet, but I heard good things about this product.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Curlformers brand.  </li>
            <li>And even when you think you got a good curl, the when you release the curler from your hair some still come out frizzy and not the sleek curl I was looking for.</li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;nt stand to throw the perfectly good Vakind hooks away, so into the recycle bin</li>
            <li>Delivery and service was good.  </li>
            <li>I have use twice and loved the outcome.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was ripping it through for a good portion of my hair.</li>
            <li>I watched you-tube videos to get help with good techniques on how to use them.  </li>
            <li>I always in good mood.</li>
            <li>These are surprising hair curlers.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Curls were gorgeous and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I loved the way my hair curled up.</li>
            <li>I tried this product out the day after I received it and everything was in good condition.</li>
            <li>I did my research &amp; heard amazon had some that worked just as good, for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>when i tell you these work mjust as good as the $40+ pack.</li>
            <li>they hold up good</li>
            <li>The end result are perfect, smooth curls</li>
            <li>that wasnt so good.</li>
            <li>good value for the amount of formers</li>
            <li>and I was good to go</li>
            <li>The package came in good shape, I just wish it came with two hooks to speed up the process.</li>
            <li>I completely loved it.</li>
            <li>They were easier to use and resulted in a good outcome (i.e, curls with no breakage).</li>
            <li>If you take your time with applying, you get good results.  </li>
            <li>I used them for the 1st time, and I loved the curls they make.</li>
            <li>If you want to try the look without spending the money these are good, but I would suggest getting a curlformers wand from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I loved the uniform curl I got and that I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in curl from the curlformers.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the curlformers.</li>
            <li>In the end, I felt that I got a good buy for my money.</li>
            <li>has mentioned to me that these work best if your hair is lightly damp.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>I put these in at night and took them out in the morning and had wonderful, smooth curls.</li>
            <li>Loved the amount I received for the price.</li>
            <li>The couple of curls that I got in did work good</li>
            <li>Good for any hair type.</li>
            <li>my curls came out perfectly gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>It still take a good bit of strength to put it together though.</li>
            <li>The we quality is good and they work just as good as the curlformers.</li>
            <li>I do suggest getting lotta body if you want some good, yet affordable wet-set lotion to use with the rollers.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved the results.</li>
            <li>This version of the product is good.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t a good buy for me and wish I never bought this</li>
            <li>Good luck if you buy it.  </li>
            <li>and she said mine are just as good as hers.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>but I imagine that these are just as good.</li>
            <li>Two of the curlers were unusable, but the rest were in good condition.</li>
            <li>and it was good to go.</li>
            <li>My hair looks really good after I put these</li>
            <li>All in all a good investment.</li>
            <li>Good quality product.</li>
            <li>Be wise and air them out or bathe them before 1st use.  </li>
            <li>This was is a really good product.  </li>
            <li>The good news is they don&#x27;t get frizzy if you brush or comb through them.</li>
            <li>They held for a good 3/4 hours.</li>
            <li>Good price.  </li>
            <li>Formers were good.  </li>
            <li>so it would work good.</li>
            <li>it took me a good hour to put them in but taking them out is like 5 mins?</li>
            <li>It a goOd product for any girl with curly hair.</li>

            <li>So glad I decided to try this product before purchasing the $70 curl formers from Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>my products weren&#x27;t the best the first time around.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>

            <li>Oh my word LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>I think that if you have a higher density of hair like mine, then it would be best to get two packages of these so that you dont accidentally run out.</li>

            <li>I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>Better value than Curlformers!</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve to using them but there are lots of online videos that help, my hair never holds curls for more than 2-3 hours and this held ALL day!</li>
            <li>Works even better than heat curlers!</li>

            <li>The curls achieved by theses curlformers ARE amazing.</li>
            <li>Creates really nice drop curls.</li>
            <li>Thanks, and it was great doing business with you!</li>
            <li>My spiral curls came out  nice, but I warn you all that the process of putting these in can take a while</li>
            <li>So its nice to wash my hair and set it in the curlformes.  </li>
            <li>I liked the curlers but didn&#x27;t receive the the hook.</li>
            <li>I honestly did not believe this would work for me, but my mother insisted on buying them from here.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions I&#x27;m more than happy to answer. :)</li>
            <li>They take forever to put in, but the results are spectacular.  </li>
            <li>are nice.</li>
            <li>has a really good one) and saw there were not to many complaints.</li>
            <li>I figured that if they didn&#x27;t come out so nice</li>
            <li>I would think they would&#x27;ve come in a nice zipper container.</li>
            <li>so many compliments &amp; everyone loved them.  </li>
            <li>I liked:  </li>
            <li>so I do the ends to give it a nice curl and still keep some length.</li>
            <li>but I liked the results.</li>
            <li>will also say that they grip nicely at the scalp, which I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li>They really are excellent for all hair types from straight-kinky.</li>
            <li>Curl looked nice but fell out within 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I definately recommend this item for anbody that wants beautiful curls wihout burning themselves or have heat damage!</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product and my daughter has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Takes some practice, but nice result.</li>
            <li>I use these to do a set along with Camille Rose Naturals Aloe Whipped Butter Gel.</li>
            <li>I would try it if you want nice bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>I just cannot figure out it will be good to have for grand kids.</li>
            <li>It worked well and gave me a nice curl,patter for my 4c hair.</li>
            <li>but all in all i love the way the curls came out good product</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have another way to do your hair without having to expose it to heat.</li>
            <li>These hair curlers are as good as the brand ones if not even better.</li>
            <li>The curls come out nice but they are tighter than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>does not create nice curls</li>
            <li>This product works well and makes beautiful ringlets; however, it takes hours to do a full head.  </li>
            <li>My curls were really nice.... until I went into the heat and humidity and</li>
            <li>I was really quite impressed with these.</li>
            <li>I really like these as they provide a great quality curl without heat!</li>
            <li>kind of frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used them on my grand daughter&#x27;s hair, she loved it, and the style lasted a week...</li>
            <li>Still, I was able to use both sets and get good results.</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best curlers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>And she can pull them through her own hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice ..</li>
            <li>Thanks Vakind and Amazon was an awesome product, Sdesta</li>
            <li>For all the kinky girls out there (no clue what my texture is - probably a mix of 4a,b and c lol) this is actually better than the one in Sally&#x27;s because it&#x27;s plastic, which makes the hair a lot more sleek.</li>
            <li>That being said, you should take care how you take them off, because if you just pull them you will end up pulling out some of your hair, and it&#x27;s kind of painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly though, I was hesitant until I tried it...</li>
            <li>They work really nicely.  </li>
            <li>I will buy a spare hook to have on hand for my own peace of mind.</li>
            <li>They made my daughters transitioning hair beautiful and my natural hair beautiful.</li>
            <li>The product is nice</li>
            <li>and I never leave it to its own devices unless I&#x27;m dressing up as Medusa for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I honestly could have used those.  </li>
            <li>Then the hair will slide through nicely.  </li>
            <li>The curler formers work well and produce really nice curls.</li>
            <li>Nice ringlet curls.</li>
            <li>My hair looks really nice when I take them out.</li>
            <li>They work so nicely in my hair.</li>
            <li>She had nice bouncy  curls.</li>
            <li>The tool has some snags at the top and sometimes pulls my daughters hair, but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li>Nice to have the extras in case some get lost too.</li>
            <li>I loved these, I was glad I found a cheaper version than the $60.00 ones I always see in the beauty supplies.</li>
            <li>Forms a nice curl.  </li>
            <li>Really, I am thrilled with the price, the quality, and the shipping time.  </li>
            <li>Wish the curlers would&#x27;ve come with some kind of carrying bag or case though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality wise they are very nice and well worth what I paid.</li>
            <li>Super easy to put in (once you know how) and looks great afterwards!</li>
            <li>These are great dupes for the original curlformers.</li>
            <li>Great price, totally worth it!</li>
            <li>The product arrived ahead of schedule which was great because we were excited to try.  </li>
            <li>I was soo excited !!</li>
            <li>I watched many YouTube videos before these arrived and our first try came out awesome.</li>
            <li>I used these on my daughter and her hair came out so great and very bouncy Amazing!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and curls up nice.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, I purchased a curlformer one ahead of time and had it handy, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>These are a great way to get your hair full of spiral curls without damaging your hair with heat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad &amp; very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>They are amazing, they leave my hair in the perfect curl and they leave it so soft.</li>
            <li>After doing much YouTube research I was able to correctly use these and my results were awesome!</li>
            <li>So I was very happy when I found this dupe product on Amazon for a much more reasonable price.</li>

            <li>I love this product and its way cheaper here than buying it at a beauty store (plus it has more!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again for sure - love them!</li>
            <li>This means if you are just wanting to quickly curl your hair without damaging it on the heat curler, but don&#x27;t want full curls, this is perfect for that!</li>
            <li>To be fair I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>the price is right!!!</li>
            <li>The shipping was  fast and the packaging was very good.</li>
            <li>The huge difference in cost if I had purchased the curl formers from the beauty supply store still makes this a good purchase though.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and these work great for me!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t own the authentic ones but these work</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this version of the popular &amp;#34;curlformers&amp;#34; because I really love the hairstyles I&#x27;ve seen on youtube using the curlformers, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the curlfrmer price.</li>
            <li>My sister and mom have purchased some of their own now :-)</li>
            <li>but I know that this makes my hair have smooth gorgeous curls every time.</li>
            <li>They are not as soft as Curl Formers, but they work great!!!</li>
            <li>I used them on my daughter’s natural hair and the ringlets turned out perfectly.</li>
            <li>My sister and mom have purchased some of their own now  :-).</li>
            <li>They are great for girls that have poker straight hair and those that have curls but want more pretty perfect hair body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard about the curl formers (The 80 dollar kind) &amp; these may even work better from the results I&#x27;ve seen from others.</li>
            <li>Someone that I watch on Youtube reviewed this brand, and that review (as well as the amazing price) made me more inclined to try them</li>
            <li>However I can say that the Magic Leverage version works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Just make sure the hair is damp and has some kind of hair product like mousse on before putting them on.</li>
            <li>Works perfect for my natural 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li>and my curls came out soft and perfect spirals.  </li>
            <li>items were in excellent condition, no missing pieces and worked well with some practice.</li>
            <li>They give the perfect spiral curl and I feel like they trap the moisture in my hair because it always look shine and soft when I take them out and stay that way after a week.</li>
            <li>The curlers work great when your hair is fresh from the shower.</li>
            <li>After watching Nap85&#x27;s vid on YouTube, I had great success.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I just can&#x27;t see myself paying more for the curlformers.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c hair and it worked perfect...</li>
            <li>Overall great product it produced  beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>price was right, the results were great.</li>
            <li>She was so right they are great.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and never ever holds a curl for longer than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>My hair is also very very fine.  </li>
            <li>My Mom has very fine hair</li>
            <li>This is not as easy as it may appear!</li>
            <li>These were so easy to use!</li>
            <li>They are so easy to put in and take out!</li>
            <li>Got this set for my daughter,  She has very fine hair and doesn&#x27;t hold curl well.  </li>
            <li>I just apply a mixture of oil and water (spray bottle) and the curlers are installed easily!</li>
            <li>So easy!</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use!</li>
            <li>they are so easy!</li>
            <li>So easy!  </li>
            <li>They are easy to put in and work so well!</li>
            <li>Love them, love them, love them!  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM !</li>
            <li>I used it on my natural 4b hair and it turned out very nice!</li>
            <li>This product is just as good as the original with an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Just has good as the original curlformers</li>
            <li>Quality of product is good in relation to original Curlformers.</li>
            <li>They are just as good as the original if you ask me.</li>
            <li>I guess it would work better if I were using them on someone else where I could see what I was doing better, but it just won&#x27;t work for me on my own hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that means I will need to use more on my own when I try them out on myself.</li>
            <li>Happy New Year!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is very very kinky/curly and it worked great.</li>
            <li>They are so easy and the girls hair is so cute!</li>
            <li>She said that they were really good for people with natural hair (like me) because they give you very nice and defined curls.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for anyone who wants beautiful curls without using heat.</li>
            <li>After using the set for the first time, I had great spiral curls and definition.</li>
            <li>The curls were beautiful and very  bouncy.</li>
            <li>She got beautiful waves and gentle ringlets instead of</li>
            <li>What a great first time experience.</li>
            <li>First product I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon that I wasn&#x27;t happy with.  </li>
            <li>Tried for the first time and the curls were great.</li>
            <li>However the hook is very cheap</li>
            <li>they still weren&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Once they are in, they aren&#x27;t very comfortable</li>
            <li>My hair looked very smooth with those just using water, coconut oil and aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely amazing and really easy to install.</li>
            <li>Pros: Fairly easy to use, nice results.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, nice .</li>
            <li>It has a nice grip, but your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught easily in the hook.</li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;m pretty confident the results will be great :) just order them too :)</li>
            <li>Very Easy, and quality is great, would highly recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to use them because my friend had great results</li>
            <li>They were budget friendly, easy to use, fast shipping and excellent durability!  </li>
            <li>I will invest in a better hook.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to spend more $</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I love the curls these give.  </li>
            <li>Also be sure to twist the hair just a bit.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>However, the cost more than makes up for it in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that these came in varying widths.</li>
            <li>I brought these because they were cheater then the curlformers but after using them I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li>This product is great and it makes my hair very curly</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I can say I truley LOVE the results and got many a compliment from them.</li>
            <li>and I got so many that I know I wont run out of them.</li>
            <li>The curlers delivered for sure.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll have to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps:)</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would not have been able to use the curlers without buying the tool separately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend money on curlformers when these exist.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Love em...</li>
            <li>and I love these rollers.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m really pleased to find these rollers a lot cheaper. :)</li>
            <li>love them.</li>
            <li>We bought two sets just to be safe, but haven&#x27;t needed them yet.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s able to sleep with them, but daughter #2 can&#x27;t stand to.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It got my hair so nice and smooth</li>
            <li>I think I need more practice because it got better as I did it more.</li>
            <li>I Love this Product.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the outcome of the curls</li>
            <li>but I watched so many hours of youtube before</li>
            <li>did. :-)</li>
            <li>I LOVE that I can wash, condition and roll my hair with these curlers and my hair results in silky curls.</li>
            <li>These are great curlers, and just like the real Curlformers but for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I might order some more bc</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>(it was about $1.45 more) and it came with a deformed up hook and just one.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>Love the end results.</li>
            <li>I love the curlformers themselves.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I use them for cheer, w/a lot of hairspray and it turn out really cute.</li>
            <li>I love these curlers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I just have to get used to the hook and find a better technique</li>
            <li>and I love these ones better...</li>
            <li>I think I like the ones from Amazon better.</li>
            <li>The curls were defined and cute.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I LOVE THESE, and may order more once my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased.</li>
            <li>That worked much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotta be the most versatile.</li>
            <li>And then if your length grows out you&#x27;ll be able to continue to use them.</li>
            <li>You get sooo many for the money.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li>and I love how bouncy my hair becomes after using it</li>
            <li>An extremely cheap alternative to the Name Brand ones from Sally Hansen!</li>
            <li>Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>I like beachy waves, but this gave me more curls.</li>
            <li>I really love these.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>I had no learning curve at all since I&#x27;ve watched so many videos on how to put these in.</li>
            <li>Many people have said the wand is flimsy</li>
            <li>not that she wasnt adorable, but thats just not the look for me.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways</li>
            <li>, after shaking the curls out and combing them through, my hair looked fabulous!</li>
            <li>but i thought it would have worked better than it did.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>Much better value than purchasing Curlformers.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how many stars to give them because of this.</li>
            <li>My parents bought me these knock-off Curlformers or Christmas (the pack of 40), and I love the curls it gave me.</li>
            <li>I could have gone with shorter ones, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>:) I have been getting nothing but compliments.</li>
            <li>She said they were comfortable to sleep in too !</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also getting lots of compliments on my hair &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>had the set come with a lot more than just one curliformer hook.</li>
            <li>Through trying out the curlers 4 times I was able to figure out a cute hairstyle that works for me but because of the damage it has caused my hair</li>
            <li>but they did stay in for a couple of hours which is a couple more hours longer than a curling iron ever did for me.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ll stick to a curling iron), but might be okay for someone with more patience.</li>
            <li>But, youtube has many tutorials to help ypu with.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the cheaper brand. :)</li>
            <li>and i needed so many to cover my head</li>
            <li>but glad I decided to wait.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I&#x27;d be completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>They have a cheap plastic smell and that smell kind of stays in your hair.</li>
            <li>I love the spiral results.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I have 3 daughters and they love these 1.</li>
            <li>: even though i dont love the Andre Walker hair typing system, I would guess that it would range from 3c-4b.&lt;br /&gt;Density: High(thick)&lt;br /&gt;Strand texture:</li>
            <li>There are many curlformer tutorials on youtube if you want to learn how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really love the price of this product</li>
            <li>I love...</li>
            <li>You get many, many more rollers for your money</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine any better results.</li>
            <li>Vakind worked just as well, even better than the Curlformers!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>and this did not spiral it a lot but did leave a lovely wave.</li>
            <li>wants.&lt;br /&gt;Pictures will follow I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>I have not use curlformers yet, so i cant compare them to these Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets.</li>
            <li>I will say that i enjoy using them!</li>
            <li>they do give my hair more length as opposed to flexi rods</li>
            <li>I first wanted to buy this product because I was interested in no heat curls and this looked like the perfect answer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the curlformers.</li>
            <li>Works great and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>have shoulder-length type 4A/4B hair and no blow dryer was needed to achieve heatless smooth curls!</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I may try once more to sleep in them</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>Works very well, sometimes gets tangled when pulling the hair out, otherwise great product</li>
            <li>I decided to try these  on a whim and wanting some more curl to my hair.</li>
            <li>but I just couldn&#x27;t get many curlers in my hair.</li>
            <li>But I love them already.</li>
            <li>These curlformers gives me the curls I love without using heat.</li>
            <li>my curls could of gotten any better.  </li>
            <li>and I love them</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased them FROM VANKIND THROUGH AMAZON.COM.</li>
            <li>i could have made better decision then</li>
            <li>Love, love, love</li>
            <li>I absolutely love what they do for my hair.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It is a bit more sturdier then the one which comes with the Vakind brand.</li>
            <li>I have used them twice since receiving them last weekend and woke up with perfect curls both times.</li>
            <li>and I was able to do heat-less  curls  that lasted for the week.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna order 1 more</li>
            <li>I love love love my curlformers.</li>
            <li>I love curformers.</li>
            <li>I think it gives me better curls anyway.</li>
            <li>I felt like i lost more hair</li>
            <li>Price is way better here</li>
            <li>I love the curls I get with them</li>
            <li>Google and YouTube, I love you.</li>
            <li>These helped set the hair at that part of my head better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and when I need to refresh the look between washings, I don&#x27;t have to use heat and damage my hair, just pop in a couple of these curlers and leave them alone for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the curl definition.</li>
            <li>Better results for 4c hair if used when damp.</li>
            <li>But overall a wonderful product</li>
            <li>love them</li>
            <li>I also have problems with my hair looking frizzy at the top</li>
            <li>glad i saved and did not buy the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Took about an hour to install all rollers (but I also took my time to make sure I didn&#x27;t snag any hair.....</li>
            <li>However the results were very beautiful and lasted several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a wonderful product and a lot cheaper than the actual brand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I checked online before buying the name brand at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>But overall great product!</li>
            <li>I just love these.</li>
            <li>I really love these and will be buying some for myself.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I decided to purchase these instead of spending all that money on the curlformers brand.</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I saw a You-Tubers review the Magic Leverage version and decided to give these a try.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>instead  off  top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to use these for many years to come!</li>

            <li>These are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love these curlers.</li>
            <li>Love this thing</li>
            <li>Did they think the curlers wouldn&#x27;t be counted to make sure all were there?</li>
            <li>Why spend 4 times as much on actual curl formers.these with awesome.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are patient because you do not want to get your hair all tangled up in the wand and curler.  </li>
            <li>Gotta say, I did rip lots of hair before I realized its better to start over.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>silky smooth  bouncy curls NO HEAT NEEDED!  </li>
            <li>Vakind Hair Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets</li>
            <li>but I like it better.</li>
            <li>and i LOVE them.</li>
            <li>Never tried the authentic Curlformers</li>
            <li>but I love them.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re even better than the flexi-rods.  </li>
            <li>I love these curlers wish I got these before dishing out the price tag for the curlformers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using the curl formers.</li>
            <li>It took all 40 curlers, probably could have used more but we managed with 40.</li>
            <li>Like magic.  </li>
            <li>Better than all the rollers i had before.</li>
            <li>These worked and the curl lasted most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep in them.  </li>
            <li>I need some more practice, but look forward to using them often.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I use these.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Really Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this product instead of paying so much more for Curlformers.</li>
            <li>I think with practice my technique will get better.</li>
            <li>My seller was JLTech1, and I&#x27;m honestly so pleased with my order.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m basing this on having used authentic curlformers and having 4C curly hair.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more about my hair than the product.  </li>
            <li>I did watch a youtube video for pointers and to make sure I was doing it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad these came in a pack of 40</li>
            <li>about 15 more would have done the job.</li>
            <li>It was okay for me.</li>
            <li>I really love these.  </li>
            <li>You get better results if you use gel in your hair when using it.</li>
            <li>but i love it.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li>,I guess with more heatand product</li>
            <li>it be better .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve convinced my sisters to buy these, and they love them too.</li>
            <li>With a continued practice I am getting better with each set and am conquering the learning curve, which is a bit steep.</li>
            <li>Not so sure about the hook....</li>
            <li>The product would have been much better if more came in the package and if there was a backup hook.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>They are firmer and more durable than the Curlformers.</li>
            <li>I love the curler.</li>
            <li>My girls love this product.  </li>
            <li>and my curls the next day were wonderful!</li>
            <li>I made this purchase :)</li>
            <li>and I was so pleased.</li>
            <li>I am beyond satisfied.</li>
            <li>I need like 10 more because I have a lot of hair</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Both love how their hair comes out after using these.</li>
            <li>and I want the curls to be more defined.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU for such a great deal!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>because I had tons more.</li>
            <li>I wanted more of a beachy wave and volume.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that I am completely satisfied with my results.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with item</li>
            <li>The more rods you use, the more curls you&#x27;ll have that don&#x27;t need to be separated</li>
            <li>No need to spend more on the name brand.</li>
            <li>but it works better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I am growing out my hair more, and have been using the original Curlformers for many years now (love those ringlets!).</li>
            <li>After reading about these curlformers, I&#x27;m glad I got them.</li>
            <li>I know we&#x27;ll get a better outcome when she sleeps in them.</li>
            <li>I would order more and recommend others to buy.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>but I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it curls my hair.</li>
            <li>4.5 for sure.</li>
            <li>The sturdiness gives a great curl and straightens very well.</li>
            <li>I will buy some curl formers since The plastic is supposedly better quality and more pliable.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>but I was able to work through it.</li>
            <li>The next morning I have perfectly formed curls that do not fall out!</li>
            <li>I love this thing for teasing, up do&#x27;s, etc.  </li>
            <li>These came out as lovely spirals.  </li>
            <li>The results were outstanding.  </li>
            <li>These came out as lovely spirals.  </li>
            <li>The results were outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take me more then and hour to put 30 in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they need to make the hook more durable or send two.</li>
            <li>Works better than the $80 ones at Sallys beauty supply.</li>
            <li>and I love, love, love them.</li>
            <li>and i love how my hair turned out</li>
            <li>so I was able to work with that one.</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve packed my curling iron and wand away since these work way better.</li>
            <li>and I think that the more you use them the easier it becomes.</li>
            <li>and I think it might have been better to have shorter ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will get faster the more</li>
            <li>I get much more of a &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I LOVE them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy the name brand ones for 50 Bucks,</li>
            <li>I love my curlers.</li>
            <li>And we get so many compliments when we use them in her hair.  </li>
            <li>Once the curler is actually on, they do their job perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Love that I got such awesome results without heat though.</li>
            <li>I should have done more research on this product before purchasing.</li>
            <li>The curls are great the wand wasn&#x27;t it comes a part if you use too much force</li>
            <li>lol I would recommend leaving the curlformers in your hair for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>As I said I use the name brand curlformer hook that I purchased from Sallys for like $5-7  too many complaints about the hook that came with this package so I just threw it out &amp; didn&#x27;t even bother with it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get any better than this. :)</li>
            <li>These things cost so much more in Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t realize how many come in a package until you get them</li>
            <li>The wand, however, could be much better.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Although, I have to leave these ones in :)  </li>
            <li>and I have gotten better results with my hair wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(and I am sure I can fix this with superglue) is the wand can break when I pull it through the curler.  </li>
            <li>and now I have to buy more as the girlfriends of those girlfriends damn</li>
            <li>And they are NOT self explanatory, because of this I haven&#x27;t been able to used them yet, so</li>
            <li>I think this is more of a hair dryer style.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love these</li>
            <li>My girls love these.</li>
            <li>but they were much cheaper lol.</li>
            <li>Curls came out ok.</li>
            <li>and I love the lose curl that I get with these.</li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d abosultely invest in more of these curlers if I needed to.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and it only took about 11 days to get here.</li>
            <li>But I Wasn&#x27;t In Love With The Price.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a way to keep them smoother while in the spiral for a more polished finished product.  </li>
            <li>You must make sure all of the hair is in the hook, or you may accidentally pull/ tangle you hair.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE these.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my curls look when I use them.</li>
            <li>Perfect for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li>They make nice smooth curls in my 4c type hair.</li>
            <li>Will order more soon :)</li>
            <li>: affordable, gave great curls, pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Very efficient, cheap for the quantity, reliable, and comes with a good hook!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, easy to put in, and easy to take out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any heat, so letting them thoroughly dry was very important to making sure the curls were perfect!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about how much I absolutely love these!!!</li>
            <li>When I took them out this 2nd try, I was in love!!!</li>
            <li>These work just as well and are soooooo much cheaper!!!!</li>
            <li>did not see a difference with the original curlformers except the amazing price.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for getting almost \\&quot;flat ironed hair\\&quot; without heat.</li>
            <li>OMG my spirals came out beautiful on my natural hair!</li>
            <li>It looked gorgeous at first, I still love the curlers, but it&#x27;s my fault for not putting some sort of mousse or setting lotion.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of time but it is much fast and more effective than using a curling iron!  </li>
            <li>The product was in great condition, but there&#x27;s a high learning curve.</li>
            <li>They are good quality and came very fast.</li>
            <li>I love them , they are  easy to put on and take off my kids love their hair and the look after all</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the curls come out perfect and last all day.</li>
            <li>These were easy to use and my hair came out with nice and smooth curls.</li>
            <li>Curls are beautiful and natural looking.</li>
            <li>They were the perfect length for my medium to long hair.  </li>
            <li>I just received my curlers, and I will say for the price these are pretty good.</li>
            <li>They stretched my hair and formed perfect ringlets.</li>
            <li>These curlers created beautiful, bouncy curls that rival any set of professional magnetic rollers</li>
            <li>The formers stretched my hair perfectly, and without any sort of heat involved.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are also comfortable and easy to sleep in!</li>
            <li>It was so worth it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use them!</li>
            <li>These were really worth my money !!</li>
            <li>However, this method of curling... like most methods... isn&#x27;t as easy as you expect.</li>
            <li>if your hair is almost dry, and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Works best if hair is blown dry with them in.</li>
            <li>Her hair is dry and has awesome ringlet curls.  </li>
            <li>Can easily make cute hair styles.</li>
            <li>Works best with 60-70 % dry hair.</li>
            <li>Was able to catch on very quickly.</li>
            <li>An easy and SAFE way to curl your hair.</li>
            <li>At some point I will google how to use them and learn from YouTube, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to have good old fashion directions.</li>
            <li>but it is sturdy and works great on my 3c/4a natural hair!</li>
            <li>Great results for natural hair!</li>
            <li>but when I put these in my hair, my curls were beautiful, soft, flexible, and full of shine!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and make natural hair look beautiful without the heat.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient, quickly and beautifully.</li>
            <li>love it, it works fine just like i wanted to..</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend an arm and a leg for the CurlFormers, because my curls were perfect and bouncy and shiny just like they should be!</li>
            <li>Satisfied, feels and looks like the original cyrlformers, but this is much more affordable</li>
            <li>Just for reference: I have a good amount of healthy, fine, naturally straight, APL hair.  </li>
            <li>but I used my curlers on freshly washed, towel damp hair and got amazing results.</li>
            <li>So far I think this was a great choice.</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>makes great curls on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Great way to stretch natural hair 4b.</li>
            <li>but so far they have worked great.</li>
            <li>too long was happy to try this product however not too thrilled with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair--using these curlers when wet gives me the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I wonder if the name brand curlformers are more comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li>Works great on those with natural hair.</li>
            <li>Recommend using on wet hair for best results.</li>
            <li>The spirals are cheap quality as well and thank goodness I did not have to pay more money for this product.  </li>
            <li>Perfect, worked as expected.</li>
            <li>and they actually smooth your hair a bit more.</li>
            <li>These are definitely more sleek, smooth and defined.</li>
            <li>These worked great on my 6 year old for &amp;#34;dance&amp;#34; hair.  </li>
            <li>Loved it but the handle thing was very flimsy and it kept coming apart when I tried to put my hair through it</li>
            <li>I loved it, much easier to sleep in than the benders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was quick and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Product is great quality, easy to use with great results, and much cheaper than the actual CurlFormers.</li>
            <li>Price is more than reasonable!!!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t many and can easily be avoided by flipping the roller around and using the part with the smooth edge.</li>
            <li>I messed up 3 times before I got it right, but when I did, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>so well she bought her own set right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking about just a little bit of curl but full out beautiful amazing curls like you would see in a magazine!</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers that YouTube is the best resource for using these rollers, since the product did not come delivered with instructions.</li>
            <li>so I was so excited when one of my favorite hair bloggers made a video comparing the results of her Curlformers and Vakind.</li>
            <li>The original Curlformers were supposed to be so much better than the knockoffs.</li>
            <li>Also they are super easy to use!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wand that pulls the hair through the curler is perfectly sturdy, IDK what other people&#x27;s problems are</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found these on Amazon for a fraction of the price of the original Curlformers.  </li>
            <li>Same product that sells for $50/$60 at the beauty supply shop...quick and easy to put on and gorgeous curls in the morning!</li>
            <li>The curl formers are in good condition and shipped very quickly, they were easy to put in and are comfortable, and they work really well.</li>

            <li>but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s sooooo easy.  </li>
            <li>However, it was still easy to use.</li>

            <li>and they mostly rang true.  </li>
            <li>Honestly if I had tried these first</li>
            <li>As soon as it arrived I took out a couple of the curlformers to try them out first (was kind of worried jajajjaha)</li>
            <li>Easy to use and super curly hair!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re in my head right now, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love the curls and they&#x27;re easy and quick to put in.</li>
            <li>And best part is the price...way cheaper than the other brands but works just as well !..</li>
            <li>I wash my hair, apply these and then sleep on them (Not the most comfortable, but hey, beauty is pain, right!)</li>
            <li>They make excellent, tight curls - which can be easily loosened if that is your preference.</li>
            <li>But these work fine.</li>
            <li>These work wonderfully in my fine hair (after adding a bit of gel and curl lotion for hold and softness).  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have really fine hair&lt;</li>
            <li>Mine worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I do break things easily) or they were just  cheaply put together.</li>
            <li>Why pay all that money for the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; ones, when these work just fine.  </li>
            <li>and I think that it will be successful for many different hair types.</li>
            <li>I have bra strap length hair and fine, but a ton of it.</li>
            <li>She has may be a 3a in curly type (fine, but curly)...</li>
            <li>the curls came out fine.</li>
            <li>There is no way I&#x27;d pay full price for some Curlformers when these do a great job at stretching my natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I used the hook in the kit and it was just fine</li>
            <li>Everything was fine with the shipping</li>
            <li>I have waist length, fine hair.</li>
            <li>And she sleeps fine on them.  </li>
            <li>I have frizzy fine type 4 collar bone length hair that shrinks substantially when I wash it.  </li>
            <li>I bought the curlformer case to hold these but a ziplock baggy would be fine.</li>
            <li>They work fine.</li>
            <li>but mine is holding up just fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is ver fine</li>
            <li>These made my daughters hair super curly and cute for cheer competition.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>and I was able to get them in quickly.</li>
            <li>Once I was accustomed to how the curlers worked, I was able to place them in my daughter&#x27;s hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>More barrel then spiral but very pretty.</li>
            <li>these are great for an easy, low maintenance hair style</li>
            <li>I was able to use them with ease even though there were no instructions a quick YouTube search filled me in.</li>
            <li>I love these Curler forms, so easy to use and worth buying.</li>
            <li>Even with my super curly, coily hair, I was able to achieve sleek, smooth, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>There are easy to use and give a good shape to my 3c natural hair.</li>
            <li>Shipping time was super fast and received them within a week when they said they would be here in a month&#x27;s time!!!!</li>
            <li>They give your hair a wonderful, tight and bouncy curl.</li>
            <li>Just tried this for the first time and it was very easy to do.</li>
            <li>It took a little longer than I would have liked to get them, but I am so happy with the product that I don&#x27;t even mind.</li>
            <li>The revisited videos (someone&#x27;s second attempt) are very informational and can give you very good hints to make your style more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The picture is accurate for the items I received.</li>
            <li>Leaving them in overnight seems to work best for soft, natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;The curlers are really huge.</li>
            <li>The hook is made of incredibly cheap, flimsy plastic.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The curls were smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love these and think they are fun.</li>
            <li>It was bouncy and nice all the way to the very roots.</li>
            <li>To get light, bouncy curls, I would recommend either using the mouse and water pair or just an oil of your choosing.</li>
            <li>They are great quality and feel like they are going to last forever.</li>
            <li>But overall I&#x27;m happy now 😍😁</li>
            <li>The pieces to hold them the wound smooth electrical tape around the wire to lock the together, otherwise I was going to throw them out.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>hope that my next purchase will be as great</li>
            <li>Overall great value for the price.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for those times your hair just feels dead and you don&#x27;t want to put heat on them anymore.  </li>
            <li>These curlers are simple to use and work great if you are looking for ringlet curls for Competitive Cheer, Show Choir, ect.</li>
            <li>I had the most soft and perfect curls the following morning that lasted 2 weeks with</li>
            <li>What a fantastic purchase - at</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a 5 star product - I&#x27;ve recommended them to all my friends - fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li>The curlers work very well &amp; are an amazing deal compared to Curlformers.</li>
            <li>I bought another one of these because the product is so fantastic.</li>
            <li>The hook that comes with this package is cheap.</li>
            <li>but once they dried they were perfect.</li>
            <li>The results were really smooth and shiny like I used a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I still I same results great results.</li>
            <li>Everyone else, it is more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Now keep in mind that these things are not all that comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>Not as comfortable to sleep in overnight.</li>
            <li>, which by the way was not so comfortable.</li>
            <li>I could not get comfortable, my neck hurt in the morning.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t fit don&#x27;t force it.</li>
            <li>so cheap</li>
            <li>Seems like a sound purchase.</li>
            <li>it was cheap.</li>
            <li>So I will be trying again because I know they have great potential.</li>
            <li>Rolling hair on rollers didnt give me a shiny frizz free look.</li>
            <li>and everything will be smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>but I still had great curls for the next day!!)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even bother using the cheap wands.</li>
            <li>These curlformers get all of my hair uniformly smooth, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I came across these and most of the reviews were favorable and the price was worth the risk.  </li>
            <li>Although it did leave a fabulous curl, I might just stick to rollers.</li>
            <li>The cons: the rod is cheap and it took me forever to somewhat attach the pieces.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a heat free styling option for the holidays.</li>
            <li>I tried them out for the first time last night and woke up with beautiful curls :-)</li>
            <li>Overall, this was a great curling tool.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how people can sleep in these comfortably.  </li>
            <li>There are also no clippies or anything that might be used to secure each curler.</li>
            <li>These things are fantastic</li>
            <li>my hair just barley fit</li>
            <li>I am definitely keeping them though because the price was great</li>
            <li>My hair turned out as smooth</li>
            <li>The curls turned out smooth and sleek, and I have what some would say is 4a type , AA, kinky, coily textured hair.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>A bit stiffer than the name brand, but same great curl result.</li>
            <li>These were a great price and they provided me similar results to those I saw on youtube.</li>
            <li>I laughed because I was so sure there wouldn&#x27;t be enough to do my hair.</li>
            <li>for my followers and I most definitely recommend these instead if you&#x27;re trying to look good on a budget</li>
            <li>They are definitely going to take some time to get use to in regards to sleeping with them in my hair, but they really are incredible!  </li>
            <li>The mesh feels good and soft - its not plush like Curlformers</li>
            <li>The hook is obviously a cheaper quality than the real one and one of my curlers had a snag in it, but everything still works great!</li>
            <li>This product makes me feel like an adult Shirley Temple (and not in a good way).  </li>
            <li>This product works really good on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>It did not  come with instructions , but I went and found a you tube video on how to use , very easy to use and love the results of my new hair</li>
            <li>The product works great on natural hair, however the curls did not keep because I have not found the right product to hold them.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my new curlers.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to get the right size.</li>
            <li>Took a while to get here, and there was no instructions in the package, so instead of being able to use them right away.</li>
            <li>Such a great product and worth the buy!</li>
            <li>They were reasonably easy to use, so I considered investing in the full set.  </li>
            <li>There great because they don&#x27;t pull out your hair when you take them out (which is a problem with many other hair curlers i have used before), and require no heat.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering another set pretty soon!!</li>
            <li>I was intimidated at first but after watching a You Tube tutorial I had zero problems!!</li>
            <li>Thanks seller!!!</li>
            <li>most  beautiful  tight curls.</li>
            <li>The price is so much better compared to the price at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply, I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants beautiful curls/waves without any heat damage.</li>
            <li>my first night using these, i put them in then went to sleep in them (which isnt very comfortable btw).</li>
            <li>Pretty much like the other kind.. cheaper plastic but get great curls!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>are quick and easy to get into my hair.</li>
            <li>These were super easy to use.</li>
            <li>and using it is quick and easy...</li>
            <li>Fast and very Easy to use.</li>
            <li>My new favorite styling product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own when humidity is high.</li>
            <li>but I really fell in love when i discovered how easy it is to put them in MYSELF.</li>
            <li>it was easy to use and very flexible and the value was even better.</li>
            <li>These are really worth the money!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the original &amp;#34;curlformers&amp;#34; in my Amazon shopping cart for weeks.</li>
            <li>Most of all, the product did exactly as described and did it well</li>
            <li>These are unique but did what they were intended to do.</li>
            <li>MUCH more reasonable!</li>
            <li>I do prefer to use the original curlformer wand over the one provided.</li>
            <li>and my man says they were worth every penny!</li>
            <li>worth the money!</li>
            <li>Save your money and purchase these over the original Cutlformers.</li>
            <li>I would buy this over and over again because it works just like the original brand</li>
            <li>I was excited to try these curlers after hearing a lot about them.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$!  </li>
            <li>super quick shipment from the seller i bought from too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the key to this is perfectly separating your hair (making sure there are no stray hairs) and holding the wand/roller in one direction and your piece of hair in the opposite direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon ;)</li>
            <li>so I was really excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would suggest getting the original wand ($4).  </li>
            <li>I was SO excited to try these as I am always looking for ways to style my out of control hair without heat and damage.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>They work just like the original and</li>
            <li>You do want to have a smoother, firmer, stronger, higher quality hook to safely pull your hair through the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Some are to the point that I can not use them and some are still useable but not for long, These work great</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell the difference between the curlers but had to purchase the original Curl Formers rod</li>
            <li>definitely worth it when you do!  </li>
            <li>Curlformers are DEFINETLY worth the investment!</li>
            <li>Had to look at a You Tube tutorial to know exactly what I was doing; after a while  I was able to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>The original curlformers have a matte finish on the ends of the curl tube.</li>
            <li>&gt; I am about to order my 2nd pack now because I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Curlformers.  </li>
            <li>I was reasonably satisfied with our first run-through but will continue to practice and experiment before they&#x27;re needed for a cheer tournament.</li>
            <li>therefore it would be my recommendation to purchase the original curlformers hook to use with these.  </li>
            <li>There is no need to purchase the original curl formers</li>
            <li>but however, you would need to buy the original curlformers hooks as a backup.</li>
            <li>Just watch a tutorial first if you arent sure about how to.</li>
            <li>I love these sooo much!  </li>
            <li>I like these curlformers, and would like them even more if the quality were consistent.</li>
            <li>Works like the original without the experience price.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed with them at all.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I bought them to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair but I am so glad I tried them on myself first because it can pull your hair</li>
            <li>The curls were ok and the stick broke into two before I finish setting my for the first time.</li>
            <li>I put them in my daughters hair, she slept on her belly, but the results were worth it!</li>
            <li>And yes, it is a challenge to sleep with them in but the curls are totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect your first time to be a style that you can go out with :).</li>
            <li>But so worth the effort when you get the results!</li>
            <li>Fell in love first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I got so many compliments after using these curl formers and i will definitely be using them more often!</li>
            <li>Other than that, they are good!</li>
            <li>I have long hair, and these were a great size.  </li>
            <li>These are totally worth it!</li>
            <li>These things are an absolute miracle tho and have turned this sceptic into a true believer!!</li>
            <li>However, these were easy to put in, the wand seems pretty strong, and I have had no problems with the curlers breaking.</li>
            <li>So I got a very good product for much less cost than the name brand.</li>
            <li>I thought these where great and actually  worked they where also pretty easy to use</li>
            <li>But this is easy and fun for a fancy and fun look!</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and these are great for the price.</li>
            <li>I recently went natural and these hair curlers make perfect spiral curls.</li>
            <li>back today to buy two more sets (now we each have our own set.).&lt;br /&gt;Learning</li>
            <li>In short, great rollers, does as stated, definitely economically affordable and girlfriend approved to praise.</li>
            <li>these are so fun and easy</li>
            <li>u get twice as much for 1/2 as much, and  they work just as good</li>
            <li>They would be great if you have a couple hours for your hair to dry.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to offer different sizes within the package as well for a better effect and look of &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; of the curls.</li>
            <li>Super super easy to use.</li>
            <li>(Like honestly who have the money for the brand name when this product does just the same okay boo boo).</li>
            <li>Seller communication could be better, but as far as the curlers themselves, I really love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used these for the first time last night and my daughter woke up with beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>In order to get a good curl on my thick hair, it needs a good 2-3 hours in (which for work, would have me getting up at 3am to put them in.)  </li>
            <li>My overall experience was very positive and I&#x27;m happy we got these curlers.</li>
            <li>I get great results with my daughter&#x27;s hair every single time.  </li>
            <li>I used more of the Magic because the tubes are longer than the curlformers and my hair was more stretched out with them once I took them out.</li>
            <li>These were pretty easy to use and the results were fabulous curls that lasted a couple of days.</li>
            <li>The curls are pretty and smooth and the formers are really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you use plenty of setting lotion and don&#x27;t plan on putting these in quickly the first time you use.</li>
            <li>and her hair turned out great and my hair is very very thin and it worked great on my hair as well</li>
            <li>Loved them, I am not very good with a curling Iron and such but these were very easy and gave me great curls</li>
            <li>She taped it and still uses it from time to time, so other than this company should produce a more durable stick for usage, I would say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I also want to say that for special occasions before I bought these I paid to have her hair curled like this.</li>
            <li>The price is just right!</li>
            <li>The price is right on target!</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on point as quoted in my order (2 Days)!</li>
            <li>The curl formers did the right thing by my hair and afforded me one day of heat-free curly locs!</li>
            <li>I just curled a few more pieces of my hair again at bedtime and in the morning I had amazing ringlets once again!</li>
            <li>but they make amazing soft curls.  </li>
            <li>I have long natural 4a/b  hair and it works perfect in my hair.</li>
            <li>These did a good job making pretty spiral curls in my natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li>The curls you get are pretty nice, but you can&#x27;t put too much hair in the curlers.</li>
            <li>but the curls are the same and is really good for all type of hair.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast, these did not have an odour has most persons had said.</li>
            <li>I was my hair every three days and these curls stay in for the full time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I chosen these instead of paying so much for curlformers.</li>
            <li>My family LOVED my purchase so much that I&#x27;m gonna have to order more, because all of us want to use them at the same time.  </li>
            <li>it was ok, they are cheaper than the curlformers I bought ($70 is tooo much,</li>
            <li>If you want good curls that will last, this product is a must bu.</li>
            <li>and my hair comes out nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good quality product for the price.</li>
            <li>one of the reasons why I love this so much is because it doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li>these are ok if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money for the real thing.</li>
            <li>The actual spiral ringlets look to be really good quality.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure that you do NOT pull too much hair through the curlformer.</li>
            <li>also it took a full 40</li>
            <li>These gave me nice curl as promised, even on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them at least five times and I get excellent results each time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post a better review after I&#x27;ve gotten some real curl cream and stuff.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the &#x27;Curlformers&#x27; brand, but i&#x27;m sure i wont have to because these work very well.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d say flexi-rod curls last longer, but these are still a good buy.</li>
            <li>glad i did because i did go thru one whole pack.</li>
            <li>Go ahead and spend more money on real curlformers</li>
            <li>This is a really cool product.</li>
            <li>Overall the product is good and works well.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because I needed 1.5 to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li>i felt competent at it after just a couple minutes and did my whole head.</li>
            <li>but I wanted my hair to be full of curls.</li>
            <li>this item is so cool.</li>
            <li>Ohhh natural nice curls.</li>
            <li>I could never do her full head of hair with a curling iron in that</li>
            <li>No need to pay full price for a &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brand curler.</li>
            <li>However, there were a lot of them (77 curlers full).  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine that the real curlformers could do any better of a job than these.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you are able to sleep in these, I don&#x27;t think these will save you much time.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Go here for my full review: hairdiary.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/curlformer-dupes/</li>
            <li>I thought that these would be a cool way to curl my hair--not.</li>
            <li>Cost is cheap and well worth it.</li>
            <li>Comes with a hook.the hook will break the same day you start using it.not a good buy</li>
            <li>I had to tape it together until I was able to go to Sally&#x27;s and buy the real one.</li>
            <li>However, these curl formers are fabulous, and are an easy way to get cascades of beautiful ringlets - even for hard to curl hair, like mine.</li>
            <li>These things give my 4c natural back length hair amazing curls!!</li>
            <li>The hook is nice and sturdy, and the openings on the curlers are easy to pinch open.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited when I saw this because I didn&#x27;t want to use heat on my hair and my hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li>When you have it right it will pull smoothly.  </li>
            <li>easy after the first time,no instructions included,so you have to figure out to put the stick through the curler,but after I got it</li>
            <li>curlers are pretty easy to use once you get the hang of them.</li>
            <li>My first thought was that these are super easy to install and</li>
            <li>Seriously the most beautiful curls I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Seriously the most beautiful curls I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>They were pretty easy to use and quick.</li>
            <li>AND THE CURLERS ARE GREAT FOR SMOOTH EDGES AND LITTLE TO NO FRIZZ.</li>
            <li>they are so happy with the curls that other people are wanting me to buythem</li>
            <li>Other than that it was great.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it was a great buy</li>
            <li>but other than that great product.</li>
            <li>The delivery of this item was great, received the package the day before the due date....</li>
            <li>One happy little girl!! :)</li>
            <li>I struggled using the orange ones my first two times but after that they worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Sleeping isn&#x27;t terribly comfortable with them in, but it&#x27;s not terrible (an old pillowcase used as a turban can keep the curlers up and out of the way and under control).  </li>
            <li>Luckily my husband poked a wire through.</li>
            <li>This rollers are super chip and they do the job.</li>
            <li>they started to ..deteriorate..rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I use Curler Magic for the first time and it was a bit intimating at first after watching Youtube video.</li>
            <li>Slept in them and when I took them out the next day Fantastic spiral curls! :) Pinned them up at night and worn a satin bonnet to bed.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m lucky to get 3 day hair.</li>
            <li>They left her with the most adorable silky looking ringlets.  </li>
            <li>Quick fix:</li>
            <li>If you looking for more volume to you hair, this product most definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li>things I will purchase many more in different sizes.</li>
            <li>It came quickly in basically a piece of plastic, but it looked like everything was inside</li>
            <li>Ringlets worked great on my hair but they were hardly enough for my whole head.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It was quick to do.</li>
            <li>I got awesome spiral curls with zero heat (left them in for 3 hours) that lasted all night and into the next morning.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>With all that said, these things allow you to QUICKLY setup a kid for a headful of curls in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I recommend putting super glue on the hook to glue the two parts together.</li>
            <li>I see zero reason to spend twice the money for real curlformers when these gave me such great results.</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of them they went in quickly.  </li>
            <li>It even arrived fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The curlers made perfect curls in my African American hair.</li>
            <li>I am recommending these to all my friends with little girls who want to have beautiful curls without all the styling products, heat and trying to twist curlers into their hair.</li>
            <li>These are great for spiral curls, but now that I know it&#x27;s a good product, I&#x27;ll probably try out the long and wide ones too!</li>
            <li>No other hair curlers have worked this nice for my hair.</li>
            <li>The sticks are cheap, so be very gentle on putting them together.</li>
            <li>They got my 4a/b mixed natural hair super straight in perfect ringlets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them twice already, and the first time my hair was a bit static-y, so I went out and bought some cheap curl defining cream</li>
            <li>They came out very pretty and looked as if I used a curling iron.</li>
            <li>(only so much will fit into the hook), since that&#x27;s good for even curls and for drying faster.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and would definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li>The wand broke the first time I used it because the plastic is too cheap for snapping together and unsnapping when finished using; so if you snap it together leave it because it may break when taking it apart.</li>
            <li>These make perfect curls, just not good for sleeping.</li>
            <li>This also shipped to my home within a day or two- very fast!</li>
            <li>I broke the brush almost immediately after trying it for the first time it was so cheaply made.</li>
            <li>the things is i wasn&#x27;t aware that the UPS the one who delivered and i am using P.O Box, but the shipping really fast!!!</li>
            <li>I normally just lightly spritz my hair ( not wet or even very damp), get them in my hair and by the time my makeup is done I have great curls.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to be the first of my friends to try this product.</li>
            <li>most of the time i wear a fro but when i am looking for new techniques to style my hair</li>
            <li>Love  my new curlfomers.</li>
            <li>These curlers was very affordable and easy to use once you got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>You will need a good amount of time to allow your hair to dry otherwise the curls will not come out at all.  </li>
            <li>I actually think it&#x27;s better quality, and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>After detangling really well these are easy to put in.</li>
            <li>they are fast and easy</li>
            <li>It really work, is really easy to use</li>
            <li>so easy to use and really do make Shirley Temple like curls.  </li>
            <li>They are VERY tricky to sleep in, but if you watch videos on how to sleep in them, it&#x27;s easily</li>
            <li>And they are super easy and fast to put on, just sleep with them and wake up with gorgeous curls every single time!</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable to sleep in and made very pretty and natural looking curls/</li>
            <li>These work exactly like the pricey Curlformers curlers!</li>
            <li>Thank you SO much!!</li>
            <li>I would have given them a 5 if my hook didn&#x27;t break on the first use!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>These are the first curlers to work!</li>
            <li>I had to redo everything to get all of my hair done, but overall, I really love this product!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These look exactly like the original ones</li>
            <li>We used curl cr&amp;egrave;me and they held all day at school--a first for her!</li>
            <li>I actually like these even better the Curlformers!</li>
            <li>As with the CurlFormers after reading those reviews, the first time using them was tricky, but I got the hang of it and my hair turned out just like the pictures!  </li>
            <li>I actually like these better than the ones I have!</li>
            <li>The most important part of the entire thing is to get the full section of hair inside the mouth of the curler.</li>
            <li>They are pretty comfy too!  </li>
            <li>However, these didn&#x27;t come with instructions, so please watch a video first!</li>
            <li>They are pretty easy to use (watch You Tube first).</li>
            <li>These curlers are amazing (and super simple).</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and actually works better than a curling iron in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and actually works better than a curling iron in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My daughter looked absolutely adorable and her curl is still going strong 2 days later.  </li>
            <li>Perfect, but very hard.</li>
            <li>I have very curly but fine hair.</li>
            <li>The 95% dried hair yields the best results, but I was happily satisfied with the semi-curls I received from fully dry hair as well.</li>
            <li>The stick comes in handy and they really make your hair so soft without heat!</li>
            <li>1-2 of my forms had holes, but other than that they all work great and so much cheaper than name brand!</li>
            <li>and I got perfect romantic loose curls.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to putting the rollers in, but once you get the hang of them they work great.  </li>
            <li>A little too well actually lol.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine anyone needing all of them, so if you have lots of hair and a tough scalp, these will be a great investment!</li>
            <li>Once I get the hang of it, and fine tune my product selection to fight frizz, I&#x27;ll be able to create a &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; look with relative ease.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!!!</li>
            <li>also may want to wash them in warm/hot water with some shampoo before your first and after every use simply to keep them clean and effective.</li>
            <li>a really good dupe for the real thing, they came super fast, and if you dont want to pay the extra money, very worth while.</li>
            <li>They take a little more time to put in but the result are great with my hair being NATURAL.</li>
            <li>If you have any daughters, this would be the most adorable hairstyle, but I don&#x27;t know how little girls would enjoy sleeping with these curlformers over night.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money trying to get a brand name when these ate just as great.</li>
            <li>When I found out how much they cost, I had a fit.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look further than here for the amazing curlers that everybody is talking about.</li>
            <li>But, the price is so cheap that I&#x27;m not complaining too much.</li>
            <li>Really yanked my hair and didn&#x27;t pull through smoothly.</li>
            <li>But never put to much of your hair in the hook/curlers it will clump your hair and wont slide in smoothly as it should.</li>
            <li>These are well worth it.</li>
            <li>and it defiantly is worth the price</li>
            <li>The material is not as soft as the curlformers, but it makes a better curl.</li>
            <li>For the price though so worth trying and having in the arsenal of hair products.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because they aren&#x27;t the most comfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li>They were a challenge, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>To me, it just isn&#x27;t worth the process.</li>
            <li>Either I&#x27;m completely unaware of my own strength (which does happen from time to time.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and I was able to do heat-less curls that lasted for the week.</li>
            <li>My hair was shiny &amp; just overall nice, when I took them out my roots</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>This was just as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>They are worth trying, however, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the number of curlers you get.</li>
            <li>I really like how so many comes in the pack, that really helps with how the hair turns out.  </li>
            <li>but I love the fact that they give me a soft curl that lasts.</li>
            <li>it did make hair curl....but would never recommend its use....not worth the effort</li>
            <li>It is by far a better value.</li>
            <li>Then I started taking them out and decided that I&#x27;d just have to find a way to make them more comfortable at night...or possibly put them in in the morning on a day off and remove them at night before bed.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped from China so the return shipping costs weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine these are as good as the real deal because I don&#x27;t think</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>The curlers and wand arrived earlier than expected and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>all in all, its worth it</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>So far though, love these things.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it would be nice to have directions in there for people that don&#x27;t know how to use them already.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice that my hair snagged a couple times on a couple formers, but well worth the HUGH price difference.</li>
            <li>it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope you have as much fun with these as I have.</li>
            <li>hope you have as much fun with these as I have.</li>
            <li>It took me awhile to get them all in, but once I can figure out how to keep the style longer than a day, it will be worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I used the tools on freshly washed hair</li>
            <li>I did use these on a 4a/4b friend which MUCH thicker hair and the orange and pink ones were great.</li>
            <li>I also made sure to wash these twice before using (since HELLO cheap mass-produced Chinese brand here).</li>
            <li>My initial purchase of this item was a gift for my daughter, she loved the produce so much.  </li>
            <li>these curlers you&#x27;re only effective if you have some type of setting lotion in your hair</li>
            <li>- well worth the effort and investment.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these rollers to anyone who wants to look good on a budget.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, it worked pretty good, but the second time I used it the wand snapped in two and I cannot find a site where you can just buy the wand and not curlers.  </li>
            <li>(: Just have fun with it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just easier, I use Redken Fresh Curls Curl Spray and my spirals  </li>
            <li>To fix this and loosen the curls so they looked more natural</li>
            <li>They are fun and the results are lovely, soft, bouncy curls.r in because I was losing patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are fun and the results are lovely, soft, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>because they don&#x27;t hold up as well as a flexirod set, but something worth trying to not put stress on your hair with heat.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how big they were honestly.</li>
            <li>I like using this product, pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quicker than stated which was awesome, however they were of poor quality.</li>
            <li>It took a while when getting the hang of it,  but the result was well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>For those of us that still remember shirley temple and her iconic curls, you would be gussing over your soft bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>I slept with them on overnight, which I&#x27;ll admit wasn&#x27;t all that comfortable but not terrible, and the next morning when I took them out</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Still, totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>it was great to find an easy way to tame my mane!!</li>
            <li>These create such a cool effect and they&#x27;re so easy to put in your hair!</li>
            <li>the plastic was the same as the original curlformers!!</li>
            <li>I was right about the hook - flimsy - worth it to invest in 1 or 2  brand name CurlFormers</li>
            <li>One day I was browsing YouTube channels looking for a new, easy and cute style for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair dries super fast and the curl lasts for days!</li>
            <li>I had my friend put them in, and she got the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>First Off, They Arrived Really Quickly.</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to use and more there are more than enough curlers to use on my thick haired 4 yr old.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than the original curlformers.</li>
            <li>Put wrap foam on each portion of my hair right before I put the Curlformer in.(it&#x27;s best if your hair is a little damp not wet) Put a blow dryer bonnet on for about 30 mins.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>How I use it is right after I come out of the shower I put my leave in and oil in my hair then either use mousse or a styling smoothie/gel on each section I do before pulling it through the curler to insure that they stay.</li>
            <li>If you do everything right, by the 5th-7th time, youll nail it like a pro.</li>
            <li>I watched 5,000 videos on YouTube just to get it right</li>
            <li>My hair basically slid right through them, and I have 4b/c hair, too.  </li>
            <li>You have to find the right size for your hair length</li>
            <li>The price is just right also.</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>You could tell I was a beginner as I didn&#x27;t have a lot of uniformity to the sections I took or whether I used the clockwise or counter clockwise ones in the right places.  </li>
            <li>I set my hair right after a Nupur treatment.</li>
            <li>They arrived right away.  </li>
            <li>Will contact seller and have to wait to get the right part.</li>
            <li>I do not plan to use it to perm or blow-dry, so I&#x27;m not too concerned about the supposed issue of it not being the exact same kind of material as the brand name</li>
            <li>Only used them a couple times, but so far I feel like they&#x27;ve been successful.</li>
            <li>I also thought I&#x27;d put them in and clean my house, but I really couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that makes gives my hair beautiful curls that last all day with no heat.  </li>
            <li>However, they are very easy to use if you watch video tutorials and such</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have a VERY strong grip, so once you slip your hair through them, they definitely stay on.</li>
            <li>the hook had a scrap of plastic left on it from molding that I cut and filed down, but it&#x27;s perfect now so no biggie!</li>
            <li>Next time I will try the smaller rollers with some setting foam and a hood dryer to see if I get ringlets that hold better, but great job so far.</li>
            <li>Took them out in less than 3 minutes the next morning with perfect curls.  </li>
            <li>After I did the first couple of curls, it went pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these, they came quickly, the only downside is that they arrived in a Ziploc bag</li>
            <li>There was absolutely no difference in quality, very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not able to buy the official Curlformers, these are a great substitute.</li>
            <li>Generally, I use 38 of the 40 curlformers that come in the package, but I&#x27;m thinking of ordering about 8 more because I want to make the sections</li>
            <li>3rd time I used it, I did not get as good results but it was my own fault because I used a leave-in conditioner that was too heavy.</li>
            <li>Pretty much like the original curlformers.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than the actual curl formers and almost work even better!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to anyone looking to get beautiful curls with little fuss.</li>
            <li>If the opening of the curler does not cover the wand completely or if held at a certain angle be sure your hair will get caught in the wand</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re able to sit under the dryer ,if you can&#x27;t then it kind of hard to maintain.</li>
            <li>A must buy for anyone who wants amazing curls and waves, especially if you want to avoid any heat tools.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a great deal to buy them &amp; spend an extra $3-$4 for an actual Curlformer hook.</li>
            <li>Really drys quick also.</li>
            <li>Never had any hair that got tangled, only set the curler too far away from my scalp twice, and loved the results.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>use it all the time for my 5 yr old easy to use on children!&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>Be the trend setter among your friends make them green with envy then give out the name of this magic tool and they will surely follow.</li>
            <li>The curlers are a great way to lock in moisture, just not very good for curls.</li>
            <li>The original curl formers which I also own sells at just a little over 57.00 for the kit</li>
            <li>After lusting after the beautiful curls of the ladies of YouTube for well over a year, I finally bought a curlformers dupe and discovered that I absolutely hate that perfectly coiffed curl look on myself.  </li>
            <li>My advice is to definitely order these with sufficient time in mind and check the package right away to make sure everything is included.</li>
            <li>My curls was nice and loose.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, uncomfortable to sleep in, but beautiful results.</li>
            <li>I read the mixed reviews and was super nervous!!</li>
            <li>My daughter who has very straight hair slept in these and took them out in the morning-</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It goes very fast.</li>
            <li>the only negative thing I have to say about these curlers is that they really aren&#x27;t that comfortable to sleep in, but the results are GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>But for my  hair it didn&#x27;t last till morning, I have very light hair</li>
            <li>However, it also did a very nice job on smoothing each section and getting out a few of the knots I made when I tried to put in too much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cheap compared to actual curlformers.</li>
            <li>I do recommend using some kind of setting cream though so your hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up and plus it adds some extra shine and makes your hair super soft.</li>
            <li>As far as the quality the curlers go, they are fine.</li>
            <li>I use these in my daughter&#x27;s hair - it is very fine and will not hold a curl with a flat iron or curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I like new gadgets and love experimenting with new hair techniques.</li>
            <li>Exchange for new item was easy and fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>First of all, these came VERY fast.</li>
            <li>Also just about perfect length, depending on the day my hair seems a little too long for them</li>
            <li>At first I struggle with insulation but after a while it was quick simple and easy.</li>
            <li>These do great on hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li>They work great on  my daughter&#x27;s hard to curl hair.  </li>
            <li>in all, if you have shorter hair that is not thick, these might work for you for special events, etc.  </li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t spend all that money on the curlformers when I got the same results with these.</li>
            <li>Sock buns, foam curlers, curling around a head band at night, hot curlers, curing irons - literally everything</li>
            <li>It was tricky at first to get them in</li>
            <li>most definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li>The first time takes a bit, but after that, it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li>So, again, if you have more hair I think these would be really great, but if you have a really sensitive scalp or thin hair, I&#x27;d say no.</li>
            <li>I do however love these curlers and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I am quiet pleased with the amout of curlers.</li>
            <li>(Packaging was basically a big ziploc bag:)</li>
            <li>I like to separate the curls into smaller sections of curls for more volume.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length relaxed hair and the curlers were more than enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>Placing it any higher on my hair resulted in the hook getting tangled into my hair at the scalp and the risk of breaking my hair if I tried to force it.</li>
            <li>I hope to purchase more from them in a bigger size!</li>
            <li>Everything is ingenious and simple.</li>
            <li>these curlers did the job perfectly and without the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li>I love doing roller sets on my hair, especially  rod sets  </li>
            <li>My product was not defected and I am overall satisfied.</li>
            <li>I used them the first night that I had them</li>
            <li>but I did soak them in really hot water and soap as a precaution.</li>
            <li>There is no reason to go out and buy the expensive brand name set though, these worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>When all was said and done after my first attempt, I must say I had no problems hooking my hair and pulling it through.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li>so next year I prob won&#x27;t be able to use them..</li>
            <li>I most definitely will not pay for curl formers from Sally</li>
            <li>My daughter and I are in love with the results and we have 2 completely different hair types.</li>
            <li>I first heard about these on Youtube and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>I received soooo many compliments the next day!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First, this took forever to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have theses smooth soft &amp;#34;Snoop</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>the Magic spirals are too big for the curlformers wand.</li>
            <li>Also, keep in mind that these come from China, so don&#x27;t expect to receive fast shipping!</li>
            <li>this sounds better than buying multiple sets, if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>other then that this is the beat thing since slice bread :-)!</li>
            <li>They are no where near comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it should</li>
            <li>My first try took about an hour</li>
            <li>The first time I tried to put the curlers in, 2 of them broke.</li>
            <li>These really do work!</li>
            <li>At first a struggle to learn how to use them.</li>
            <li>That I didn&#x27;t expect but then again, I used them a LOT when I first got them.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s held up very well!</li>
            <li>I pair them with my Softhood dryer attachment, since they are way too uncomfortable to sleep in, and the curls turn out perfectly every time.</li>
            <li>The only thing  will say as a word of warning if you have a tender head you probably will not be able to sleep in these and will need to sit under a dryer for an hour.</li>
            <li>Worked exactly like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>everybody gave compliments to my hair for the first time i used it..</li>
            <li>I went to Sally&#x27;s at first</li>
            <li>All that to say, you get what you pay for but these definitely are not terrible!</li>
            <li>I did wash them twice in hot soap water and rinse them (didn&#x27;t like the plastic smell).</li>
            <li>so my texture is different but it worked for us both more for me though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the real curlformers, but these do the job!</li>
            <li>I also did not do them in front of the mirror the first time, so I did not watch what I was doing.</li>
            <li>My curls were so defined and smooth; my hair so bouncy and soft, almost as if I came from the salon.  </li>
            <li>They work exactly how they are intended.</li>
            <li>Marula-Muru Moisture butter then attached the magic leverage curl former, adding moisture with a spray bottle as needed.</li>
            <li>The first curler went in with no issues.</li>
            <li>I was going to pay 4 times more for a similar product.</li>
            <li>I might post a picture, we shall see...;)</li>
            <li>The trick is twisting the hair at the root first and then pulling it through.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what my curl formers do.</li>
            <li>Wish I had seen these first.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>no problem the first time.  </li>
            <li>LOVE them and definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li>I first suggest you super-glue the hook, because I have heard complaints of it breaking.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things including the peach colored perming rods (results were very similar).</li>
            <li>but it was still a challenge for a first timer like myself to put them in.</li>
            <li>It took some practice at first</li>
            <li>I received 2  of  the  same top hook  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if these are the generic version, I STILL LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>These are better than traditional roller setting!</li>
            <li>, I then pushed the hair back to the top of the curler to untangle.  </li>
            <li>One, the hook broke on me from the first time I tried to assemble.</li>
            <li>these work just as well as the name brand and are SO much cheaper!</li>
            <li>) Use as many formers as possible!</li>
            <li>The curlers are EXACTLY like curlformers without the price tag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to me that they dont understand BUSINESS ETHICS ,and solely interested in making money , even if this accounts to FRAUD.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use them yet but they seen pretty durable.</li>
            <li>The order came a whole day ahead of time!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering the real thing from now on, it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>AND MY STICK BROKE FIRST ATTEMPT.</li>
            <li>The trick is not to put too big of a chunk of hair in the curlformer and to make sure the hair doesn&#x27;t escape the rod as you pull it through the curlformer.</li>
            <li>Get ready for alot of curl!</li>
            <li>Can be tricky to use at first.</li>
            <li>The first day at work after using these, some of my coworkers thought I had gotten rid of my dreadies.  </li>
            <li>Get these and get real results!  </li>
            <li>even smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I put Krazy Glue all over the hook part as soon as I opened the package, because I&#x27;d heard horror stories from others about hooks breaking on first use.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This came fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>So glad I found these for a fraction of the cost of traditional curlformers!</li>
            <li>Well the problem is, is that I didn&#x27;t know what length to buy at first</li>
            <li>First, the shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li>Just tried it for the first time</li>
            <li>I can tell these are better then hot curlers, regular rollers, flex rods, and even my clipless curling iron.</li>
            <li>But overall its not terrible</li>
            <li>and I used as many as possible and still have about 8 extras in the package.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly how it should.</li>
            <li>Recommend watching a video on YouTube how to do it first.</li>
            <li>They are exactly like the product named Curlformers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure work just the same.</li>
            <li>: I still love these curlformers, and have used them a total of 6 times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay the extra money for the name-brand version.</li>
            <li>The heated curlers are to hot for my hands.</li>
            <li>I let them soak in HOT water to rinse of any manufacture stuff you know.</li>
            <li>It did exactly like it says it will do.</li>
            <li>, they do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do</li>
            <li>Be sure to use some type of product in each section before putting it in the curl former (curly pudding, can&#x27;t shea, etc) and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Even though my curls didn&#x27;t last more than a day or so</li>
            <li>I love them overall.</li>
            <li>They work great with no problems and last me a long time.</li>
            <li>40 is more than enough for one person.</li>
            <li>actually ended up buying more after this set.</li>
            <li>I have because I only got 2 top halves of the hook.</li>
            <li>However, 40 curlers wasn&#x27;t quite enough for all of my medium length mostly 4A hair.</li>
            <li>Will most likely end up buying one at a beauty supply store or another online retailer.</li>
            <li>This price was much better than that of the regular curl formers.  </li>
            <li>We put them in their wet hair at night and in the morning they have nice ringlets and no knots.  </li>
            <li>I still love Bantu, but I felt like thse made it a bit easier, and it&#x27;s a different type of curl.</li>
            <li>So now I have choices for my no-heat looks, which is pretty</li>
            <li>We probably used 20-25 the first time.  </li>
            <li>If this is your first time I would recommend watching some YouTube tutorials on them to save you a lot of trial and error.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it should.  </li>
            <li>, Can&#x27;t wait to try them this following Monday!!!!! :)</li>
            <li>They give me perfect corkscrew curls which is not what I wanted unfortunately.</li>
            <li>My first time using these was years ago with the shorter ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these for a couple of months now and overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>but I bought two packs (because the first worked well</li>
            <li>My curls came out really pretty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be trying it on damp hair with another product that holds better next!</li>
            <li>So stop looking at the price and get them now, 40 in a pack is more than enough.</li>
            <li>would not even dream about using heat now ;)</li>
            <li>I First Saw A Video Review Of Curlformers</li>
            <li>I will need to order more &amp;#34;curlers&amp;#34; as 40 was not enough.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and takes curls very easily so it came out in the exact shape of these curlers, ie Shirley Temple.</li>
            <li>I was up most of the night trying to find a comfortable way to lay my head down.</li>
            <li>The curlers work very nicely and may be hard to use at first,  </li>
            <li>This is not near as easy as it looks on you tube!</li>
            <li>I had just the right amount for my full naturally kinky curled hair.</li>
            <li>Installation was quick and simple just like with the name-brand product, and the results are smooth and shiny, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Works very well and shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>I like them, I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to get the exact results I want, but they work perfectly fine for my super thick 3b/c curls.</li>
            <li>i have fine to normal strands with normal density.</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and I go long periods without relaxing it, so for a quick and easy style</li>
            <li>Also let me be clear that I haven&#x27;t used original curlformers, so</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair curls after wearing the former overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Its a long process but love the end results.</li>
            <li>They work really great, curls last long, and they are very defined.</li>
            <li>The plastic is thinner and the ends are made with cheap, flimsy, rubber instead of the more firm rubber the first set had.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the resulting long lasting, shiny curls - and the compliments :-)</li>
            <li>I love the product (Vakind Hair Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets Former Leverage Stretched Length).</li>
            <li>My hair is hard to style but these finally give me the option of perfect curls!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and the curls look great, there just hard to sleep with.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product for the money spent.</li>
            <li>The curl formers were made very well and created smooth curls in my 4B,C natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I currently have heat damaged hair and decided to do non heat styles to get my hair back into good shape.</li>
            <li>SOMETHING because these gave me the most perfectly smooth and firm curl set that I&#x27;ve ever had using no relaxer and NO HEAT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i didn&#x27;t spend the extra money on the real curl formers product.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did because I ended up using nearly 50 on my 7 year old&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>But Instead I got some cheap product (with shorter length and only 18 curlformer) worth around Rs 400.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i look like a total fewl with these in, but i don&#x27;t even care because they make my hair look so good later!</li>
            <li>They pretty much mold your hair to the exact shape of the curlers (I used a product with them, fyi).  </li>
            <li>and I was able to do a really good job, it wasn&#x27;t that difficult.</li>
            <li>Very simple and easy, very fast to catch on to.</li>
            <li>The Curlformers prices are high, but it&#x27;s an investment worth making in my opinion.</li>
            <li>A perfect way to get heatless curls that last without hair spray even with fine, thin hair that is resistant to curling!  </li>
            <li>I just used these last night and they are pretty cool!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown out my relaxer, so it&#x27;s been hard to stay away from the flat iron to keep my curls, but these do a wonderful job</li>
            <li>The first package too a while to get to me, but the next package was delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li>So when I saw a (raving) positive review of the Vakind Curlers on YouTube - I practically ran to my computer to order them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>When Naptural85 did a POSITIVE review comparing these dupes to CurlFormers, I jumped on the dupe-bandwagon.</li>
            <li>First of all the delivery was FAST.</li>
            <li>Gonna order me some more today &amp; what I did realize if you have really long hair</li>
            <li>it being more stretched</li>
            <li>Even when I cluelessly put up my lion&#x27;s mane for the first time, it went surprisingly fast.</li>
            <li>I imagine that these will be plenty long for most</li>
            <li>They work exactly like the real curl formers.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think they would really curl my hair</li>
            <li>but the ends of my hair wasn&#x27;t as crisp and straight as my roots.</li>
            <li>first the ship is really fast</li>
            <li>, pretty much i bought it, used it once, and haven&#x27;t picked it up since</li>
            <li>Okay first let me start by saying I do not normally do reviews.</li>
            <li>My oldest daughter&#x27;s hair is about 14 inches long, these curlers are more like 30 inches.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing I would consider if you are interested in purchasing is buying a stronger hook from the real curlformers company.</li>
            <li>and so ended up paying more in the long run.</li>
            <li>This is so much better then the other one and worth the money 10 times over.</li>
            <li>First of all it is much longer making it easier to work with.</li>
            <li>I would much rather curl my hair this way than with a hot tool.</li>
            <li>If not better than Curlformers, then just as good.</li>
            <li>When finished wrapping I have a soft dryer bonnet that I put over the ponytail for fifteen minutes and then let cool.</li>
            <li>This uses the full length of your hair, so don&#x27;t under-estimate how long your hair is, or else, expect to pull it away from your scalp a little to make sure you&#x27;re sure to curl the ends.</li>
            <li>But once I got it down my hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li>They work wonderfully every time as long as your hair has enough time to fully dry.</li>
            <li>VERY easy to use, a little tougher to get the hang of and get the right style</li>
            <li>So far I have only used this item twice and was impressed with the results only after my second time of using them.</li>
            <li>I was familiar with the more (much) more expensive brand, and this works just as well.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately I can not do a rod set on my own hair, but then when I heard about these!!</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m sure I will use them more in the future.  </li>
            <li>i heard the original curl formers are soft but you get a better curl for these because they are harder.</li>
            <li>; I really liked the results on the half of my hair that I did get done since it was almost dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily I had some pink perm rods and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li>What appears so simple and easy on you tube turned into a bit of a nightmare for me.</li>
            <li>I feel that for this tool, you need a leave-in that is lightweight and be sure that the curlformers are COMPLETELY dry.</li>
            <li>My hair came out nice every time the only downside is that is you are not careful you can pull your hair out.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t come with instructions, but you can find them easy enough online.</li>
            <li>Then make sure they are totally dry when removing.</li>
            <li>very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of putting them on they are so easy and could take only 20 minutes to do!</li>
            <li>So easy and simple to install</li>
            <li>I have used mines now several times and they still stand strong to the test.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them twice since I got them because my hair is so long and its work for me to do alone, my hair texture does not lend itself to stay curly for a good while.</li>
            <li>they were very tight curls.&lt;br /&gt;-my daughter &amp;#34;loads&amp;#34; the curlers, so it&#x27;s super easy!</li>
            <li>what looks like a large crochet hook through the curler, and twist a section of your hair, then hook your hair and pull it through the curler.  </li>
            <li>Now that my order has arrived, I can certainly feel and see the difference in quality between the hooks.</li>
            <li>I also bought the large ones for my daughter who has waist length hair.</li>
            <li>The wand is a bit large but it works.</li>
            <li>If you use a lot of rods, take a large section in each side of your head and out a hair tie over it.</li>
            <li>these are too large.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day the curler are loose, but I also love that look.</li>
            <li>So I had to work with only the orange ones which was fine.</li>
            <li>pretty sure you&#x27;ve seen this in other reviews is the wand i have to admit mines</li>
            <li>curls look nice but try not to put too much hair in one curl because it wont give it as much of a tight curl.</li>
            <li>Honestly I think they are a little bit of a headache to put on (time consuming) but if your like me and want every ounce of sleep you can get then this is for you.</li>
            <li>and it even came with its own little carrying case to hold all the curlers and stick .</li>
            <li>bought for a 14 yr olds hair that is baby fine yet thick hair.. love theses curlers.</li>
            <li>Make sure the curlers aren&#x27;t to tight on your scalp creating more tension then necessary !&lt;</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, medium fine hair, but I have TONS of it - so much hair!</li>
            <li>The original ones are marked with &amp;#34;JXL&amp;#34; on their cuff, but the new, inferior ones, have no markings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are hard to get on your hair at times and not at all comfortable to sleep in however, they do make a lovely curl.</li>
            <li>They were left in overnight (not the best night&#x27;s sleep unfortunately!) and easily removed in the morning.</li>
            <li>or like I&#x27;m trying too hard to be young and cute.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>This curler is amazing for African, coarse type hair.</li>
            <li>hair goes from curly poodle to pin straight in a couple of hours even with products; can&#x27;t blame that entirely on the curlformers, my hair plays an important role in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>these really gave my hair nice fluffy curls.</li>
            <li>For the price this is fantastic, especially through Amazon prime.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare them to the real curl-former&#x27;s</li>
            <li>They are fairly straight forward</li>
            <li>and you have to decide on how much hair to get through the tube.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Both of these also depend on how much hair you put in each curler.</li>
            <li>* Mesh and coil quality are low-grade and not like the real thing.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them on my niece&#x27;s thin hair and they worked great as well.</li>
            <li>They shipped fast, and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li>These really do work.  </li>
            <li>Also, the hair went straight within a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I got my package really fast</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair</li>
            <li>It took me 2 hours to get 25 into my hair, which covered my whole head.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the real curlformers.</li>
            <li>I have pin straight hair that has never held any curl</li>
            <li>The package arrived within 7 days which was much faster than some of the reviews that claimed it would take two weeks.</li>
            <li>The curl rod was very flimsy</li>
            <li>I had no hair breakage or hair being torn out, you ladies were probably trying to pull too much hair through or didn&#x27;t brush your hair..</li>
            <li>and they are going away fast</li>
            <li>It was very professional.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Also the hook was very flimsy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll be purchasing a real from the Curlformers website.</li>
            <li>very reliable product, unlike my cats.</li>
            <li>So yea, and they stay the whole day</li>
            <li>This product works very well and the curls stay all day.  </li>
            <li>One package just gets her whole head done.  </li>
            <li>Fast Delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>its not so much the tool but what you use with.</li>
            <li>While doing my set, I had a problem with this, but once I clipped off the extra plastic and used a nail filer to smooth it out, it seemed to work</li>
            <li>because i had 80 formers i didn&#x27;t really need to seperate.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t add to much hair or it won&#x27;t go through/</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are much cheaper than Curlformers</li>
            <li>The unfilled part of the coil will just be there hanging off the end curling a whole bunch of nothing.</li>
            <li>They did the job very well.</li>
            <li>Shipped REALLY fast.</li>
            <li>These were so much cheaper than buying the name brand.</li>
            <li>but it is much cheaper</li>
            <li>but once I did the process was fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of starting out with damp hair, I spritzed my hair lightly with water and set  the curls, section by section.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as the real curl formers.</li>
            <li>Made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>these issues are acknowledged correctly, then I would absolutely recommend this off-brand product to anyone of all hair textures who want the option of creating curls without heat.</li>
            <li>With that said the cost is still MUCH cheaper than buying name brand.</li>
            <li>This also worked a lot better on soaking wet hair than it did on damp</li>
            <li>The curls are so pretty on this 16 year old&#x27;s long hair :)</li>
            <li>The wand that comes with it is trash compared to the real curlformers wand</li>
            <li>The seller was fast.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really a matter of not trying to pull to much hair at once, or tangled hair, through the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would have gone much faster</li>
            <li>In case anyone may think I was putting too much hair in at once let me assure you that was not the case.</li>
            <li>and it can be a real pain to style it at times.</li>
            <li>I think this product would work on any type of hair especiall naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li>I paid WAY TOO MUCH money for Curlformers in Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>I had a couple of hits when passing the hair through the curlformer, since they are spirals they tend to bounce, so just be careful :)</li>
            <li>It works just like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very springy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare them to the real deal considering</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast with both products.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out very shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li>This product was way better than I could have ever expected.</li>
            <li>Plus, I can&#x27;t really get the rod to come apart after putting it together.</li>
            <li>I really like these curlers.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product as yet, so I can&#x27;t say much about it.</li>
            <li>The curlers were in a ziploc bag, but for the price I guess I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I did not experience any of the problems I have read in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The product came in a very timely fashion.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>it worked better on wet hair for me</li>
            <li>so I have to buy the real curl formers</li>
            <li>Really helps if you watch a tutorial.  </li>
            <li>They are so much easier than using a curler set.</li>
            <li>it would fit properly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Works like a charm, but the wand is a bit cheap and doesn&#x27;t click together properly</li>
            <li>and my curls are almost all straight.</li>
            <li>hair that has really kinky/tight curls that resembles an afro when shrunken.</li>
            <li>I see no reason to pay 70 bucks for Curlformers when you can get these for so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>But with the price that wasnt a real issue for me.</li>
            <li>you are a woman with curly hair or even straight hair</li>
            <li>Also do not put too much hair in</li>
            <li>soo  much  </li>
            <li>but this is very easier way to get that look.</li>
            <li>It is very practical and you can do it on yourself.</li>
            <li>My straight hair now has so much bounce and body.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really even need product, just conditioner.</li>
            <li>Thanks and Be Blessed..</li>
            <li>Great versatility especially for African American hair.</li>
            <li>It is a great idea but too frustrating.</li>
            <li>Flimsy, feels as if it will break if you attempt to pull to much hair.  </li>
            <li>Quality-wise, the hook is really flimsy and I expect I&#x27;ll need to replace it soon.</li>
            <li>I ordered these to see if they would function and curl my hair anything like the real curlformers.  </li>
            <li>The curlers feel sturdy, and the hook is better than expected from the reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>They were better that I expected.  </li>
            <li>the curlformers came just like in package.the shipping was neat and the package came really fast.</li>
            <li>these one&#x27;s are really week.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t like that they were rolled together in bunches of 5.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable enough for them to sleep in.</li>
            <li>This is so like it has been advertised my hairdresser wants 2</li>
            <li>The real wands are about $3.50 at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>or I used too much hair product, but my hair would not go through the tube if my life depended on it.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>The downside is that you can&#x27;t  sleep in them very well.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted curls throughout my hair without using the curling iron.</li>
            <li>For some reason I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of Flexi rods but these were much easier.</li>
            <li>but I think they&#x27;re much shorter.</li>
            <li>If you have tried or heard of Curlformers and wanted a cheap alternative then this is definitely the product for you!</li>
            <li>They are very durable, I got everything the description provided and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered these because they are so much cheaper than the brands out there</li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>They really work and your hair stays for days.</li>
            <li>This product worked really well.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the speed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use all of them, but if you think it&#x27;s necessary, feel free to buy two.</li>
            <li>- maybe some product would help, too, though water really helps.</li>
            <li>My sister has the real curlformers.</li>
            <li>Would have given 4 stars had the hook not broken.</li>
            <li>I also really like the speed.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I recommend this as a reasonable alternative for Curlformers.</li>
            <li>At $15, this compares very favorably with the brand name version.</li>
            <li>This is straight up curly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They cost as much as my starter kit of 6, so I went for it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I do love that I can use it with my hair wet.</li>
            <li>This makes sleeping soo much easier.</li>
            <li>These work very well in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Daughters whole cheerleading team loves them.</li>
            <li>The curlformers themselves are very well made.</li>
            <li>Save your money on this one and get twice as much.</li>
            <li>fast and does not damage your hair.</li>
            <li>but I expected way more defined curls, plus my hair matted after the day with this style.</li>
            <li>I actually did mine on Day 3 hair and just used a water bottle to spritz the sections lightly</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference between the hook provided in the kit and the curlformer hook.  </li>
            <li>If you are struggling, you are trying to get too much hair in the curler.  </li>
            <li>I did start to get one when I was tugging on the crown of my hair, but that was because I was cramming too much hair in because I was losing patience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These curled my hair very well.</li>
            <li>Package came relatively fast compared to where it was coming from.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really get to use them.</li>
            <li>The curlers are great, but one if the tools were broken in one of my packages when I received it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve spent most of my morning trying to put these on ... after a while</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;m just going to give up because my head hurt so much from pulling out so much hair</li>
            <li>After about 5 hours of having it on my head hurt so much</li>
            <li>and they work really well.  </li>
            <li>and they work very well.  </li>
            <li>Then I use a light hairspray after and the curls stay in all day and even into the next day.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the name-brand, and they work very well.  </li>
            <li>But there are smaller curlers available.</li>
            <li>It took me about 1.5 hours to do my whole head.</li>
            <li>I really like using these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>Also, the hook doesn&#x27;t stay clicked together very well</li>
            <li>I did my whole head with one pack.  </li>
            <li>It wouldnt have been so much trial and error.</li>
            <li>They work and are priced very well</li>
            <li>Does not hurt the scalp as much and easier to sleep in.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use them much.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone who wants no heat curls.</li>
            <li>Except they really really cause soreness and pain to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know if they really work or stay in&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only worn these once they are not as comfortable as i thought they would be</li>
            <li>but I brought the dupe not the real thing</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into hair typing, my curl pattern ranges from about 3C - 4b and in some places it doesn&#x27;t really curl at all</li>
            <li>I received it fast too.</li>
            <li>Because Much Of My Hair Is Still Relaxed.</li>
            <li>and they are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Too much hair</li>
            <li>Oh I had such great hopes for these...but not only are they too short (about 4&amp;#34</li>
            <li>No matter how much gunk, time, or cursing I used, these just wouldn&#x27;t produce anything resembling spiral curls in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used em twice now so far and both times had complete strangers actually stopping me to compliment me on my hair and wanting to know what I had used to get such beautiful curls! &#x3D;</li>
            <li>My curls were a tad frizzy, so next time I&#x27;ll try a slightly different approach and see what kind of difference</li>
            <li>I have a cowlick on the back of my head near the top so from the side</li>
            <li>in  the  near  future :)</li>
            <li>I have natural, kinky hair and these still do a great job on my thick</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked the way my hair looked the next day.</li>
            <li>I just received these today &amp; wow!!!</li>
            <li>However, after using the Curlformers for so long, many of them are being to kind of fall apart (the openings get loose and will slide around the hair, especially when damp), so I needed to replace some of them.</li>
            <li>I tried to use more curlers with less hair in them, and that seemed to work pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;These can hurt your head a bit.</li>
            <li>the technique is pretty simple to master and goes fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I have watched various tutorials on curlformers and the &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; on YouTube, and the general consensus seemed to be that the off brand was just as good if not better than the original!</li>
            <li>If you or your child has a sensitive scalp or issues with their hair being pulled, this is probably not the right product for you.</li>
            <li>Loved them and the curls last longer than any other thing we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>was a great addition to my process after I filled down some of the hard plastic deformities.</li>
            <li>After working with these formers for a few minutes it became very easy and fast to put in and take out.  </li>
            <li>I will NOT buy the expensive curlformers when these are just as good!</li>
            <li>I was glad I got two from the other</li>
            <li>I love the results, they form such pretty curls and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li>I am unsure why anyone would pay more for other sets.</li>
            <li>i am so excited to try different style of my hair again...</li>
            <li>Also, take your time placing your hair in the loop and if I was you, possibly looking in a mirror for the first few maybe a good suggestion.</li>
            <li>Anyways, the plastic from the other ones is softer and more manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These look and work exactly like my Curlformers, maybe a little better.</li>
            <li>They arrived rolled on top of each other and had to be separated.</li>
            <li>I normally have wavy hair and love that I can now get it curly without having to wakeup extra early.</li>
            <li>I also took the advice of the other reviewers and bought a Curlformer hook as many said that worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to work with at first,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars, because I think the curl formers themselves are probably fine, especially for the price, but now I have to order a new plastic tool from another company.  </li>
            <li>The curlers are very long, longer than my hair (hair is mid back length), which is great because I won&#x27;t have to replace as my hair grows.</li>
            <li>They were easy to install after watching a video on YouTube , it&#x27;s just time consuming &amp; for my 4b hair to dry</li>
            <li>then i came across a youtuber by the name of Napturals (or something) and she did a comparison between these and the more expensive kind and her results from these were actually better than the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>awesome, not sure what I would be missing by ordering the off brand</li>
            <li>They make it look easy, and be forewarned that your first few will be a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold curl long without a holding product: This product produces GORGEOUS curls, but if you want them to last long, make sure to apply a holding product on the hair prior to installing the ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No biggy, my thick haired sistas just add a piece of duck tape to the middle works beautifully.</li>
            <li>The second time around after using a regular light moisturizer my curls were bouncy and had a shine yet didn’t last more than two day.</li>
            <li>It was hard to pull the hair through, but the results were very cute.  </li>
            <li>Unless you want to take the extra time to do this every day, I would recommend special occasions and when you want to have a girly spa type night.  </li>
            <li>Plus Curls always look extra special.</li>
            <li>By my third curlformer set (which is in my hair right now!), I am sliding these curlers on like a pro.</li>
            <li>These worked pretty good, although it is a little time consuming if you have a lot of long hair like I do.  </li>
            <li>I used a tiny bit of shampoo and warm water to soak and rinse them and then let them air dry overnight - voila - smell solved.  </li>
            <li>I like how it kind of forces you to use only a limited amount of hair</li>
            <li>This product gave me, an amateur, AMAZING curls.</li>
            <li>so I can have a head full of curls that last for the week!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure that they may not have the same issue, but I do know that many reviewers I&#x27;ve watched using them have had their curlers for 2 or 3 years and have never made the complaint about &amp;#34;tearing&amp;#34; that this product is getting.</li>
            <li>First, watch a YouTube video to get the &#x27;pumping&#x27; action needed to place these.</li>
            <li>But the are a pain to sleep on, next time I&#x27;m going under the dryer set on cool.</li>
            <li>The curls looked okay in the morning, but they were not worth the time, money, or lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>It took a couple times to get the hang of it but overall a cool invention.</li>
            <li>Found on the net by tidal full name.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tried the Curlformers without the dryer and the curl last almost a full day.</li>
            <li>Easy enough for my 5 year old to use on her older sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the curls last all day, even after a full day of competing.</li>
            <li>I used these for my first time setting my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Left my hair full and curly.  </li>
            <li>Worked out pretty well for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I never applied any hair spray or gel and the curls stayed up and nice for 4 days: they might have stayed longer but I usually wash my hair ever 2 - 3 days so 4 was pushing it for me.</li>
            <li>Takes a fair bit of work to relax my hair back down to something normal looking</li>
            <li>my hair length medium-long natural no perm and I whip these curlers thru my wet mosse hair quickly!!</li>
            <li>The product came within the expected time frame (10-17 business days) and was clean and ready to use!</li>
            <li>The issue with these is the stick, it does not remain together, I&#x27;d have to glue it to be able to use it, or may have to purchase a stick that is intact so that when I pull down the hair it does not break.</li>
            <li>I assume this will go down in time once I have done this more than once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to keep the curls down for 2 days and in an updo for another 2 days.</li>
            <li>Everyone says to go from the bottom up, I learned to go from the top down</li>
            <li>Instead of $69.00 I paid a much lower price &amp; got the same exact product!  </li>
            <li>Pro: worked very well, gave me lovely spriral curls with little work.</li>
            <li>my new go to item for 2014 protective styles!</li>
            <li>I think this is my new favourite hair tool!</li>
            <li>They also give off a smell (like burned tyres) which could indicate the use of cheap (and probably illegal) plastics (that is also probably why they are so cheap in comparison with the original Curlformers).</li>
            <li>I will try to contact the seller to get a new one, but don&#x27;t hold out much hope for that to happen.</li>
            <li>Great job, lasts long, works on short and long hair!!</li>
            <li>Although these could technically fit all of my waist-length hair into them, I needed a LOT to compensate for the thickness which took a very long time.</li>
            <li>ok, so I heard and read all good and bad things...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learnt that ensuring that the hair is wet helps the hair pull through easily without breakage.</li>
            <li>SO..to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my deteriorating issue...I&#x27;ll just buy more so that they will have less stress per roller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got these at Amazon for more than half the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I try to put more hair in the curler to get less curly sue curls and it won&#x27;t allow it</li>
            <li>I do them half way sometimes and love that look as wel as the curled from root to tip.</li>
            <li>so I saved more than half the price.</li>
            <li>My hair was dry with just a light mist when I put them in</li>
            <li>My 3 star rating is less about the product and more for the results...</li>
            <li>It could have taken less if the wand behaved better...</li>
            <li>As an AA with natural hair, stretching my hair is important and these generic curlformers did the trick although they hurt to sleep in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been dealing with attempting to get nice spiral curls with my natural texture (while attempting to avoid harsh heating elements like curling irons and blow dryers).</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had ordered an additional smaller set of curl formers which came with the complete tool.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have enough setting spray on your hair so the curls will last.</li>
            <li>Every review I have read says these actually work BETTER than curlformers, so that&#x27;s a big thing considering the price difference.</li>
            <li>hard to use, and after I was able to use...they hurt!</li>
            <li>thing I would recommend, however, is that you purchase an actual Curlformer hook from the name-brand Hair Flair because the hook that I received with these Vankind magic leverage ones got caught on my hair because of rogue remnants of plastic left over from the mold.</li>
            <li>I leave em in for about 30-45 minutes while I eat breakfast and finish getting ready and then use my hair dryer again over the curlformers to make sure my hair has completely dried in them before taking them out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely order more because when I initially put them in, I ran out!</li>
            <li>I have natural 3c/4a hair and my curls same out sleek and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s cheap, but I&#x27;m inclined to believe that any broken hooks were user error.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I know I would not be able to sleep in them, but that is me, it may be different for someone else.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this over the brand, you get more for your money here and results are the same</li>
            <li>I guess the main advantage is the variety you&#x27;ll get by using these.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is poker straight and it will not hold a curl with a curling iron for more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I have even recurled prior to washing by dampening the hair, adding a tiny bit more styling product, and sliding on the curlformers.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is poker straight and it will not hold a curl with a curling iron for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t pay an extra $40 for the same thing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my problems were the result of this particular maker or if it is the nature of this type of curler to invite breakage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for the more expensive ones......</li>
            <li>decent and work well, but the company sent two hooks instead of the extension for the hook.  </li>
            <li>The curlers are fine but the wand they came with was cheap and didn&#x27;t attach to each other properly therefore cannot us them until I&#x27;m send a new wand.</li>
            <li>I have the original curlformers and at about 60 bucks back when i bought them at my local sallys, these curlers are a steal because they are just as good if not better than curlformers.</li>
            <li>They are not the soft mesh plastic like the original curl former brand; these guys are hard (but it makes for a nice straight curl)</li>
            <li>My first time took me nearly 2 hours to complete my whole head</li>
            <li>Both hair curlers will definitely accomplish the same thing, which is placing your hair in a good, heat-free stretched state with a lot of highly defined curls.  </li>
            <li>Cheap looking product (you get what you pay for) and the styling wand snapped in half the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only will I most likely order a few more in this size, but I am very interested in the bigger barrel curls size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tightly curled type 4 b-c hair and this gets it smooth and curly with no heat!</li>
            <li>These curlers gave her tight spirals that lasted more than a day.  </li>
            <li>These curlers gave her tight spirals that lasted more than a day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li>highly recommend watching a video on YouTube or on the sally&#x27;s website so you can see how it&#x27;s supposed to be done.</li>
            <li>Plus curlformers sells their replacements too high (15 dollars for a pack of 6...outrageous).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to buy the HairFlair hook, since it&#x27;s easier to pass through the curlformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, you can audio do permanent washing with these there is a curlformer tutorial on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been reading about Curlformers for some time now but refused to pay the high price for them.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>If you dont set a curl right on a flexirod, it may not dry correctly.</li>
            <li>I use these every other week, as a3c natural who just hit phase 2 length, and I use mousse for my set and LOVE these with all of my heart.</li>
            <li>I have tried curling irons, tried to flat iron curl, brush curlers, bendy curling rods, hot, overnight, perms, you name it, but these are the first product I can do all by myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily I live literally 4 minutes from Sally&#x27;s and was able to replace it for less than $5.</li>
            <li>This can be overcome by putting the top of the curler a little farther out from the root, but if the curlers were longer, it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li>only difference between these and curlformers official brand is the ends are a slick rubber (hurts slighty more then the original).</li>
            <li>I like the hook a little more because my hair is held in place while inserting curlers.</li>
            <li>The curls were adorable on my little girl, but it takes some practice.</li>
            <li>I gave up and substituted another style till I have a little more patience.</li>
            <li>I would give it five stars, but I think the wand could be a little better.</li>
            <li>They are great for less than half the cost of curlformers.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t hard, its just nice to see it.</li>
            <li>If you decide to sleep in them they will be kind of hard</li>
            <li>They were kind of hard to put in and they hurt to sleep on.</li>
            <li>These are too hard for one person to use on their own hair.</li>
            <li>My curls looked nice, but at the expense of ripped hairs when threading the hair through the hard plastic curlers.</li>
            <li>If you go directly to their site you&#x27;ll see just how much of a deal this is, but I&#x27;m fallin in love with these little things.</li>
            <li>I ordered these for my little sister&#x27;s Christmas present and they were on time, worked the same and a great value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really curly, though, so she usually will wear a high ponytail for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>I think I need to buy more because my hair is very thick and the curl definition is better on smaller sections.</li>
            <li>I would suggest having wet hair, and plan on sleeping on them (not so comfortable, but you get used to it over time).  </li>
            <li>Depending on whether my hair is straight or in its natural state I can use all 80 of the  curlers (curlformers+the vakind)</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;brand-name&amp;#34; curlers are so expensive, so these &amp;#34;knock-offs&amp;#34; are a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I bought them to use for my 8 year old daughter who always wants her hair curly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going through the whole hair transition from relaxed to natural</li>
            <li>I bought these because I really wanted to try the CurlFormers on my natural hair but did not want to pay $70 for them.</li>
            <li>These are a great alternative to the expensive curlformers.</li>
            <li>miss the huge packs of pink foam rollers we use to get in the store</li>
            <li>Saw these on Amazon and they are just the same as the more expensive kind.</li>
            <li>The Curl Formers brand are normally $50.00 to $60.00 dollars.</li>
            <li>I do wish there were just a few more because my hair is so dense.</li>
            <li>Not a negative</li>
            <li>I tried these last night so this is a fresh review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>&amp; I needed a few more</li>
            <li>is use small strands because if it&#x27;s too much (you&#x27;ll have to decide based on the thickness of your hair) it&#x27;ll get stuck. :-)  </li>
            <li>but thats normal for my hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to do my entire head (I have long hair)</li>
            <li>They are not comfortable at all. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with very coarse hair and they make my hair nice and curly.</li>
            <li>The plug-in bottom and top of the wand do not fit together in a flush manner but it will hold up and do the job.</li>
            <li>We tested it out a few days ago and the curls we adorable.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length frizzy, wavy, curly hair under normal circumstances that has a mind of</li>
            <li>But, the results were well worth the extra annoyance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth getting used to for the results - especially for the bargain price.  </li>
            <li>If the hair is a little long and the ends stick out, you can just quickly curl those tips with a curling iron before or after removing the magic curlers.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to develop the technique, and it&#x27;s easy to pull the hair when you&#x27;re pulling it through the curlers if you try to get too much hair at one time.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to buy if you are looking for a new way to do heatless curls.</li>
            <li>Some of the other reviews said they had problems with the hook but the one that came in ours works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Going off other reviews, I bought an additional Curlformer wand, but the one that came with theses seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li>and they took 5 hours to completely air dry for perfectly smooth ringlets or</li>
            <li>I only use a leave in conditioner before putting them in, then I let it air dry for 4-6 hours or more if I&#x27;m not going any where.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very tightly coiled but these made my hair very smooth and elongated.</li>
            <li>I still love the results gives me flat iron like curls except they feel so soft and last for 2-3 days!</li>
            <li>but they definitely do the job if you do them right.</li>
            <li>This only gets 4 stars because they are HELL to sleep on and a I had a bit of a learning curve to get them on right.  </li>
            <li>Pinks go on the right side and orange go on the left side of your head.</li>
            <li>I watched a billion youtube videos before I could finally get it right</li>
            <li>, I am actually sitting with them in my hair right now.</li>
            <li>Okay due to the fact that my hair is long and that I have a lot of it, it took a little more time than I thought it would to get all the curlers in my hair but not too much longer.</li>
            <li>These curlers work fine, but they are a hassle to put in; I had some problems with my hair getting tangled in the curlers, especially when curling the back.</li>
            <li>The Vakind curlers stay in place and easy to take down.</li>
            <li>first package came with just the bottom half of the hook but the seller responded quickly and sent me a new hook.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The material is a much harder plastic than the original Curlformers</li>
            <li>I liked the length (again a little longer than the Curlformers), which meant that my entire length of the curl was in the curler - versus the Curlformers which did not fully cover the ends of my longer hair (bra strap length).  </li>
            <li>Nice little generic zip lock bag to store them.</li>
            <li>There is no way to contact seller and request new wand.  </li>
            <li>I apply them to newly washed hair and leave them in over night.</li>
            <li>i need a new stick where can i get one</li>
            <li>The shea moisture curling souffle (aka gel) did leave a bit of a residue but after the new day it goes away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this another go on New Years Eve.</li>
            <li>Guess I have to order a new hook just to use the things.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll follow up with an updated review when I receive my new tool.</li>
            <li>Got this product wanting to copy Naptural 85&#x27;s new twist out method.</li>
            <li>Although, if you are new to using these, it would be helpful to look up videos before trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After burning myself repeatedly with the new curling irons that don&#x27;t have the clamp on them, I decided to give Curlformers a go.  </li>
            <li>and I had no problems on my first try, and have them back in my hair right now for a second go.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use, and they&#x27;re less of a pain to sleep in than rollers.</li>
            <li>It would be a good product if I had received the entire hook, it only came with the bottom half.  </li>
            <li>I need to use the curlers a few more times to learn how to use them on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews that stated you need to use small sections, should smooth the hair out first, watch youtube videos...</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are pretty long, much longer than their hair.</li>
            <li>I just got my Curler Magic curlers yesterday - 10 days earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li>I watched quite a few Youtube tutorials for pointers, which is helpful, but actual practice on your own head, is how you learn what works for you.  </li>
            <li>I think I would have been better with extra wide.  </li>
            <li>I think I would have been better with extra wide.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, the curlers dry relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>and i loved the idea, but it appears the only way to get bounce in my hair is to braid it wet, let it dry, and poof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughters hair is passed her butt and curly at the ends but not so much at the top because it is so thick we used these</li>
            <li>They were a little teadious to use at first, but I quickly got the hang of how to put them in.</li>
            <li>On my kinky-Curly African American hair my curls came out smooth and soft and they held with no heat!</li>
            <li>These weren&#x27;t long enough for my 22 inch length hair, so please order the longer ones if you have really long hair, but I really love these!</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair, the short layers are to my shoulders and the long layers are down to my lower back, it is semi fine, and straight, and very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>These arrived maybe one week after ordering, much faster than I expected and were in great condition with no funny chemical smell I read about from other reviews.</li>
            <li>The stick that comes with the package isnt strong enough if you have long or course hair.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use if you tape the hook together tightly.  </li>
            <li>though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth sending back (since now they are at a higher price) or fixing myself with super glue... or just pointing the busted tips down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also slept in them and they are pretty comfy, relatively speaking.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the Curlformers, but from what I see, they look like the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>These are exactly the same as the curl formers that are sold in beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>, these are EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li>Also, there is a sufficient number of the curl formers and they are WAY cheaper than you can get them at Sally&#x27;s, and it&#x27;s exactly the same product.</li>
            <li>these are the exact same thing I made a how to on instagram @tina_thegreat</li>
            <li>And in my case, make sure the sections aren&#x27;t too small</li>
            <li>First, the curlers constantly slipped off the hook.</li>
            <li>but the are so soft and feminine!</li>
            <li>I was willing to pay extra to get it here faster.</li>
            <li>It was actually quite pretty.</li>
            <li>These work exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I only used 39 out of 40.</li>
            <li>They should make some that would hold a regular hot roller amount of hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used them on natural thick long hair, relaxed fine short hair and super excited about the results.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put a small amount of product on your hair so that it does not get frizzy.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think I could handle sleeping in them because they are pretty bulky especially if you have a lot of hair</li>
            <li>This version is exactly the same and works just as well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nearly a $50 difference!</li>
            <li>My curls were so bouncy, and pretty that I was taking selfie&#x27;s and finally realized it was 3 a.m!  </li>
            <li>Literally the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>and I had to put a second curler after the first for the longer sections.</li>
            <li>AKA the first time I tried them, I woke up in the middle of the night and pulled them all out of my head</li>
            <li>I have 1.5 year old dreadlocks and these work!  </li>
            <li>I bought my first set of generic curlformers in May.</li>
            <li>The first set had &amp;#34;JXL&amp;#34; imprinted on the ends and the second set didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I did purchase the real ones from Sally&#x27;s and from amazon and compared and you can barely tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I got these for my 14 year old daughter and she loves them!</li>
            <li>The process is pretty simple.</li>
            <li>Be warned - they do not come with any instructions at all - but there are several youtube videos with demos (that is how I found out about them in the first place).  </li>
            <li>(all of whom have medium to long hair and are in elementary school).</li>
            <li>Other than the damaged ones,  these were worth the price!</li>
            <li>Does the same as the higher priced ones.</li>
            <li>I had read a lot of reviews on these versus curl formers and they looked the exact same</li>
            <li>Exactly like the actual Curl formers but a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li>The curl formers are not bad at all and was as expected.  </li>
            <li>since my hair is fine, the curls didnt last long (about 2 days)</li>
            <li>We let it air dry for about 3 hours and then easily slid them out of her (extra tender head, might I add!)</li>
            <li>I woke up twice to change positions and reposition the curlformers so that I could lay my head down comfortably.</li>
            <li>but I made them work &amp; my hair is very thick , but overall I love them &amp; will be ordering more at a later date.</li>
            <li>The only down side is she didn&#x27;t think they were very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Took me a few tries to get it right, but I love the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took multiple tries to put in each of the first 4 curlers, but I quickly got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>yet.&lt;br /&gt;I received a ton of compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve started using them, they work much better than conventional curlers and my curls last days.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>No curlers have broken yet, although the wand can be a tricky to disassemble when finished especially since I apply oil to my hair sometimes my fingers slip, but other than that its great!</li>
            <li>These should be the right length for hair as long as mid-back.  </li>
            <li>The curls are fantastic and take a lot less time and effort than the heated curling iron.</li>
            <li>great product, they&#x27;re actually really big and long, maybe too long for my hair, but id rather get them bigger than i need instead of smaller.</li>
            <li>If you have long hair you need patience and I think this is better with damp slightly wet hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the rods are super flimsy but you do have to be careful.</li>
            <li>You have to work carefully to avoid ripping any hair out, but I got the hang of it quickly.  </li>
            <li>The one that comes with this set is kind of weak for kinky textured hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly thrifty, so I had a hard time justifying another kit - or even a single package of Curlformers at the exorbitant price of 14.00 per 10 pack at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Just ok I had a hard time getting them on my hair first of all, a couple of the bands cracked on the top part of the ringlets poor quality I suppose and they are not for sleeping in</li>
            <li>My curls were rock solid tight, didn’t move but they looked extra cute!</li>
            <li>At most they turn into loose curls and stay for a half a day, after which they turn into more like a messy wave.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest these for anyone wanting some curls without the major damage to your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair reaches to the top of my bra strap but only fills up half way on the curlers.</li>
            <li>LOL...snapped mine in half 2nd time out, so I&#x27;m buying a couple more.</li>
            <li>Curls take better and last longer if you have slightly damp hair, either water or a setting</li>
            <li>Less expensive and gave me excellent curls.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had was with the hook itself, they are not as strong as I would have expected</li>
            <li>The hook is very hard to put together, I had to take my pocket knife and kind of carve it that way</li>
            <li>Then, I realized that by putting the hook just on the last 3 inches of my dreads and pulling the tube up to the root (or however far up I want), pulling the dread through last, it was quick and painless.  </li>
            <li>On must avoid creating large sections of hair to ensure there is no hair outside of hook&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>too large for short hair lengths.</li>
            <li>I will say that if you have very long hair, as I do (to my lower back), you may find that the ends of your hair don&#x27;t fit at the very longest part of your hair, but the name brand are the same.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I won&#x27;t be duped by the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll buy the real thing and tell everyone else to do the same.</li>
            <li>, I did not have any frizz (and I am not exaggerating when I say that my hair dried very smooth), and I plan to use them on my younger sister/niece/cousins, etc.</li>
            <li>but they are a little cheap looking</li>
            <li>I put a little leave in conditioner in my hair to smooth it a bit and never got my hair snagged.</li>
            <li>The process of getting hair into the curliformer requires the curliformer hook to pull your hair through the curler which for me has been proven to be pretty harsh on my hair and even showed significant hair damage after only having used the curlers twice.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length natural kinky hair and these tame the frizz and are fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>There was some slight tugging, but after you become familiar with how to use the curlers, you learn how to avoid it.</li>
            <li>and sometimes I have a hard time pulling my daughter&#x27;s hair through it, but mostly have the knack now.  </li>
            <li>Have tried every other type of roller, I think, and nothing else has ever worked as well and as quickly.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old girl has long very straight hair.  </li>
            <li>All that&#x27;s left is to run my fingers through my hair a couple of times to separate the curls a little bit and get more of a natural look</li>
            <li>However, these curlers are thicker than the actual curlforers which means that your hair will take significantly longer to dry.  </li>
            <li>The advertisement clearly says a roller pack of 40 in the title.</li>
            <li>assemble the hook (comes in two pieces as it&#x27;s long), push it hook end first though a tube, put a bit of hair in the hook near your scalp/roots, hold the end of the tube closest to your scalp in place as you pull out the hook and your hair will go inside.</li>
            <li>U have to be careful with how much hair you use because if you use to much it will snag and it WILL hurt.</li>
            <li>I have to say these are the same as the real Curlformers at the fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>4c natural hair.</li>
            <li>Have to return completely.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I have natural 3c/4a hair.  </li>
            <li>These counterfeit curlformers are a far inferior product than Curlformers</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and strait at the roots.</li>
            <li>if trying to go natural curlformeres are the way to go.</li>
            <li>I got this product from the House Sweety seller fairly early, 2 days after the earliest arrival date.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>The price is a real deal, totally recommended!</li>
            <li>I am a natural with 4C hair</li>
            <li>I hope I can find longer and winder ones to hold my waiste length natural 4a/b hair.</li>
            <li>My curls where soft and bouncy</li>
            <li>Ive been natural for five years.</li>
            <li>You will defintely need to purchase two packs and there are not nearly enough for one whole head.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair about 12&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have 4c natural hair</li>
            <li>They were so soft.  </li>
            <li>As a natural curly girl...</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this product, but I&#x27;ve had some issues with my hair snagging through the curl former (especially when wet).</li>
            <li>This took me two hours to complete because there werent instructions.</li>
            <li>Even after my whole head was done, I still had rollers left.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair (3b/3c)</li>
            <li>The curlers were firm, but gave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It definitely beats the 70 bucks that the real curl formers cost.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 8 year old daughter because she wanted to have spiral curls.</li>
            <li>gives my hair life when I want some curls for my 4c natural hair.</li>
            <li>just natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried them 6 times.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using these for my pre-teen daughter for cheer, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for frequent use.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>and I have been natural for 12 years.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE</li>
            <li>I have not used the Hair Flair Curlformers, but I don&#x27;t think I will need to seeing as how Alicia James (a YouTube Natural hair community guru) did a side-by-side comparison of the $70 product and the $18 product, both of which work identically to another.</li>
            <li>I would recommend a soft bonnet dryer for these as sleeping on them will not be happening again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and my set lasts me about 4 days before I have to put it up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li>The second one I had too much hair</li>
            <li>A gift for my 10 year old niece and had difficulty figuring out how to use.</li>
            <li>This vakind hair curler worked well for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>If you have natural hair this will work for you.</li>
            <li>This works wonders for my natural transaction hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 7yrs, my texture is 4c (coily ziggly).</li>
            <li>My hair is natural  </li>
            <li>i used a soft bonnet dryer before i went to bed.</li>
            <li>My hair is 100% natural with a hair type of 3b/3c.</li>
            <li>I really want some that results in bigger (looser) curls</li>
            <li>I use the rods to curl my hair as well as my 71/2 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li>I am 3 years natural.</li>
            <li>My hair came out soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Worked well on natural hair.</li>
            <li>I am Hispanic and was looking for a way to get natural spiral looking curls without applying heat.</li>
            <li>so I suggest doing them early in the morning then taking them out before bed.</li>
            <li>(I prefer air drying to avoid heat on my natural hair)&lt;br /&gt;6.)</li>
            <li>They work so well for my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t complete as far as the hook.</li>
            <li>It has worked for her hair (natural - no relaxers), and my daughter&#x27;s as well.</li>
            <li>Works on natural hair.</li>
            <li>The package wasn&#x27;t complete, How does that happen?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in college and my hair is natural (struggle).</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and the end results are</li>
            <li>Too much money for the same product, just without the name.</li>
            <li>bought 2 sets, one for me and one for my 3 year old daughter</li>
            <li>I have a natural Afro and guess what ...</li>
            <li>My hair came out looking like i had a professional rollers et under a dryer.</li>
            <li>Once I did separate them it was pretty obvious that the second set was of a much lesser quality than the first.</li>
            <li>The product does not come with instructions but after watching a YouTube video on how to use, it was really quite simple.</li>
            <li>and my hair frequently got tangled in the hook.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and brought these after seeing them used in some Youtube videos.</li>
            <li>complete torture.</li>
            <li>This is comparable to the real magenta and yellow curlformers.</li>
            <li>I lightly sprayed my hair with water and put a few curlers in.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I bought these to use on my young daughters hair.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian with a lot of medium weight hair that is naturally wavy and layered -length</li>
            <li>I speed up the process a bit with a soft bonnet attachment to my hand held dryer.</li>
            <li>but I contacted the company and it was fixed immediately</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with the quality of these curlers.</li>
            <li>I also have a hooded (soft) dryer so that speeds up the drying process.</li>
            <li>I used the Jane Carter setting and wrap as followed by a Youtuber because I did decide to go natural</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper than the Curlformers and does the same thing!  </li>
            <li>They are soft, bouncy with no frizz.</li>
            <li>AM TRANSITIONING FROM RELAXED TO NATURAL HAIR AND AM AVOIDING HEAT AT ALL COSTS</li>
            <li>It has a natural wave to it</li>
            <li>If I want to get a headache to avoid going to an event, I just think about the old school days when you pulled highlights through one of those caps with a hook.  </li>
            <li>When taking them out, stretch the curler out completely and squeeze at the mouth.  </li>
            <li>They reminded me of Phoebe from friends and they were soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>When taking them out, stretch the curler out completely and squeeze at the mouth.  </li>
            <li>They reminded me of Phoebe from friends and they were soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>The results were soft flowy ringlets.</li>
            <li>I prefer a tighter curl that will drop to ringlets once it is old.</li>
            <li>In total, I needed about 55-60 curlers for my whole head.</li>
            <li>After receiving it I completely understand why.</li>
            <li>Mines would not close completely so it kept falling off</li>
            <li>so I recommend doing it early so you can take it out before bed.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4b hair</li>
            <li>However after a night with these in my hair, I notched how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li>Kept her busy.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4 type hair.</li>
            <li>These curl former&#x27;s really work</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet had a problem with the wand breaking and have used it 3 times so far.  </li>
            <li>I know natural divas out there</li>
            <li>I used put the curlers on using nothing but leave-in conditioner and hair oil directly after washing and without drying.</li>
            <li>I Am Transitioning From Relaxed Hair To Natural,</li>
            <li>Worked awesomely on my natural (4c) hair.</li>
            <li>Curls last a long time and look pretty even after a few days maybe even more depending on your preference and hair type.</li>
            <li>I tested them out on my 5 year old daughter who has naturally soft and curly hair</li>
            <li>So Glad I order these and the green and blue pack</li>
            <li>You have to make sure the pieces you thread on are not too thick otherwise they won&#x27;t pull through.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how the outrageously expensive ones could be significantly superior to these, because I thought these  worked</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>First off,I have long and thick hard to hold a curl hair, the roller length said 50-51 inches, my hair length is 46in and it tends to leave a good inch off!</li>
            <li>These are great, work exactly like curlformers and are much less expensive.</li>
            <li>I would say that you need to watch videos on how to put these in, take your time the first time (there is a learning curve) and let them dry completely.</li>
            <li>But other than that I&#x27;m glad I found this brand and didn&#x27;t have to buy the ones that were more expensive.</li>
            <li>My package came right as expected</li>
            <li>The result was as I had hoped, pretty curls- a little more tangled than I had expected but they worked well enough.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t find them easy to use and they usually damage my hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair is straight and flat within an hour.</li>
            <li>My hair does not respond to heat curls very well, and often will be flat by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are well worth the price</li>
            <li>Okay for a pack of the Extra Long and Wide, your looking at $15 a pack if your not a member, wth?</li>
            <li>fun but remember to be careful!</li>
            <li>I did purchase a curlformer hook separate due to having read many reviews that were not positive about the hook that comes with the formers.</li>
            <li>But that is fine, because I am aiming for about that length in the very back down the road, hopefully in about 2 years or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pacific express&#x27;s was perfect and high quality while the  other was bad quality and smelled.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical on this off brand, but I&#x27;m glad I went for it.</li>
            <li>These are a decent alternative to paying the extra money for curlformers.  </li>
            <li>My main recommendation is to BUY EXTRA HOOKS!</li>
            <li>Delivery was decent it didn&#x27;t turn out to be several weeks to show up at the door.</li>
            <li>Play with products such as different types of gels or setting lotions and test them out in your hair first.</li>
            <li>My sister ordered the exact same curlers 2 weeks before me from a different vendor in California, and she still hasn&#x27;t received hers...</li>
            <li>I ordered a second set a month later and they are nothing like the first set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give four stars to the first and two to the second, simply because I know about the difference.</li>
            <li>The Curlformers long and narrow worked much much better for me.</li>
            <li>In fact, to get a more defined curl, you&#x27;ll want to make the curls as small as possible.</li>
            <li>They are hard, feel cheap, both of which I could live with.</li>
            <li>With other curlers, I try to just start with damp, because wet would never dry, but with these, they keep the strand being curled totally separate and open to air, so it dries amazingly quickly, I think (probably only a couple hours - faster, with a blow drier, I&#x27;m sure).</li>
            <li>Why pay the high price for the same results!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend purchasing the actual curlformer hook for about $4 though.</li>
            <li>But i simply rubber band all the curlers into a high ponytail to keep them out my way while I sleep.</li>
            <li>They have fine thick bone straight hair and no heat is the only way their hair will hold curl.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use the items if you don&#x27;t have the hook, so I haven&#x27;t been able to try out the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 4/23/14 - Seller contacted me for feedback and when I mentioned the broken hook, they immediately sent me a new one at no charge.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to all my natural sistas!!</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave four stars is because a few of these were easily punctured with the stick, creating a hole.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t fall out that I end up with super tight curls and some still fall out.  </li>
            <li>Very east to use and didn&#x27;t take long to be delievered.</li>
            <li>( I have medium straight long hair) not just talking</li>
            <li>However not many curlers out  there that you can comfortably sleep in.  </li>
            <li>The real ones are 22 inches long.</li>
            <li>They stay on securely (unlike ordinary rollers).  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what she expected, and she loves them.  </li>
            <li>Worked exactly like i expected.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I expected when ordered.  </li>
            <li>They did calm down over night, but that is what I wanted them to do...</li>
            <li>I have really thick long board straight hair and had pretty much given up on ever getting it to curl even a little bit after wasting literally hundreds of dollars over the last 20 years on every single kind of curlers, curling products, &amp; curling irons that is/</li>
            <li>I have short, fine, very tightly curled natural hair.</li>
            <li>Well, I came across a few posters who raved about these little amazing no heat spiral rollers.</li>
            <li>I expected the formers to be a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li>Put them in with slightly damp hair and let sit for an hour or two and stayed nice tight, defined bouncy curls for 2 days with no product!</li>
            <li>The only hard part is finding a comfortable spot to sleep on them!  </li>
            <li>Apparently, the super tight grip on the end worked with my tossing and turning to &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They were all the same size , in brand new condition</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pick out a new storage container to keep them in because one of the bags split open during transit , all in all.</li>
            <li>and we both live in the same city.  </li>
            <li>Putting them in was very fast compared to other curlers.  </li>
            <li>They are very versatile- on dry hair for an hour</li>
            <li>very breathable, you can use about 20-30 mins of heat to set them, or let them air dry overnight but its a bitch to sleep on them.</li>
            <li>After waiting a couple of hours for my hair to dry I removed the curlers (the easiest part of the whole thing).  </li>
            <li>I let them air dry while I got dressed and ready to go out for the night.</li>
            <li>You can also blow dry for fast results.</li>
            <li>Oh and the black hook that comes with detaches in the middle to make for easy storing, but the darn thing kept detaching in the middle of pulling my curl through!</li>
            <li>The key to not having breakage is to NOT try to thread TOO much hair into one Former.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommended spending the extra couple of bucks and getting the real rod.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on these I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give these a try especially since they didnt look any different than the real curlformers.</li>
            <li>First, my hair is long and blonde.  </li>
            <li>We love to do waves in her hair with a curling iron, but after an hour or so, they are limp and not very curly.</li>
            <li>I bought these and have tried once, I left them in my hair for several hours to take them out to mostly straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick coily hair, and these really smooth everything out for soft, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>More unfortunately, this particular curler was positioned near my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these things for at least 2+ years now and they&#x27;re still holding strong .</li>
            <li>Trying to cram as much hair as possible into a single former will leave you with damaged locks, and no one wants that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve tried the other more &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; ones and my curl isn&#x27;t as tight.</li>
            <li>I wanted soft waves but these are tight, tight, tight perfect little curls</li>
            <li>Other than shipping was fast and the product was just as described!</li>
            <li>the curls are pretty and it&#x27;s way easier than other methods of achieving that look.</li>
            <li>That sounds like a major inconvenience to me.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviews have stated, the hook that came with the curlers made installation a bit tricky at first, but it wasn&#x27;t anything that I couldn&#x27;t work around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious to see how nice they will be after a few hours in!! .</li>
            <li>That plastic handle is too weak, but the curlers are magical</li>
            <li>There is major shrinkage and</li>
            <li>Remember the pink are for the left and orange are for the right.</li>
            <li>That being said, I have never been one to curl my hair, I usually kept it short and easy to manage..</li>
            <li>The first ringlet former was easy but trying to put in the second one was very hard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to effectively use wet set rollers, but these are darn near idiot proof.</li>
            <li>Snapped right in half.</li>
            <li>order came so quickly,  and I took the time to sit down and review the quality/condition of every last one of my 80 curlers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Minus half star only for being available in only this one curl intensity/size.</li>
            <li>The pink in this set match the orange, and the orange in this set match the pink in the original set.  </li>
            <li>I personally have somewhat thinner hair that holds curls very well, but based on how long they last for me, it seems that someone with thick hair will be highly satisfied with how well these curl &amp; hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to be careful you don&#x27;t select to large a section</li>
            <li>Now it is cheap and hard to put together.</li>
            <li>These are the long and wide curl formers and they make really pretty curls!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the curls don&#x27;t last more than 3 days on average - even less if you live in a windy area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll add that she has super tight curls and for competition she needed bigger spirals to match the team.</li>
            <li>Additionally, these curlers are harder and I found that I absolutely could not sleep in them at all whereas I can generally sleep on curlformers.  </li>
            <li>I guess the only downfall was the packageing (?), the rollers came in a clear ziplock bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely suggest buying them if you have long straight hair and want it to be curly.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;extra long&#x27; from Curlformers will be much easier to work</li>
            <li>and you have to be careful to not pull to much hair through the roller.</li>
            <li>Hair snags and is harder to pull through the coil unlike the real thing.</li>
            <li>This happened with two curlers so far after only one use.</li>
            <li>I have used them on my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, as well, and the same results!!</li>
            <li>I want to start off saying that I&#x27;ve only used these once so far</li>
            <li>This same set in the brand name &#x27;curlformers&#x27; was $72 at a store near me....</li>
            <li>The one in the package barely holds together.</li>
            <li>especially for ALL hair types (natural, perm, weave)</li>
            <li>I have 3c natural hair and this product actually worked!</li>
            <li>I actually started using these and then later received the real curlformers as a christmas present.  </li>
            <li>immediately tried them out on my shoulder-length, naturally curly hair (my curls are unruly and I wanted these to help them lie differently).  </li>
            <li>When I received them they had a long brown hair stuck between a curl former which I thought was pretty gross.</li>
            <li>I started with wet hair and twisted each piece of hair at the root (small pieces of hair strung through the needle more effectively).</li>
            <li>did my 5 year old entire head.</li>
            <li>The only disadvantages about the curlformers were price and the end result on natural hair (as compared to the vakind curlers now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will definitely be a keeper in my natural hair regimen.</li>
            <li>I watched the videos, but apparently some details escaped me.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be real, One of the pink curl</li>
            <li>Next time i will do them early in the morning and take them out by night</li>
            <li>completely recommend that if you have been wanting curlformers you should definitely try these.</li>
            <li>I would especially recommend this product to individuals with natural hair that want a different look with soft curls.</li>
            <li>I am a natural lady with 3c mixed with 4b hair.</li>
            <li>I blame myself for using setting lotion on wet hair instead of a simple moisturizer on damp hair the first time around.</li>
            <li>and no none have broken but be sure to assess</li>
            <li>More of a personal issue - I have a lot of hair (it reaches just above my bra strap, but it&#x27;s really thick)</li>
            <li>Although getting the hang of using the wand and a few tangling incidents because of the wand it was so worth it.</li>
            <li>Good quality and design, but really difficult to use with long hair.</li>
            <li>The ONLY minor problem I have is with the hook as it tends to separate in the process of pulling slightly thicker strands of hair through--nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li>and I am sure that would be worse if I were trying to sleep in them.  </li>
            <li>This size pack worked for my hair, but if you have thick and long hair, you should probably order more than one pack.</li>
            <li>I was kind of uncomfortable all night.</li>
            <li>The weaving is a little harder than the real curlformers, but you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li>Luckily the seller reimbursed me for the missing curlers but this was a major inconvenience for me since I still had to go back and purchase another pack</li>
            <li>They are not uncomfortable but not very comfortable either (to sleep in).</li>
            <li>I first got them my hair was down to my rear and</li>
            <li>The needle had some jagged edges that I had to file and melt down after the first piece of hair was snagged.</li>
            <li>I used all 40 in the pack plus 9 extra out of a smaller set I bought after other natural women reviews talked about needing a few more to finish their heads.</li>
            <li>but so far I don&#x27;t plan on buying them due to the high price.</li>
            <li>I have hip length hair), but the curl is not tight enough and it doesn&#x27;t add the fullness I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Next time I use these will probably be when I have dry, straight hair.</li>
            <li>The same combo with these larger ones was a little frizzy, didn&#x27;t hold and kind of limp.</li>
            <li>If I hooked the hair lower down the hair went through, but the top part above the hook didn&#x27;t make it in, and it knotted into a mess.</li>
            <li>On top of thickness I have some crazy kinky curls that are out of control and my hair is super nappy, frizzy, and dry.</li>
            <li>Docked one star for the less than stellar needle hair hook thing.</li>
            <li>you definitely want your hair towel-dried/damp, and if you are having a hard time putting them in, it is probably because your hair has dried too much, or you need to keep the wand at more of a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li>That it&#x27;s not as hard as the original one its easier to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li>Now I have about mid back length hair which is very fine and very hard to curl and keep a curl.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft,  porous, and about 7 inches long.  </li>
            <li>True rag curls were the the only other thing that came close, but they take forever to dry, and I&#x27;m tempted to use irregular sections of hair.</li>
            <li>Saw a youtube vlogger use these on one side of her head with the real curl formers and the other side with these Vakind Hair curlers for the price.....</li>
            <li>Like many, my first couple of tries were frustrating, but afterwards I was installing these like a pro!</li>
            <li>and it was way too much work compared to other hair curling methods.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have gotten the other ones to prevent so much shrinkage</li>
            <li>When I took them out my hair looked a hot mess...</li>
            <li>I read other reviews and these recommendations really helped.</li>
            <li>It can feel a little heavy when you have so many curlers on your head.</li>
            <li>Especially with as many as I&#x27;d need to set my thick long 3c-4a hair.</li>
            <li>The pink and orange are slightly shorter than the original</li>
            <li>You get pretty tight curls</li>
            <li>I have natural hair that is think (4a-4b) and it makes my hair looks as if i applied a flat iron to the roots!</li>
            <li>I noiced that the wand is cheaply made (duh, the set is only $16) and because of this the hook where the hair goes can snag on hair strands.</li>
            <li>Sure I figured out how to use them, and went on youtube to watch a video, but shouldn&#x27;t there but at least minimal directions with these things?</li>
            <li>I knew going in that I usually need more than the average person when it comes to curlers</li>
            <li>I recently began being natural and have 2-3 inches of relaxed hair left.</li>
            <li>Given that these are the generic brand, I took it upon myself to order an extra curlformer hook (directly from their website as it&#x27;s cheaper than getting it from amazon).</li>
            <li>Used with eco-styler gel on natural african american hair.  </li>
            <li>once I snapped them in place (this is important bc thick hair will constantly pull the wand apart if you don&#x27;t tape it).</li>
            <li>Then later in the day when she takes the ponytail out, her hair is wavy curly and looks really pretty down.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a little tricky for the first 3 or 4 but went well afterwards.</li>
            <li>This curler and hook worked exactly the same and was only 1/4 the price of the other curler.</li>
            <li>The technique was a little daunting at first</li>
            <li>These got here later than promised and it caused a major issue.</li>
            <li>A little tricky to put on the first time I used but started to get the hang of it at the end</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of stiff, but at least they don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, red hair that usually loses forced curls rather fast after using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>They do the exact same thing for way less of their price.</li>
            <li>It was super difficult to get the hair through at first.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4b hair and it made my hair look like I flat ironed it prior</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had long hair nearly 30 years</li>
            <li>So as long as my 4yr old doesn&#x27;t need her hair done for about 4hrs we like to use these.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for three years and have the curlformers from Sally&#x27;s about as long.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m African-American with natural 3c/4a curls, collarbone length if stretched.)</li>
            <li>I have natural African American hair with loads of shrinkage, it made my hair looked relaxed with only a leavs in conditioner.</li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve had so far was having the curls hold for second and third day hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m african american, my hair is naturally curly/kinky, and I&#x27;ve used mousse and setting lotions, but nothing seems to keep the shape longer than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this company and this product to friends and relatives.</li>
            <li>Pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li>First I applied them all the way at the root &amp; let the excess hair at ends poke out freely a few inches.</li>
            <li>the next morning i woke up, took them out, and was surprised to see that i looked exactly like shirley temple :/.</li>
            <li>Had to get use to the process at first, even watched a few YouTube videos.</li>
            <li>With that said, they are not uncomfortable or heavy.  </li>
            <li>I spritz each section of my dry hair with a dilute mix of Infusium and water,  or use on freshly washed, slightly damp hair, for about 4hrs.  </li>
            <li>It only took a little over a week for these to arrive and the curls turned out really pretty.</li>
            <li>These are just like the more expensive major name brand, but at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>The stick might not be a problem if you have fine silky hair, but if you have thick textured hair, it separated every time!</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly weren&#x27;t hard to use.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if they will last as long as the original curlformers.</li>
            <li>So Cool i had to ge the Small Curlers !</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I do notice a slight crease from where the end sits at the scalp - this doesn&#x27;t affect my styles too much</li>
            <li>The wand is ever so slightly shorter than the real curl formers</li>
            <li>I used them on dry hair with no product added and they came out soft and springy.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning to natural and these long rods only go 1/4</li>
            <li>I got numerous comments all day in person and through social media.</li>
            <li>It broke really easy, was not happy</li>
            <li>I have arm pit length hair that is a mixture of natural (4A/B) from the roots to several inches down, and the rest down to the tips is straight from old relaxers.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t pull too much through one curler or you get a tangled mess.</li>
            <li>this will give you a fuller head of curls and you wont have to separate your curls as much and mess up the pattern</li>
            <li>though was that they were not long enough</li>
            <li>Additionally, the one that come with it is just not long enough.</li>
            <li>This is slightly bigger than real curl formers, the real pink and orange ones are smaller.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s $18 right now, not sure why, and I will not pay the extra $2 lol).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These Curler are amazing, the learning curve isn&#x27;t that difficult, one thing I realized is that if your having trouble you should probably use less hair in each spiral, but I love the heat less curls</li>
            <li>The plastic is super hard, not malleable enough for fragile relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>Also, I noticed dramatically different results when I changed how much hair I put in each curler and using the curlers on dry hair versus wet hair.</li>
            <li>The only CON is that the bottom of my hair sticks out of these curlers.. they are not long enough</li>
            <li>have fine hair that is a bit thin at the moment.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li>I have baby fine and thin hair that never holds a curl.</li>
            <li>The curls lasted all day , and the next day they turned into soft loose curls.  </li>
            <li>But I need to do a little hair at a time, if you do too much hair ,the hair will stuck in the tube.</li>
            <li>: Would not recoment for hair longer than mid back, curler is not long enough.</li>
            <li>I have unprocessed, thick and fine coiled hair.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, silky curls even with my very thick hair</li>
            <li>I got the 3rd set a little longer, because my hair is really growing.  </li>
            <li>Yes, a little painful to sleep on, but I was able to sleep soundly.</li>
            <li>my hair, even when left to dry naturally curly, is flat in that spot.  </li>
            <li>I love it because I no longer have to worry about the tangles I was getting in the natural-textured part of my hair after washing, can always get my hair styled and ready to go within 5 minutes in the mornings, and will never again have to wonder whether I&#x27;m going to have a bad hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it would be lovely if Vakind offered a fatter, looser curler set, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus another half star because they are ridiculous to try to sleep</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Perfect curls each time.</li>
            <li> I have never used them, but these work perfectly for the styles that I want to achieve.</li>

            <li> I watched so many YouTubers have excellent results with CurlFormers</li>
            <li> These curlers worked great and I loved the results.</li>
            <li> Curls come out flawlessly, make sure you have some sort of setting lotion.</li>
            <li> However, if you are more concerned with results than efficiency, these are great!  </li>
            <li> However, if you are more concerned with results than efficiency, these are great!  </li>

            <li> It works just fine without the sticks being perfectly clamped together.</li>
            <li> They were very easy to use and made the cutest spiral curls!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use as yet, but I heard good things about this product.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Curlformers brand.  </li>
            <li> And even when you think you got a good curl, the when you release the curler from your hair some still come out frizzy and not the sleek curl I was looking for.</li>
            <li> GOOD</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;nt stand to throw the perfectly good Vakind hooks away, so into the recycle bin</li>
            <li> Delivery and service was good.  </li>
            <li> I have use twice and loved the outcome.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was ripping it through for a good portion of my hair.</li>
            <li> I watched you-tube videos to get help with good techniques on how to use them.  </li>
            <li> I always in good mood.</li>
            <li> These are surprising hair curlers.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Curls were gorgeous and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I loved the way my hair curled up.</li>
            <li> I tried this product out the day after I received it and everything was in good condition.</li>
            <li> I did my research &amp; heard amazon had some that worked just as good, for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> when i tell you these work mjust as good as the $40+ pack.</li>
            <li> they hold up good</li>
            <li> The end result are perfect, smooth curls</li>
            <li> that wasnt so good.</li>
            <li> good value for the amount of formers</li>
            <li> and I was good to go</li>
            <li> The package came in good shape, I just wish it came with two hooks to speed up the process.</li>
            <li> I completely loved it.</li>
            <li> They were easier to use and resulted in a good outcome (i.e, curls with no breakage).</li>
            <li> If you take your time with applying, you get good results.  </li>
            <li> I used them for the 1st time, and I loved the curls they make.</li>
            <li> If you want to try the look without spending the money these are good, but I would suggest getting a curlformers wand from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I loved the uniform curl I got and that I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in curl from the curlformers.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the curlformers.</li>
            <li> In the end, I felt that I got a good buy for my money.</li>
            <li> has mentioned to me that these work best if your hair is lightly damp.</li>
            <li> and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> I put these in at night and took them out in the morning and had wonderful, smooth curls.</li>
            <li> Loved the amount I received for the price.</li>
            <li> The couple of curls that I got in did work good</li>
            <li> Good for any hair type.</li>
            <li> my curls came out perfectly gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> It still take a good bit of strength to put it together though.</li>
            <li> The we quality is good and they work just as good as the curlformers.</li>
            <li> I do suggest getting lotta body if you want some good, yet affordable wet-set lotion to use with the rollers.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the results.</li>
            <li> This version of the product is good.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a good buy for me and wish I never bought this</li>
            <li> Good luck if you buy it.  </li>
            <li> and she said mine are just as good as hers.</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> but I imagine that these are just as good.</li>
            <li> Two of the curlers were unusable, but the rest were in good condition.</li>
            <li> and it was good to go.</li>
            <li> My hair looks really good after I put these</li>
            <li> All in all a good investment.</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> Be wise and air them out or bathe them before 1st use.  </li>
            <li> This was is a really good product.  </li>
            <li> The good news is they don&#x27;t get frizzy if you brush or comb through them.</li>
            <li> They held for a good 3/4 hours.</li>
            <li> Good price.  </li>
            <li> Formers were good.  </li>
            <li> so it would work good.</li>
            <li> it took me a good hour to put them in but taking them out is like 5 mins?</li>
            <li> It a goOd product for any girl with curly hair.</li>

            <li> These are nice quality they are made of a sturdy plastic like material  and seem to look like they hold a really good curl I am going to try them tonight before I go to bed to see how they do on my braids</li>
            <li> My curls were beautiful and full of life!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m off to face the day with a beautiful head full of curls!</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and make beautiful curls in any texture of hair.</li>
            <li> They work beautifully and are easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I ran my fingers through them to make it more wavy, misted some hairspray, and voila amazing and  voluminous waves!</li>
            <li> Ok, these curl formers are the bomb!</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to try this product before purchasing the $70 curl formers from Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> my products weren&#x27;t the best the first time around.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> My girls love having curly hair!  </li>
            <li> I love these curlers!</li>
            <li> I love the  product for the price!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> curls are lovely!</li>
            <li> Oh my word LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> I think that if you have a higher density of hair like mine, then it would be best to get two packages of these so that you dont accidentally run out.</li>
            <li> I was so sure these weren&#x27;t going to work, but they are AMAZEBALLS!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>

            <li> LOVE these knockoff curlformers!</li>
            <li> And after I wrap the curls around my head to stretch them, they look even more amazing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> Better value than Curlformers!</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve to using them but there are lots of online videos that help, my hair never holds curls for more than 2-3 hours and this held ALL day!</li>
            <li> Works even better than heat curlers!</li>

            <li> Creates really nice drop curls.</li>
            <li> Thanks, and it was great doing business with you!</li>
            <li> My spiral curls came out  nice, but I warn you all that the process of putting these in can take a while</li>
            <li> So its nice to wash my hair and set it in the curlformes.  </li>
            <li> I liked the curlers but didn&#x27;t receive the the hook.</li>
            <li> I honestly did not believe this would work for me, but my mother insisted on buying them from here.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions I&#x27;m more than happy to answer. :)</li>
            <li> They take forever to put in, but the results are spectacular.  </li>
            <li> are nice.</li>
            <li> has a really good one) and saw there were not to many complaints.</li>
            <li> I figured that if they didn&#x27;t come out so nice</li>
            <li> I would think they would&#x27;ve come in a nice zipper container.</li>
            <li> so many compliments &amp; everyone loved them.  </li>
            <li> I liked:  </li>
            <li> so I do the ends to give it a nice curl and still keep some length.</li>
            <li> but I liked the results.</li>
            <li> will also say that they grip nicely at the scalp, which I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li> They really are excellent for all hair types from straight-kinky.</li>
            <li> Curl looked nice but fell out within 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I definately recommend this item for anbody that wants beautiful curls wihout burning themselves or have heat damage!</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product and my daughter has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice, but nice result.</li>
            <li> I use these to do a set along with Camille Rose Naturals Aloe Whipped Butter Gel.</li>
            <li> I would try it if you want nice bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> I just cannot figure out it will be good to have for grand kids.</li>
            <li> It worked well and gave me a nice curl,patter for my 4c hair.</li>
            <li> but all in all i love the way the curls came out good product</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to have another way to do your hair without having to expose it to heat.</li>
            <li> These hair curlers are as good as the brand ones if not even better.</li>
            <li> The curls come out nice but they are tighter than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> does not create nice curls</li>
            <li> This product works well and makes beautiful ringlets; however, it takes hours to do a full head.  </li>
            <li> My curls were really nice.... until I went into the heat and humidity and</li>
            <li> I was really quite impressed with these.</li>
            <li> I really like these as they provide a great quality curl without heat!</li>
            <li> kind of frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used them on my grand daughter&#x27;s hair, she loved it, and the style lasted a week...</li>
            <li> Still, I was able to use both sets and get good results.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best curlers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> And she can pull them through her own hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice ..</li>
            <li> Thanks Vakind and Amazon was an awesome product, Sdesta</li>
            <li> For all the kinky girls out there (no clue what my texture is - probably a mix of 4a,b and c lol) this is actually better than the one in Sally&#x27;s because it&#x27;s plastic, which makes the hair a lot more sleek.</li>
            <li> That being said, you should take care how you take them off, because if you just pull them you will end up pulling out some of your hair, and it&#x27;s kind of painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly though, I was hesitant until I tried it...</li>
            <li> They work really nicely.  </li>
            <li> I will buy a spare hook to have on hand for my own peace of mind.</li>
            <li> They made my daughters transitioning hair beautiful and my natural hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> The product is nice</li>
            <li> and I never leave it to its own devices unless I&#x27;m dressing up as Medusa for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I honestly could have used those.  </li>
            <li> Then the hair will slide through nicely.  </li>
            <li> The curler formers work well and produce really nice curls.</li>
            <li> Nice ringlet curls.</li>
            <li> My hair looks really nice when I take them out.</li>
            <li> They work so nicely in my hair.</li>
            <li> She had nice bouncy  curls.</li>
            <li> The tool has some snags at the top and sometimes pulls my daughters hair, but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> Nice to have the extras in case some get lost too.</li>
            <li> I loved these, I was glad I found a cheaper version than the $60.00 ones I always see in the beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> Forms a nice curl.  </li>
            <li> Really, I am thrilled with the price, the quality, and the shipping time.  </li>
            <li> Wish the curlers would&#x27;ve come with some kind of carrying bag or case though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality wise they are very nice and well worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> Super easy to put in (once you know how) and looks great afterwards!</li>
            <li> These are great dupes for the original curlformers.</li>
            <li> Great price, totally worth it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived ahead of schedule which was great because we were excited to try.  </li>
            <li> I was soo excited !!</li>

            <li> Very easy to use and curls up nice.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, I purchased a curlformer one ahead of time and had it handy, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> These are a great way to get your hair full of spiral curls without damaging your hair with heat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad &amp; very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> They are amazing, they leave my hair in the perfect curl and they leave it so soft.</li>
            <li> After doing much YouTube research I was able to correctly use these and my results were awesome!</li>

            <li> I love this product and its way cheaper here than buying it at a beauty store (plus it has more!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again for sure - love them!</li>
            <li> This means if you are just wanting to quickly curl your hair without damaging it on the heat curler, but don&#x27;t want full curls, this is perfect for that!</li>
            <li> To be fair I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> the price is right!!!</li>
            <li> The shipping was  fast and the packaging was very good.</li>
            <li> The huge difference in cost if I had purchased the curl formers from the beauty supply store still makes this a good purchase though.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and these work great for me!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own the authentic ones but these work</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this version of the popular &amp;#34;curlformers&amp;#34; because I really love the hairstyles I&#x27;ve seen on youtube using the curlformers, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the curlfrmer price.</li>
            <li> My sister and mom have purchased some of their own now :-)</li>
            <li> but I know that this makes my hair have smooth gorgeous curls every time.</li>
            <li> They are not as soft as Curl Formers, but they work great!!!</li>
            <li> I used them on my daughter’s natural hair and the ringlets turned out perfectly.</li>
            <li> My sister and mom have purchased some of their own now  :-).</li>
            <li> They are great for girls that have poker straight hair and those that have curls but want more pretty perfect hair body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about the curl formers (The 80 dollar kind) &amp; these may even work better from the results I&#x27;ve seen from others.</li>
            <li> Someone that I watch on Youtube reviewed this brand, and that review (as well as the amazing price) made me more inclined to try them</li>
            <li> However I can say that the Magic Leverage version works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> Just make sure the hair is damp and has some kind of hair product like mousse on before putting them on.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my natural 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li> and my curls came out soft and perfect spirals.  </li>
            <li> items were in excellent condition, no missing pieces and worked well with some practice.</li>
            <li> They give the perfect spiral curl and I feel like they trap the moisture in my hair because it always look shine and soft when I take them out and stay that way after a week.</li>
            <li> The curlers work great when your hair is fresh from the shower.</li>
            <li> After watching Nap85&#x27;s vid on YouTube, I had great success.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I just can&#x27;t see myself paying more for the curlformers.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c hair and it worked perfect...</li>
            <li> Overall great product it produced  beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> price was right, the results were great.</li>
            <li> She was so right they are great.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and never ever holds a curl for longer than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> My hair is also very very fine.  </li>
            <li> My Mom has very fine hair</li>
            <li> This is not as easy as it may appear!</li>
            <li> These were so easy to use!</li>
            <li> They are so easy to put in and take out!</li>
            <li> Got this set for my daughter,  She has very fine hair and doesn&#x27;t hold curl well.  </li>
            <li> I just apply a mixture of oil and water (spray bottle) and the curlers are installed easily!</li>
            <li> So easy!</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use!</li>
            <li> they are so easy!</li>
            <li> So easy!  </li>
            <li> They are easy to put in and work so well!</li>
            <li> Love them, love them, love them!  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM !</li>
            <li> I used it on my natural 4b hair and it turned out very nice!</li>
            <li> This product is just as good as the original with an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Just has good as the original curlformers</li>
            <li> Quality of product is good in relation to original Curlformers.</li>
            <li> They are just as good as the original if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I guess it would work better if I were using them on someone else where I could see what I was doing better, but it just won&#x27;t work for me on my own hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that means I will need to use more on my own when I try them out on myself.</li>
            <li> Happy New Year!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is very very kinky/curly and it worked great.</li>
            <li> They are so easy and the girls hair is so cute!</li>
            <li> She said that they were really good for people with natural hair (like me) because they give you very nice and defined curls.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for anyone who wants beautiful curls without using heat.</li>
            <li> After using the set for the first time, I had great spiral curls and definition.</li>
            <li> The curls were beautiful and very  bouncy.</li>
            <li> She got beautiful waves and gentle ringlets instead of</li>
            <li> What a great first time experience.</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon that I wasn&#x27;t happy with.  </li>
            <li> Tried for the first time and the curls were great.</li>
            <li> However the hook is very cheap</li>
            <li> they still weren&#x27;t very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Once they are in, they aren&#x27;t very comfortable</li>
            <li> My hair looked very smooth with those just using water, coconut oil and aloe vera gel.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely amazing and really easy to install.</li>
            <li> Pros: Fairly easy to use, nice results.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice .</li>
            <li> It has a nice grip, but your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught easily in the hook.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m pretty confident the results will be great :) just order them too :)</li>
            <li> Very Easy, and quality is great, would highly recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use them because my friend had great results</li>
            <li> They were budget friendly, easy to use, fast shipping and excellent durability!  </li>
            <li> I will invest in a better hook.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to spend more $</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> I love the curls these give.  </li>
            <li> Also be sure to twist the hair just a bit.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> However, the cost more than makes up for it in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that these came in varying widths.</li>
            <li> I brought these because they were cheater then the curlformers but after using them I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the outcome.</li>
            <li> This product is great and it makes my hair very curly</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I can say I truley LOVE the results and got many a compliment from them.</li>
            <li> and I got so many that I know I wont run out of them.</li>
            <li> The curlers delivered for sure.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll have to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps:)</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would not have been able to use the curlers without buying the tool separately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend money on curlformers when these exist.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Love em...</li>
            <li> and I love these rollers.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m really pleased to find these rollers a lot cheaper. :)</li>
            <li> love them.</li>
            <li> We bought two sets just to be safe, but haven&#x27;t needed them yet.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s able to sleep with them, but daughter #2 can&#x27;t stand to.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It got my hair so nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I think I need more practice because it got better as I did it more.</li>
            <li> I Love this Product.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the outcome of the curls</li>
            <li> but I watched so many hours of youtube before</li>
            <li> did. :-)</li>
            <li> I LOVE that I can wash, condition and roll my hair with these curlers and my hair results in silky curls.</li>
            <li> These are great curlers, and just like the real Curlformers but for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I might order some more bc</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> (it was about $1.45 more) and it came with a deformed up hook and just one.</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> Love the end results.</li>
            <li> I love the curlformers themselves.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I use them for cheer, w/a lot of hairspray and it turn out really cute.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I just have to get used to the hook and find a better technique</li>
            <li> and I love these ones better...</li>
            <li> I think I like the ones from Amazon better.</li>
            <li> The curls were defined and cute.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I LOVE THESE, and may order more once my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> That worked much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotta be the most versatile.</li>
            <li> And then if your length grows out you&#x27;ll be able to continue to use them.</li>
            <li> You get sooo many for the money.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li> and I love how bouncy my hair becomes after using it</li>
            <li> An extremely cheap alternative to the Name Brand ones from Sally Hansen!</li>
            <li> Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> I like beachy waves, but this gave me more curls.</li>
            <li> I really love these.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I had no learning curve at all since I&#x27;ve watched so many videos on how to put these in.</li>
            <li> Many people have said the wand is flimsy</li>
            <li> not that she wasnt adorable, but thats just not the look for me.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways</li>
            <li> , after shaking the curls out and combing them through, my hair looked fabulous!</li>
            <li> but i thought it would have worked better than it did.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li> Much better value than purchasing Curlformers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how many stars to give them because of this.</li>
            <li> My parents bought me these knock-off Curlformers or Christmas (the pack of 40), and I love the curls it gave me.</li>
            <li> I could have gone with shorter ones, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> :) I have been getting nothing but compliments.</li>
            <li> She said they were comfortable to sleep in too !</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also getting lots of compliments on my hair &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> had the set come with a lot more than just one curliformer hook.</li>
            <li> Through trying out the curlers 4 times I was able to figure out a cute hairstyle that works for me but because of the damage it has caused my hair</li>
            <li> but they did stay in for a couple of hours which is a couple more hours longer than a curling iron ever did for me.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll stick to a curling iron), but might be okay for someone with more patience.</li>
            <li> But, youtube has many tutorials to help ypu with.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the cheaper brand. :)</li>
            <li> and i needed so many to cover my head</li>
            <li> but glad I decided to wait.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I&#x27;d be completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> They have a cheap plastic smell and that smell kind of stays in your hair.</li>
            <li> I love the spiral results.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I have 3 daughters and they love these 1.</li>
            <li> : even though i dont love the Andre Walker hair typing system, I would guess that it would range from 3c-4b.&lt;br /&gt;Density: High(thick)&lt;br /&gt;Strand texture:</li>
            <li> There are many curlformer tutorials on youtube if you want to learn how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really love the price of this product</li>
            <li> I love...</li>
            <li> You get many, many more rollers for your money</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine any better results.</li>
            <li> Vakind worked just as well, even better than the Curlformers!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> and this did not spiral it a lot but did leave a lovely wave.</li>
            <li> wants.&lt;br /&gt;Pictures will follow I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> I have not use curlformers yet, so i cant compare them to these Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets.</li>
            <li> I will say that i enjoy using them!</li>
            <li> they do give my hair more length as opposed to flexi rods</li>
            <li> I first wanted to buy this product because I was interested in no heat curls and this looked like the perfect answer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the curlformers.</li>
            <li> Works great and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> have shoulder-length type 4A/4B hair and no blow dryer was needed to achieve heatless smooth curls!</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I may try once more to sleep in them</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> Works very well, sometimes gets tangled when pulling the hair out, otherwise great product</li>
            <li> I decided to try these  on a whim and wanting some more curl to my hair.</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t get many curlers in my hair.</li>
            <li> But I love them already.</li>
            <li> These curlformers gives me the curls I love without using heat.</li>
            <li> my curls could of gotten any better.  </li>
            <li> and I love them</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased them FROM VANKIND THROUGH AMAZON.COM.</li>
            <li> i could have made better decision then</li>
            <li> Love, love, love</li>
            <li> I absolutely love what they do for my hair.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It is a bit more sturdier then the one which comes with the Vakind brand.</li>
            <li> I have used them twice since receiving them last weekend and woke up with perfect curls both times.</li>
            <li> and I was able to do heat-less  curls  that lasted for the week.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna order 1 more</li>
            <li> I love love love my curlformers.</li>
            <li> I love curformers.</li>
            <li> I think it gives me better curls anyway.</li>
            <li> I felt like i lost more hair</li>
            <li> Price is way better here</li>
            <li> I love the curls I get with them</li>
            <li> Google and YouTube, I love you.</li>
            <li> These helped set the hair at that part of my head better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and when I need to refresh the look between washings, I don&#x27;t have to use heat and damage my hair, just pop in a couple of these curlers and leave them alone for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the curl definition.</li>
            <li> Better results for 4c hair if used when damp.</li>
            <li> But overall a wonderful product</li>
            <li> love them</li>
            <li> I also have problems with my hair looking frizzy at the top</li>
            <li> glad i saved and did not buy the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Took about an hour to install all rollers (but I also took my time to make sure I didn&#x27;t snag any hair.....</li>
            <li> However the results were very beautiful and lasted several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product and a lot cheaper than the actual brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I checked online before buying the name brand at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> But overall great product!</li>
            <li> I just love these.</li>
            <li> I really love these and will be buying some for myself.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to purchase these instead of spending all that money on the curlformers brand.</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I saw a You-Tubers review the Magic Leverage version and decided to give these a try.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> instead  off  top</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to use these for many years to come!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE theses</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love these curlers.</li>
            <li> Love this thing</li>
            <li> Did they think the curlers wouldn&#x27;t be counted to make sure all were there?</li>
            <li> Why spend 4 times as much on actual curl formers.these with awesome.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are patient because you do not want to get your hair all tangled up in the wand and curler.  </li>
            <li> Gotta say, I did rip lots of hair before I realized its better to start over.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> silky smooth  bouncy curls NO HEAT NEEDED!  </li>
            <li> Vakind Hair Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets</li>
            <li> but I like it better.</li>
            <li> and i LOVE them.</li>
            <li> Never tried the authentic Curlformers</li>
            <li> but I love them.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re even better than the flexi-rods.  </li>
            <li> I love these curlers wish I got these before dishing out the price tag for the curlformers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using the curl formers.</li>
            <li> It took all 40 curlers, probably could have used more but we managed with 40.</li>
            <li> Like magic.  </li>
            <li> Better than all the rollers i had before.</li>
            <li> These worked and the curl lasted most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep in them.  </li>
            <li> I need some more practice, but look forward to using them often.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I use these.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Really Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this product instead of paying so much more for Curlformers.</li>
            <li> I think with practice my technique will get better.</li>
            <li> My seller was JLTech1, and I&#x27;m honestly so pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basing this on having used authentic curlformers and having 4C curly hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more about my hair than the product.  </li>
            <li> I did watch a youtube video for pointers and to make sure I was doing it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad these came in a pack of 40</li>
            <li> about 15 more would have done the job.</li>
            <li> It was okay for me.</li>
            <li> I really love these.  </li>
            <li> You get better results if you use gel in your hair when using it.</li>
            <li> but i love it.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li> ,I guess with more heatand product</li>
            <li> it be better .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve convinced my sisters to buy these, and they love them too.</li>
            <li> With a continued practice I am getting better with each set and am conquering the learning curve, which is a bit steep.</li>
            <li> Not so sure about the hook....</li>
            <li> The product would have been much better if more came in the package and if there was a backup hook.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> They are firmer and more durable than the Curlformers.</li>
            <li> I love the curler.</li>
            <li> My girls love this product.  </li>
            <li> and my curls the next day were wonderful!</li>
            <li> I made this purchase :)</li>
            <li> and I was so pleased.</li>
            <li> I am beyond satisfied.</li>
            <li> I need like 10 more because I have a lot of hair</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Both love how their hair comes out after using these.</li>
            <li> and I want the curls to be more defined.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU for such a great deal!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> because I had tons more.</li>
            <li> I wanted more of a beachy wave and volume.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to say that I am completely satisfied with my results.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with item</li>
            <li> The more rods you use, the more curls you&#x27;ll have that don&#x27;t need to be separated</li>
            <li> No need to spend more on the name brand.</li>
            <li> but it works better than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I am growing out my hair more, and have been using the original Curlformers for many years now (love those ringlets!).</li>
            <li> After reading about these curlformers, I&#x27;m glad I got them.</li>
            <li> I know we&#x27;ll get a better outcome when she sleeps in them.</li>
            <li> I would order more and recommend others to buy.</li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> but I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it curls my hair.</li>
            <li> 4.5 for sure.</li>
            <li> The sturdiness gives a great curl and straightens very well.</li>
            <li> I will buy some curl formers since The plastic is supposedly better quality and more pliable.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> but I was able to work through it.</li>
            <li> The next morning I have perfectly formed curls that do not fall out!</li>
            <li> I love this thing for teasing, up do&#x27;s, etc.  </li>
            <li> These came out as lovely spirals.  </li>
            <li> The results were outstanding.  </li>
            <li> These came out as lovely spirals.  </li>
            <li> The results were outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take me more then and hour to put 30 in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they need to make the hook more durable or send two.</li>
            <li> Works better than the $80 ones at Sallys beauty supply.</li>
            <li> and I love, love, love them.</li>
            <li> and i love how my hair turned out</li>
            <li> so I was able to work with that one.</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve packed my curling iron and wand away since these work way better.</li>
            <li> and I think that the more you use them the easier it becomes.</li>
            <li> and I think it might have been better to have shorter ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will get faster the more</li>
            <li> I get much more of a &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I LOVE them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy the name brand ones for 50 Bucks,</li>
            <li> I love my curlers.</li>
            <li> And we get so many compliments when we use them in her hair.  </li>
            <li> Once the curler is actually on, they do their job perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Love that I got such awesome results without heat though.</li>
            <li> I should have done more research on this product before purchasing.</li>
            <li> The curls are great the wand wasn&#x27;t it comes a part if you use too much force</li>
            <li> lol I would recommend leaving the curlformers in your hair for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> As I said I use the name brand curlformer hook that I purchased from Sallys for like $5-7  too many complaints about the hook that came with this package so I just threw it out &amp; didn&#x27;t even bother with it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get any better than this. :)</li>
            <li> These things cost so much more in Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how many come in a package until you get them</li>
            <li> The wand, however, could be much better.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Although, I have to leave these ones in :)  </li>
            <li> and I have gotten better results with my hair wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (and I am sure I can fix this with superglue) is the wand can break when I pull it through the curler.  </li>
            <li> and now I have to buy more as the girlfriends of those girlfriends damn</li>
            <li> And they are NOT self explanatory, because of this I haven&#x27;t been able to used them yet, so</li>
            <li> I think this is more of a hair dryer style.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these</li>
            <li> My girls love these.</li>
            <li> but they were much cheaper lol.</li>
            <li> Curls came out ok.</li>
            <li> and I love the lose curl that I get with these.</li>
            <li> ENJOY!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d abosultely invest in more of these curlers if I needed to.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and it only took about 11 days to get here.</li>
            <li> But I Wasn&#x27;t In Love With The Price.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to keep them smoother while in the spiral for a more polished finished product.  </li>
            <li> You must make sure all of the hair is in the hook, or you may accidentally pull/ tangle you hair.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE these.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my curls look when I use them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li> They make nice smooth curls in my 4c type hair.</li>
            <li> Will order more soon :)</li>
            <li> : affordable, gave great curls, pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Very efficient, cheap for the quantity, reliable, and comes with a good hook!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, easy to put in, and easy to take out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any heat, so letting them thoroughly dry was very important to making sure the curls were perfect!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how much I absolutely love these!!!</li>
            <li> When I took them out this 2nd try, I was in love!!!</li>
            <li> These work just as well and are soooooo much cheaper!!!!</li>
            <li> did not see a difference with the original curlformers except the amazing price.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for getting almost \\&quot;flat ironed hair\\&quot; without heat.</li>
            <li> OMG my spirals came out beautiful on my natural hair!</li>
            <li> It looked gorgeous at first, I still love the curlers, but it&#x27;s my fault for not putting some sort of mousse or setting lotion.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit of time but it is much fast and more effective than using a curling iron!  </li>
            <li> The product was in great condition, but there&#x27;s a high learning curve.</li>
            <li> They are good quality and came very fast.</li>
            <li> I love them , they are  easy to put on and take off my kids love their hair and the look after all</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the curls come out perfect and last all day.</li>
            <li> These were easy to use and my hair came out with nice and smooth curls.</li>
            <li> Curls are beautiful and natural looking.</li>
            <li> They were the perfect length for my medium to long hair.  </li>
            <li> I just received my curlers, and I will say for the price these are pretty good.</li>
            <li> They stretched my hair and formed perfect ringlets.</li>
            <li> These curlers created beautiful, bouncy curls that rival any set of professional magnetic rollers</li>
            <li> The formers stretched my hair perfectly, and without any sort of heat involved.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are also comfortable and easy to sleep in!</li>
            <li> It was so worth it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use them!</li>
            <li> These were really worth my money !!</li>
            <li> However, this method of curling... like most methods... isn&#x27;t as easy as you expect.</li>
            <li> if your hair is almost dry, and they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works best if hair is blown dry with them in.</li>
            <li> Her hair is dry and has awesome ringlet curls.  </li>
            <li> Can easily make cute hair styles.</li>
            <li> Works best with 60-70 % dry hair.</li>
            <li> Was able to catch on very quickly.</li>
            <li> An easy and SAFE way to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> At some point I will google how to use them and learn from YouTube, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to have good old fashion directions.</li>
            <li> but it is sturdy and works great on my 3c/4a natural hair!</li>
            <li> Great results for natural hair!</li>
            <li> but when I put these in my hair, my curls were beautiful, soft, flexible, and full of shine!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and make natural hair look beautiful without the heat.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient, quickly and beautifully.</li>
            <li> love it, it works fine just like i wanted to..</li>
            <li> Other than that, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend an arm and a leg for the CurlFormers, because my curls were perfect and bouncy and shiny just like they should be!</li>
            <li> Satisfied, feels and looks like the original cyrlformers, but this is much more affordable</li>
            <li> Just for reference: I have a good amount of healthy, fine, naturally straight, APL hair.  </li>
            <li> but I used my curlers on freshly washed, towel damp hair and got amazing results.</li>
            <li> So far I think this was a great choice.</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> makes great curls on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Great way to stretch natural hair 4b.</li>
            <li> but so far they have worked great.</li>
            <li> too long was happy to try this product however not too thrilled with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair--using these curlers when wet gives me the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I wonder if the name brand curlformers are more comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> Works great on those with natural hair.</li>
            <li> Recommend using on wet hair for best results.</li>
            <li> The spirals are cheap quality as well and thank goodness I did not have to pay more money for this product.  </li>
            <li> Perfect, worked as expected.</li>
            <li> and they actually smooth your hair a bit more.</li>
            <li> These are definitely more sleek, smooth and defined.</li>
            <li> These worked great on my 6 year old for &amp;#34;dance&amp;#34; hair.  </li>
            <li> Loved it but the handle thing was very flimsy and it kept coming apart when I tried to put my hair through it</li>
            <li> I loved it, much easier to sleep in than the benders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was quick and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product is great quality, easy to use with great results, and much cheaper than the actual CurlFormers.</li>
            <li> Price is more than reasonable!!!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t many and can easily be avoided by flipping the roller around and using the part with the smooth edge.</li>
            <li> I messed up 3 times before I got it right, but when I did, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> so well she bought her own set right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking about just a little bit of curl but full out beautiful amazing curls like you would see in a magazine!</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that YouTube is the best resource for using these rollers, since the product did not come delivered with instructions.</li>
            <li> so I was so excited when one of my favorite hair bloggers made a video comparing the results of her Curlformers and Vakind.</li>
            <li> The original Curlformers were supposed to be so much better than the knockoffs.</li>
            <li> Also they are super easy to use!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wand that pulls the hair through the curler is perfectly sturdy, IDK what other people&#x27;s problems are</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found these on Amazon for a fraction of the price of the original Curlformers.  </li>
            <li> Same product that sells for $50/$60 at the beauty supply shop...quick and easy to put on and gorgeous curls in the morning!</li>
            <li> The curl formers are in good condition and shipped very quickly, they were easy to put in and are comfortable, and they work really well.</li>

            <li> Honestly if I had tried these first</li>
            <li> As soon as it arrived I took out a couple of the curlformers to try them out first (was kind of worried jajajjaha)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and super curly hair!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re in my head right now, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love the curls and they&#x27;re easy and quick to put in.</li>
            <li> And best part is the price...way cheaper than the other brands but works just as well !..</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, apply these and then sleep on them (Not the most comfortable, but hey, beauty is pain, right!)</li>
            <li> They make excellent, tight curls - which can be easily loosened if that is your preference.</li>
            <li> But these work fine.</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully in my fine hair (after adding a bit of gel and curl lotion for hold and softness).  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have really fine hair&lt;</li>
            <li> Mine worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I do break things easily) or they were just  cheaply put together.</li>
            <li> Why pay all that money for the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; ones, when these work just fine.  </li>
            <li> and I think that it will be successful for many different hair types.</li>
            <li> I have bra strap length hair and fine, but a ton of it.</li>
            <li> She has may be a 3a in curly type (fine, but curly)...</li>
            <li> the curls came out fine.</li>
            <li> There is no way I&#x27;d pay full price for some Curlformers when these do a great job at stretching my natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I used the hook in the kit and it was just fine</li>
            <li> Everything was fine with the shipping</li>
            <li> I have waist length, fine hair.</li>
            <li> And she sleeps fine on them.  </li>
            <li> I have frizzy fine type 4 collar bone length hair that shrinks substantially when I wash it.  </li>
            <li> I bought the curlformer case to hold these but a ziplock baggy would be fine.</li>
            <li> They work fine.</li>
            <li> but mine is holding up just fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair is ver fine</li>
            <li> These made my daughters hair super curly and cute for cheer competition.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> and I was able to get them in quickly.</li>
            <li> Once I was accustomed to how the curlers worked, I was able to place them in my daughter&#x27;s hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> More barrel then spiral but very pretty.</li>
            <li> these are great for an easy, low maintenance hair style</li>
            <li> I was able to use them with ease even though there were no instructions a quick YouTube search filled me in.</li>
            <li> I love these Curler forms, so easy to use and worth buying.</li>
            <li> Even with my super curly, coily hair, I was able to achieve sleek, smooth, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> There are easy to use and give a good shape to my 3c natural hair.</li>
            <li> Shipping time was super fast and received them within a week when they said they would be here in a month&#x27;s time!!!!</li>
            <li> They give your hair a wonderful, tight and bouncy curl.</li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time and it was very easy to do.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than I would have liked to get them, but I am so happy with the product that I don&#x27;t even mind.</li>
            <li> The revisited videos (someone&#x27;s second attempt) are very informational and can give you very good hints to make your style more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The picture is accurate for the items I received.</li>
            <li> Leaving them in overnight seems to work best for soft, natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;The curlers are really huge.</li>
            <li> The hook is made of incredibly cheap, flimsy plastic.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The curls were smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love these and think they are fun.</li>
            <li> It was bouncy and nice all the way to the very roots.</li>
            <li> To get light, bouncy curls, I would recommend either using the mouse and water pair or just an oil of your choosing.</li>
            <li> They are great quality and feel like they are going to last forever.</li>
            <li> But overall I&#x27;m happy now 😍😁</li>
            <li> The pieces to hold them the wound smooth electrical tape around the wire to lock the together, otherwise I was going to throw them out.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> hope that my next purchase will be as great</li>
            <li> Overall great value for the price.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for those times your hair just feels dead and you don&#x27;t want to put heat on them anymore.  </li>
            <li> These curlers are simple to use and work great if you are looking for ringlet curls for Competitive Cheer, Show Choir, ect.</li>
            <li> I had the most soft and perfect curls the following morning that lasted 2 weeks with</li>
            <li> What a fantastic purchase - at</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a 5 star product - I&#x27;ve recommended them to all my friends - fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li> The curlers work very well &amp; are an amazing deal compared to Curlformers.</li>
            <li> I bought another one of these because the product is so fantastic.</li>
            <li> The hook that comes with this package is cheap.</li>
            <li> but once they dried they were perfect.</li>
            <li> The results were really smooth and shiny like I used a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I still I same results great results.</li>
            <li> Everyone else, it is more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Now keep in mind that these things are not all that comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Not as comfortable to sleep in overnight.</li>
            <li> , which by the way was not so comfortable.</li>
            <li> I could not get comfortable, my neck hurt in the morning.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t fit don&#x27;t force it.</li>
            <li> so cheap</li>
            <li> Seems like a sound purchase.</li>
            <li> it was cheap.</li>
            <li> So I will be trying again because I know they have great potential.</li>
            <li> Rolling hair on rollers didnt give me a shiny frizz free look.</li>
            <li> and everything will be smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> but I still had great curls for the next day!!)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother using the cheap wands.</li>
            <li> These curlformers get all of my hair uniformly smooth, shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I came across these and most of the reviews were favorable and the price was worth the risk.  </li>
            <li> Although it did leave a fabulous curl, I might just stick to rollers.</li>
            <li> The cons: the rod is cheap and it took me forever to somewhat attach the pieces.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a heat free styling option for the holidays.</li>
            <li> I tried them out for the first time last night and woke up with beautiful curls :-)</li>
            <li> Overall, this was a great curling tool.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people can sleep in these comfortably.  </li>
            <li> There are also no clippies or anything that might be used to secure each curler.</li>
            <li> These things are fantastic</li>
            <li> my hair just barley fit</li>
            <li> I am definitely keeping them though because the price was great</li>
            <li> My hair turned out as smooth</li>
            <li> The curls turned out smooth and sleek, and I have what some would say is 4a type , AA, kinky, coily textured hair.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> A bit stiffer than the name brand, but same great curl result.</li>
            <li> These were a great price and they provided me similar results to those I saw on youtube.</li>
            <li> I laughed because I was so sure there wouldn&#x27;t be enough to do my hair.</li>
            <li> for my followers and I most definitely recommend these instead if you&#x27;re trying to look good on a budget</li>
            <li> They are definitely going to take some time to get use to in regards to sleeping with them in my hair, but they really are incredible!  </li>
            <li> The mesh feels good and soft - its not plush like Curlformers</li>
            <li> The hook is obviously a cheaper quality than the real one and one of my curlers had a snag in it, but everything still works great!</li>
            <li> This product makes me feel like an adult Shirley Temple (and not in a good way).  </li>
            <li> This product works really good on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It did not  come with instructions , but I went and found a you tube video on how to use , very easy to use and love the results of my new hair</li>
            <li> The product works great on natural hair, however the curls did not keep because I have not found the right product to hold them.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my new curlers.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure to get the right size.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here, and there was no instructions in the package, so instead of being able to use them right away.</li>
            <li> Such a great product and worth the buy!</li>
            <li> They were reasonably easy to use, so I considered investing in the full set.  </li>
            <li> There great because they don&#x27;t pull out your hair when you take them out (which is a problem with many other hair curlers i have used before), and require no heat.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering another set pretty soon!!</li>
            <li> I was intimidated at first but after watching a You Tube tutorial I had zero problems!!</li>
            <li> Thanks seller!!!</li>
            <li> most  beautiful  tight curls.</li>
            <li> The price is so much better compared to the price at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply, I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants beautiful curls/waves without any heat damage.</li>
            <li> my first night using these, i put them in then went to sleep in them (which isnt very comfortable btw).</li>
            <li> Pretty much like the other kind.. cheaper plastic but get great curls!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> are quick and easy to get into my hair.</li>
            <li> These were super easy to use.</li>
            <li> and using it is quick and easy...</li>
            <li> Fast and very Easy to use.</li>
            <li> My new favorite styling product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own when humidity is high.</li>
            <li> but I really fell in love when i discovered how easy it is to put them in MYSELF.</li>
            <li> it was easy to use and very flexible and the value was even better.</li>
            <li> These are really worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the original &amp;#34;curlformers&amp;#34; in my Amazon shopping cart for weeks.</li>
            <li> Most of all, the product did exactly as described and did it well</li>
            <li> These are unique but did what they were intended to do.</li>
            <li> MUCH more reasonable!</li>
            <li> I do prefer to use the original curlformer wand over the one provided.</li>
            <li> and my man says they were worth every penny!</li>
            <li> worth the money!</li>
            <li> Save your money and purchase these over the original Cutlformers.</li>
            <li> I would buy this over and over again because it works just like the original brand</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these curlers after hearing a lot about them.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$!  </li>
            <li> super quick shipment from the seller i bought from too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the key to this is perfectly separating your hair (making sure there are no stray hairs) and holding the wand/roller in one direction and your piece of hair in the opposite direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more soon ;)</li>
            <li> so I was really excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would suggest getting the original wand ($4).  </li>
            <li> I was SO excited to try these as I am always looking for ways to style my out of control hair without heat and damage.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> They work just like the original and</li>
            <li> You do want to have a smoother, firmer, stronger, higher quality hook to safely pull your hair through the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some are to the point that I can not use them and some are still useable but not for long, These work great</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between the curlers but had to purchase the original Curl Formers rod</li>
            <li> definitely worth it when you do!  </li>
            <li> Curlformers are DEFINETLY worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Had to look at a You Tube tutorial to know exactly what I was doing; after a while  I was able to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The original curlformers have a matte finish on the ends of the curl tube.</li>
            <li> &gt; I am about to order my 2nd pack now because I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Curlformers.  </li>
            <li> I was reasonably satisfied with our first run-through but will continue to practice and experiment before they&#x27;re needed for a cheer tournament.</li>
            <li> therefore it would be my recommendation to purchase the original curlformers hook to use with these.  </li>
            <li> There is no need to purchase the original curl formers</li>
            <li> but however, you would need to buy the original curlformers hooks as a backup.</li>
            <li> Just watch a tutorial first if you arent sure about how to.</li>
            <li> I love these sooo much!  </li>
            <li> I like these curlformers, and would like them even more if the quality were consistent.</li>
            <li> Works like the original without the experience price.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed with them at all.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I bought them to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair but I am so glad I tried them on myself first because it can pull your hair</li>
            <li> The curls were ok and the stick broke into two before I finish setting my for the first time.</li>
            <li> I put them in my daughters hair, she slept on her belly, but the results were worth it!</li>
            <li> And yes, it is a challenge to sleep with them in but the curls are totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect your first time to be a style that you can go out with :).</li>
            <li> But so worth the effort when you get the results!</li>
            <li> Fell in love first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I got so many compliments after using these curl formers and i will definitely be using them more often!</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are good!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and these were a great size.  </li>
            <li> These are totally worth it!</li>
            <li> These things are an absolute miracle tho and have turned this sceptic into a true believer!!</li>
            <li> However, these were easy to put in, the wand seems pretty strong, and I have had no problems with the curlers breaking.</li>
            <li> So I got a very good product for much less cost than the name brand.</li>
            <li> I thought these where great and actually  worked they where also pretty easy to use</li>
            <li> But this is easy and fun for a fancy and fun look!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and these are great for the price.</li>
            <li> I recently went natural and these hair curlers make perfect spiral curls.</li>
            <li> back today to buy two more sets (now we each have our own set.).&lt;br /&gt;Learning</li>
            <li> In short, great rollers, does as stated, definitely economically affordable and girlfriend approved to praise.</li>
            <li> these are so fun and easy</li>
            <li> u get twice as much for 1/2 as much, and  they work just as good</li>
            <li> They would be great if you have a couple hours for your hair to dry.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to offer different sizes within the package as well for a better effect and look of &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; of the curls.</li>
            <li> Super super easy to use.</li>
            <li> (Like honestly who have the money for the brand name when this product does just the same okay boo boo).</li>
            <li> Seller communication could be better, but as far as the curlers themselves, I really love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used these for the first time last night and my daughter woke up with beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> In order to get a good curl on my thick hair, it needs a good 2-3 hours in (which for work, would have me getting up at 3am to put them in.)  </li>
            <li> My overall experience was very positive and I&#x27;m happy we got these curlers.</li>
            <li> I get great results with my daughter&#x27;s hair every single time.  </li>
            <li> I used more of the Magic because the tubes are longer than the curlformers and my hair was more stretched out with them once I took them out.</li>
            <li> These were pretty easy to use and the results were fabulous curls that lasted a couple of days.</li>
            <li> The curls are pretty and smooth and the formers are really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you use plenty of setting lotion and don&#x27;t plan on putting these in quickly the first time you use.</li>
            <li> and her hair turned out great and my hair is very very thin and it worked great on my hair as well</li>
            <li> Loved them, I am not very good with a curling Iron and such but these were very easy and gave me great curls</li>
            <li> She taped it and still uses it from time to time, so other than this company should produce a more durable stick for usage, I would say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I also want to say that for special occasions before I bought these I paid to have her hair curled like this.</li>
            <li> The price is just right!</li>
            <li> The price is right on target!</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on point as quoted in my order (2 Days)!</li>
            <li> The curl formers did the right thing by my hair and afforded me one day of heat-free curly locs!</li>
            <li> I just curled a few more pieces of my hair again at bedtime and in the morning I had amazing ringlets once again!</li>
            <li> but they make amazing soft curls.  </li>
            <li> I have long natural 4a/b  hair and it works perfect in my hair.</li>
            <li> These did a good job making pretty spiral curls in my natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li> The curls you get are pretty nice, but you can&#x27;t put too much hair in the curlers.</li>
            <li> but the curls are the same and is really good for all type of hair.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast, these did not have an odour has most persons had said.</li>
            <li> I was my hair every three days and these curls stay in for the full time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I chosen these instead of paying so much for curlformers.</li>
            <li> My family LOVED my purchase so much that I&#x27;m gonna have to order more, because all of us want to use them at the same time.  </li>
            <li> it was ok, they are cheaper than the curlformers I bought ($70 is tooo much,</li>
            <li> If you want good curls that will last, this product is a must bu.</li>
            <li> and my hair comes out nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good quality product for the price.</li>
            <li> one of the reasons why I love this so much is because it doesn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> these are ok if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money for the real thing.</li>
            <li> The actual spiral ringlets look to be really good quality.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure that you do NOT pull too much hair through the curlformer.</li>
            <li> also it took a full 40</li>
            <li> These gave me nice curl as promised, even on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them at least five times and I get excellent results each time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post a better review after I&#x27;ve gotten some real curl cream and stuff.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the &#x27;Curlformers&#x27; brand, but i&#x27;m sure i wont have to because these work very well.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d say flexi-rod curls last longer, but these are still a good buy.</li>
            <li> glad i did because i did go thru one whole pack.</li>
            <li> Go ahead and spend more money on real curlformers</li>
            <li> This is a really cool product.</li>
            <li> Overall the product is good and works well.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did because I needed 1.5 to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li> i felt competent at it after just a couple minutes and did my whole head.</li>
            <li> but I wanted my hair to be full of curls.</li>
            <li> this item is so cool.</li>
            <li> Ohhh natural nice curls.</li>
            <li> I could never do her full head of hair with a curling iron in that</li>
            <li> No need to pay full price for a &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brand curler.</li>
            <li> However, there were a lot of them (77 curlers full).  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine that the real curlformers could do any better of a job than these.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you are able to sleep in these, I don&#x27;t think these will save you much time.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Go here for my full review: hairdiary.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/curlformer-dupes/</li>
            <li> I thought that these would be a cool way to curl my hair--not.</li>
            <li> Cost is cheap and well worth it.</li>
            <li> Comes with a hook.the hook will break the same day you start using it.not a good buy</li>
            <li> I had to tape it together until I was able to go to Sally&#x27;s and buy the real one.</li>
            <li> However, these curl formers are fabulous, and are an easy way to get cascades of beautiful ringlets - even for hard to curl hair, like mine.</li>
            <li> These things give my 4c natural back length hair amazing curls!!</li>
            <li> The hook is nice and sturdy, and the openings on the curlers are easy to pinch open.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited when I saw this because I didn&#x27;t want to use heat on my hair and my hair is naturally straight</li>
            <li> When you have it right it will pull smoothly.  </li>
            <li> easy after the first time,no instructions included,so you have to figure out to put the stick through the curler,but after I got it</li>
            <li> curlers are pretty easy to use once you get the hang of them.</li>
            <li> My first thought was that these are super easy to install and</li>
            <li> Seriously the most beautiful curls I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Seriously the most beautiful curls I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> They were pretty easy to use and quick.</li>
            <li> AND THE CURLERS ARE GREAT FOR SMOOTH EDGES AND LITTLE TO NO FRIZZ.</li>
            <li> they are so happy with the curls that other people are wanting me to buythem</li>
            <li> Other than that it was great.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it was a great buy</li>
            <li> but other than that great product.</li>
            <li> The delivery of this item was great, received the package the day before the due date....</li>
            <li> One happy little girl!! :)</li>
            <li> I struggled using the orange ones my first two times but after that they worked perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Sleeping isn&#x27;t terribly comfortable with them in, but it&#x27;s not terrible (an old pillowcase used as a turban can keep the curlers up and out of the way and under control).  </li>
            <li> Luckily my husband poked a wire through.</li>
            <li> This rollers are super chip and they do the job.</li>
            <li> they started to ..deteriorate..rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I use Curler Magic for the first time and it was a bit intimating at first after watching Youtube video.</li>
            <li> Slept in them and when I took them out the next day Fantastic spiral curls! :) Pinned them up at night and worn a satin bonnet to bed.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m lucky to get 3 day hair.</li>
            <li> They left her with the most adorable silky looking ringlets.  </li>
            <li> Quick fix:</li>
            <li> If you looking for more volume to you hair, this product most definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> things I will purchase many more in different sizes.</li>
            <li> It came quickly in basically a piece of plastic, but it looked like everything was inside</li>
            <li> Ringlets worked great on my hair but they were hardly enough for my whole head.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It was quick to do.</li>
            <li> I got awesome spiral curls with zero heat (left them in for 3 hours) that lasted all night and into the next morning.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> With all that said, these things allow you to QUICKLY setup a kid for a headful of curls in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I recommend putting super glue on the hook to glue the two parts together.</li>
            <li> I see zero reason to spend twice the money for real curlformers when these gave me such great results.</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of them they went in quickly.  </li>
            <li> It even arrived fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The curlers made perfect curls in my African American hair.</li>
            <li> I am recommending these to all my friends with little girls who want to have beautiful curls without all the styling products, heat and trying to twist curlers into their hair.</li>
            <li> These are great for spiral curls, but now that I know it&#x27;s a good product, I&#x27;ll probably try out the long and wide ones too!</li>
            <li> No other hair curlers have worked this nice for my hair.</li>
            <li> The sticks are cheap, so be very gentle on putting them together.</li>
            <li> They got my 4a/b mixed natural hair super straight in perfect ringlets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them twice already, and the first time my hair was a bit static-y, so I went out and bought some cheap curl defining cream</li>
            <li> They came out very pretty and looked as if I used a curling iron.</li>
            <li> (only so much will fit into the hook), since that&#x27;s good for even curls and for drying faster.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and would definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> The wand broke the first time I used it because the plastic is too cheap for snapping together and unsnapping when finished using; so if you snap it together leave it because it may break when taking it apart.</li>
            <li> These make perfect curls, just not good for sleeping.</li>
            <li> This also shipped to my home within a day or two- very fast!</li>
            <li> I broke the brush almost immediately after trying it for the first time it was so cheaply made.</li>
            <li> the things is i wasn&#x27;t aware that the UPS the one who delivered and i am using P.O Box, but the shipping really fast!!!</li>
            <li> I normally just lightly spritz my hair ( not wet or even very damp), get them in my hair and by the time my makeup is done I have great curls.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to be the first of my friends to try this product.</li>
            <li> most of the time i wear a fro but when i am looking for new techniques to style my hair</li>
            <li> Love  my new curlfomers.</li>
            <li> These curlers was very affordable and easy to use once you got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> You will need a good amount of time to allow your hair to dry otherwise the curls will not come out at all.  </li>
            <li> I actually think it&#x27;s better quality, and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> After detangling really well these are easy to put in.</li>
            <li> they are fast and easy</li>
            <li> It really work, is really easy to use</li>
            <li> so easy to use and really do make Shirley Temple like curls.  </li>
            <li> They are VERY tricky to sleep in, but if you watch videos on how to sleep in them, it&#x27;s easily</li>
            <li> And they are super easy and fast to put on, just sleep with them and wake up with gorgeous curls every single time!</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable to sleep in and made very pretty and natural looking curls/</li>
            <li> These work exactly like the pricey Curlformers curlers!</li>
            <li> Thank you SO much!!</li>
            <li> I would have given them a 5 if my hook didn&#x27;t break on the first use!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> These are the first curlers to work!</li>
            <li> I had to redo everything to get all of my hair done, but overall, I really love this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These look exactly like the original ones</li>
            <li> We used curl cr&amp;egrave;me and they held all day at school--a first for her!</li>
            <li> I actually like these even better the Curlformers!</li>
            <li> As with the CurlFormers after reading those reviews, the first time using them was tricky, but I got the hang of it and my hair turned out just like the pictures!  </li>
            <li> I actually like these better than the ones I have!</li>
            <li> The most important part of the entire thing is to get the full section of hair inside the mouth of the curler.</li>
            <li> They are pretty comfy too!  </li>
            <li> However, these didn&#x27;t come with instructions, so please watch a video first!</li>
            <li> They are pretty easy to use (watch You Tube first).</li>
            <li> These curlers are amazing (and super simple).</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and actually works better than a curling iron in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and actually works better than a curling iron in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My daughter looked absolutely adorable and her curl is still going strong 2 days later.  </li>
            <li> Perfect, but very hard.</li>
            <li> I have very curly but fine hair.</li>
            <li> The 95% dried hair yields the best results, but I was happily satisfied with the semi-curls I received from fully dry hair as well.</li>
            <li> The stick comes in handy and they really make your hair so soft without heat!</li>
            <li> 1-2 of my forms had holes, but other than that they all work great and so much cheaper than name brand!</li>
            <li> and I got perfect romantic loose curls.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to putting the rollers in, but once you get the hang of them they work great.  </li>
            <li> A little too well actually lol.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine anyone needing all of them, so if you have lots of hair and a tough scalp, these will be a great investment!</li>
            <li> Once I get the hang of it, and fine tune my product selection to fight frizz, I&#x27;ll be able to create a &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; look with relative ease.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!!!</li>
            <li> also may want to wash them in warm/hot water with some shampoo before your first and after every use simply to keep them clean and effective.</li>
            <li> a really good dupe for the real thing, they came super fast, and if you dont want to pay the extra money, very worth while.</li>
            <li> They take a little more time to put in but the result are great with my hair being NATURAL.</li>
            <li> If you have any daughters, this would be the most adorable hairstyle, but I don&#x27;t know how little girls would enjoy sleeping with these curlformers over night.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money trying to get a brand name when these ate just as great.</li>
            <li> When I found out how much they cost, I had a fit.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look further than here for the amazing curlers that everybody is talking about.</li>
            <li> But, the price is so cheap that I&#x27;m not complaining too much.</li>
            <li> Really yanked my hair and didn&#x27;t pull through smoothly.</li>
            <li> But never put to much of your hair in the hook/curlers it will clump your hair and wont slide in smoothly as it should.</li>
            <li> These are well worth it.</li>
            <li> and it defiantly is worth the price</li>
            <li> The material is not as soft as the curlformers, but it makes a better curl.</li>
            <li> For the price though so worth trying and having in the arsenal of hair products.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because they aren&#x27;t the most comfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li> They were a challenge, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> To me, it just isn&#x27;t worth the process.</li>
            <li> Either I&#x27;m completely unaware of my own strength (which does happen from time to time.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and I was able to do heat-less curls that lasted for the week.</li>
            <li> My hair was shiny &amp; just overall nice, when I took them out my roots</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This was just as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> They are worth trying, however, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the number of curlers you get.</li>
            <li> I really like how so many comes in the pack, that really helps with how the hair turns out.  </li>
            <li> but I love the fact that they give me a soft curl that lasts.</li>
            <li> it did make hair curl....but would never recommend its use....not worth the effort</li>
            <li> It is by far a better value.</li>
            <li> Then I started taking them out and decided that I&#x27;d just have to find a way to make them more comfortable at night...or possibly put them in in the morning on a day off and remove them at night before bed.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped from China so the return shipping costs weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine these are as good as the real deal because I don&#x27;t think</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> The curlers and wand arrived earlier than expected and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> all in all, its worth it</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> So far though, love these things.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it would be nice to have directions in there for people that don&#x27;t know how to use them already.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did notice that my hair snagged a couple times on a couple formers, but well worth the HUGH price difference.</li>
            <li> it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope you have as much fun with these as I have.</li>
            <li> hope you have as much fun with these as I have.</li>
            <li> It took me awhile to get them all in, but once I can figure out how to keep the style longer than a day, it will be worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I used the tools on freshly washed hair</li>
            <li> I did use these on a 4a/4b friend which MUCH thicker hair and the orange and pink ones were great.</li>
            <li> I also made sure to wash these twice before using (since HELLO cheap mass-produced Chinese brand here).</li>
            <li> My initial purchase of this item was a gift for my daughter, she loved the produce so much.  </li>
            <li> these curlers you&#x27;re only effective if you have some type of setting lotion in your hair</li>
            <li> - well worth the effort and investment.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these rollers to anyone who wants to look good on a budget.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it worked pretty good, but the second time I used it the wand snapped in two and I cannot find a site where you can just buy the wand and not curlers.  </li>
            <li> (: Just have fun with it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just easier, I use Redken Fresh Curls Curl Spray and my spirals  </li>
            <li> To fix this and loosen the curls so they looked more natural</li>
            <li> They are fun and the results are lovely, soft, bouncy curls.r in because I was losing patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are fun and the results are lovely, soft, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> because they don&#x27;t hold up as well as a flexirod set, but something worth trying to not put stress on your hair with heat.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how big they were honestly.</li>
            <li> I like using this product, pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived quicker than stated which was awesome, however they were of poor quality.</li>
            <li> It took a while when getting the hang of it,  but the result was well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> For those of us that still remember shirley temple and her iconic curls, you would be gussing over your soft bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> I slept with them on overnight, which I&#x27;ll admit wasn&#x27;t all that comfortable but not terrible, and the next morning when I took them out</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Still, totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> it was great to find an easy way to tame my mane!!</li>
            <li> These create such a cool effect and they&#x27;re so easy to put in your hair!</li>
            <li> the plastic was the same as the original curlformers!!</li>
            <li> I was right about the hook - flimsy - worth it to invest in 1 or 2  brand name CurlFormers</li>
            <li> One day I was browsing YouTube channels looking for a new, easy and cute style for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dries super fast and the curl lasts for days!</li>
            <li> I had my friend put them in, and she got the hang of it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> First Off, They Arrived Really Quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use and more there are more than enough curlers to use on my thick haired 4 yr old.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the original curlformers.</li>
            <li> Put wrap foam on each portion of my hair right before I put the Curlformer in.(it&#x27;s best if your hair is a little damp not wet) Put a blow dryer bonnet on for about 30 mins.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was right on time.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> How I use it is right after I come out of the shower I put my leave in and oil in my hair then either use mousse or a styling smoothie/gel on each section I do before pulling it through the curler to insure that they stay.</li>
            <li> If you do everything right, by the 5th-7th time, youll nail it like a pro.</li>
            <li> I watched 5,000 videos on YouTube just to get it right</li>
            <li> My hair basically slid right through them, and I have 4b/c hair, too.  </li>
            <li> You have to find the right size for your hair length</li>
            <li> The price is just right also.</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> You could tell I was a beginner as I didn&#x27;t have a lot of uniformity to the sections I took or whether I used the clockwise or counter clockwise ones in the right places.  </li>
            <li> I set my hair right after a Nupur treatment.</li>
            <li> They arrived right away.  </li>
            <li> Will contact seller and have to wait to get the right part.</li>
            <li> I do not plan to use it to perm or blow-dry, so I&#x27;m not too concerned about the supposed issue of it not being the exact same kind of material as the brand name</li>
            <li> Only used them a couple times, but so far I feel like they&#x27;ve been successful.</li>
            <li> I also thought I&#x27;d put them in and clean my house, but I really couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that makes gives my hair beautiful curls that last all day with no heat.  </li>
            <li> However, they are very easy to use if you watch video tutorials and such</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have a VERY strong grip, so once you slip your hair through them, they definitely stay on.</li>
            <li> the hook had a scrap of plastic left on it from molding that I cut and filed down, but it&#x27;s perfect now so no biggie!</li>
            <li> Next time I will try the smaller rollers with some setting foam and a hood dryer to see if I get ringlets that hold better, but great job so far.</li>
            <li> Took them out in less than 3 minutes the next morning with perfect curls.  </li>
            <li> After I did the first couple of curls, it went pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these, they came quickly, the only downside is that they arrived in a Ziploc bag</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no difference in quality, very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not able to buy the official Curlformers, these are a great substitute.</li>
            <li> Generally, I use 38 of the 40 curlformers that come in the package, but I&#x27;m thinking of ordering about 8 more because I want to make the sections</li>
            <li> 3rd time I used it, I did not get as good results but it was my own fault because I used a leave-in conditioner that was too heavy.</li>
            <li> Pretty much like the original curlformers.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the actual curl formers and almost work even better!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to anyone looking to get beautiful curls with little fuss.</li>
            <li> If the opening of the curler does not cover the wand completely or if held at a certain angle be sure your hair will get caught in the wand</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re able to sit under the dryer ,if you can&#x27;t then it kind of hard to maintain.</li>
            <li> A must buy for anyone who wants amazing curls and waves, especially if you want to avoid any heat tools.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a great deal to buy them &amp; spend an extra $3-$4 for an actual Curlformer hook.</li>
            <li> Really drys quick also.</li>
            <li> Never had any hair that got tangled, only set the curler too far away from my scalp twice, and loved the results.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> use it all the time for my 5 yr old easy to use on children!&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li> Be the trend setter among your friends make them green with envy then give out the name of this magic tool and they will surely follow.</li>
            <li> The curlers are a great way to lock in moisture, just not very good for curls.</li>
            <li> The original curl formers which I also own sells at just a little over 57.00 for the kit</li>
            <li> After lusting after the beautiful curls of the ladies of YouTube for well over a year, I finally bought a curlformers dupe and discovered that I absolutely hate that perfectly coiffed curl look on myself.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to definitely order these with sufficient time in mind and check the package right away to make sure everything is included.</li>
            <li> My curls was nice and loose.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, uncomfortable to sleep in, but beautiful results.</li>
            <li> I read the mixed reviews and was super nervous!!</li>
            <li> My daughter who has very straight hair slept in these and took them out in the morning-</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It goes very fast.</li>
            <li> the only negative thing I have to say about these curlers is that they really aren&#x27;t that comfortable to sleep in, but the results are GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> But for my  hair it didn&#x27;t last till morning, I have very light hair</li>
            <li> However, it also did a very nice job on smoothing each section and getting out a few of the knots I made when I tried to put in too much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very cheap compared to actual curlformers.</li>
            <li> I do recommend using some kind of setting cream though so your hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up and plus it adds some extra shine and makes your hair super soft.</li>
            <li> As far as the quality the curlers go, they are fine.</li>
            <li> I use these in my daughter&#x27;s hair - it is very fine and will not hold a curl with a flat iron or curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I like new gadgets and love experimenting with new hair techniques.</li>
            <li> Exchange for new item was easy and fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> First of all, these came VERY fast.</li>
            <li> Also just about perfect length, depending on the day my hair seems a little too long for them</li>
            <li> At first I struggle with insulation but after a while it was quick simple and easy.</li>
            <li> These do great on hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li> They work great on  my daughter&#x27;s hard to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> in all, if you have shorter hair that is not thick, these might work for you for special events, etc.  </li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t spend all that money on the curlformers when I got the same results with these.</li>
            <li> Sock buns, foam curlers, curling around a head band at night, hot curlers, curing irons - literally everything</li>
            <li> It was tricky at first to get them in</li>
            <li> most definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> The first time takes a bit, but after that, it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li> So, again, if you have more hair I think these would be really great, but if you have a really sensitive scalp or thin hair, I&#x27;d say no.</li>
            <li> I do however love these curlers and would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am quiet pleased with the amout of curlers.</li>
            <li> (Packaging was basically a big ziploc bag:)</li>
            <li> I like to separate the curls into smaller sections of curls for more volume.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length relaxed hair and the curlers were more than enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> Placing it any higher on my hair resulted in the hook getting tangled into my hair at the scalp and the risk of breaking my hair if I tried to force it.</li>
            <li> I hope to purchase more from them in a bigger size!</li>
            <li> Everything is ingenious and simple.</li>
            <li> these curlers did the job perfectly and without the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> I love doing roller sets on my hair, especially  rod sets  </li>
            <li> My product was not defected and I am overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> I used them the first night that I had them</li>
            <li> but I did soak them in really hot water and soap as a precaution.</li>
            <li> There is no reason to go out and buy the expensive brand name set though, these worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> When all was said and done after my first attempt, I must say I had no problems hooking my hair and pulling it through.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li> so next year I prob won&#x27;t be able to use them..</li>
            <li> I most definitely will not pay for curl formers from Sally</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are in love with the results and we have 2 completely different hair types.</li>
            <li> I first heard about these on Youtube and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> I received soooo many compliments the next day!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First, this took forever to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have theses smooth soft &amp;#34;Snoop</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> the Magic spirals are too big for the curlformers wand.</li>
            <li> Also, keep in mind that these come from China, so don&#x27;t expect to receive fast shipping!</li>
            <li> this sounds better than buying multiple sets, if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other then that this is the beat thing since slice bread :-)!</li>
            <li> They are no where near comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it should</li>
            <li> My first try took about an hour</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to put the curlers in, 2 of them broke.</li>
            <li> These really do work!</li>
            <li> At first a struggle to learn how to use them.</li>
            <li> That I didn&#x27;t expect but then again, I used them a LOT when I first got them.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s held up very well!</li>
            <li> I pair them with my Softhood dryer attachment, since they are way too uncomfortable to sleep in, and the curls turn out perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> The only thing  will say as a word of warning if you have a tender head you probably will not be able to sleep in these and will need to sit under a dryer for an hour.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> everybody gave compliments to my hair for the first time i used it..</li>
            <li> I went to Sally&#x27;s at first</li>
            <li> All that to say, you get what you pay for but these definitely are not terrible!</li>
            <li> I did wash them twice in hot soap water and rinse them (didn&#x27;t like the plastic smell).</li>
            <li> so my texture is different but it worked for us both more for me though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the real curlformers, but these do the job!</li>
            <li> I also did not do them in front of the mirror the first time, so I did not watch what I was doing.</li>
            <li> My curls were so defined and smooth; my hair so bouncy and soft, almost as if I came from the salon.  </li>
            <li> They work exactly how they are intended.</li>
            <li> Marula-Muru Moisture butter then attached the magic leverage curl former, adding moisture with a spray bottle as needed.</li>
            <li> The first curler went in with no issues.</li>
            <li> I was going to pay 4 times more for a similar product.</li>
            <li> I might post a picture, we shall see...;)</li>
            <li> The trick is twisting the hair at the root first and then pulling it through.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what my curl formers do.</li>
            <li> Wish I had seen these first.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> no problem the first time.  </li>
            <li> LOVE them and definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> I first suggest you super-glue the hook, because I have heard complaints of it breaking.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things including the peach colored perming rods (results were very similar).</li>
            <li> but it was still a challenge for a first timer like myself to put them in.</li>
            <li> It took some practice at first</li>
            <li> I received 2  of  the  same top hook  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if these are the generic version, I STILL LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> These are better than traditional roller setting!</li>
            <li> , I then pushed the hair back to the top of the curler to untangle.  </li>
            <li> One, the hook broke on me from the first time I tried to assemble.</li>
            <li> these work just as well as the name brand and are SO much cheaper!</li>
            <li> ) Use as many formers as possible!</li>
            <li> The curlers are EXACTLY like curlformers without the price tag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to me that they dont understand BUSINESS ETHICS ,and solely interested in making money , even if this accounts to FRAUD.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use them yet but they seen pretty durable.</li>
            <li> The order came a whole day ahead of time!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering the real thing from now on, it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> AND MY STICK BROKE FIRST ATTEMPT.</li>
            <li> The trick is not to put too big of a chunk of hair in the curlformer and to make sure the hair doesn&#x27;t escape the rod as you pull it through the curlformer.</li>
            <li> Get ready for alot of curl!</li>
            <li> Can be tricky to use at first.</li>
            <li> The first day at work after using these, some of my coworkers thought I had gotten rid of my dreadies.  </li>
            <li> Get these and get real results!  </li>
            <li> even smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I put Krazy Glue all over the hook part as soon as I opened the package, because I&#x27;d heard horror stories from others about hooks breaking on first use.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This came fast!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> So glad I found these for a fraction of the cost of traditional curlformers!</li>
            <li> Well the problem is, is that I didn&#x27;t know what length to buy at first</li>
            <li> First, the shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li> Just tried it for the first time</li>
            <li> I can tell these are better then hot curlers, regular rollers, flex rods, and even my clipless curling iron.</li>
            <li> But overall its not terrible</li>
            <li> and I used as many as possible and still have about 8 extras in the package.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly how it should.</li>
            <li> Recommend watching a video on YouTube how to do it first.</li>
            <li> They are exactly like the product named Curlformers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure work just the same.</li>
            <li> : I still love these curlformers, and have used them a total of 6 times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, they are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay the extra money for the name-brand version.</li>
            <li> The heated curlers are to hot for my hands.</li>
            <li> I let them soak in HOT water to rinse of any manufacture stuff you know.</li>
            <li> It did exactly like it says it will do.</li>
            <li> , they do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do</li>
            <li> Be sure to use some type of product in each section before putting it in the curl former (curly pudding, can&#x27;t shea, etc) and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Even though my curls didn&#x27;t last more than a day or so</li>
            <li> I love them overall.</li>
            <li> They work great with no problems and last me a long time.</li>
            <li> 40 is more than enough for one person.</li>
            <li> actually ended up buying more after this set.</li>
            <li> I have because I only got 2 top halves of the hook.</li>
            <li> However, 40 curlers wasn&#x27;t quite enough for all of my medium length mostly 4A hair.</li>
            <li> Will most likely end up buying one at a beauty supply store or another online retailer.</li>
            <li> This price was much better than that of the regular curl formers.  </li>
            <li> We put them in their wet hair at night and in the morning they have nice ringlets and no knots.  </li>
            <li> I still love Bantu, but I felt like thse made it a bit easier, and it&#x27;s a different type of curl.</li>
            <li> So now I have choices for my no-heat looks, which is pretty</li>
            <li> We probably used 20-25 the first time.  </li>
            <li> If this is your first time I would recommend watching some YouTube tutorials on them to save you a lot of trial and error.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it should.  </li>
            <li> , Can&#x27;t wait to try them this following Monday!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> They give me perfect corkscrew curls which is not what I wanted unfortunately.</li>
            <li> My first time using these was years ago with the shorter ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a couple of months now and overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> but I bought two packs (because the first worked well</li>
            <li> My curls came out really pretty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying it on damp hair with another product that holds better next!</li>
            <li> So stop looking at the price and get them now, 40 in a pack is more than enough.</li>
            <li> would not even dream about using heat now ;)</li>
            <li> I First Saw A Video Review Of Curlformers</li>
            <li> I will need to order more &amp;#34;curlers&amp;#34; as 40 was not enough.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and takes curls very easily so it came out in the exact shape of these curlers, ie Shirley Temple.</li>
            <li> I was up most of the night trying to find a comfortable way to lay my head down.</li>
            <li> The curlers work very nicely and may be hard to use at first,  </li>
            <li> This is not near as easy as it looks on you tube!</li>
            <li> I had just the right amount for my full naturally kinky curled hair.</li>
            <li> Installation was quick and simple just like with the name-brand product, and the results are smooth and shiny, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> Works very well and shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> I like them, I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to get the exact results I want, but they work perfectly fine for my super thick 3b/c curls.</li>
            <li> i have fine to normal strands with normal density.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and I go long periods without relaxing it, so for a quick and easy style</li>
            <li> Also let me be clear that I haven&#x27;t used original curlformers, so</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair curls after wearing the former overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Its a long process but love the end results.</li>
            <li> They work really great, curls last long, and they are very defined.</li>
            <li> The plastic is thinner and the ends are made with cheap, flimsy, rubber instead of the more firm rubber the first set had.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the resulting long lasting, shiny curls - and the compliments :-)</li>
            <li> I love the product (Vakind Hair Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets Former Leverage Stretched Length).</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to style but these finally give me the option of perfect curls!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the curls look great, there just hard to sleep with.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product for the money spent.</li>
            <li> The curl formers were made very well and created smooth curls in my 4B,C natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I currently have heat damaged hair and decided to do non heat styles to get my hair back into good shape.</li>
            <li> SOMETHING because these gave me the most perfectly smooth and firm curl set that I&#x27;ve ever had using no relaxer and NO HEAT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i didn&#x27;t spend the extra money on the real curl formers product.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did because I ended up using nearly 50 on my 7 year old&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> But Instead I got some cheap product (with shorter length and only 18 curlformer) worth around Rs 400.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i look like a total fewl with these in, but i don&#x27;t even care because they make my hair look so good later!</li>
            <li> They pretty much mold your hair to the exact shape of the curlers (I used a product with them, fyi).  </li>
            <li> and I was able to do a really good job, it wasn&#x27;t that difficult.</li>
            <li> Very simple and easy, very fast to catch on to.</li>
            <li> The Curlformers prices are high, but it&#x27;s an investment worth making in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A perfect way to get heatless curls that last without hair spray even with fine, thin hair that is resistant to curling!  </li>
            <li> I just used these last night and they are pretty cool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown out my relaxer, so it&#x27;s been hard to stay away from the flat iron to keep my curls, but these do a wonderful job</li>
            <li> The first package too a while to get to me, but the next package was delivered very quickly.  </li>
            <li> So when I saw a (raving) positive review of the Vakind Curlers on YouTube - I practically ran to my computer to order them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> When Naptural85 did a POSITIVE review comparing these dupes to CurlFormers, I jumped on the dupe-bandwagon.</li>
            <li> First of all the delivery was FAST.</li>
            <li> Gonna order me some more today &amp; what I did realize if you have really long hair</li>
            <li> it being more stretched</li>
            <li> Even when I cluelessly put up my lion&#x27;s mane for the first time, it went surprisingly fast.</li>
            <li> I imagine that these will be plenty long for most</li>
            <li> They work exactly like the real curl formers.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think they would really curl my hair</li>
            <li> but the ends of my hair wasn&#x27;t as crisp and straight as my roots.</li>
            <li> first the ship is really fast</li>
            <li> , pretty much i bought it, used it once, and haven&#x27;t picked it up since</li>
            <li> Okay first let me start by saying I do not normally do reviews.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter&#x27;s hair is about 14 inches long, these curlers are more like 30 inches.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing I would consider if you are interested in purchasing is buying a stronger hook from the real curlformers company.</li>
            <li> and so ended up paying more in the long run.</li>
            <li> This is so much better then the other one and worth the money 10 times over.</li>
            <li> First of all it is much longer making it easier to work with.</li>
            <li> I would much rather curl my hair this way than with a hot tool.</li>
            <li> If not better than Curlformers, then just as good.</li>
            <li> When finished wrapping I have a soft dryer bonnet that I put over the ponytail for fifteen minutes and then let cool.</li>
            <li> This uses the full length of your hair, so don&#x27;t under-estimate how long your hair is, or else, expect to pull it away from your scalp a little to make sure you&#x27;re sure to curl the ends.</li>
            <li> But once I got it down my hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li> They work wonderfully every time as long as your hair has enough time to fully dry.</li>
            <li> VERY easy to use, a little tougher to get the hang of and get the right style</li>
            <li> So far I have only used this item twice and was impressed with the results only after my second time of using them.</li>
            <li> I was familiar with the more (much) more expensive brand, and this works just as well.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can not do a rod set on my own hair, but then when I heard about these!!</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m sure I will use them more in the future.  </li>
            <li> i heard the original curl formers are soft but you get a better curl for these because they are harder.</li>
            <li> ; I really liked the results on the half of my hair that I did get done since it was almost dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily I had some pink perm rods and they worked just fine.</li>
            <li> What appears so simple and easy on you tube turned into a bit of a nightmare for me.</li>
            <li> I feel that for this tool, you need a leave-in that is lightweight and be sure that the curlformers are COMPLETELY dry.</li>
            <li> My hair came out nice every time the only downside is that is you are not careful you can pull your hair out.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come with instructions, but you can find them easy enough online.</li>
            <li> Then make sure they are totally dry when removing.</li>
            <li> very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of putting them on they are so easy and could take only 20 minutes to do!</li>
            <li> So easy and simple to install</li>
            <li> I have used mines now several times and they still stand strong to the test.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them twice since I got them because my hair is so long and its work for me to do alone, my hair texture does not lend itself to stay curly for a good while.</li>
            <li> they were very tight curls.&lt;br /&gt;-my daughter &amp;#34;loads&amp;#34; the curlers, so it&#x27;s super easy!</li>
            <li> what looks like a large crochet hook through the curler, and twist a section of your hair, then hook your hair and pull it through the curler.  </li>
            <li> Now that my order has arrived, I can certainly feel and see the difference in quality between the hooks.</li>
            <li> I also bought the large ones for my daughter who has waist length hair.</li>
            <li> The wand is a bit large but it works.</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of rods, take a large section in each side of your head and out a hair tie over it.</li>
            <li> these are too large.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day the curler are loose, but I also love that look.</li>
            <li> So I had to work with only the orange ones which was fine.</li>
            <li> pretty sure you&#x27;ve seen this in other reviews is the wand i have to admit mines</li>
            <li> curls look nice but try not to put too much hair in one curl because it wont give it as much of a tight curl.</li>
            <li> Honestly I think they are a little bit of a headache to put on (time consuming) but if your like me and want every ounce of sleep you can get then this is for you.</li>
            <li> and it even came with its own little carrying case to hold all the curlers and stick .</li>
            <li> bought for a 14 yr olds hair that is baby fine yet thick hair.. love theses curlers.</li>
            <li> Make sure the curlers aren&#x27;t to tight on your scalp creating more tension then necessary !&lt;</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, medium fine hair, but I have TONS of it - so much hair!</li>
            <li> The original ones are marked with &amp;#34;JXL&amp;#34; on their cuff, but the new, inferior ones, have no markings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are hard to get on your hair at times and not at all comfortable to sleep in however, they do make a lovely curl.</li>
            <li> They were left in overnight (not the best night&#x27;s sleep unfortunately!) and easily removed in the morning.</li>
            <li> or like I&#x27;m trying too hard to be young and cute.  :)&lt;</li>
            <li> This curler is amazing for African, coarse type hair.</li>
            <li> hair goes from curly poodle to pin straight in a couple of hours even with products; can&#x27;t blame that entirely on the curlformers, my hair plays an important role in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> these really gave my hair nice fluffy curls.</li>
            <li> For the price this is fantastic, especially through Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare them to the real curl-former&#x27;s</li>
            <li> They are fairly straight forward</li>
            <li> and you have to decide on how much hair to get through the tube.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Both of these also depend on how much hair you put in each curler.</li>
            <li> * Mesh and coil quality are low-grade and not like the real thing.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them on my niece&#x27;s thin hair and they worked great as well.</li>
            <li> They shipped fast, and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li> These really do work.  </li>
            <li> Also, the hair went straight within a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I got my package really fast</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair</li>
            <li> It took me 2 hours to get 25 into my hair, which covered my whole head.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the real curlformers.</li>
            <li> I have pin straight hair that has never held any curl</li>
            <li> The package arrived within 7 days which was much faster than some of the reviews that claimed it would take two weeks.</li>
            <li> The curl rod was very flimsy</li>
            <li> I had no hair breakage or hair being torn out, you ladies were probably trying to pull too much hair through or didn&#x27;t brush your hair..</li>
            <li> and they are going away fast</li>
            <li> It was very professional.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Also the hook was very flimsy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be purchasing a real from the Curlformers website.</li>
            <li> very reliable product, unlike my cats.</li>
            <li> So yea, and they stay the whole day</li>
            <li> This product works very well and the curls stay all day.  </li>
            <li> One package just gets her whole head done.  </li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> its not so much the tool but what you use with.</li>
            <li> While doing my set, I had a problem with this, but once I clipped off the extra plastic and used a nail filer to smooth it out, it seemed to work</li>
            <li> because i had 80 formers i didn&#x27;t really need to seperate.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t add to much hair or it won&#x27;t go through/</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are much cheaper than Curlformers</li>
            <li> The unfilled part of the coil will just be there hanging off the end curling a whole bunch of nothing.</li>
            <li> They did the job very well.</li>
            <li> Shipped REALLY fast.</li>
            <li> These were so much cheaper than buying the name brand.</li>
            <li> but it is much cheaper</li>
            <li> but once I did the process was fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of starting out with damp hair, I spritzed my hair lightly with water and set  the curls, section by section.</li>
            <li> It works just as well as the real curl formers.</li>
            <li> Made my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> these issues are acknowledged correctly, then I would absolutely recommend this off-brand product to anyone of all hair textures who want the option of creating curls without heat.</li>
            <li> With that said the cost is still MUCH cheaper than buying name brand.</li>
            <li> This also worked a lot better on soaking wet hair than it did on damp</li>
            <li> The curls are so pretty on this 16 year old&#x27;s long hair :)</li>
            <li> The wand that comes with it is trash compared to the real curlformers wand</li>
            <li> The seller was fast.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really a matter of not trying to pull to much hair at once, or tangled hair, through the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would have gone much faster</li>
            <li> In case anyone may think I was putting too much hair in at once let me assure you that was not the case.</li>
            <li> and it can be a real pain to style it at times.</li>
            <li> I think this product would work on any type of hair especiall naturally straight hair.</li>
            <li> I paid WAY TOO MUCH money for Curlformers in Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of hits when passing the hair through the curlformer, since they are spirals they tend to bounce, so just be careful :)</li>
            <li> It works just like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very springy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare them to the real deal considering</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast with both products.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out very shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This product was way better than I could have ever expected.</li>
            <li> Plus, I can&#x27;t really get the rod to come apart after putting it together.</li>
            <li> I really like these curlers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product as yet, so I can&#x27;t say much about it.</li>
            <li> The curlers were in a ziploc bag, but for the price I guess I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any of the problems I have read in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The product came in a very timely fashion.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> it worked better on wet hair for me</li>
            <li> so I have to buy the real curl formers</li>
            <li> Really helps if you watch a tutorial.  </li>
            <li> They are so much easier than using a curler set.</li>
            <li> it would fit properly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, but the wand is a bit cheap and doesn&#x27;t click together properly</li>
            <li> and my curls are almost all straight.</li>
            <li> hair that has really kinky/tight curls that resembles an afro when shrunken.</li>
            <li> I see no reason to pay 70 bucks for Curlformers when you can get these for so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> But with the price that wasnt a real issue for me.</li>
            <li> you are a woman with curly hair or even straight hair</li>
            <li> Also do not put too much hair in</li>
            <li> soo  much  </li>
            <li> but this is very easier way to get that look.</li>
            <li> It is very practical and you can do it on yourself.</li>
            <li> My straight hair now has so much bounce and body.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really even need product, just conditioner.</li>
            <li> Thanks and Be Blessed..</li>
            <li> Great versatility especially for African American hair.</li>
            <li> It is a great idea but too frustrating.</li>
            <li> Flimsy, feels as if it will break if you attempt to pull to much hair.  </li>
            <li> Quality-wise, the hook is really flimsy and I expect I&#x27;ll need to replace it soon.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to see if they would function and curl my hair anything like the real curlformers.  </li>
            <li> The curlers feel sturdy, and the hook is better than expected from the reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> They were better that I expected.  </li>
            <li> the curlformers came just like in package.the shipping was neat and the package came really fast.</li>
            <li> these one&#x27;s are really week.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t like that they were rolled together in bunches of 5.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable enough for them to sleep in.</li>
            <li> This is so like it has been advertised my hairdresser wants 2</li>
            <li> The real wands are about $3.50 at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> or I used too much hair product, but my hair would not go through the tube if my life depended on it.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> The downside is that you can&#x27;t  sleep in them very well.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted curls throughout my hair without using the curling iron.</li>
            <li> For some reason I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of Flexi rods but these were much easier.</li>
            <li> but I think they&#x27;re much shorter.</li>
            <li> If you have tried or heard of Curlformers and wanted a cheap alternative then this is definitely the product for you!</li>
            <li> They are very durable, I got everything the description provided and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because they are so much cheaper than the brands out there</li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> They really work and your hair stays for days.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the speed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use all of them, but if you think it&#x27;s necessary, feel free to buy two.</li>
            <li> - maybe some product would help, too, though water really helps.</li>
            <li> My sister has the real curlformers.</li>
            <li> Would have given 4 stars had the hook not broken.</li>
            <li> I also really like the speed.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I recommend this as a reasonable alternative for Curlformers.</li>
            <li> At $15, this compares very favorably with the brand name version.</li>
            <li> This is straight up curly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They cost as much as my starter kit of 6, so I went for it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I do love that I can use it with my hair wet.</li>
            <li> This makes sleeping soo much easier.</li>
            <li> These work very well in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Daughters whole cheerleading team loves them.</li>
            <li> The curlformers themselves are very well made.</li>
            <li> Save your money on this one and get twice as much.</li>
            <li> fast and does not damage your hair.</li>
            <li> but I expected way more defined curls, plus my hair matted after the day with this style.</li>
            <li> I actually did mine on Day 3 hair and just used a water bottle to spritz the sections lightly</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference between the hook provided in the kit and the curlformer hook.  </li>
            <li> If you are struggling, you are trying to get too much hair in the curler.  </li>
            <li> I did start to get one when I was tugging on the crown of my hair, but that was because I was cramming too much hair in because I was losing patience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These curled my hair very well.</li>
            <li> Package came relatively fast compared to where it was coming from.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really get to use them.</li>
            <li> The curlers are great, but one if the tools were broken in one of my packages when I received it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spent most of my morning trying to put these on ... after a while</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;m just going to give up because my head hurt so much from pulling out so much hair</li>
            <li> After about 5 hours of having it on my head hurt so much</li>
            <li> and they work really well.  </li>
            <li> and they work very well.  </li>
            <li> Then I use a light hairspray after and the curls stay in all day and even into the next day.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the name-brand, and they work very well.  </li>
            <li> But there are smaller curlers available.</li>
            <li> It took me about 1.5 hours to do my whole head.</li>
            <li> I really like using these.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Also, the hook doesn&#x27;t stay clicked together very well</li>
            <li> I did my whole head with one pack.  </li>
            <li> It wouldnt have been so much trial and error.</li>
            <li> They work and are priced very well</li>
            <li> Does not hurt the scalp as much and easier to sleep in.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use them much.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone who wants no heat curls.</li>
            <li> Except they really really cause soreness and pain to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if they really work or stay in&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only worn these once they are not as comfortable as i thought they would be</li>
            <li> but I brought the dupe not the real thing</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into hair typing, my curl pattern ranges from about 3C - 4b and in some places it doesn&#x27;t really curl at all</li>
            <li> I received it fast too.</li>
            <li> Because Much Of My Hair Is Still Relaxed.</li>
            <li> and they are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Too much hair</li>
            <li> Oh I had such great hopes for these...but not only are they too short (about 4&amp;#34</li>
            <li> No matter how much gunk, time, or cursing I used, these just wouldn&#x27;t produce anything resembling spiral curls in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used em twice now so far and both times had complete strangers actually stopping me to compliment me on my hair and wanting to know what I had used to get such beautiful curls! &#x3D;</li>
            <li> My curls were a tad frizzy, so next time I&#x27;ll try a slightly different approach and see what kind of difference</li>
            <li> I have a cowlick on the back of my head near the top so from the side</li>
            <li> in  the  near  future :)</li>
            <li> I have natural, kinky hair and these still do a great job on my thick</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked the way my hair looked the next day.</li>
            <li> I just received these today &amp; wow!!!</li>
            <li> However, after using the Curlformers for so long, many of them are being to kind of fall apart (the openings get loose and will slide around the hair, especially when damp), so I needed to replace some of them.</li>
            <li> I tried to use more curlers with less hair in them, and that seemed to work pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;These can hurt your head a bit.</li>
            <li> the technique is pretty simple to master and goes fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I have watched various tutorials on curlformers and the &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; on YouTube, and the general consensus seemed to be that the off brand was just as good if not better than the original!</li>
            <li> If you or your child has a sensitive scalp or issues with their hair being pulled, this is probably not the right product for you.</li>
            <li> Loved them and the curls last longer than any other thing we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> was a great addition to my process after I filled down some of the hard plastic deformities.</li>
            <li> After working with these formers for a few minutes it became very easy and fast to put in and take out.  </li>
            <li> I will NOT buy the expensive curlformers when these are just as good!</li>
            <li> I was glad I got two from the other</li>
            <li> I love the results, they form such pretty curls and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> I am unsure why anyone would pay more for other sets.</li>
            <li> i am so excited to try different style of my hair again...</li>
            <li> Also, take your time placing your hair in the loop and if I was you, possibly looking in a mirror for the first few maybe a good suggestion.</li>
            <li> Anyways, the plastic from the other ones is softer and more manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These look and work exactly like my Curlformers, maybe a little better.</li>
            <li> They arrived rolled on top of each other and had to be separated.</li>
            <li> I normally have wavy hair and love that I can now get it curly without having to wakeup extra early.</li>
            <li> I also took the advice of the other reviewers and bought a Curlformer hook as many said that worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to work with at first,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars, because I think the curl formers themselves are probably fine, especially for the price, but now I have to order a new plastic tool from another company.  </li>
            <li> The curlers are very long, longer than my hair (hair is mid back length), which is great because I won&#x27;t have to replace as my hair grows.</li>
            <li> They were easy to install after watching a video on YouTube , it&#x27;s just time consuming &amp; for my 4b hair to dry</li>
            <li> then i came across a youtuber by the name of Napturals (or something) and she did a comparison between these and the more expensive kind and her results from these were actually better than the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> awesome, not sure what I would be missing by ordering the off brand</li>
            <li> They make it look easy, and be forewarned that your first few will be a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold curl long without a holding product: This product produces GORGEOUS curls, but if you want them to last long, make sure to apply a holding product on the hair prior to installing the ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No biggy, my thick haired sistas just add a piece of duck tape to the middle works beautifully.</li>
            <li> The second time around after using a regular light moisturizer my curls were bouncy and had a shine yet didn’t last more than two day.</li>
            <li> It was hard to pull the hair through, but the results were very cute.  </li>
            <li> Unless you want to take the extra time to do this every day, I would recommend special occasions and when you want to have a girly spa type night.  </li>
            <li> Plus Curls always look extra special.</li>
            <li> By my third curlformer set (which is in my hair right now!), I am sliding these curlers on like a pro.</li>
            <li> These worked pretty good, although it is a little time consuming if you have a lot of long hair like I do.  </li>
            <li> I used a tiny bit of shampoo and warm water to soak and rinse them and then let them air dry overnight - voila - smell solved.  </li>
            <li> I like how it kind of forces you to use only a limited amount of hair</li>
            <li> This product gave me, an amateur, AMAZING curls.</li>
            <li> so I can have a head full of curls that last for the week!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure that they may not have the same issue, but I do know that many reviewers I&#x27;ve watched using them have had their curlers for 2 or 3 years and have never made the complaint about &amp;#34;tearing&amp;#34; that this product is getting.</li>
            <li> First, watch a YouTube video to get the &#x27;pumping&#x27; action needed to place these.</li>
            <li> But the are a pain to sleep on, next time I&#x27;m going under the dryer set on cool.</li>
            <li> The curls looked okay in the morning, but they were not worth the time, money, or lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> It took a couple times to get the hang of it but overall a cool invention.</li>
            <li> Found on the net by tidal full name.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried the Curlformers without the dryer and the curl last almost a full day.</li>
            <li> Easy enough for my 5 year old to use on her older sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the curls last all day, even after a full day of competing.</li>
            <li> I used these for my first time setting my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Left my hair full and curly.  </li>
            <li> Worked out pretty well for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I never applied any hair spray or gel and the curls stayed up and nice for 4 days: they might have stayed longer but I usually wash my hair ever 2 - 3 days so 4 was pushing it for me.</li>
            <li> Takes a fair bit of work to relax my hair back down to something normal looking</li>
            <li> my hair length medium-long natural no perm and I whip these curlers thru my wet mosse hair quickly!!</li>
            <li> The product came within the expected time frame (10-17 business days) and was clean and ready to use!</li>
            <li> The issue with these is the stick, it does not remain together, I&#x27;d have to glue it to be able to use it, or may have to purchase a stick that is intact so that when I pull down the hair it does not break.</li>
            <li> I assume this will go down in time once I have done this more than once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to keep the curls down for 2 days and in an updo for another 2 days.</li>
            <li> Everyone says to go from the bottom up, I learned to go from the top down</li>
            <li> Instead of $69.00 I paid a much lower price &amp; got the same exact product!  </li>
            <li> Pro: worked very well, gave me lovely spriral curls with little work.</li>
            <li> my new go to item for 2014 protective styles!</li>
            <li> I think this is my new favourite hair tool!</li>
            <li> They also give off a smell (like burned tyres) which could indicate the use of cheap (and probably illegal) plastics (that is also probably why they are so cheap in comparison with the original Curlformers).</li>
            <li> I will try to contact the seller to get a new one, but don&#x27;t hold out much hope for that to happen.</li>
            <li> Great job, lasts long, works on short and long hair!!</li>
            <li> Although these could technically fit all of my waist-length hair into them, I needed a LOT to compensate for the thickness which took a very long time.</li>
            <li> ok, so I heard and read all good and bad things...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learnt that ensuring that the hair is wet helps the hair pull through easily without breakage.</li>
            <li> SO..to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my deteriorating issue...I&#x27;ll just buy more so that they will have less stress per roller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got these at Amazon for more than half the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I try to put more hair in the curler to get less curly sue curls and it won&#x27;t allow it</li>
            <li> I do them half way sometimes and love that look as wel as the curled from root to tip.</li>
            <li> so I saved more than half the price.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry with just a light mist when I put them in</li>
            <li> My 3 star rating is less about the product and more for the results...</li>
            <li> It could have taken less if the wand behaved better...</li>
            <li> As an AA with natural hair, stretching my hair is important and these generic curlformers did the trick although they hurt to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with attempting to get nice spiral curls with my natural texture (while attempting to avoid harsh heating elements like curling irons and blow dryers).</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I had ordered an additional smaller set of curl formers which came with the complete tool.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have enough setting spray on your hair so the curls will last.</li>
            <li> Every review I have read says these actually work BETTER than curlformers, so that&#x27;s a big thing considering the price difference.</li>
            <li> hard to use, and after I was able to use...they hurt!</li>
            <li> thing I would recommend, however, is that you purchase an actual Curlformer hook from the name-brand Hair Flair because the hook that I received with these Vankind magic leverage ones got caught on my hair because of rogue remnants of plastic left over from the mold.</li>
            <li> I leave em in for about 30-45 minutes while I eat breakfast and finish getting ready and then use my hair dryer again over the curlformers to make sure my hair has completely dried in them before taking them out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely order more because when I initially put them in, I ran out!</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair and my curls same out sleek and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s cheap, but I&#x27;m inclined to believe that any broken hooks were user error.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I know I would not be able to sleep in them, but that is me, it may be different for someone else.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this over the brand, you get more for your money here and results are the same</li>
            <li> I guess the main advantage is the variety you&#x27;ll get by using these.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is poker straight and it will not hold a curl with a curling iron for more than a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I have even recurled prior to washing by dampening the hair, adding a tiny bit more styling product, and sliding on the curlformers.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is poker straight and it will not hold a curl with a curling iron for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t pay an extra $40 for the same thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my problems were the result of this particular maker or if it is the nature of this type of curler to invite breakage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for the more expensive ones......</li>
            <li> decent and work well, but the company sent two hooks instead of the extension for the hook.  </li>
            <li> The curlers are fine but the wand they came with was cheap and didn&#x27;t attach to each other properly therefore cannot us them until I&#x27;m send a new wand.</li>
            <li> I have the original curlformers and at about 60 bucks back when i bought them at my local sallys, these curlers are a steal because they are just as good if not better than curlformers.</li>
            <li> They are not the soft mesh plastic like the original curl former brand; these guys are hard (but it makes for a nice straight curl)</li>
            <li> My first time took me nearly 2 hours to complete my whole head</li>
            <li> Both hair curlers will definitely accomplish the same thing, which is placing your hair in a good, heat-free stretched state with a lot of highly defined curls.  </li>
            <li> Cheap looking product (you get what you pay for) and the styling wand snapped in half the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only will I most likely order a few more in this size, but I am very interested in the bigger barrel curls size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tightly curled type 4 b-c hair and this gets it smooth and curly with no heat!</li>
            <li> These curlers gave her tight spirals that lasted more than a day.  </li>
            <li> These curlers gave her tight spirals that lasted more than a day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> highly recommend watching a video on YouTube or on the sally&#x27;s website so you can see how it&#x27;s supposed to be done.</li>
            <li> Plus curlformers sells their replacements too high (15 dollars for a pack of 6...outrageous).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to buy the HairFlair hook, since it&#x27;s easier to pass through the curlformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, you can audio do permanent washing with these there is a curlformer tutorial on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about Curlformers for some time now but refused to pay the high price for them.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> If you dont set a curl right on a flexirod, it may not dry correctly.</li>
            <li> I use these every other week, as a3c natural who just hit phase 2 length, and I use mousse for my set and LOVE these with all of my heart.</li>
            <li> I have tried curling irons, tried to flat iron curl, brush curlers, bendy curling rods, hot, overnight, perms, you name it, but these are the first product I can do all by myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily I live literally 4 minutes from Sally&#x27;s and was able to replace it for less than $5.</li>
            <li> This can be overcome by putting the top of the curler a little farther out from the root, but if the curlers were longer, it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> only difference between these and curlformers official brand is the ends are a slick rubber (hurts slighty more then the original).</li>
            <li> I like the hook a little more because my hair is held in place while inserting curlers.</li>
            <li> The curls were adorable on my little girl, but it takes some practice.</li>
            <li> I gave up and substituted another style till I have a little more patience.</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars, but I think the wand could be a little better.</li>
            <li> They are great for less than half the cost of curlformers.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t hard, its just nice to see it.</li>
            <li> If you decide to sleep in them they will be kind of hard</li>
            <li> They were kind of hard to put in and they hurt to sleep on.</li>
            <li> These are too hard for one person to use on their own hair.</li>
            <li> My curls looked nice, but at the expense of ripped hairs when threading the hair through the hard plastic curlers.</li>
            <li> If you go directly to their site you&#x27;ll see just how much of a deal this is, but I&#x27;m fallin in love with these little things.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my little sister&#x27;s Christmas present and they were on time, worked the same and a great value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really curly, though, so she usually will wear a high ponytail for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> I think I need to buy more because my hair is very thick and the curl definition is better on smaller sections.</li>
            <li> I would suggest having wet hair, and plan on sleeping on them (not so comfortable, but you get used to it over time).  </li>
            <li> Depending on whether my hair is straight or in its natural state I can use all 80 of the  curlers (curlformers+the vakind)</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;brand-name&amp;#34; curlers are so expensive, so these &amp;#34;knock-offs&amp;#34; are a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I bought them to use for my 8 year old daughter who always wants her hair curly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going through the whole hair transition from relaxed to natural</li>
            <li> I bought these because I really wanted to try the CurlFormers on my natural hair but did not want to pay $70 for them.</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to the expensive curlformers.</li>
            <li> miss the huge packs of pink foam rollers we use to get in the store</li>
            <li> Saw these on Amazon and they are just the same as the more expensive kind.</li>
            <li> The Curl Formers brand are normally $50.00 to $60.00 dollars.</li>
            <li> I do wish there were just a few more because my hair is so dense.</li>
            <li> Not a negative</li>
            <li> I tried these last night so this is a fresh review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> &amp; I needed a few more</li>
            <li> is use small strands because if it&#x27;s too much (you&#x27;ll have to decide based on the thickness of your hair) it&#x27;ll get stuck. :-)  </li>
            <li> but thats normal for my hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to do my entire head (I have long hair)</li>
            <li> They are not comfortable at all. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with very coarse hair and they make my hair nice and curly.</li>
            <li> The plug-in bottom and top of the wand do not fit together in a flush manner but it will hold up and do the job.</li>
            <li> We tested it out a few days ago and the curls we adorable.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length frizzy, wavy, curly hair under normal circumstances that has a mind of</li>
            <li> But, the results were well worth the extra annoyance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth getting used to for the results - especially for the bargain price.  </li>
            <li> If the hair is a little long and the ends stick out, you can just quickly curl those tips with a curling iron before or after removing the magic curlers.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to develop the technique, and it&#x27;s easy to pull the hair when you&#x27;re pulling it through the curlers if you try to get too much hair at one time.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to buy if you are looking for a new way to do heatless curls.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews said they had problems with the hook but the one that came in ours works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Going off other reviews, I bought an additional Curlformer wand, but the one that came with theses seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li> and they took 5 hours to completely air dry for perfectly smooth ringlets or</li>
            <li> I only use a leave in conditioner before putting them in, then I let it air dry for 4-6 hours or more if I&#x27;m not going any where.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very tightly coiled but these made my hair very smooth and elongated.</li>
            <li> I still love the results gives me flat iron like curls except they feel so soft and last for 2-3 days!</li>
            <li> but they definitely do the job if you do them right.</li>
            <li> This only gets 4 stars because they are HELL to sleep on and a I had a bit of a learning curve to get them on right.  </li>
            <li> Pinks go on the right side and orange go on the left side of your head.</li>
            <li> I watched a billion youtube videos before I could finally get it right</li>
            <li> , I am actually sitting with them in my hair right now.</li>
            <li> Okay due to the fact that my hair is long and that I have a lot of it, it took a little more time than I thought it would to get all the curlers in my hair but not too much longer.</li>
            <li> These curlers work fine, but they are a hassle to put in; I had some problems with my hair getting tangled in the curlers, especially when curling the back.</li>
            <li> The Vakind curlers stay in place and easy to take down.</li>
            <li> first package came with just the bottom half of the hook but the seller responded quickly and sent me a new hook.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The material is a much harder plastic than the original Curlformers</li>
            <li> I liked the length (again a little longer than the Curlformers), which meant that my entire length of the curl was in the curler - versus the Curlformers which did not fully cover the ends of my longer hair (bra strap length).  </li>
            <li> Nice little generic zip lock bag to store them.</li>
            <li> There is no way to contact seller and request new wand.  </li>
            <li> I apply them to newly washed hair and leave them in over night.</li>
            <li> i need a new stick where can i get one</li>
            <li> The shea moisture curling souffle (aka gel) did leave a bit of a residue but after the new day it goes away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this another go on New Years Eve.</li>
            <li> Guess I have to order a new hook just to use the things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll follow up with an updated review when I receive my new tool.</li>
            <li> Got this product wanting to copy Naptural 85&#x27;s new twist out method.</li>
            <li> Although, if you are new to using these, it would be helpful to look up videos before trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After burning myself repeatedly with the new curling irons that don&#x27;t have the clamp on them, I decided to give Curlformers a go.  </li>
            <li> and I had no problems on my first try, and have them back in my hair right now for a second go.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use, and they&#x27;re less of a pain to sleep in than rollers.</li>
            <li> It would be a good product if I had received the entire hook, it only came with the bottom half.  </li>
            <li> I need to use the curlers a few more times to learn how to use them on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews that stated you need to use small sections, should smooth the hair out first, watch youtube videos...</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are pretty long, much longer than their hair.</li>
            <li> I just got my Curler Magic curlers yesterday - 10 days earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> I watched quite a few Youtube tutorials for pointers, which is helpful, but actual practice on your own head, is how you learn what works for you.  </li>
            <li> I think I would have been better with extra wide.  </li>
            <li> I think I would have been better with extra wide.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, the curlers dry relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> and i loved the idea, but it appears the only way to get bounce in my hair is to braid it wet, let it dry, and poof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is passed her butt and curly at the ends but not so much at the top because it is so thick we used these</li>
            <li> They were a little teadious to use at first, but I quickly got the hang of how to put them in.</li>
            <li> On my kinky-Curly African American hair my curls came out smooth and soft and they held with no heat!</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t long enough for my 22 inch length hair, so please order the longer ones if you have really long hair, but I really love these!</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair, the short layers are to my shoulders and the long layers are down to my lower back, it is semi fine, and straight, and very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> These arrived maybe one week after ordering, much faster than I expected and were in great condition with no funny chemical smell I read about from other reviews.</li>
            <li> The stick that comes with the package isnt strong enough if you have long or course hair.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use if you tape the hook together tightly.  </li>
            <li> though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth sending back (since now they are at a higher price) or fixing myself with super glue... or just pointing the busted tips down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also slept in them and they are pretty comfy, relatively speaking.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the Curlformers, but from what I see, they look like the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> These are exactly the same as the curl formers that are sold in beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> , these are EXACTLY the same.</li>
            <li> Also, there is a sufficient number of the curl formers and they are WAY cheaper than you can get them at Sally&#x27;s, and it&#x27;s exactly the same product.</li>
            <li> these are the exact same thing I made a how to on instagram @tina_thegreat</li>
            <li> And in my case, make sure the sections aren&#x27;t too small</li>
            <li> First, the curlers constantly slipped off the hook.</li>
            <li> but the are so soft and feminine!</li>
            <li> I was willing to pay extra to get it here faster.</li>
            <li> It was actually quite pretty.</li>
            <li> These work exactly the same.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I only used 39 out of 40.</li>
            <li> They should make some that would hold a regular hot roller amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used them on natural thick long hair, relaxed fine short hair and super excited about the results.</li>
            <li> Be sure to put a small amount of product on your hair so that it does not get frizzy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I could handle sleeping in them because they are pretty bulky especially if you have a lot of hair</li>
            <li> This version is exactly the same and works just as well</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nearly a $50 difference!</li>
            <li> My curls were so bouncy, and pretty that I was taking selfie&#x27;s and finally realized it was 3 a.m!  </li>
            <li> Literally the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> and I had to put a second curler after the first for the longer sections.</li>
            <li> AKA the first time I tried them, I woke up in the middle of the night and pulled them all out of my head</li>
            <li> I have 1.5 year old dreadlocks and these work!  </li>
            <li> I bought my first set of generic curlformers in May.</li>
            <li> The first set had &amp;#34;JXL&amp;#34; imprinted on the ends and the second set didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I did purchase the real ones from Sally&#x27;s and from amazon and compared and you can barely tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I got these for my 14 year old daughter and she loves them!</li>
            <li> The process is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> Be warned - they do not come with any instructions at all - but there are several youtube videos with demos (that is how I found out about them in the first place).  </li>
            <li> (all of whom have medium to long hair and are in elementary school).</li>
            <li> Other than the damaged ones,  these were worth the price!</li>
            <li> Does the same as the higher priced ones.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of reviews on these versus curl formers and they looked the exact same</li>
            <li> Exactly like the actual Curl formers but a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> The curl formers are not bad at all and was as expected.  </li>
            <li> since my hair is fine, the curls didnt last long (about 2 days)</li>
            <li> We let it air dry for about 3 hours and then easily slid them out of her (extra tender head, might I add!)</li>
            <li> I woke up twice to change positions and reposition the curlformers so that I could lay my head down comfortably.</li>
            <li> but I made them work &amp; my hair is very thick , but overall I love them &amp; will be ordering more at a later date.</li>
            <li> The only down side is she didn&#x27;t think they were very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Took me a few tries to get it right, but I love the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took multiple tries to put in each of the first 4 curlers, but I quickly got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> yet.&lt;br /&gt;I received a ton of compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve started using them, they work much better than conventional curlers and my curls last days.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> No curlers have broken yet, although the wand can be a tricky to disassemble when finished especially since I apply oil to my hair sometimes my fingers slip, but other than that its great!</li>
            <li> These should be the right length for hair as long as mid-back.  </li>
            <li> The curls are fantastic and take a lot less time and effort than the heated curling iron.</li>
            <li> great product, they&#x27;re actually really big and long, maybe too long for my hair, but id rather get them bigger than i need instead of smaller.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair you need patience and I think this is better with damp slightly wet hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the rods are super flimsy but you do have to be careful.</li>
            <li> You have to work carefully to avoid ripping any hair out, but I got the hang of it quickly.  </li>
            <li> The one that comes with this set is kind of weak for kinky textured hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly thrifty, so I had a hard time justifying another kit - or even a single package of Curlformers at the exorbitant price of 14.00 per 10 pack at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Just ok I had a hard time getting them on my hair first of all, a couple of the bands cracked on the top part of the ringlets poor quality I suppose and they are not for sleeping in</li>
            <li> My curls were rock solid tight, didn’t move but they looked extra cute!</li>
            <li> At most they turn into loose curls and stay for a half a day, after which they turn into more like a messy wave.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest these for anyone wanting some curls without the major damage to your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair reaches to the top of my bra strap but only fills up half way on the curlers.</li>
            <li> LOL...snapped mine in half 2nd time out, so I&#x27;m buying a couple more.</li>
            <li> Curls take better and last longer if you have slightly damp hair, either water or a setting</li>
            <li> Less expensive and gave me excellent curls.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was with the hook itself, they are not as strong as I would have expected</li>
            <li> The hook is very hard to put together, I had to take my pocket knife and kind of carve it that way</li>
            <li> Then, I realized that by putting the hook just on the last 3 inches of my dreads and pulling the tube up to the root (or however far up I want), pulling the dread through last, it was quick and painless.  </li>
            <li> On must avoid creating large sections of hair to ensure there is no hair outside of hook&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> too large for short hair lengths.</li>
            <li> I will say that if you have very long hair, as I do (to my lower back), you may find that the ends of your hair don&#x27;t fit at the very longest part of your hair, but the name brand are the same.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I won&#x27;t be duped by the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll buy the real thing and tell everyone else to do the same.</li>
            <li> , I did not have any frizz (and I am not exaggerating when I say that my hair dried very smooth), and I plan to use them on my younger sister/niece/cousins, etc.</li>
            <li> but they are a little cheap looking</li>
            <li> I put a little leave in conditioner in my hair to smooth it a bit and never got my hair snagged.</li>
            <li> The process of getting hair into the curliformer requires the curliformer hook to pull your hair through the curler which for me has been proven to be pretty harsh on my hair and even showed significant hair damage after only having used the curlers twice.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length natural kinky hair and these tame the frizz and are fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li> There was some slight tugging, but after you become familiar with how to use the curlers, you learn how to avoid it.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I have a hard time pulling my daughter&#x27;s hair through it, but mostly have the knack now.  </li>
            <li> Have tried every other type of roller, I think, and nothing else has ever worked as well and as quickly.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old girl has long very straight hair.  </li>
            <li> All that&#x27;s left is to run my fingers through my hair a couple of times to separate the curls a little bit and get more of a natural look</li>
            <li> However, these curlers are thicker than the actual curlforers which means that your hair will take significantly longer to dry.  </li>
            <li> The advertisement clearly says a roller pack of 40 in the title.</li>
            <li> assemble the hook (comes in two pieces as it&#x27;s long), push it hook end first though a tube, put a bit of hair in the hook near your scalp/roots, hold the end of the tube closest to your scalp in place as you pull out the hook and your hair will go inside.</li>
            <li> U have to be careful with how much hair you use because if you use to much it will snag and it WILL hurt.</li>
            <li> I have to say these are the same as the real Curlformers at the fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> 4c natural hair.</li>
            <li> Have to return completely.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair.  </li>
            <li> These counterfeit curlformers are a far inferior product than Curlformers</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and strait at the roots.</li>
            <li> if trying to go natural curlformeres are the way to go.</li>
            <li> I got this product from the House Sweety seller fairly early, 2 days after the earliest arrival date.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> The price is a real deal, totally recommended!</li>
            <li> I am a natural with 4C hair</li>
            <li> I hope I can find longer and winder ones to hold my waiste length natural 4a/b hair.</li>
            <li> My curls where soft and bouncy</li>
            <li> Ive been natural for five years.</li>
            <li> You will defintely need to purchase two packs and there are not nearly enough for one whole head.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair about 12&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have 4c natural hair</li>
            <li> They were so soft.  </li>
            <li> As a natural curly girl...</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product, but I&#x27;ve had some issues with my hair snagging through the curl former (especially when wet).</li>
            <li> This took me two hours to complete because there werent instructions.</li>
            <li> Even after my whole head was done, I still had rollers left.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair (3b/3c)</li>
            <li> The curlers were firm, but gave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It definitely beats the 70 bucks that the real curl formers cost.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 8 year old daughter because she wanted to have spiral curls.</li>
            <li> gives my hair life when I want some curls for my 4c natural hair.</li>
            <li> just natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried them 6 times.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using these for my pre-teen daughter for cheer, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for frequent use.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> and I have been natural for 12 years.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE</li>
            <li> I have not used the Hair Flair Curlformers, but I don&#x27;t think I will need to seeing as how Alicia James (a YouTube Natural hair community guru) did a side-by-side comparison of the $70 product and the $18 product, both of which work identically to another.</li>
            <li> I would recommend a soft bonnet dryer for these as sleeping on them will not be happening again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and my set lasts me about 4 days before I have to put it up in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> The second one I had too much hair</li>
            <li> A gift for my 10 year old niece and had difficulty figuring out how to use.</li>
            <li> This vakind hair curler worked well for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> If you have natural hair this will work for you.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for my natural transaction hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 7yrs, my texture is 4c (coily ziggly).</li>
            <li> My hair is natural  </li>
            <li> i used a soft bonnet dryer before i went to bed.</li>
            <li> My hair is 100% natural with a hair type of 3b/3c.</li>
            <li> I really want some that results in bigger (looser) curls</li>
            <li> I use the rods to curl my hair as well as my 71/2 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I am 3 years natural.</li>
            <li> My hair came out soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Worked well on natural hair.</li>
            <li> I am Hispanic and was looking for a way to get natural spiral looking curls without applying heat.</li>
            <li> so I suggest doing them early in the morning then taking them out before bed.</li>
            <li> (I prefer air drying to avoid heat on my natural hair)&lt;br /&gt;6.)</li>
            <li> They work so well for my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t complete as far as the hook.</li>
            <li> It has worked for her hair (natural - no relaxers), and my daughter&#x27;s as well.</li>
            <li> Works on natural hair.</li>
            <li> The package wasn&#x27;t complete, How does that happen?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in college and my hair is natural (struggle).</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and the end results are</li>
            <li> Too much money for the same product, just without the name.</li>
            <li> bought 2 sets, one for me and one for my 3 year old daughter</li>
            <li> I have a natural Afro and guess what ...</li>
            <li> My hair came out looking like i had a professional rollers et under a dryer.</li>
            <li> Once I did separate them it was pretty obvious that the second set was of a much lesser quality than the first.</li>
            <li> The product does not come with instructions but after watching a YouTube video on how to use, it was really quite simple.</li>
            <li> and my hair frequently got tangled in the hook.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and brought these after seeing them used in some Youtube videos.</li>
            <li> complete torture.</li>
            <li> This is comparable to the real magenta and yellow curlformers.</li>
            <li> I lightly sprayed my hair with water and put a few curlers in.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use on my young daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with a lot of medium weight hair that is naturally wavy and layered -length</li>
            <li> I speed up the process a bit with a soft bonnet attachment to my hand held dryer.</li>
            <li> but I contacted the company and it was fixed immediately</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with the quality of these curlers.</li>
            <li> I also have a hooded (soft) dryer so that speeds up the drying process.</li>
            <li> I used the Jane Carter setting and wrap as followed by a Youtuber because I did decide to go natural</li>
            <li> It is so much cheaper than the Curlformers and does the same thing!  </li>
            <li> They are soft, bouncy with no frizz.</li>
            <li> AM TRANSITIONING FROM RELAXED TO NATURAL HAIR AND AM AVOIDING HEAT AT ALL COSTS</li>
            <li> It has a natural wave to it</li>
            <li> If I want to get a headache to avoid going to an event, I just think about the old school days when you pulled highlights through one of those caps with a hook.  </li>
            <li> When taking them out, stretch the curler out completely and squeeze at the mouth.  </li>
            <li> They reminded me of Phoebe from friends and they were soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> When taking them out, stretch the curler out completely and squeeze at the mouth.  </li>
            <li> They reminded me of Phoebe from friends and they were soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> The results were soft flowy ringlets.</li>
            <li> I prefer a tighter curl that will drop to ringlets once it is old.</li>
            <li> In total, I needed about 55-60 curlers for my whole head.</li>
            <li> After receiving it I completely understand why.</li>
            <li> Mines would not close completely so it kept falling off</li>
            <li> so I recommend doing it early so you can take it out before bed.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4b hair</li>
            <li> However after a night with these in my hair, I notched how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li> Kept her busy.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4 type hair.</li>
            <li> These curl former&#x27;s really work</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet had a problem with the wand breaking and have used it 3 times so far.  </li>
            <li> I know natural divas out there</li>
            <li> I used put the curlers on using nothing but leave-in conditioner and hair oil directly after washing and without drying.</li>
            <li> I Am Transitioning From Relaxed Hair To Natural,</li>
            <li> Worked awesomely on my natural (4c) hair.</li>
            <li> Curls last a long time and look pretty even after a few days maybe even more depending on your preference and hair type.</li>
            <li> I tested them out on my 5 year old daughter who has naturally soft and curly hair</li>
            <li> So Glad I order these and the green and blue pack</li>
            <li> You have to make sure the pieces you thread on are not too thick otherwise they won&#x27;t pull through.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how the outrageously expensive ones could be significantly superior to these, because I thought these  worked</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> First off,I have long and thick hard to hold a curl hair, the roller length said 50-51 inches, my hair length is 46in and it tends to leave a good inch off!</li>
            <li> These are great, work exactly like curlformers and are much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I would say that you need to watch videos on how to put these in, take your time the first time (there is a learning curve) and let them dry completely.</li>
            <li> But other than that I&#x27;m glad I found this brand and didn&#x27;t have to buy the ones that were more expensive.</li>
            <li> My package came right as expected</li>
            <li> The result was as I had hoped, pretty curls- a little more tangled than I had expected but they worked well enough.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t find them easy to use and they usually damage my hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair is straight and flat within an hour.</li>
            <li> My hair does not respond to heat curls very well, and often will be flat by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are well worth the price</li>
            <li> Okay for a pack of the Extra Long and Wide, your looking at $15 a pack if your not a member, wth?</li>
            <li> fun but remember to be careful!</li>
            <li> I did purchase a curlformer hook separate due to having read many reviews that were not positive about the hook that comes with the formers.</li>
            <li> But that is fine, because I am aiming for about that length in the very back down the road, hopefully in about 2 years or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pacific express&#x27;s was perfect and high quality while the  other was bad quality and smelled.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical on this off brand, but I&#x27;m glad I went for it.</li>
            <li> These are a decent alternative to paying the extra money for curlformers.  </li>
            <li> My main recommendation is to BUY EXTRA HOOKS!</li>
            <li> Delivery was decent it didn&#x27;t turn out to be several weeks to show up at the door.</li>
            <li> Play with products such as different types of gels or setting lotions and test them out in your hair first.</li>
            <li> My sister ordered the exact same curlers 2 weeks before me from a different vendor in California, and she still hasn&#x27;t received hers...</li>
            <li> I ordered a second set a month later and they are nothing like the first set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give four stars to the first and two to the second, simply because I know about the difference.</li>
            <li> The Curlformers long and narrow worked much much better for me.</li>
            <li> In fact, to get a more defined curl, you&#x27;ll want to make the curls as small as possible.</li>
            <li> They are hard, feel cheap, both of which I could live with.</li>
            <li> With other curlers, I try to just start with damp, because wet would never dry, but with these, they keep the strand being curled totally separate and open to air, so it dries amazingly quickly, I think (probably only a couple hours - faster, with a blow drier, I&#x27;m sure).</li>
            <li> Why pay the high price for the same results!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend purchasing the actual curlformer hook for about $4 though.</li>
            <li> But i simply rubber band all the curlers into a high ponytail to keep them out my way while I sleep.</li>
            <li> They have fine thick bone straight hair and no heat is the only way their hair will hold curl.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use the items if you don&#x27;t have the hook, so I haven&#x27;t been able to try out the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 4/23/14 - Seller contacted me for feedback and when I mentioned the broken hook, they immediately sent me a new one at no charge.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to all my natural sistas!!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave four stars is because a few of these were easily punctured with the stick, creating a hole.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t fall out that I end up with super tight curls and some still fall out.  </li>
            <li> Very east to use and didn&#x27;t take long to be delievered.</li>
            <li> ( I have medium straight long hair) not just talking</li>
            <li> However not many curlers out  there that you can comfortably sleep in.  </li>
            <li> The real ones are 22 inches long.</li>
            <li> They stay on securely (unlike ordinary rollers).  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what she expected, and she loves them.  </li>
            <li> Worked exactly like i expected.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I expected when ordered.  </li>
            <li> They did calm down over night, but that is what I wanted them to do...</li>
            <li> I have really thick long board straight hair and had pretty much given up on ever getting it to curl even a little bit after wasting literally hundreds of dollars over the last 20 years on every single kind of curlers, curling products, &amp; curling irons that is/</li>
            <li> I have short, fine, very tightly curled natural hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I came across a few posters who raved about these little amazing no heat spiral rollers.</li>
            <li> I expected the formers to be a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Put them in with slightly damp hair and let sit for an hour or two and stayed nice tight, defined bouncy curls for 2 days with no product!</li>
            <li> The only hard part is finding a comfortable spot to sleep on them!  </li>
            <li> Apparently, the super tight grip on the end worked with my tossing and turning to &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They were all the same size , in brand new condition</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pick out a new storage container to keep them in because one of the bags split open during transit , all in all.</li>
            <li> and we both live in the same city.  </li>
            <li> Putting them in was very fast compared to other curlers.  </li>
            <li> They are very versatile- on dry hair for an hour</li>
            <li> very breathable, you can use about 20-30 mins of heat to set them, or let them air dry overnight but its a bitch to sleep on them.</li>
            <li> After waiting a couple of hours for my hair to dry I removed the curlers (the easiest part of the whole thing).  </li>
            <li> I let them air dry while I got dressed and ready to go out for the night.</li>
            <li> You can also blow dry for fast results.</li>
            <li> Oh and the black hook that comes with detaches in the middle to make for easy storing, but the darn thing kept detaching in the middle of pulling my curl through!</li>
            <li> The key to not having breakage is to NOT try to thread TOO much hair into one Former.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommended spending the extra couple of bucks and getting the real rod.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on these I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give these a try especially since they didnt look any different than the real curlformers.</li>
            <li> First, my hair is long and blonde.  </li>
            <li> We love to do waves in her hair with a curling iron, but after an hour or so, they are limp and not very curly.</li>
            <li> I bought these and have tried once, I left them in my hair for several hours to take them out to mostly straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick coily hair, and these really smooth everything out for soft, bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> More unfortunately, this particular curler was positioned near my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these things for at least 2+ years now and they&#x27;re still holding strong .</li>
            <li> Trying to cram as much hair as possible into a single former will leave you with damaged locks, and no one wants that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tried the other more &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; ones and my curl isn&#x27;t as tight.</li>
            <li> I wanted soft waves but these are tight, tight, tight perfect little curls</li>
            <li> Other than shipping was fast and the product was just as described!</li>
            <li> the curls are pretty and it&#x27;s way easier than other methods of achieving that look.</li>
            <li> That sounds like a major inconvenience to me.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviews have stated, the hook that came with the curlers made installation a bit tricky at first, but it wasn&#x27;t anything that I couldn&#x27;t work around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how nice they will be after a few hours in!! .</li>
            <li> That plastic handle is too weak, but the curlers are magical</li>
            <li> There is major shrinkage and</li>
            <li> Remember the pink are for the left and orange are for the right.</li>
            <li> That being said, I have never been one to curl my hair, I usually kept it short and easy to manage..</li>
            <li> The first ringlet former was easy but trying to put in the second one was very hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to effectively use wet set rollers, but these are darn near idiot proof.</li>
            <li> Snapped right in half.</li>
            <li> order came so quickly,  and I took the time to sit down and review the quality/condition of every last one of my 80 curlers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Minus half star only for being available in only this one curl intensity/size.</li>
            <li> The pink in this set match the orange, and the orange in this set match the pink in the original set.  </li>
            <li> I personally have somewhat thinner hair that holds curls very well, but based on how long they last for me, it seems that someone with thick hair will be highly satisfied with how well these curl &amp; hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to be careful you don&#x27;t select to large a section</li>
            <li> Now it is cheap and hard to put together.</li>
            <li> These are the long and wide curl formers and they make really pretty curls!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the curls don&#x27;t last more than 3 days on average - even less if you live in a windy area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add that she has super tight curls and for competition she needed bigger spirals to match the team.</li>
            <li> Additionally, these curlers are harder and I found that I absolutely could not sleep in them at all whereas I can generally sleep on curlformers.  </li>
            <li> I guess the only downfall was the packageing (?), the rollers came in a clear ziplock bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely suggest buying them if you have long straight hair and want it to be curly.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;extra long&#x27; from Curlformers will be much easier to work</li>
            <li> and you have to be careful to not pull to much hair through the roller.</li>
            <li> Hair snags and is harder to pull through the coil unlike the real thing.</li>
            <li> This happened with two curlers so far after only one use.</li>
            <li> I have used them on my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, as well, and the same results!!</li>
            <li> I want to start off saying that I&#x27;ve only used these once so far</li>
            <li> This same set in the brand name &#x27;curlformers&#x27; was $72 at a store near me....</li>
            <li> The one in the package barely holds together.</li>
            <li> especially for ALL hair types (natural, perm, weave)</li>
            <li> I have 3c natural hair and this product actually worked!</li>
            <li> I actually started using these and then later received the real curlformers as a christmas present.  </li>
            <li> immediately tried them out on my shoulder-length, naturally curly hair (my curls are unruly and I wanted these to help them lie differently).  </li>
            <li> When I received them they had a long brown hair stuck between a curl former which I thought was pretty gross.</li>
            <li> I started with wet hair and twisted each piece of hair at the root (small pieces of hair strung through the needle more effectively).</li>
            <li> did my 5 year old entire head.</li>
            <li> The only disadvantages about the curlformers were price and the end result on natural hair (as compared to the vakind curlers now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will definitely be a keeper in my natural hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I watched the videos, but apparently some details escaped me.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be real, One of the pink curl</li>
            <li> Next time i will do them early in the morning and take them out by night</li>
            <li> completely recommend that if you have been wanting curlformers you should definitely try these.</li>
            <li> I would especially recommend this product to individuals with natural hair that want a different look with soft curls.</li>
            <li> I am a natural lady with 3c mixed with 4b hair.</li>
            <li> I blame myself for using setting lotion on wet hair instead of a simple moisturizer on damp hair the first time around.</li>
            <li> and no none have broken but be sure to assess</li>
            <li> More of a personal issue - I have a lot of hair (it reaches just above my bra strap, but it&#x27;s really thick)</li>
            <li> Although getting the hang of using the wand and a few tangling incidents because of the wand it was so worth it.</li>
            <li> Good quality and design, but really difficult to use with long hair.</li>
            <li> The ONLY minor problem I have is with the hook as it tends to separate in the process of pulling slightly thicker strands of hair through--nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> and I am sure that would be worse if I were trying to sleep in them.  </li>
            <li> This size pack worked for my hair, but if you have thick and long hair, you should probably order more than one pack.</li>
            <li> I was kind of uncomfortable all night.</li>
            <li> The weaving is a little harder than the real curlformers, but you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li> Luckily the seller reimbursed me for the missing curlers but this was a major inconvenience for me since I still had to go back and purchase another pack</li>
            <li> They are not uncomfortable but not very comfortable either (to sleep in).</li>
            <li> I first got them my hair was down to my rear and</li>
            <li> The needle had some jagged edges that I had to file and melt down after the first piece of hair was snagged.</li>
            <li> I used all 40 in the pack plus 9 extra out of a smaller set I bought after other natural women reviews talked about needing a few more to finish their heads.</li>
            <li> but so far I don&#x27;t plan on buying them due to the high price.</li>
            <li> I have hip length hair), but the curl is not tight enough and it doesn&#x27;t add the fullness I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Next time I use these will probably be when I have dry, straight hair.</li>
            <li> The same combo with these larger ones was a little frizzy, didn&#x27;t hold and kind of limp.</li>
            <li> If I hooked the hair lower down the hair went through, but the top part above the hook didn&#x27;t make it in, and it knotted into a mess.</li>
            <li> On top of thickness I have some crazy kinky curls that are out of control and my hair is super nappy, frizzy, and dry.</li>
            <li> Docked one star for the less than stellar needle hair hook thing.</li>
            <li> you definitely want your hair towel-dried/damp, and if you are having a hard time putting them in, it is probably because your hair has dried too much, or you need to keep the wand at more of a 90 degree angle.</li>
            <li> That it&#x27;s not as hard as the original one its easier to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> Now I have about mid back length hair which is very fine and very hard to curl and keep a curl.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft,  porous, and about 7 inches long.  </li>
            <li> True rag curls were the the only other thing that came close, but they take forever to dry, and I&#x27;m tempted to use irregular sections of hair.</li>
            <li> Saw a youtube vlogger use these on one side of her head with the real curl formers and the other side with these Vakind Hair curlers for the price.....</li>
            <li> Like many, my first couple of tries were frustrating, but afterwards I was installing these like a pro!</li>
            <li> and it was way too much work compared to other hair curling methods.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have gotten the other ones to prevent so much shrinkage</li>
            <li> When I took them out my hair looked a hot mess...</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and these recommendations really helped.</li>
            <li> It can feel a little heavy when you have so many curlers on your head.</li>
            <li> Especially with as many as I&#x27;d need to set my thick long 3c-4a hair.</li>
            <li> The pink and orange are slightly shorter than the original</li>
            <li> You get pretty tight curls</li>
            <li> I have natural hair that is think (4a-4b) and it makes my hair looks as if i applied a flat iron to the roots!</li>
            <li> I noiced that the wand is cheaply made (duh, the set is only $16) and because of this the hook where the hair goes can snag on hair strands.</li>
            <li> Sure I figured out how to use them, and went on youtube to watch a video, but shouldn&#x27;t there but at least minimal directions with these things?</li>
            <li> I knew going in that I usually need more than the average person when it comes to curlers</li>
            <li> I recently began being natural and have 2-3 inches of relaxed hair left.</li>
            <li> Given that these are the generic brand, I took it upon myself to order an extra curlformer hook (directly from their website as it&#x27;s cheaper than getting it from amazon).</li>
            <li> Used with eco-styler gel on natural african american hair.  </li>
            <li> once I snapped them in place (this is important bc thick hair will constantly pull the wand apart if you don&#x27;t tape it).</li>
            <li> Then later in the day when she takes the ponytail out, her hair is wavy curly and looks really pretty down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a little tricky for the first 3 or 4 but went well afterwards.</li>
            <li> This curler and hook worked exactly the same and was only 1/4 the price of the other curler.</li>
            <li> The technique was a little daunting at first</li>
            <li> These got here later than promised and it caused a major issue.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to put on the first time I used but started to get the hang of it at the end</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kind of stiff, but at least they don&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, red hair that usually loses forced curls rather fast after using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> They do the exact same thing for way less of their price.</li>
            <li> It was super difficult to get the hair through at first.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4b hair and it made my hair look like I flat ironed it prior</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had long hair nearly 30 years</li>
            <li> So as long as my 4yr old doesn&#x27;t need her hair done for about 4hrs we like to use these.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for three years and have the curlformers from Sally&#x27;s about as long.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m African-American with natural 3c/4a curls, collarbone length if stretched.)</li>
            <li> I have natural African American hair with loads of shrinkage, it made my hair looked relaxed with only a leavs in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve had so far was having the curls hold for second and third day hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african american, my hair is naturally curly/kinky, and I&#x27;ve used mousse and setting lotions, but nothing seems to keep the shape longer than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this company and this product to friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> Pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> First I applied them all the way at the root &amp; let the excess hair at ends poke out freely a few inches.</li>
            <li> the next morning i woke up, took them out, and was surprised to see that i looked exactly like shirley temple :/.</li>
            <li> Had to get use to the process at first, even watched a few YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> With that said, they are not uncomfortable or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I spritz each section of my dry hair with a dilute mix of Infusium and water,  or use on freshly washed, slightly damp hair, for about 4hrs.  </li>
            <li> It only took a little over a week for these to arrive and the curls turned out really pretty.</li>
            <li> These are just like the more expensive major name brand, but at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> The stick might not be a problem if you have fine silky hair, but if you have thick textured hair, it separated every time!</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly weren&#x27;t hard to use.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if they will last as long as the original curlformers.</li>
            <li> So Cool i had to ge the Small Curlers !</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I do notice a slight crease from where the end sits at the scalp - this doesn&#x27;t affect my styles too much</li>
            <li> The wand is ever so slightly shorter than the real curl formers</li>
            <li> I used them on dry hair with no product added and they came out soft and springy.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning to natural and these long rods only go 1/4</li>
            <li> I got numerous comments all day in person and through social media.</li>
            <li> It broke really easy, was not happy</li>
            <li> I have arm pit length hair that is a mixture of natural (4A/B) from the roots to several inches down, and the rest down to the tips is straight from old relaxers.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t pull too much through one curler or you get a tangled mess.</li>
            <li> this will give you a fuller head of curls and you wont have to separate your curls as much and mess up the pattern</li>
            <li> though was that they were not long enough</li>
            <li> Additionally, the one that come with it is just not long enough.</li>
            <li> This is slightly bigger than real curl formers, the real pink and orange ones are smaller.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s $18 right now, not sure why, and I will not pay the extra $2 lol).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These Curler are amazing, the learning curve isn&#x27;t that difficult, one thing I realized is that if your having trouble you should probably use less hair in each spiral, but I love the heat less curls</li>
            <li> The plastic is super hard, not malleable enough for fragile relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed dramatically different results when I changed how much hair I put in each curler and using the curlers on dry hair versus wet hair.</li>
            <li> The only CON is that the bottom of my hair sticks out of these curlers.. they are not long enough</li>
            <li> have fine hair that is a bit thin at the moment.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair</li>
            <li> I have baby fine and thin hair that never holds a curl.</li>
            <li> The curls lasted all day , and the next day they turned into soft loose curls.  </li>
            <li> But I need to do a little hair at a time, if you do too much hair ,the hair will stuck in the tube.</li>
            <li> : Would not recoment for hair longer than mid back, curler is not long enough.</li>
            <li> I have unprocessed, thick and fine coiled hair.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, silky curls even with my very thick hair</li>
            <li> I got the 3rd set a little longer, because my hair is really growing.  </li>
            <li> Yes, a little painful to sleep on, but I was able to sleep soundly.</li>
            <li> my hair, even when left to dry naturally curly, is flat in that spot.  </li>
            <li> I love it because I no longer have to worry about the tangles I was getting in the natural-textured part of my hair after washing, can always get my hair styled and ready to go within 5 minutes in the mornings, and will never again have to wonder whether I&#x27;m going to have a bad hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it would be lovely if Vakind offered a fatter, looser curler set, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus another half star because they are ridiculous to try to sleep</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and didn&#x27;t use the whole set when I curled my hair, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> If you have long, thick, hair - you will probably need two sets to do a full head.</li>
            <li> The first time I used them, there were a couple that did turn out frizzy, but I wet them down and recurled them.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended them to people who are trying to use less heat on their hair.........</li>
            <li> One tip is to work with smaller sections of hair - especially if you have super thick or long hair.</li>
            <li> my hair which is textured black hair responded well and curls were soft and flexible!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do pay attention to the color coding (pink spirals one way and orange the other) and don&#x27;t try to cram too much hair into each tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest putting them in before bed when your hair is wet, the curls may be really tight when you first take them out but comb them out, they&#x27;ll relax, and</li>
            <li> another reviewer stated, file down the sharp edge on the needle first, or you&#x27;ll get it caught on your hair and in the curler, which could eventually cause damage.  </li>
            <li> No harsh smells like the other postings.</li>
            <li> I have long hair middle of my back, and a lot, and I only use 30 rollers.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to squeeze open at the top to put the long hook through and remove them.</li>
            <li> It works nicely, however, if you have long, thick hair, buy, at the least two packages (I wish I had).  </li>
            <li> , I was little impatient and used hair dryer for less then 5 min at the end to make sure</li>
            <li> My only complaint i received 3broken ones that were unusable then on first use</li>
            <li> It stretched many and they appear useless.</li>
            <li> these weren&#x27;t quite long enough to hold the entire length from scalp to end...</li>
            <li> or if you have short hair now but might have long hair later...</li>
            <li> if your hair isn&#x27;t long enough to fill the entire coil it won&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> You slide the long hook tool through the middle of the mesh curler, hook a piece of hair, and pull the hook back out.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the wand wasn&#x27;t long enough to go through the entire curler, so I had to try to scrunch the curler on the wand...</li>
            <li> The only cons, and it&#x27;s not the fault of the curlers, is that the style doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I may come back and revise this post when I see how long they last me.</li>
            <li> The Kid&#x27;s hair has grown quite a lot, and the starter kit didn&#x27;t have enough rollers, nor were they long enough.  </li>
            <li> They have small, medium and large.</li>
            <li> Based on the fact that my hair is very thick, 4a type hair that is responding SUPER well to a hair steamer I recently bought-</li>
            <li> Its exactly what i needed, but they are hard to sleep on.</li>
            <li> I doubt the second set will last very long</li>
            <li> I am a Black American lady with all natural hair.</li>
            <li> They were easy to apply, but were really uncomfortable to keep in the hair for several hours.  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter has mastered these and can pull them through my hair in less than ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Starting from the back helped me, but my hair was already dry once I made it to the front.</li>
            <li> I have used them twice and while they are very uncomfortable to sleep in, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> By the next day I was more frustrated because the results were no where near curled.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and long, to the small of my back, some weren&#x27;t long enough</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will use them all that much if ever again.</li>
            <li> I have bone straight hair past my ribs</li>
            <li> and they work very well if you use small sections.  </li>
            <li> These curlers and built well and seem like they would last a long while of use.</li>
            <li> The actual curl in my hair lasts a long time</li>
            <li> They are too long for my hair and the curls may end up too big.</li>
            <li> It took forever to use the curlers and to get your hair set and the result was absolutely flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t long enough to hold all my hair.</li>
            <li> so I needed the extra long.</li>
            <li> They are a plastic flat mesh spiral.</li>
            <li> but i haven&#x27;t gotten my curls to last as long using this curl-former dupe.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the wand is a bit flimsy, but that caused a really minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> It gives me long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> If I had to choose one styling product, it would be between these and my flat iron</li>
            <li> As long as the sections aren&#x27;t too big, you get all of the section into the hook, and you run a comb through each section immediately before hooking it</li>
            <li> However, I tested these curlers on my bangs (which I purposefully cut short and is about 16 inches long) and I STILL had hair hanging out the bottom.</li>
            <li> These are sturdy curlers that will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll want the extra long curlers.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the extra long</li>
            <li> They will look short, but I thought my hair would go to the bottom of these  since it is so long.  </li>
            <li> They will look short, but I thought my hair would go to the bottom of these  since it is so long.  </li>
            <li> I had to return them because they weren&#x27;t long enough for my hair.  </li>
            <li> curler might work if your hair is short... and if someone says long, they means shoulder long, not actually long long.</li>
            <li> Having a neck pillow or something to keep your head from being flat helps.</li>
            <li> in they wont last you all day long.</li>
            <li> as if I had flat ironed it.</li>
            <li> I saw somewhere that you could buy an extra long needle so I&#x27;ll just do that.</li>
            <li> The curls last a long time.</li>
            <li> Okay I am half Egyptian and half Greek, so you imagine how thick my hair is.</li>
            <li> As well as this, the hook provided is very weak and breaks easily.</li>
            <li> They are equal to the Extra Long and Wide name brand Curlformers just a tad shorter but no big deal.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this and other products like it and lots of people said they had broken the wand easily.  </li>
            <li> The first few were tricky BUT!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, they were easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Do not remove the Former until the hair is fully dry.</li>
            <li> Next time I will just air dry or sit under a hooded dryer...</li>
            <li> Needless to say, they were easy to use.</li>
            <li> Start with almost dry hair and  put some product in your hair to help hold the curl if you want it to last.  </li>
            <li> You must only do this if you have all day to let your hair dry.</li>
            <li> I used them on my natural black hair and they were as promised.</li>
            <li> These really works, seen on you tube decided to get them I use in my daughters hair every Sunday curl last at least 3 days</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of thinking my hair was dry before it actually was, so some of my curls frizzed and didn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> They work the same and the came earlier than expected, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Also, there were random crimps in the top and bottom of the curls from where the curler closed.  </li>
            <li> I have straight thick hair and used the entire set on my head.</li>
            <li> Did notice when receiving this package a few pieces were torn on the mesh...very minimal that it wasn&#x27;t much of a problem to put them on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not comfortable as you first lay down</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend purchasing to help stretch your hair and prevent single strand knots.</li>
            <li> When I first placed my order, I was afraid that 40 curlformers wouldn&#x27;t be enough to do my whole head</li>
            <li> Wish they were the Extra Wide &amp; Extra Long</li>
            <li> , it hurt, this is a way to loose hair especially with that hook and trying to get it off and having to pull it off.</li>
            <li> Even though I personally have not experienced this, but I read other reviewers on Amazon and YouTube that when purchased the products are not always clean during the shipping process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wash my hair, spritz a small strand, twist the strand at the root, and the hook slides right over the hair strand and the hair glides down into the curlformer.</li>
            <li> I definitely used it wrong the first time because my hair came out in my natural texture but stretched.</li>
            <li> For those wondering if these are the same size as the yellow and pink ones from Curlformers they are NOT!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compared them with the more expensive ones because I&#x27;m not willing to pay the $70.00 price.</li>
            <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend sleeping in them, I tried that last night, and even putting only the bottom half of each strand in</li>
            <li> My hair gets tangled very often when trying to pull through with the hook and the only way to prevent that is to take very very small sections.</li>
            <li> These placed in her hair while slightly damp then drying makes curls last the entire day - and sometimes into the next morning.</li>
            <li> This are the most uncomfortable things to wear your hair and even sleeping on them for a night they only stay in for about a half an hour after words.</li>
            <li> I taped it, tried again, and still couldn&#x27;t get anything through the curl former, the ends are pinched together so tightly that I could barely get the stick alone to go through.</li>
            <li> Huge issue the wand/stick is very weak and MUST be reinforced.</li>
            <li> so my curls are a little straighter on my naturally curly/kinky hair texture 4a/4b.</li>
            <li> MAIN complaint is that I want bigger curls, but that is not a quality issue.</li>
            <li> Also, these tubes are much longer than the wand, so it&#x27;s hard to grasp the end of the wand.  </li>
            <li> These curlers aren&#x27;t hard to use, but they really hurt to have in for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li> the plastic is a bit hard to sleep on but it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> cons are they are not very comfortable to sleep in and a few curlers had some fraying of the mesh but nothing that would prevent you from using the curler and certainly nothing to warrant buying the $70 version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Curls are soft, sleek and bouncy but they are hard to sleep in and the needle will tear your hair if not careful.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about this because like most off brand curlformers they would be stiff and the tips would be hard to squeeze, but not this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as flimsy as I thought it would be after reading some of the reviews, I&#x27;ve gotten my air stuck at least 8 or 10 times (trying to put too much hair in it..)</li>
            <li> They do what they say they&#x27;re just kind of painful to sleep in</li>
            <li> When I purchased these, I figured that even if they didn&#x27;t work, or i didn&#x27;t like them at least I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.</li>
            <li> For the past year or so, I have used Curlformers on my natural hair (4A) on a regular basis to stretch my hair into glossy ringlets.  </li>
            <li> I got them on time if not early.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to take her long to put them in her hair.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair to my waist.</li>
            <li> I have a daughter with long hair who loves to curl it.  </li>
            <li> I have wanted these for a long time but Ididn&#x27;t want to pay the price.</li>
            <li> They keep your hair curly for a long time.</li>
            <li> They are for long hair.</li>
            <li> Took me a long time to figure out how to get them to work</li>
            <li> I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I like using this product, but not too often because when using on wet hair it may cause thinning of the hair or potential breakage, according to my beautician.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting these for a really long time and they shipped in 2 days</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 packs but only used roughly 50.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll take too long to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this product is the same size as the Green and Blue, the only thing is instead of getting 24 you 40  or 50 I forget.</li>
            <li> My daughter has really long hair that doesn&#x27;t stay curled with heat curlers and these</li>
            <li> but i definitely should of blowdryed my hair because some spots were still wet and made my hair puffy afterwords</li>
            <li> my hair is really long</li>
            <li> I have wanted these for a long time but Ididn&#x27;t want to pay the price.</li>
            <li> and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> hair is quite long now.</li>
            <li> And also because my hair was still wet  the next day.</li>
            <li> I wish they made them in extra wide size so I could try those.</li>
            <li> I only wet the hair, applied a moisturizer and installed the spirals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once because they are time consuming to put in and even harder to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I also like how they feel and how long they are.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my six-year-old daughter who has long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leverage Stretched Length 50CM Circle Roller Pack of 40) .</li>
            <li> Also it was too long, I should have gotten shorter ones.</li>
            <li> It came WAY before the expected arrival date, taking only 10 days to ship from China to California!</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy if you have long hair (waist length/ hip length)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use these curlers for my hair; my hair was way tooo long for these.</li>
            <li> but if you he long hair it will work well and also</li>
            <li> I have used these curlers ony a few times but so far I like them.</li>
            <li> Definitely need to start with wet hair</li>
            <li> these curlers are 19 inches long.</li>
            <li> I got the extra long and wide because my hair is long (below arm pit) and growing.</li>
            <li> If you have really long hair (below shoulder blades)</li>
            <li> They to be about 18 in long, when pulled all the way out.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair below the shoulders, and this product tore my hair and pulled my hair out.</li>
            <li> and it is long, so</li>
            <li> and that was so long it was unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> However, if you want waves and big curls, get the wide ones.  </li>
            <li> However, if you want waves and big curls, get the wide ones.  </li>
            <li> I will try them on wet hair and sit under a hair dryer the next time.</li>
            <li> These were really long- way longer than my hair-</li>
            <li> These rollers were inexpensive, there are plenty of them for our needs, and they handle plenty long hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 packs for my daughter&#x27;s long hair.</li>
            <li> Saving me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have the curlformer package (long and extra wide) by HairFlair</li>
            <li> Gets the same results as curl formers long and wide size.</li>
            <li> These are the extra long and wide ones.  </li>
            <li> These are the extra long and wide ones.  </li>
            <li> my hair is thick but straight</li>
            <li> and I have thick and straight hair.</li>
            <li> The application was annoying for a good part of it though.</li>
            <li> I believe that this set of 40 is equal to the brand name of Extra Long and Wide set (NOT the Extra Long Extra Wide, which I would have preferred, but I make do by using slightly thicker sections of hair in each curler), sold by Sally&#x27;s and also here.  </li>
            <li> Not comfortable to lay down in but with a dryer I didn&#x27;t really need to.</li>
            <li> key is to start with ALMOST DRY HAIR!!</li>
            <li> The trick is to get the hair damp enough to blow dry into curls without getting the hair too wet.</li>
            <li> Super difficult to sleep in, so next time I&#x27;ll try to use a bonnet hair dryer in the morning rather than sleeping in them at night.</li>
            <li> I use a hooded hair dryer because it HARD trying to sleep in these curlers, but it can be done.(ie) after you completed adding all your curlers to your hair, grab a huge scarf and tie is down tightly without giving yourself a headache- boom- you can sleep with the curler-</li>
            <li> My hair DOES NOT normally curl with curling irons, and if it does, it goes flat so quickly...but the curl I get from these rollers lasts for THREE days!!</li>
            <li> dry long</li>
            <li> Not because they tugged on my hair, but the hard plastic made it hard for me to find a position to lay my head comfortably.</li>
            <li> (BTW: I am a natural with tightly curly hair!)</li>
            <li> While I wish they were the EXTRA wide ones, which I haven&#x27;t seen in a knock off yet, they still get the job done!</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial and has an extremely curly coarse hair texture.</li>
            <li> The tubes do hold the hair flat and stretch it out, even with my hair being about 40% wet when I attached them.</li>
            <li> Not soft at all!</li>
            <li> Often times people say, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; With this being a significant amount cheaper than Curlformers, I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would come in the original case, but unfortunately I have to buy that separate.</li>
            <li> I have insisted that she gets her money back from the other vendor and orders from Vakind Tech.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I was so glad when I saw a company that mad a cheaper version of the Curlformers.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is invest in the curl former hook, because the one in the package was a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> I gave them to a friend of mine who has a teenage daughter and they can help each other.</li>
            <li> However, the original company are incredibly expensive (you can get about 10 for $13 at Sallys-</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t realize that these were so long!</li>
            <li> I actually slept in them the other night.  </li>
            <li> and these are long enough for all of my hair with a few inches left.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy with a loose curl, I use these when my hair is wet to form the mess into something workable.</li>
            <li> otherwise the hair will be stretched out but not have a loose curl shape which is what you want from the product.</li>
            <li> I have seen people use it on wet hair, but I get soft and bouncy curls on dry hair that is moisturized and a little bit of gel to hold them up.</li>
            <li> I have very long, think and stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> These are very long.</li>
            <li> but I have very long hair that sticks out the bottom that I roll on rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using these for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The  item  did  take a  very  long  time to arrive in my case.</li>
            <li> If you have very long hair like mine</li>
            <li> so it is very long</li>
            <li> so if you do not have anyhting to do let them air dry or sit under a hooded dryer.</li>
            <li> I allow my to air dry (6-8 hours).</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry my hair with the curlers still on.</li>
            <li> It took my hair over night to dry and with the products I used they lasted for about a week.</li>
            <li> and it took about 40 mins to zip it thru and hour to dry.</li>
            <li> So I would recommend to wash them and let them dry out before putting them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if it is to dry, the curl does not hold.</li>
            <li> So if you put them in in the morning, without heat they will be dry that evening.</li>
            <li> You could air dry or since they are mesh, sit under a dryer or use a dryer.</li>
            <li> me, I just take a shower in the morning, blow dry my hair about 1/2way, and then use a styling mouse on my hair before putting in the curlformers.</li>
            <li> CAN NOT BLOW DRY your hair with these....</li>
            <li> put a dryer over them for about 15 minutes and my hair was completely dry once I removed the curlers.</li>
            <li> dry</li>
            <li> I recommend air dry throughout the day or sitting under a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> so they can air dry or sitting under the hair dryer</li>
            <li> I just have to find a product that helps to hold the curl without leaving it crunchy and dry.</li>
            <li> It took a while for hair to dry out</li>
            <li> You can air dry during the day if you have time and depending on hair texture.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry</li>
            <li> I just spritzed my dry hair with a leave in conditioner before pulling it through the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I then blow dry my hair to set the curls with the curlers in.  </li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t fully dry</li>
            <li> We just used them after her showet and until her hair was dry.</li>
            <li> Hair should be 90% dry.  </li>
            <li> Crazy reasonable price compared to the real deal at Sally.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t let your hair completely dry with the curlers  </li>
            <li> I just blow dry my hair in the curlers.</li>
            <li> Started with dry hair and spritzed with water.</li>
            <li> Where you sit under a hair dryer and let it dry.</li>
            <li> and it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is transitioning and I have a lot of relaxer left at the ends, so a few curls dropped by the next day.</li>
            <li> You can use thick sections with less rods for looser curls, or the whole set of them for much smaller and tighter ones.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was with the rod, it kept slipping out of place; so I had to keep holding the center section when I went to slide the rod out.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected and came earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> It does a terrific job stretching and curling my hair in curls that last quite a few days.</li>
            <li> So I can only stare at it for the next few months....or</li>
            <li> I only used a few from the second pack</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on the more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was the wand kept wanting to come apart after every few curls, but it wasn&#x27;t that big of an issue.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the wand wouldn&#x27;t snap together completely.</li>
            <li> I have thick 3c/4a shoulder length natural hair and 40 wasnt nearly enough</li>
            <li> This curl is just a little tighter than I wanted I should have got the extra long and extra wide set.</li>
            <li> Only down side is how long i waited to receive it.</li>
            <li> but the ringlets are pretty tough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried two of them as a tester on my thin, straight hair, no product and blasted them with a hair dryer for 5 minutes, then let them cool naturally.  </li>
            <li> The curls come out really tight if you leave them in for an hour and half an hour for very soft curls.</li>
            <li> The curl is amazing and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Plus, I saw a review by a trusted natural hair care reviewer on youtube who compared both brands and found that Vakind work just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> I received two wands with the set of curlers and normally I use at least thirty of the forty curlers.</li>
            <li> but once you have done it a few times I think I can actually get them in faster than it takes to curl my hair using my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I spent a long time researching the difference between Curlformers and the knock offs.</li>
            <li> The curlers we received were shorter and the colors we received were blue, green, pink, and yellow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m african american and have thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> Makes tight, long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Putting the hair in the tubes was a little hard at first, but eventually you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is the hook.</li>
            <li> These last longer than any other curlers I&#x27;ve used in her hair!</li>
            <li> What took me so long to order these!!</li>
            <li> Took a LITTLE over an hour to put all of them in, I had 5-8 left over and have shoulder length(when stretched)</li>
            <li> These are stupid expensive at  the beaty supply so this is a much better option yo get the same thing for cheap.</li>
            <li> I really wanted narrow curlers but chose these instead because I could not tell if the blue and green were actually narrow.</li>
            <li> I am really bad with doing hair, but these are pretty much fool proof.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry and finding a hooded dryer to fit your head once done is next to impossible.</li>
            <li> tried using a product the first time I did this, and the curl held a bit better, but my hair felt awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put them in dry hair and wet hair.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a small started kit from Sally&#x27;s but was too expensive to as many curlers that I needed.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re suppose to thread wet hair through the twists and dry that way, but I cant even get my hair through it.</li>
            <li> If it is too wet, the hair doesn&#x27;t dry overnight</li>
            <li> Anywhere locally I could get half the quantity for 4 times the price.</li>
            <li> It would constantly get caught half way thru the roller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed with black</li>
            <li> Worked as well as curlformers for less than 20.00, will be buying a second set soon for a tighter set.</li>
            <li> Lastly my rollers arrived in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only less then $5.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend 70+ for the CurlFormers Salon kit - this set is equal to that one for less than 20.</li>
            <li> The only dislike was the the black bar, it snagged my hair a bit</li>
            <li> but once I actually used the product, half way through the hook snagged at the bottom in a piece of mesh and snapped.</li>
            <li> I tried some other regular sponge curlers, and looked at other styles of curlers...  </li>
            <li> I have done them with dry hair and wet hair</li>
            <li> After trying initially on dry hair, the orange curls worked the pink ones did not..</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will try for a 3rd just because inserting them is actually quite time consuming.</li>
            <li> They do not have anywhere to go, so it was super uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT IS SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE TO SLEEP IN.</li>
            <li> I found these because I was a little surprised how expensive the name brand (&amp;#34;Curlformers&amp;#34;) was, so</li>
            <li> With some Shea Butter, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Eco Styler gel on damp hair, I popped these bad boys in before I went to bed and got a head full of curls the next morning.</li>
            <li> I tend to wear my hair loose even when its up in a bun, so I&#x27;m not really a fan of the pressure on my scalp and hair when I wear these.</li>
            <li> Of note - they had a weird chemical odor that lingered for a few days, even after a soak in a strong Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap bath.  </li>
            <li> Want to find fatter ones that make big waves rather than tight ringlets.</li>
            <li> My hair is around 20 in long (some parts are 22 inches long), so I knew that I would have to put the curlers lower on some parts (and it wouldn&#x27;t be as tight on the roots).</li>
            <li> only complaint is the stick thing, it comes in two parts, and there were several times that it came apart mid application, so I was stuck trying to get my hair and the remaining half out of the curler.</li>
            <li> I simply turned it upside down and slid my hair through the other end.</li>
            <li> but i watched some videos on youtube and with a little practice it became really simple to put in.</li>
            <li> Was very simple to use although the needle the threads the hair does seem a little flimsy</li>
            <li> Now I only put in about 4 at night to give my hair a little volume.</li>
            <li> It probably pulls out a little hair  overall, but so does brushing and washing your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> well if your hair comes to your bra strap like mine, they are a little too short.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion the wand needs to be made a little stronger and that would help and the end of the hair curler needs to have some type of bigger opening</li>
            <li> I had to do a little extra research to figure out how to use them....</li>
            <li> Give me big hair (and honestly, a little frizz) any day.  </li>
            <li> The wand that comes with these is a little short for the curlers leaving you trying to push the wand through while still holding your hair</li>
            <li> I used the whole bag in my hair, but I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> The plastic mesh is a little harder on the Vakind - which actually created a smoother curl.  </li>
            <li> They were a bit hard to sleep in, they are not as soft as curlformers.</li>
            <li> While my curls WERE there and amazing, I hated my results ONLY because of the products I used.</li>
            <li> If they are fake then I can not tell the difference they do the same thing as the real ones and my stick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last though.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected and was easier to put in than expected.</li>
            <li> Wet hair</li>
            <li> The only con is they were not comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> but I did notice that the pink rollers were shorter which didn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious, go to youtube and google curlformers or spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> Only a few times where my hair didn&#x27;t pull all the way through.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, if you&#x27;re not paying attention you might pull,your hair</li>
            <li> Be careful with the hook so you don&#x27;t pull your hair out.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with finding a low maintenance protective style and decided to give these a try.</li>
            <li> This product was beyond what I had expected.</li>
            <li> The hook did not fit together well and seemed to short for the length of the curler.  </li>
            <li> I use Rocaholic defrizzer/detangler before putting them in and sleep on them (not very comfy)</li>
            <li> so i had to constantly wet my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hooks are not very sturdy at all.</li>
            <li> They did the job as expected.</li>
            <li> (I leave them in roughly eight hours without any heat...</li>
            <li> Also, without having wet hair then the curl falls within an hour.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> My only tiny complaint is some of them.have rough edges</li>
            <li> Every thing came as expected thank you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are rough to sleep in</li>
            <li> I would not sleep on these though, as I said they are harder</li>
            <li> Used them with her wet hair</li>
            <li> just pulled the hair into the curlers and left them in for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> but it was still wet.</li>
            <li> Came in the expected time.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> These are a cheaper way to go to get the same outcome that you would get purchasing the ones in the store - HOWEVER, these are NOT comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> and I did not have it soaking wet.</li>
            <li> The wave/curl will last for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and  I had few left over</li>
            <li> Would give 4 1/2 stars (minus 1 for the flimsy hook).</li>
            <li> I read quite a few reviews prior to purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> do recommend watching some tutorials on youtube to learn how to use these, it&#x27;s not as difficult, but there are some useful tips online.</li>
            <li> Your hair needs to be wet</li>
            <li> When I want my curls to last for a few days, I use knotty boy aloe vera lock tightening gel.  </li>
            <li> The results were as expected.</li>
            <li> I guess they were maybe a bit rough on them.  </li>
            <li> but I found mine to be stronger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I should have gotten the short narrow ones instead.</li>
            <li> is roughly 2 inches below my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I used them a couple of times and got what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The videos help so definitely watch a few.</li>
            <li> The curlformers were too wide for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I always use them as though I am doing a wet set.</li>
            <li> I watched a few tutorials on YouTube and tried it last night.</li>
            <li> , I got the hang of it after just two tries.  </li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m not a very patient person).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it is purely wet, the curl looks a bit mushy to me.  </li>
            <li> Still, I will use these on the bottom layers and order the wide set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, I will use these on the bottom layers and order the wide set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are not comfortable to sleep in, but it was possible.  </li>
            <li> Orderd these and the blue and green set.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I tried again a few nights later with</li>
            <li> One appointment cost as much as I spent on all of these things accessories included.</li>
            <li> So you have to be careful about that.  </li>
            <li> I have had a few problems with hangups and snags, but it just requires a regroup or maybe the use of a different curler.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try on wet hair..</li>
            <li> Harder to use than in the video and the two part hook keeps coming apart during application.</li>
            <li> It is the same as the expensive formers but with AA natural hair using this size doesnt define my hair well enough..</li>
            <li> you need the skinny green and blue formers</li>
            <li> think these would work on hair that can be permed and hold it, but alas, I am cursed with recalcitrant straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this set comes with enough formers to curl my entire head!</li>
            <li> It only took a few tries to get the hang of using the rod</li>
            <li> Put them on wet hair a few hours later you have well defined curls.</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying 2 packs if you are natural or have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy an extra hook and use half of your set to give to a friend!</li>
            <li> The two different colors mean that the hair curls in opposite directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman of Carribean decent with thick, natural hair that falls a little past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> the other daughter had thin poker straight hair abd</li>
            <li> The second is that I had to toss a few curlers away due to pulls in the fabric or cracks in the plastic that I feared would damage my hair.</li>
            <li> These looked sooooo easy to use but they are very difficult to put into your hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately 40 wasn&#x27;t enough and I had only realized this after I had done half of my hair, so I will be buying a second pack after the price goes back to the $15-$16 range</li>
            <li> Although some are starting to unstitch at the tops, I&#x27;m not worried, as they are a cheaper brand, you get what you pay for and seeing as my friend bought the more expensive brand and those are doing the same thing, I&#x27;ll stick with these less expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I figured if it turned out to be a mistake, then I was only out less than half the $ of the Curlformers.  </li>
            <li> Package arrived before expected and like I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, the plastic curlers do have an odor to them</li>
            <li> I was so happy and shocked, and it is so much less expensive than the actual curlformers.</li>
            <li> AND if you leave them in that long they will be TIGHT curls, and I like mine a bit looser, but it&#x27;s all in preference.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that these are as long as they come and my hair needs them a tad longer.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, semi straight, and is average leaning towards thin.</li>
            <li> She has really long thick hair, and one set is enough.</li>
            <li> Ok, I like to think I am not a complete moron.</li>
            <li> On dry, stretched hair  with a little coconut oil and the Jane Carter, sat under the hood dryer for 30 minutes, and perfection!</li>
            <li> The next time, I applied them a few inches down from my roots so that there wouldn&#x27;t be any excess hair hanging out the ends.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t quite have the method down until I got to the last few pieces of hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, didn’t have an opportunity to try out my newly acquired toys that same day</li>
            <li> These curls are little tight for my taste, so will try to next size up.  </li>
            <li> Not good for someone like myself who is going natural.</li>
            <li> Beware they are some other off brand \\&quot;curlformers\\&quot;</li>
            <li> so i just used the other side.</li>
            <li> Other than that...</li>
            <li> they went to re-purposed in some other way.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just like what all the other reviews said, you can&#x27;t sleep in these rollers.</li>
            <li> i got the other pack from kkstar</li>
            <li> Other than that my hair lasted a week with the style</li>
            <li> and I think it was due to</li>
            <li> they last days for me I just have to touch them up with a small curling iron.</li>
            <li> I would use them over any other brand.</li>
            <li> but I find this to be an asset and assume that the curlers will last longer do to the different material (several of my expensive curlformers have been trashed due to breaking).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once because I&#x27;m too lazy to do it again.  </li>
            <li> There are a few obstacles to conquer:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Only downside is the curl former stick is a bit weak.  </li>
            <li> On my first try to install, it was a fail.</li>
            <li> Due to this I might not use them as often if I have to sleep on them.</li>
            <li> took the advice of other raters in that</li>
            <li> Do not forget to section your hair in small sections so you are not yanking your hair through the tiny opening.</li>
            <li> She sent me to the actual website where they required a small loan.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> so I will try to find some other ones.</li>
            <li> the only advice I heeded was use small sections</li>
            <li> I say this because sleeping on them was pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> other than that they are o.k.</li>
            <li> i first saw these at Sally&#x27;s but thought they were way too expensive</li>
            <li> It was difficult to put in the first five curlers, but I learned how to do it after a while.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT come with instructions, so you should search YouTube for \\&quot;curlformers\\&quot; to see how other women are putting theirs in.</li>
            <li> I refuse to put heat in my hair due to breakage.</li>
            <li> Never have I got these results from any other curlers.</li>
            <li> Any kinks--no pun intended--in the process are due to operator error, not the curlers themselves.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the other brand)</li>
            <li> And unlike other reviewers, I havent had a problem with the hooks breaking at all.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to pay so much due to needing 2 packs.</li>
            <li> You get similar results if not better.</li>
            <li> The little wand ripped my hair out a little bit but after using smaller amounts of hair I didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t going to spend $70 for the other ones.  </li>
            <li> It felt weird at first</li>
            <li> When plastics heats up their bonds break and when these bonds break, the things that make up the plastic like dioxins are released and they are extremely toxic and carcinogenic (cancer causing).</li>
            <li> Search for a tutorial on youtube but still no able to make them work because this product dont have the same accesories as others.</li>
            <li> I tried it on dry hair with a little conditioner and the curls fell as soon as I hit the door.</li>
            <li> Took me a couple of tries to get it down.</li>
            <li> But there a little to big  and a few of them already broke.</li>
            <li> My suggestion would be to put these on in the morning, dry them a little with a hair dryer and allow them to air dry for a few hours.</li>
            <li> My hair is long to my mid back and very thick, this product kept snagging and pulling even though i took small amounts and the handle kept slipping out while i was pulling my hair through the mouth.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly easy once you get the hang of it and sleeping in them isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> and I brought the narrow ones (the green &amp; blue) for the front.</li>
            <li> From watching the videos I did go ahead and wash my hair and let it dry for a few hours so that it was still damp.</li>
            <li> some of the curl former where either missing the round parts at the end of them or they had holes in them</li>
            <li> I would also recommend air drying or hood drying as opposed to sleeping in them as they are not real comfortable.</li>
            <li> or so all but a few were dry.</li>
            <li> 1″ curlers to dry before applying \\&quot;round</li>
            <li> After hearing a few recommendations, I bought these to air dry and stretch my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I know people who allow them to dry in the morning for a few hours</li>
            <li> It is very hard to curl and if it does curl is usually flat 1 hour later.  </li>
            <li> Works on my very thin straight hair!  </li>
            <li> it was easy!beats other spiral systems.about half hour setting,another half drying,perfect!and hair should be almost dry before you roll,see youtube!</li>
            <li> With the use of a little gel my curl will hold well over a week and it doesn&#x27;t take my hair 24 hours to dry!</li>
            <li> hair is very thick and down to the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> I half way dried my hair the other night, put in the curlers, let them sit for 3 hours, took them out, went to bed and the curlers stayed all day long!</li>
            <li> If you keep them on for a long time (or sleep in them), the curls are very tight and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to order but thanks to other reviews</li>
            <li> I did a comparison to the ones in the beauty supply stores, the ones I ordered are a little harder than the ones in the supply store</li>
            <li> I used Infusium leave in conditioner and lotta body with a little jojoba oil and curled while wet (not dripping).  </li>
            <li> I did them on wet hair after a shower with a little gel in my hair and they lasted for 3 days.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and very thick</li>
            <li> and I have 4b/4c natural hair that is very thick and kinky and</li>
            <li> At first they&#x27;re a little difficult to get used too, and sleep in.</li>
            <li> : It is possible to pull out strands of your hair with these curlers if you pull too hard.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they are hard to sleep in</li>
            <li> With these you can do just that, sleep in them (a little uncomfortable) and have a spiral set that is pretty.</li>
            <li> They work just like the super expensive one sold at Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to get curls in my hair with no success.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they began to hurt my scalp after a while, so I would recommend drying the hair instead of air drying or sleeping on them overnight.</li>
            <li> Received item late (!)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the hook broke before I could even use it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really give me the curls i wanted, also extremely uncomfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> The only negative was the packaging.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to lay on, so expect to spend a couple of hours air drying or sit under some low heat if you need to be styled and ready to go to an event.</li>
            <li> At least I got my money back.</li>
            <li> However, it may be difficult for the first few nights to sleep in.</li>
            <li> ASAP.This product is not worth the time effort and money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> At least if I had purchased from an Amazon fulfilled store I would have gotten it sooner and with a lesser chance of error on the part of the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t mastered getting the curls to stay all day.</li>
            <li> Curls last at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Left on for at least 3 hours.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can say is that I received 39 instead of 40 and two of them were frayed and not usable.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is about the &#x27;ends&#x27; of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick so 40 was just enough to do it all!</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t enough for my thick nappy bra strap length hair.</li>
            <li> Second, these worked well for my waist length thick frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> just isn&#x27;t enough for my thick, kinky/curly hair.</li>
            <li> So far my hook hasn&#x27;t broken yet</li>
            <li> I have thin 4a type natural hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t sleep on them - not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not very comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> But the trick is, place them down and inch or two from your roots</li>
            <li> so I just slid the curler farther down.</li>
            <li> Purchased this set for my sister who was trying to locate this down here - Jamaica.</li>
            <li> Now, you think I would of had this down pat.....</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve got the knack down</li>
            <li> when i took them down my hair looked like i had a relaxer.</li>
            <li> Other than the one danaged curlee, all was well!</li>
            <li> Other than that, these are a hit with me!</li>
            <li> I will recommend to other cheer Moms!</li>
            <li> I always had a hard time curling my hair, curls would fall flat within an hour.</li>
            <li> The plastic is a little hard, but you can leave them for only 3 hrs.</li>
            <li> I also recommend leaving at least  a 1/2  inch from the scalp to let the rollers lay flat while drying.</li>
            <li> , I use on slightly damp hair and when it dries i take em out, ordered two sets</li>
            <li> It takes me less than 30 minutes to put these curlers in.</li>
            <li> I received 40 curlers (orange/pink) and a black hook in each package.</li>
            <li> BUT I received it about a week and a half ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s definitely a slight learning curve....</li>
            <li> Less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s less than half the cost.</li>
            <li> Once in, the curlers were heavy and uncomfortable, pulling hair if I moved my head to much.  </li>
            <li> It comes with the black wand thingy as well...</li>
            <li> You end up losing the bottom half of the wand when you pull it through which causes pain and pulling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying at a longer wait time this weekend with slightly damp hair and updating my review.</li>
            <li> I duct taped the hook wand as suggested in a previous review and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> less then what the BSS was asking.</li>
            <li> I ordered my 1st pack and received them in a week and a half from China.  </li>
            <li> I understand a container not being included had they been in some sort of temporary bag, but no instructions was odd.</li>
            <li> So, I tried them for the first time last night and was disappointed that the plastic tool does not work.  </li>
            <li> I was half way through my hair, the wand snapped....</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve.</li>
            <li> Over all, especially for the price, you cannot go wrong, especially being heatless&gt;</li>
            <li> I do need to put less hair in each curler because my hair is already curly.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to use this ringlets since I was looking for way to use less heat on my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> one but half the price.</li>
            <li> It took me almost an hour and a half to do it.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t fill up half of the tube.</li>
            <li> We typically do it after bath night.  </li>
            <li> I put a lot of mousse in slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I would like to add that these do significantly less damage to my hair than the foam curlers, and I don&#x27;t pull out a lot of my hair trying to put these on/take them off.  </li>
            <li> Well, these particular ones didnt come with instructions----- useless.</li>
            <li> but it was a naughty, naughty wand!</li>
            <li> these curlers cause I hate the process of trying to wrap my hair the right way around regular rollers like perm rods and flexi rods and the take downs.</li>
            <li> Getting the technique down is a little tricky.</li>
            <li> We like these very much the only complaint we have is they are very uncomfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> For my first try, they snagged my hair like crazy...</li>
            <li> i have to put in something to keep the curls prior to putting them on which is just not good for me</li>
            <li> The hair is at a mess after treatment by using this tool.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my hair is too thick or too long, but I cannot get my hair to pull through the tube.  </li>
            <li> I did not think this would work for my extremely thick long hair.</li>
            <li> The amount of hair that each curler holds is very small and just one set on my average thickness hair took a long time to put in.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and the curls</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick And long but that has never been a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I will say that the wand is hard to put together, and a little awkward to use (especially granted that it was not long enough for the rollers).</li>
            <li> The technique can be a little tricky, they&#x27;re not super user-friendly as you can break hair and tangle it in the process.  </li>
            <li> I can say that it takes a few times to get the technique down</li>
            <li> (And by difficult I mean PAINFUL lol)</li>
            <li> The size is not too tight, and have lasted all day.  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend to put this on and sleep with them, though I guaranty you won&#x27;t have a tight sleep.</li>
            <li> My curls were tight spirals.</li>
            <li> They can cause a headache if you are doing them tight or trying to sleep on them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give you tight curls.  </li>
            <li> I then seperated the tight curls</li>
            <li> Does not keep the curl tight.</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t apply them to tight and figure out where to push them aside</li>
            <li> I have layered medium length hair and when I took these out the curls were so tight I looked like shurly temple.</li>
            <li> However, they were too tight for the look I wanted.  </li>
            <li> However, they were too tight for the look I wanted.  </li>
            <li> , not the tight spirals I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> a few reviewers said, you do have to cut and file down the little &#x27;nub&#x27; on the pulling tool.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is inhumanly thick and very long.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick hair</li>
            <li> Dry hair you need at least an hour for them to work.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to dry, at least 7 hours</li>
            <li> My hair takes at least 8 hours to curl with these in dry.</li>
            <li> Only suggestion I would make is to make the hook a bit longer, because the curler is so long it was a bit difficult to use, but doable.</li>
            <li> the first three curlers I was about to throw the whole thing away as I was terrible.  </li>
            <li> And since the material is a little tougher, it may result in smoother curls.  </li>
            <li> The length is a little longer than the name brand product as well.</li>
            <li> They do take a little getting used to</li>
            <li> , the fact that these aren&#x27;t the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; version, the quality may be a little off.  </li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, it felt like there were little people in my hair just ripping it out alllllll night.</li>
            <li> Take a little practice to get the hang of how to use the product.</li>
            <li> I slept with them which took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> Just used water, oil and a little bit of shea butter</li>
            <li> I add a little pomade to make it piecey and for texture.</li>
            <li> Also a little hair serum for shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Vakind was a little wider than the Curlformers which reduced the drying time, provided I didn&#x27;t over stuff the Vakind with hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What could use a little improvement:  </li>
            <li> They do take a little time to learn how to use them</li>
            <li> Little bummed that some of these were busted already at the tips...</li>
            <li> so I have to modify the method a little when using them</li>
            <li> We did have to wash them with a little shampoo when they arrived because of the plastic type smell</li>
            <li> Sleeping in them is no fun!</li>
            <li> Some pieces got into the little tube &#x27;things&#x27; but others got stuck.</li>
            <li> They are also a little longer than the curlformers that i have.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to get used to but</li>
            <li> i have curly hair(spanish) and my hair comes out like if I did little rollos on each curl..</li>
            <li> Hoping to give them another shot soon when i have a little time.</li>
            <li> The wand was a little bit if a challenge for me to disconnect once I put it together</li>
            <li> The plastic is a little firmer than curlformers</li>
            <li> Get two packs if your hair is curly/kinky/ coily so you can use little sections.  </li>
            <li> I can see how you could break it with little care</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice but with in one use I was a pro.</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed that they would take over a month to get here.</li>
            <li> So I found these on Amazon for less then half the price that I paid!</li>
            <li> All I did was add a little oils to my hair and put the curl formers in.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, you will look like you stepped out the salon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a little while to receive the order</li>
            <li> This set, I could take little clumps of hair at a time, pull them through.  </li>
            <li> ONLY complaint is that it took like a month for me to get mine !</li>
            <li> They do not hold tightly to the hair and they are not as firm a curl.  </li>
            <li> I usually do mines when my hair is very wet.</li>
            <li> If you pull too hard on it while you are threading, it separates leaving you with a mess partially in and out of the curler and half the hook inside!</li>
            <li> i must admit i had a little trouble getting used to them in the beginning</li>
            <li> I just use a little bit of Nairobi setting foam or the fluffy shea butter</li>
            <li> the only negative being that the  hook is very delicate and may break apart on rough handling .&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I have yet to find the knock off version of the extra wide and long :-(</li>
            <li> Nothing negative regarding the product, they work very well, I just ordered the wrong size...  </li>
            <li> These curlers are very difficult to open and, if you are not extremely careful with the rod, you will pull your hair out while attempting to pull your hair through the curler.  </li>
            <li> &quot; if you&#x27;re having trouble with the installation.</li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube vids before these arrived so I would know how to use them once they came.  </li>
            <li> i would give 4.5 stars because of the few defects.</li>
            <li> The curlers can be a bit heavy which adds to it.</li>
            <li> So while these do work, I think the cons of hurting your head and pulling your hair are a bigger problem with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Some of the pressure on your scalp is decreased if you have the curlers a bit further from your head, but then you have tugging on the hair.</li>
            <li> I watched a few youtube video to get the hang of using these curler.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it turns out too heavy and causes the curls to fall quicker.</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting my hair into these curlers.</li>
            <li> I watched a few videos on youtube to learn how to put them in, and I will say they are not comfortable to sleep in, but they do work well.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> It wasnt inoperable just missing a lil piece.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that you shouldn&#x27;t put any heavy products or leave in conditioners while installing these.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I watched a few YouTube vids before these arrived so I would know how to use them once they came.</li>
            <li> I also would suggest watching a few “how to” YouTube videos on using them.</li>
            <li> Each time I ended up giving up about 4&#x3D;5 hours into it because they are so heavy and because they pull on the hair.  </li>
            <li> I decided that it was the product I added to my hair, which is a homemade, heavy shea butter and oils</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> I wasted money.</li>
            <li> it is not comfortable to sleep with, but</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to sleep in at all, though.  </li>
            <li> these feel like they will hold up well over time unlike my curlformers which a few have already broke.</li>
            <li> However, a few of my curlers were missing the rubber tips.</li>
            <li> Leave in for a few hours and pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Put these in when you have a few hours of house work to do, or lay around watching movies.</li>
            <li> I had trouble with this item&lt;</li>
            <li> So far, not impressed.</li>
            <li> Its not cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Got this Hair Curler Spiral Ringlets a few months ago</li>
            <li> When I finally got them all to stay and went to sleep in them I was exhausted.</li>
            <li> I tried these on towel dried hair with cantu leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I watched quite a few while waiting for my curlers</li>
            <li> I took me at least 2 tries to learn how to put them in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> waste your money on buying the &amp;#34;Curlformers&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I can NEVER get my hair to keep curls over a few hours.</li>
            <li> and I did have trouble with my ends getting fuzzy, but that may be technique.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try these out before attending a wedding, but this will not happen because the event is in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> Also, the many people who complained about them being difficult to use must be doing it wrong.  </li>
            <li> This gave fat limp curls.</li>
            <li> Also, they are extremely heavy once you are done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse if you have a big head.</li>
            <li> It is not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> They feel and look just like the name brand ones so don&#x27;t waste your money on them.</li>
            <li> I put a few in just to try them out</li>
            <li> They work well but are not comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> You need to leave them in for a while while your hair dries, and I am impatient.</li>
            <li> After doing a few I found my groove</li>
            <li> I ordered some narrow curlformers</li>
            <li> tried using these with freshly-washed, 95% dried hair, and fully dried hair.</li>
            <li> They are not comfortable to sleep in, but I already have sleep issues.  </li>
            <li> One of the curlers was missing a piece</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> so I would recommend watching a few you-tube videos to understand how to use.</li>
            <li> and they did curl but not greatly because there just wasn&#x27;t enough moisture</li>
            <li> A few things about me to give you some context for my comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having to wait for my \\&quot;round</li>
            <li> It was flimsy and not smooth</li>
            <li> I watched a few videos on how to use them</li>
            <li> Definitely not comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> It took a few attempts to get my hair to thread through the spiral rod, but I will use again.</li>
            <li> I watched a couple of YouTube videos a few days ago</li>
            <li> similar, even worse, results.</li>
            <li> but once the curlers get used a few times the hook goes through easier.</li>
            <li> I watched a few youtube videos about curlformers that were helpful.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve for using this product, but don&#x27;t be too impatient.</li>
            <li> One of my curlformers was missing the plastic tip</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t any trouble to attach and took me about 20 - 30min to get them all on.</li>
            <li> A few of them have since torn</li>
            <li> but i have messed arounf with them and put a few on my hair and none&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> Enough to do all of my thick, longish hair and 80% of my friend&#x27;s thick,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge deal but still an inconvenience.</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulder so there were a few that I had to pull down from the root because the ends were sticking out from the roller.</li>
            <li> I just washed them before using, and used the name brand stick, since those were two of the concerns usually raised in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> any heat damage).The style usually lasts me about 4 days (which is typically when I wash my hair again).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re still paying less than you would at Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> But, just like other curlers, they are a bit hard to sleep on.  </li>
            <li> Sleeping in the curlers are quite a challenge due to the hard plastic material</li>
            <li> After two hours of struggling, I was frustated for so much time I wasted, had a headache, and my thumb was nearly numb from pushing the small rubber opening to pull the hair through with the wand.</li>
            <li> There are no written directions but a YouTube search will provide provide demonstrations from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need a spray bottle with PLAIN water to dampen your hair if it dries before you get to the sections to use the curlers.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve used foam rollers, but I have to put them in so tight</li>
            <li> No more awkward crimped or straight ends.</li>
            <li> In the morning I pulled the formers off, which were snagging and breaking hair, and the curls were very slight</li>
            <li> not easy at all</li>
            <li> I decided the curls were a little too small for my hair to work out,  </li>
            <li> With the other kit, I tended to try to pack the hair into the few long curlers I had, resulting in sometimes uncomfortably pulling on the Kid&#x27;s hair, to the point she didn&#x27;t want to use them anymore.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it came with only one half of the hook that is used to pull the hair through.  </li>
            <li> They were not as tight as I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied though!</li>
            <li> , it was hard and pulled at my scalp when i laid down and</li>
            <li> They smell pretty bad.</li>
            <li> My first attempt wasnt bad..</li>
            <li> I first ordered these, I was frustrated.  </li>
            <li> So as an advise for thin hair, use some gel.&lt;br /&gt;Great length for long hair</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is so thick and down to her bum.</li>
            <li> Im giving 4 out of 5 because the rod is hard to put together and mine snapped in half</li>
            <li> the back was difficult but just watch  few youtube videos</li>
            <li> the only negative was two rollers came broken without the ends.</li>
            <li> The ends are extremely stiff, making it difficult to hold the rods in the open position while you&#x27;re trying to remove your hair from them.  </li>
            <li> They were a little hard to work with though</li>
            <li> However, the curlers are longer than the hook which makes it a little hard to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> The pack for my daughter was missing the bottom half of the hook, not a big deal but disappointing.</li>
            <li> It curled my hair with very little product.</li>
            <li> Used these yesterday on damp hair/ long/ thick with a little mousse.</li>
            <li> They were not very tight and they would just clump up into one giant curl which I hate.</li>
            <li> I think my hair is a little too thick for these because I had to make small sections for them to be inserted without getting stuck.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, i really like this product and sleeping with them is not as bad as i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I was not going t pay $70 for the real ones and was shocked to find these knock off brand here for $14</li>
            <li> I have no perm in my hair and was SHOCKED to see how straight my hair was after using these and how well the curl formed.  </li>
            <li> After two attempts, it became easier to use them - use small sections.</li>
            <li> and I have to use small sections</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that the styling hook was difficult to snap apart after.</li>
            <li> I had such a difficult time putting these in my hair.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not sure which size to get...</li>
            <li> Insert the rod into the curler, hook a small amount of your hair, and pull your hair through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are name brand</li>
            <li> The fact that the rod pulls the hair through the curl former just says that if you use it wrong, there will be damage.</li>
            <li> I have already these two times in the past month.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem sleeping in them because I don&#x27;t usually twist and turn when I sleep.</li>
            <li> ‘These worked just as well as if not better than the name brand ‘Curlformers but at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> hair is thick and heavy</li>
            <li> The hair seems to catch onto the material :/</li>
            <li> The hook was too small for the curlers and because I bought them through amazon, the company wouldn&#x27;t help me.  </li>
            <li> Take a small section of hair</li>
            <li> did not break as I read in the past.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try Curlformers for a while but couldn&#x27;t get past the price for a set.</li>
            <li> and you need to grab small portions of hair (</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage is if you choose to sleep on the curlers they are uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can fault the quality or not.  </li>
            <li> I found these extremely difficult to use, despite watching several YouTube tutorials.</li>
            <li> but I was never able to get one in my hair.</li>
            <li> ( I have used the brand curlformers in the past).</li>
            <li> There was a small hiccup with my order</li>
            <li> Am not sure if I will use it again.</li>
            <li> They were in convenient and small packaging.</li>
            <li> But in comparison to the name brand expensive ones, I would definitely purchase these again over those.</li>
            <li> These are very similar to curl formers, they are difficult to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Not really my favorite</li>
            <li> I usually do Bantu knots as my go-to, no-heat, curl style.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get my hair into the formers because (even after de-tangling and combing for several minutes)</li>
            <li> I put a small pump on each strand before I rolled.</li>
            <li> The only reason why this product did not get 5 stars is because it took me a while to figure out how to use them and they are really uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I usually sleep on it overnight</li>
            <li> my hair relaxed is just past arm pit length</li>
            <li> not sure.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that they were really uncomfortable for me to sleep in them.</li>
            <li> Also, I bought these in February 2014, so I don&#x27;t know if the packaging has changed, but I was a bit disappointed the packaging was just all the curlers stuffed into a large sandwich bag, but...</li>
            <li> Makes it very hard to do the job since it&#x27;s half the length.  </li>
            <li> After my hair completely dried in the curlers I took then out to discover firm  curls as promised however you had to be careful not to brush or comb it because it would cause your hair to frizz and puff out like CRAZY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried small bundles and thick bundles and every time, it just twists my hair and pulls it.</li>
            <li> : the wand is slightly tough to put together and oddly, it can come apart while you are putting the rod in your hair.</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;t give it 5 stars because sleeping was near impossible..</li>
            <li> It was slightly painful having them on and while I do like the results, it&#x27;s not worth the potential damage these could cause to my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was slightly damp trying these and that made it even worse pulling the hair through.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is something I would use on a regular basis because application can be long and annoying.</li>
            <li> Have have a hard time with my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> did like the product it wasn&#x27;t hard to sleep in</li>
            <li> , mine hardly ever bends.</li>
            <li> The curlers are hard and no matter which way I moved they were pushing on my head and face.</li>
            <li> I even cut my finger on the hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Hard to sleep in too.</li>
            <li> hard to sleep in....</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t hard to install at all.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to use, and my hair wash&#x27;t tangled.</li>
            <li> Also hard to take off.</li>
            <li> Hard to do</li>
            <li> They are hard to sleep in</li>
            <li> If it escapes the hair will get stuck and you will pull your hair hard.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely hard to curl and tougher to keep a curl.  </li>
            <li> but none of the products have made it hard to take these off once the set is done.</li>
            <li> They are to hard to sleep in.</li>
            <li> These were really hard to put in my curly hair.</li>
            <li> but then it might be hard to store.</li>
            <li> It was hard to sleep the 1st time I used them.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try to sleep in these because they are a hard type plastic and your head and neck might ache in the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also prone to migraines and headaches if I yank on my hair too hard.  </li>
            <li> I just had a hard time sleeping with them.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves having her hair curled, but I have a hard time getting her hair to hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> The curlers themselves are soft and not too bad to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid these will not will hold up after several uses</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have short hair, leaving 2 to 3 inches of unnecessary weight on the ends of my hair when I put them on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also seen some people leave negative comments about the hook, which I don&#x27;t agree with.</li>
            <li> Before you attempt any styling please set aside at least an hour to get the hang of using the wand and rollers.</li>
            <li> I did read negative reviews about hair getting stuck on the hook that comes with this set.</li>
            <li> I would keep them in for at least an hour depending on the thickness of your hair.</li>
            <li> At least that was my experience.</li>
            <li> She uses them at least once a week</li>
            <li> They even offered a 10% off for the late delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the wand sucks..really sucks.</li>
            <li> They were useless slipping off  would not recommend these at all.</li>
            <li> I had curls that looked like I&#x27;d gone to the salon (or at least had used a curling iron).</li>
            <li> Well, they are, at least on my head.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> hair is so thick that I will need to order additional curlers.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and watched all the videos for women with reasonably thick hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know whether my hair was too thick</li>
            <li> This product does not work well for those with unpermed thick nappy hair.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have any problems sleeping in them, but for 2 girls with thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick type 3c/4a hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe is is due to the texture of my hair, but I found these to be useless.</li>
            <li> One of mine was damaged but I mean I have 40</li>
            <li> other concern with these was that they would be too uncomfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry but other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure!</li>
            <li> And even tho they may feel a little hard, for me they are not that uncomfotable to sleep in!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was me or the curlformer itself but 2 of the curlformers had their plastic tips broken off, and I punctured one.</li>
            <li> The hair must be very slick and well for application or the hook will hitch and not pull your hair through the tube.</li>
            <li> Fact, less heat on hair makes stronger hair!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s like putting in perm rods</li>
            <li> So despite the wand making it impossible for you to actually put these things in..</li>
            <li> The plastic molding on this wand looks scary and might snag tightly curled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick very hard to curl hair abd</li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that they are made of a tough plastic, so they are hard to sleep in.</li>
            <li> they are just a little difficult to work with but do work.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> so I was a little skeptical that this would work.  </li>
            <li> she slept on them and said it was a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The wand was a little difficult to use at times</li>
            <li> and I only have shoulder length hair which may not be a bad thing.</li>
            <li> too bad that I big chopped my hair a week after I order it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girl and the only thing bad</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying the expensive brand.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive Curlfromers like I did.</li>
            <li> She was shocked by the low price and the quality of the set.</li>
            <li> Not good for ringlets.</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t get 5 stars because a few maybe two of them were broken!</li>
            <li> This set is definitely not as good.</li>
            <li> Not good to sleep in</li>
            <li> but they take a long time to put on and they are very uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> If I had to do it again I would not make the parts as thick, but also not as thin.</li>
            <li> Especially tight curls, it helps you stretch your hair without he heat of a blow dryer .</li>
            <li> It is VERY poorly made and the pieces do not fit together.</li>
            <li> Hard to sleep in, but my curls came out FAB!</li>
            <li> Also I found that my hair was difficult to pull through if I did not take small sections.</li>
            <li> Beware of trying to sleep on these, it was TERRIBLE the first time.</li>
            <li> Though I had to wait several weeks for the curls to arrive, I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was not looking forward to using curlers because it&#x27;s usually time consuming, uncomfortable and the curls don&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> The hook though, is pretty terrible.</li>
            <li> They work wonderfully on my thick hair!</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is very hard to curl</li>
            <li> Very hard to work with.</li>
            <li> very hard to use.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick</li>
            <li> She does have very thick hair, so 40 may be sufficient for most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also used them on my daughter&#x27;s hair that is very thick</li>
            <li> an African-American woman with very thick, kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I used these on my daughter&#x27;s hair, she is 8 and has very thick hair to her waist.</li>
            <li> I said I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> and I have VERY thick hair.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately just left me with some really ugly curls.</li>
            <li> Product was broken upon arrival...</li>
            <li> The wand on one set has broken already.</li>
            <li> The material is poor quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just put these on last night and they were annoying to install because sometimes the hair just didn&#x27;t go through.</li>
            <li> The wand is a not great quality.  </li>
            <li> I was NOT happy after sleeping on these.</li>
            <li> For storage, they needed to be placed in a container because the thin flimsy plastic it is came in ripped. .</li>
            <li> One was broken which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> those poor curls did not stand a chance.</li>
            <li> they came packaged in a zip-lock bag with none broken or damaged.</li>
            <li> pay the outrageous price for the real deal.  </li>
            <li> it was sooo sleek and straight looking, it was shocking.</li>
            <li> If you are tender headed or have thin hair, I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> broken nor cracked.</li>
            <li> All the hype is false.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I saw this for less than the price of two 8 count Curformer curlers...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as bad as the other reviewers have reported.  </li>
            <li> I do not have any bad odor, as I was worried about from previous reviews.</li>
            <li> I had no problems putting these bad boys on after watching a few YouTube tutorials.</li>
            <li> The ends of them also don&#x27;t grasp too tightly in a horizontal fashion, so you won&#x27;t have the annoying dents in your hair after it dries.</li>
            <li> however it is uncomfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> They are a bit uncomfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the curlers, just need to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about getting some of these</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nothing difficult, you just have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Even though sleeping was extremely difficult and uncomfortable I still would 100% recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the hook</li>
            <li> These curl formers were way too complicated to use.</li>
            <li> When I took my hair out the next day, I hated the results!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I found nothing wrong with the curl formers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wond should be a bit longer cuz I find it difficult to hold my place on the head and scrunch the curler</li>
            <li> This product is clearly an illegal and counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> CURL FORMERS A BIT DIFFICULT.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the least painful sleep option.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to purchase expensive curlformers...</li>
            <li> uncomfortable to sleep in which is why I did not give the 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> a  bit  uncomfortable  but  managed).</li>
            <li> The curlers themselves are incredibly uncomfortable though, so i wouldnt recommend trying to sleep in them.</li>
            <li> The rollers are uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> works just like the expensive versions.</li>
            <li> I used setting lotion on damp hair and sat under the dryer for about an hour, then slept on them (which took some getting used to but wasn&#x27;t terribly uncomfortable).  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it got the job done</li>
            <li> There were no instructions on how to use these, so they are useless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sleep in them, too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was worried that they would bother me throughout the night and feel uncomfortable against my scalp, but this was not the case.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because some were saying it was ripped</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit uncomfortable to sleep so a hair dryer make figure into your beauty equation.</li>
            <li> These work as well as the expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> When it is wrong, it will give you resistance immediately.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with this product, the seller however, didn&#x27;t include all 40 curlers and I cant even use the 39</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely difficult to sleep in them.</li>
            <li> They are horrible to sleep in (despite several tips on youtube).  </li>
            <li> I give it only four stars because it is impossible to sleep in these!!</li>
            <li> I had no clue what to dovso after the fail in using them, I gave them away.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but it was a fail on my part</li>
            <li> They are highly uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> VERY FRUSTRATING TO USE</li>
            <li> Sleeping on them is uncomfortable and the people who don&#x27;t mind it must be crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now lets talk about the stick.. it sucks so bad!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shipping took a while, which was disappointing</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would run out formers before completing.  </li>
            <li> you will have to wash them when you just get them because mine came dirty as in factory floor grime.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to them now!!</li>
            <li> Ehh... The curls look unnatural, and the ringlet formers are extremely uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is 4b or 4a, but it shrinks and fuzzes up terribly.  </li>
            <li> Bought these after I bought the Curlformers, which were way expensive!</li>
            <li> They are very very uncomfortable to sleep on</li>
            <li> It is very uncomfortable to sleep</li>
            <li> therefore it will be very uncomfortable sleeping on these.</li>
            <li> So uncomfortable and annoying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-They are VERY uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use unless someone else is doing it for you.  </li>
            <li> and if was very uncomfortable....</li>
            <li> I put them in before going to bed, but have to say that they are very uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> The curlers do work, however, I found it impossible to sleep with them in.  </li>
            <li> a woman has ever tried rolling her hair with flexirods and then trying to sleep in them, it is nearly impossible.  </li>
            <li> BAD -</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> Not to bad to sleep in either.</li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve known something was going to go bad.</li>
            <li> However, I managed and it wasn&#x27;t that bad for me.</li>
            <li> YouTube was my bestfriend for these bad boys because they did not come with instructions.</li>
            <li> However, at the price, I don&#x27;t feel bad at all for having to discard some curlers.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t to bad to handle, but its tiring.</li>
            <li> application wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> These pulled on my hair really bad.</li>
            <li> These things are extremely painful and they broke my hair.</li>
            <li> , I was so shocked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the results.</li>
            <li> I found myself so frustrated trying to pull these through my hair, and it hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this might work for some people, it is too painful and non-effective for me, so I am returning it and will keep searching for something else.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you are like me and desperately want your hair to curl and nothing else works, give these a go!</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a friend, however I was disappointed by it.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>
            <li> Disappointed with that, will see how my hair comes out.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed, these work</li>
            <li> were my complaints :(</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to give them to one of my friends :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> These curlformers are made with some sort of plastic and heating up plastic can be very dangerous.</li>
            <li> I seen some bad reviews about these breaking or bad quality material not at all for me!</li>
            <li> and I hate putting any type of heat on my hair.</li>
            <li> I found this process annoying</li>
            <li> I got express shipping for these because I&#x27;m going to a formal event, and needed spiral curls for the base.</li>
            <li> I HATE IT.</li>
            <li> made the application process somewhat longer (and annoying).</li>
            <li> still the price is impossible to beat!  </li>
            <li> I used Eco styling gel and my hair hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> If I hooked close to my scalp it pulled horribly and the hair wouldn&#x27;t go into the curler.</li>
            <li> Once I superglued the hook together and asked for help, they were miserable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> It was the worst night&#x27;s sleep</li>
            <li> I bought some from ebay, horrible</li>
            <li> I am terrible at using heating tools and I never get the results I want.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t look at those stupid rollers without getting upset all over again!!</li>
            <li> Once I tried it, it ended up horrible.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> BAD IDEA!!!!</li>
            <li> My experience have been pathetic with tribalsensation and would not advise anyone to fall in this loop .All</li>
            <li> I can say is PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE .</li>
            <li> and it is very, very painful!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try sleeping in them, worst mistake ever.</li>
            <li> I made that awful mistake.  </li>
            <li> They are horrible to sleep in</li>
            <li> Very annoying!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These things are extremely painful and they broke my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend sleeping on them, but they take all day to put in so just don&#x27;t buy them at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use as yet, but I heard good things about this product. That it&#x27;s not as hard as the original one its easier to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> This product worked great. At times my hair would tamgle when inserting my hair in the curler. However, once I was able to get the flow of it, it was awesome. My hair turned out beautifully. So glad I didn&#x27;t spend all that money on the curlformers when I got the same results with these. I will invest in a better hook.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Curlformers brand.  And since the material is a little tougher, it may result in smoother curls.  The length is a little longer than the name brand product as well.</li>
            <li> It did not  come with instructions , but I went and found a you tube video on how to use , very easy to use and love the results of my new hair do</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING! I have long, straight, medium fine hair, but I have TONS of it - so much hair! I have tried for years to get curls in my hair with no success. Sock buns, foam curlers, curling around a head band at night, hot curlers, curing irons - literally everything and my hair is straight and flat within an hour. I recently went to get a body wave perm to try that, but couldn&#x27;t because of my highlights. I had given up on my dream of hair with any volume at all, and went with a last effort and tried these. and bam! CURLY HAIR!!!! I wash my hair, apply these and then sleep on them (Not the most comfortable, but hey, beauty is pain, right!) Day 1 is ringlet type hair, it falls out through the day, but I am on day 3, and i still have curl and volume - think Kate Middleton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using a product the first time I did this, and the curl held a bit better, but my hair felt awful. Not wanting to spend more $ I tried this time with no product, following a deep conditioning treatment, and it is still holding day 3! I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are like me and desperately want your hair to curl and nothing else works, give these a go! Life changer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the stick thing, it comes in two parts, and there were several times that it came apart mid application, so I was stuck trying to get my hair and the remaining half out of the curler. I may try to superglue, or purchase a name brand one.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm for a fraction of the name brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen the results of these on an acquaintance. Her hair looked great, she told me what she used, I ordered them. Well, these particular ones didnt come with instructions----- useless. At some point I will google how to use them and learn from YouTube, but sometimes it&#x27;s nice to have good old fashion directions.</li>
            <li> I love the curls these give.  They do take a little getting used to but once you got it it will only take a few minutes to do your whole head.  You have to be careful you don&#x27;t select to large a section or you will end up with a know trying to pull it through.  Also be sure to twist the hair just a bit.  Remember the pink are for the left and orange are for the right.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install once you get the hang of it. My only complaint is that they began to hurt my scalp after a while, so I would recommend drying the hair instead of air drying or sleeping on them overnight. Other than that, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend an arm and a leg for the CurlFormers, because my curls were perfect and bouncy and shiny just like they should be!</li>
            <li> These worked pretty good, although it is a little time consuming if you have a lot of long hair like I do.  Takes practice.  But these work fine.</li>
            <li> Do not buy the name brand, these work great and at a fraction of the cost. They are very easy to install and you can go on youtube and search \\&quot;curlformers\\&quot; if you&#x27;re having trouble with the installation. I have natural 4b hair and it made my hair look like I flat ironed it prior but I didn&#x27;t! These are well worth it. Beware they are some other off brand \\&quot;curlformers\\&quot; that are not made of the same material and do not work as well so just do your research before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Loved these curlers! After two attempts, it became easier to use them - use small sections. They worked amazingly! Perfect curls each time. I didn&#x27;t use any heat, so letting them thoroughly dry was very important to making sure the curls were perfect! I&#x27;m addicted to them now!! You have to try these!</li>
            <li> for a knock off the product actually does quite well. My hair is very long and these are great for the price. My only complaint i received 3broken ones that were unusable then on first use 2more broke. Expident shipping considering coming from china.</li>
            <li> I have to say these are the same as the real Curlformers at the fraction of the price. I highly recommend them...</li>
            <li> item did not come wit instructions but i watched some videos on youtube and with a little practice it became really simple to put in. Creates really nice drop curls. I&#x27;ve learnt that ensuring that the hair is wet helps the hair pull through easily without breakage.</li>
            <li> I love these things!! It was tricky at first to get them in but I got the hang of it!! I will be ordering another set pretty soon!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I watched a few YouTube vids before these arrived so I would know how to use them once they came.  Needless to say, they were easy to use.  I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product at all and it defiantly is worth the price however it is uncomfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> These curlers are no joke! Such a great product and worth the buy! I recommend these curlers to those who want to create a effortless style without the hassle as well as saving money.</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully in my fine hair (after adding a bit of gel and curl lotion for hold and softness).  Sleeping isn&#x27;t terribly comfortable with them in, but it&#x27;s not terrible (an old pillowcase used as a turban can keep the curlers up and out of the way and under control).  They can also be used with a bonnet dryer for quicker results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the fact that these aren&#x27;t the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; version, the quality may be a little off.  Some of the curlers I received had tiny frays.  However, they have not bent out of shape, nor has the wand punctured any during use.  However, the cost more than makes up for it in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that these came in varying widths.</li>
            <li> For the price this is fantastic, especially through Amazon prime. I bought some similar off/no brand curl-former&#x27;s that came 16 in a pack and it was enough so I found these and though i would give them a try. My kit came with 2 wands that are still in tact after 2 uses. My curlers had no odor, but still washed with shampoo just to remove any product residue. about 2 of them were defect on one end so i just used the other side. I can&#x27;t compare them to the real curl-former&#x27;s bc I have never used them, but these work perfectly for the styles that I want to achieve. i would give 4.5 stars because of the few defects. most definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> These curlers and built well and seem like they would last a long while of use. However, this method of curling... like most methods... isn&#x27;t as easy as you expect. I have straight thick hair and used the entire set on my head. You can&#x27;t pull too much through one curler or you get a tangled mess. And even when you think you got a good curl, the when you release the curler from your hair some still come out frizzy and not the sleek curl I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These are really worth the money! It only took a little over a week for these to arrive and the curls turned out really pretty. The only complaint I have is that they were really uncomfortable for me to sleep in them. But other than that I&#x27;m glad I found this brand and didn&#x27;t have to buy the ones that were more expensive. They work just as well.</li>
            <li> Unless you want to take the extra time to do this every day, I would recommend special occasions and when you want to have a girly spa type night.  They are fairly straight forward and you have to decide on how much hair to get through the tube.  The first time takes a bit, but after that, it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I bought these instead of the name brand. They work the same and the came earlier than expected, which is a plus. Would recommend this.</li>
            <li> 4c natural hair. Worked as expected and was easier to put in than expected. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> These work exactly like the pricey Curlformers curlers! They are easy to put in and make darling curls and are a great price! Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> 1) You don&#x27;t have really fine hair&lt;br /&gt;2) You don&#x27;t want to sleep in them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do a great job of putting curl in your hair. I&#x27;ve put them in dry hair and wet hair. Dry hair you need at least an hour for them to work. The curls may fall a bit, but I think this also depends on your hair. Wet hair you&#x27;ll need two hours. Both of these also depend on how much hair you put in each curler. I tried to use more curlers with less hair in them, and that seemed to work pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;These can hurt your head a bit. To get the best results you need them close to your scalp, which therefore pulls on your head. The curlers can be a bit heavy which adds to it. When you put the curlers in you get a lot of bulk on your head which is why I don&#x27;t recommend sleeping in them.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that is a bit thin at the moment. So while these do work, I think the cons of hurting your head and pulling your hair are a bigger problem with thin hair. Some of the pressure on your scalp is decreased if you have the curlers a bit further from your head, but then you have tugging on the hair. So, again, if you have more hair I think these would be really great, but if you have a really sensitive scalp or thin hair, I&#x27;d say no.</li>
            <li> Curls are beautiful and natural looking. I I brought these because they were cheater then the curlformers but after using them I&#x27;m glad I did. They are easy to use and make natural hair look beautiful without the heat.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  Watched youtube videos and thought it seemed straight-forward.  Received item late (!) even though I paid for expedited shipping.  Opened package to discover that the wand enclosed it to short to use with curling tubes.  Also hair seems to get caught easily in tubes.  There is no way to contact seller and request new wand.  Have to return completely.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The curl formers are in good condition and shipped very quickly, they were easy to put in and are comfortable, and they work really well.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very pleased with the product.  I helped her with her hair and it turned out great!!  Thanks, and it was great doing business with you!</li>
            <li> These curlers was very affordable and easy to use once you got the hang of it.  Would not recommend sleeping in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a while and I finally tried them and I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the outcome. As an AA with natural hair, stretching my hair is important and these generic curlformers did the trick although they hurt to sleep in. My spiral curls came out  nice, but I warn you all that the process of putting these in can take a while and you have to be careful to not pull to much hair through the roller. Although I wouldn&#x27;t use these every week, I will use them for occasional styling. I hope to buy another pack soon and no none have broken but be sure to assess the hook hat comes with theses because the flaws on it could rip through your roller, I already has a Curlformer hook and the one that came with these was a great addition to my process after I filled down some of the hard plastic deformities. I love them!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the greatest invention EVER! I have natural hair and I don&#x27;t use a lot of product or heat. So its nice to wash my hair and set it in the curlformes.  They are really easy to use and very quick. Took me around 30-45 minutes and I have a LOT of hair. I have also slept in them and they are pretty comfy, relatively speaking. I would definitly buy them.</li>
            <li> These Curler are amazing, the learning curve isn&#x27;t that difficult, one thing I realized is that if your having trouble you should probably use less hair in each spiral, but I love the heat less curls it looks like I just left the beauty shop when I take them out, I use on slightly damp hair and when it dries i take em out, ordered two sets so I can have a head full of curls that last for the week! cant beat that price!</li>
            <li> I purchased these after viewing a site that discussed how to curl hair without heat as my hair has been heat damaged from years of using a curling iron. There were no directions included on how to use them. I Googled instructions on how to use them, but no luck. I did find instructions for Curlformers which are essentially the same thing. These fell out of my head after wearing them around the house at night. I made multiple attempts. They don&#x27;t stay in. Maybe is is due to the texture of my hair, but I found these to be useless.</li>
            <li> This product is great and it makes my hair very curly but they take a long time to put on and they are very uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> The advertisement clearly says a roller pack of 40 in the title. However I only got 20. Had I would&#x27;ve known this I would have bought a pack of 40.</li>
            <li> I have natural 3c/4a hair.  I set my hair on them and they work.  Why pay the high price for the same results!</li>
            <li> The Curlformers prices are high, but it&#x27;s an investment worth making in my opinion. These counterfeit curlformers are a far inferior product than Curlformers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The hook is made of incredibly cheap, flimsy plastic.&lt;br /&gt;* Mesh and coil quality are low-grade and not like the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;* Hair snags and is harder to pull through the coil unlike the real thing.</li>
            <li> Curls hair the same as curlformers. Love them. The material is not as soft as the curlformers, but it makes a better curl.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother to spend $60.00+ on the name brand curlers! These things are excellent. I have shoulder-length, wavy and sometimes frizzy hair. It takes me less than 30 minutes to put these curlers in. I let them sit in my hair for about four hours while I go about my business around the house. When I pull them off, my hair is beautifully curled! I&#x27;ve tried them on my niece&#x27;s thin hair and they worked great as well. This is a great purchase if you&#x27;re looking to curl your hair without heat! There are tons of tutorials on YouTube if you need help on putting them in or removing them.</li>
            <li> The curl is amazing and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Go ahead and try. The actual curl in my hair lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Have have a hard time with my daughter&#x27;s. Not anymore! Her hair looks wonderful . Thank  you for the great price.</li>
            <li> So far I think this was a great choice. I&#x27;ve been dealing with attempting to get nice spiral curls with my natural texture (while attempting to avoid harsh heating elements like curling irons and blow dryers). This did the trick. Was very simple to use although the needle the threads the hair does seem a little flimsy</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I wanted an easy way to style my hair without heat. I have curly/coily hair. I watched a few youtube video to get the hang of using these curler. Well let me tell you my hair came out beautiful. The curls were smooth and shiny. I do not use hairspray so the set only lasted 2 days. I do however love these curlers and would definitely purchase again. I would recommend these for anyone who wants beautiful curls without using heat. The only con is they were not comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try Curlformers for a while but cannot see myself paying that amount for them. I say Naptural75 do a review on Vakind Hair Curlers and decided to purchase them. First of all the delivery was FAST. I ordered them on a Saturday I received them the Tuesday!. I can say that it takes a few times to get the technique down but after that I was a pro. They are a bit uncomfortable to sleep in so if you do not have anyhting to do let them air dry or sit under a hooded dryer. I can say I truley LOVE the results and got many a compliment from them. My hair was soft and strait at the roots. Hopes this helps</li>
            <li> I am quiet pleased with the amout of curlers. I have a lot of hair and I got so many that I know I wont run out of them. I got them on time if not early.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and make beautiful curls in any texture of hair. My hair is thick so 40 was just enough to do it all!</li>
            <li> My hair came out great lasted a couple of days.... Great Buy!!I wasn&#x27;t sure my hair would come out the way it did. I was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> The rollers were delivered BEFORE the promised date. The rollers were well made, as was the enclosed hook and sold for a great price. I tried out the rollers which were easy to use and produced my desired result. I would highly recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered these they work perfectly. They shipped fast, and neatly packaged. I had just the right amount for my full naturally kinky curled hair. These are a great buy</li>
            <li> Great! I have not tried the Curlformers, but from what I see, they look like the exact same thing. They were very easy to use and made the cutest spiral curls!</li>
            <li> I am growing out a relaxer and therefore am avoiding using heat as much as possible. I&#x27;ve had the original &amp;#34;curlformers&amp;#34; in my Amazon shopping cart for weeks. I have a lot of mid-back length hair and I knew that one pack would not do it. I just couldn&#x27;t pay $140 for curlers! Plus, I saw a review by a trusted natural hair care reviewer on youtube who compared both brands and found that Vakind work just as well if not better. So I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two packs of the Vakind Hair Curlers. I received 40 curlers (orange/pink) and a black hook in each package. (Packaging was basically a big ziploc bag:) I didn&#x27;t see any difference in width between the curlers but I did notice that the pink rollers were shorter which didn&#x27;t work for my hair (the ends were sticking out). So I had to work with only the orange ones which was fine. I had enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD - It took me a minute to get the hang of things but I used my curlers on freshly washed, towel damp hair and got amazing results. The curlers delivered for sure. My hair is transitioning and I have a lot of relaxer left at the ends, so a few curls dropped by the next day. I just curled a few more pieces of my hair again at bedtime and in the morning I had amazing ringlets once again! They definitely do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD - My only problem with this product is that the rubber ends of some of the curlers have already started to pull away from the netting part of the curler. This happened with two curlers so far after only one use. I&#x27;m afraid these will not will hold up after several uses and I&#x27;ll have to purchase more. Also let me be clear that I haven&#x27;t used original curlformers, so I don&#x27;t know for sure that they may not have the same issue, but I do know that many reviewers I&#x27;ve watched using them have had their curlers for 2 or 3 years and have never made the complaint about &amp;#34;tearing&amp;#34; that this product is getting. BUT you could buy another set of these curlers and still not spend what you would on the originals -- so it&#x27;s a personal decision. I hope this review helps:)end what you would on the originals -- so it&#x27;s a personal decision. I hope this review helps:)</li>
            <li> These really do work.  Takes a bit of time getting used to using them and sometimes I have a hard time pulling my daughter&#x27;s hair through it, but mostly have the knack now.  These curls are little tight for my taste, so will try to next size up.  For the price though so worth trying and having in the arsenal of hair products.</li>
            <li> DO NOT wear these to bed. Oh my gosh, it felt like there were little people in my hair just ripping it out alllllll night. I was up most of the night trying to find a comfortable way to lay my head down. By 5am I got up and had to take them out, my neck and scalp was so sore all day! Also, the hair went straight within a couple hours. Now I only put in about 4 at night to give my hair a little volume. There are tons in one pack and I can&#x27;t imagine anyone needing all of them, so if you have lots of hair and a tough scalp, these will be a great investment!</li>
            <li> As i write this review three months after receiving the item, i have not used it yet. Why?? They are too long for my hair and the curls may end up too big. I am transitioning to natural and these long rods only go 1/4 the length f the rod. I will write another review after i use them.</li>
            <li> Save your money and purchase the Vankind version of the curlformers!  They work wonders on my African American 4b hair texture!</li>
            <li> I only received part of the hair hook the tool with my order.  Fortunately, I had ordered an additional smaller set of curl formers which came with the complete tool. Otherwise, I would not have been able to use the curlers without buying the tool separately. The huge difference in cost if I had purchased the curl formers from the beauty supply store still makes this a good purchase though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet. However, they appear to be very similar to the Curlformers which I returned as soon as I learned about Vakind. They are about an inch longer and maybe a couple of millimeters narrower. I&#x27;ll update this review after I use them. I&#x27;m giving them a 4 before using them because they were only $18 for a set of 40 vs. $70 at Sally Beauty.</li>
            <li> A co-worker told me about these.  If you&#x27;re curious, go to youtube and google curlformers or spiral curls.  These are a great way to get your hair full of spiral curls without damaging your hair with heat.  They are easy to use.  I would suggest having wet hair, and plan on sleeping on them (not so comfortable, but you get used to it over time).  You might also use a setting gel on each piece of hair you use in a curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You thread what looks like a large crochet hook through the curler, and twist a section of your hair, then hook your hair and pull it through the curler.  The curler automatically springs into a curl and your hair dries.  It probably pulls out a little hair  overall, but so does brushing and washing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to take the curlers out and leave your hair for 30 minutes before styling it.  I like to separate the curls into smaller sections of curls for more volume.  I love these and think they are fun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t spend money on curlformers when these exist. They got my 4a/b mixed natural hair super straight in perfect ringlets. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try these out!</li>
            <li> I liked the curlers but didn&#x27;t receive the the hook. I had to go purchase one from sallys.Other than that...I love them.</li>
            <li> 1. The ETA was from Feb 6.-20. BUT I received it about a week and a half ago. (about 10 days after ordering)&lt;br /&gt;2. 5 minutes in and my hair already started to curl (without a holding product!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WILL ADD TO THIS REVIEW ONCE I USE THEM AGAIN. I&#x27;M GETTING BOX BRAIDS SO IT MAY TAKE AWHILE.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT!  So easy to use and the curls are awesome!  My daughter who has very straight hair slept in these and took them out in the morning- she had curls ALL DAY!</li>
            <li> I read a great deal of reviews before deciding to place my order for these curlformers. Based on the fact that my hair is very thick, 4a type hair that is responding SUPER well to a hair steamer I recently bought- I figured 2 packs of these curlers  would be plenty.  I invested 6 bucks in my local Sally Beauty store to pick up two of the actual Curlformer- brand hooks- this was just my personal&lt;br /&gt;Preference. Now that my order has arrived, I can certainly feel and see the difference in quality between the hooks. I could&#x27;nt stand to throw the perfectly good Vakind hooks away, so into the recycle bin they went to re-purposed in some other way.&lt;br /&gt;My order came so quickly,  and I took the time to sit down and review the quality/condition of every last one of my 80 curlers. They were all the same size , in brand new condition and I could not be happier with my purchase. I&#x27;ll pick out a new storage container to keep them in because one of the bags split open during transit , all in all. I would recommend this product to EVERYONE! Thank you for your excellent care and concern every step along the way JLTECH1 , I truly appreciate it :-)</li>
            <li> Product gives great curls. It took me a couple of trails to determine how big of sections I needed to part my hair in. My hair is very thick and I have to use small sections or it was a fight to get me hair in the curl former.</li>
            <li> These are exactly the same as the curl formers that are sold in beauty supply stores. BUT, they are a quarter of the price!  Instead of $69.00 I paid a much lower price &amp; got the same exact product!  Very happy with these!</li>
            <li> I had purchased a small started kit from Sally&#x27;s but was too expensive to as many curlers that I needed. Saw these on Amazon and they are just the same as the more expensive kind. They worked well on my 4 c coily hair. Make sure you have enough setting spray on your hair so the curls will last. You will need a good amount of time to allow your hair to dry otherwise the curls will not come out at all.  I allow my to air dry (6-8 hours). Not the most comfortable to sleep in. Next time I will sit under a bonnet  dryer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money trying to get a brand name when these ate just as great. Love em... Great deal.</li>
            <li> I got my package really fast and I love these rollers. Just like what all the other reviews said, you can&#x27;t sleep in these rollers. I sat under a hooded dryer and then removed them. It does take practice with these rollers. Watch YouTube videos on how to place them on the hair and, how to remove them off the hair.  The Curl Formers brand are normally $50.00 to $60.00 dollars. So, I&#x27;m really pleased to find these rollers a lot cheaper. :)</li>
            <li> these work great!! if trying to go natural curlformeres are the way to go. they are so amazing. love them.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair and I hate putting any type of heat on my hair. These were easy to use and my hair came out with nice and smooth curls. I do wish there were just a few more because my hair is so dense. Also I found that my hair was difficult to pull through if I did not take small sections. Most of all, the product did exactly as described and did it well so it deserves five stars.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly every time.  Delivery and service was good.  I was familiar with the more (much) more expensive brand, and this works just as well.  I just washed them before using, and used the name brand stick, since those were two of the concerns usually raised in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> These are awesome and work well. Took me a couple of tries to get it down. It works best if you partition the hair off and clip up the top part as you work up from the bottom. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because they aren&#x27;t the most comfortable to sleep on. They&#x27;re kind of stiff, but at least they don&#x27;t fall out. *NOTE: The two different colors mean that the hair curls in opposite directions.*</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these.  She has really long thick hair, and one set is enough. We bought two sets just to be safe, but haven&#x27;t needed them yet. It doesn&#x27;t seem to take her long to put them in her hair. She&#x27;s able to sleep with them, but daughter #2 can&#x27;t stand to. If the hair is a little long and the ends stick out, you can just quickly curl those tips with a curling iron before or after removing the magic curlers.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this purchase. Item arrived ahead of schedule. I have use twice and loved the outcome. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any difference in the outcome in using the orginal product. Take a little practice to get the hang of how to use the product. The key to not having breakage is to NOT try to thread TOO much hair into one Former.  For longer lasting sets, use some type of holdin gel or setting lotion on damp hair.  Do not remove the Former until the hair is fully dry.</li>
            <li> I got this product from the House Sweety seller fairly early, 2 days after the earliest arrival date. The product was in great condition, but there&#x27;s a high learning curve. It took me 2 hours to get 25 into my hair, which covered my whole head. I have shoulder length relaxed hair and the curlers were more than enough for my hair. For my hair, I had to place the hook an the end of my hair and slide it up. Placing it any higher on my hair resulted in the hook getting tangled into my hair at the scalp and the risk of breaking my hair if I tried to force it. But there&#x27;s nothing wrong with the curlers, just need to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;inspired&amp;#34; curlformers worked great. I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the real curlformers. They worked great, they didn&#x27;t tear and the hook was not flimsy as some others have reported. Mine worked just fine. I had no problems with the hook at all. I hope to purchase more from them in a bigger size! I will NOT buy the expensive curlformers when these are just as good!</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted!! I am a transitioner and so I have to blend too different textures. The nature texture is somewhere in the 4B-4C. It got my hair so nice and smooth, I was so shocked. It was bouncy and nice all the way to the very roots. The application was annoying for a good part of it though. I felt like I was ripping it through for a good portion of my hair. I think I need more practice because it got better as I did it more. I am VERY happy with my purchase and at such a great price too!!</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I had a great result with these formers.  I watched you-tube videos to get help with good techniques on how to use them.  I had a great smooth response!  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair curlers which I know. I am very happy. It is very convenient, quickly and beautifully. I derive a lot of pleasure and beauty. All girlfriends envy me. They are happy me to see. I always in good mood. These are surprising hair curlers. Everything is ingenious and simple.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this set comes with enough formers to curl my entire head! The price is a real deal, totally recommended!</li>
            <li> A must buy!! Please DO NOT spend 3-4x the price for the Curlformers, these are EXACTLY the same. They are very versatile- on dry hair for an hour you&#x27;ll get a soft wave, and worn wet you&#x27;ll get amazing curls. You can use thick sections with less rods for looser curls, or the whole set of them for much smaller and tighter ones. I love this product! I have pin straight hair that has never held any curl, it didn&#x27;t even hold a perm, but these puppies definitely changed that. A must buy for anyone who wants amazing curls and waves, especially if you want to avoid any heat tools.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been wanting these curl formers forever.  They are exactly what she expected, and she loves them.  They&#x27;re easy to use once she got the hang of them, and she likes the results after she uses them.  Also, there is a sufficient number of the curl formers and they are WAY cheaper than you can get them at Sally&#x27;s, and it&#x27;s exactly the same product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying the expensive brand.  these curlers did the job perfectly and without the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> This curler is amazing for African, coarse type hair. I purchased 2 packs because 1 wasn&#x27;t enough. I used mouse and water before adding the curlers. Then I blow dry my hair with the curlers still on. To get light, bouncy curls, I would recommend either using the mouse and water pair or just an oil of your choosing. The trick is to get the hair damp enough to blow dry into curls without getting the hair too wet. Otherwise, it turns out too heavy and causes the curls to fall quicker. I&#x27;ve already recommended this curler to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I Love this Product. I am an African American female with medium length relaxed hair. I love doing roller sets on my hair, especially  rod sets  Unfortunately I can not do a rod set on my own hair, but then when I heard about these!! OMG!!!!!!!!!! I fell in love with the outcome of the curls but I really fell in love when i discovered how easy it is to put them in MYSELF. Anyway I brought this product for the back of my head and I brought the narrow ones (the green &amp; blue) for the front. My product was not defected and I am overall satisfied. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love my curl formers, they work better than I could have hoped for! The picture is accurate for the items I received. It took a little longer than I would have liked to get them, but I am so happy with the product that I don&#x27;t even mind. I used them the first night that I had them and they worked to perfection. I choose to sleep in them with damp hair and some mousse. When I woke up and toke them out I had perfect spiral curls. I ran my fingers through them to make it more wavy, misted some hairspray, and voila amazing and  voluminous waves! The price is so much better compared to the price at Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply, I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants beautiful curls/waves without any heat damage.</li>
            <li> I am a natural with 4C hair and I read a lot of reviews before choosing these over the brand name curlformers. The package arrived within 7 days which was much faster than some of the reviews that claimed it would take two weeks. I also didn&#x27;t have any issues with smell but I did soak them in really hot water and soap as a precaution. The curl rod was very flimsy which is the only reason I gave them a four but I got that from the reviews and had also gone ahead and ordered the brand name rod which worked great. I would definitely recommended spending the extra couple of bucks and getting the real rod. There is no reason to go out and buy the expensive brand name set though, these worked perfectly. They didn&#x27;t come with instructions but I watched so many hours of youtube before and after they arrived that I got the hang of it. I used all 40 in the pack plus 9 extra out of a smaller set I bought after other natural women reviews talked about needing a few more to finish their heads. I am extremely happy with them and after I take them out in the morning I will update my review.</li>
            <li> Good product. Bit of a learning curve. Watch. The vids on You Tube to get some direction. Curls were gorgeous and bouncy. Only a few times where my hair didn&#x27;t pull all the way through. Be careful though, if you&#x27;re not paying attention you might pull,your hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did. :-)</li>
            <li> I LOVE that I can wash, condition and roll my hair with these curlers and my hair results in silky curls. I am a Black American lady with all natural hair. My husband calls this process a miracle!! I have used them on my 7 year old daughter&#x27;s hair, as well, and the same results!! Great product, affordable cost, I will continue use. Fact, less heat on hair makes stronger hair!!!</li>
            <li> Okay I am half Egyptian and half Greek, so you imagine how thick my hair is. On top of thickness I have some crazy kinky curls that are out of control and my hair is super nappy, frizzy, and dry. I honestly did not believe this would work for me, but my mother insisted on buying them from here. When I saw that there was only 40 I laughed because I was so sure there wouldn&#x27;t be enough to do my hair. When all was said and done after my first attempt, I must say I had no problems hooking my hair and pulling it through. Very simple and easy, very fast to catch on to. I had no hair breakage or hair being torn out, you ladies were probably trying to pull too much hair through or didn&#x27;t brush your hair.. idk. Plus I had 3 or 4 curlformers leftover! The end result was immaculate! Talk about perfect curls! I do recommend using some kind of setting cream though so your hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up and plus it adds some extra shine and makes your hair super soft. I personally used the Jane Carter brand, it works wonders! Well hope this was helpful to someone out there. If you have any questions I&#x27;m more than happy to answer. :)</li>
            <li> These create beautiful curls and make styling  a lot easier. The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that they are made of a tough plastic, so they are hard to sleep in.</li>
            <li> These are unique but did what they were intended to do. For my amount of hair I should have purchased an extra pack even though I would have had extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little tricky for the first 3 or 4 but went well afterwards. I slept with them which took a little getting used to&lt;br /&gt;I applied Eden&#x27;s bodywork products and the results were what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Product was broken upon arrival... next time I will purchase the name brand. Did not stay. So no curl happened!</li>
            <li> Love love these! They work so well n give the best curl to my Curley hair! Easy to manage n works well under dryer</li>
            <li> These are great curlers, and just like the real Curlformers but for a fraction of the price. For those wondering if these are the same size as the yellow and pink ones from Curlformers they are NOT! These will provide a spiral curl, not a barrel curl. But if a spiral curl is what you&#x27;re looking for, these are great!</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch! They are great.... And affordable! I might order some more bc I have a big head lol.</li>
            <li> The product works great on natural hair, however the curls did not keep because I have not found the right product to hold them.</li>
            <li> They worked as stated. I loved the way my hair curled up. My curls was nice and loose. It took my hair over night to dry and with the products I used they lasted for about a week.</li>
            <li> Love it...they are so happy with the curls that other people are wanting me to buythem also and they are going away fast</li>
            <li> I order two packs on different days and i got different packing styles.&lt;br /&gt;I got one pack from melodysusie that came with:2 hooks, big duck bull clip and a thank you card.It was very professional.&lt;br /&gt;Then i got the other pack from kkstar (it was about $1.45 more) and it came with a deformed up hook and just one.Also the hook was very flimsy. I was glad I got two from the other pack.&lt;br /&gt;The curl form are also different the melodysusie rolls are a softer then kkstar. but the curls are the same and is really good for all type of hair.</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about getting some curlformers for a while but just could not afford it, i  then saw a review on this and thought why not try them. the shipping was fast, these did not have an odour has most persons had said. The problem  I had though was that they were not long enough and i should have gotten 2 packs. I hope I can find longer and winder ones to hold my waiste length natural 4a/b hair.</li>
            <li> This product arrived TWO WEEKS before the estimated delivery date, that&#x27;s AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long hair to my waist. My hair is very fine and never ever holds a curl for longer than a couple hours. This product works great. It&#x27;s super easy to use. Took me about 20 min to put them in. I love the results, they form such pretty curls and the curls last all day. Do not spend the 60 or 70 dollars on the Curlformers, these are just as good and for a fraction of the price! At first I was skeptical on this off brand, but I&#x27;m glad I went for it. For any of you out there that are still on the fence about getting these I say DO IT! They are great quality and feel like they are going to last forever.</li>
            <li> Ordered it on Thursday &amp; got it today! They&#x27;re in my head right now, very easy to use. YT videos help me with the installing process. They&#x27;re 70$ at Sally&#x27;s &amp; 23.48 on here..I should have bought 2 b/c it wasn&#x27;t enough for my thick nappy bra strap length hair. Now 1/4 of my isn&#x27;t finish. UPDATE- went to Sally&#x27;s, thought I could get 20 for $14 but they has SIX for $15!!! It would not be enough for my hair so I just left. Gonna order me some more today &amp; what I did realize if you have really long hair you might want to go with Sally&#x27;s b/c theirs is longer &amp; in some parts of my hair was the same length as the amazon curlformers so next year I prob won&#x27;t be able to use them.. But overall I&#x27;m happy now 😍😁</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with 4c hair. I recently went natural and these hair curlers make perfect spiral curls. I apply them to newly washed hair and leave them in over night. The only downside is that the curls don&#x27;t last more than 3 days on average - even less if you live in a windy area.</li>
            <li> I love these I most definitely will not pay for curl formers from Sally these are the exact same thing I made a how to on instagram @tina_thegreat for my followers and I most definitely recommend these instead if you&#x27;re trying to look good on a budget plus I ordered a extra hook because there known to break</li>
            <li> worked great.  easy  to  use once I got  the  hang of it. produces curls  that last  on  my  girls  hair  for  three  days.</li>
            <li> Ok, I like to think I am not a complete moron. I bought these knowing they worked well from others recommendations, but not knowing anything else about them. Sure I figured out how to use them, and went on youtube to watch a video, but shouldn&#x27;t there but at least minimal directions with these things? I have pretty long hair, the short layers are to my shoulders and the long layers are down to my lower back, it is semi fine, and straight, and very easy to work with. I had trouble getting my hair into these curlers. If I hooked close to my scalp it pulled horribly and the hair wouldn&#x27;t go into the curler. If I hooked the hair lower down the hair went through, but the top part above the hook didn&#x27;t make it in, and it knotted into a mess.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are in love with the results and we have 2 completely different hair types. It took 1 day of trial and error but now we have the hang of doing it in record time</li>
            <li> Love the end results. Love the way my hair curls after wearing the former overnight.&lt;br /&gt;Its a long process but love the end results.</li>
            <li> I have watched various tutorials on curlformers and the &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; on YouTube, and the general consensus seemed to be that the off brand was just as good if not better than the original! I tried this product out the day after I received it and everything was in good condition. I will say that the wand is hard to put together, and a little awkward to use (especially granted that it was not long enough for the rollers). But all in all I loved the results! I got numerous comments all day in person and through social media. I have and will definitely continue to recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I love the curlformers themselves. Being in college, this is a great alternative. However the hook is very cheap so I&#x27;ll be purchasing a real from the Curlformers website.</li>
            <li> First, watch a YouTube video to get the &#x27;pumping&#x27; action needed to place these. It isn&#x27;t hard, its just nice to see it. Second, these worked well for my waist length thick frizzy hair. But the trick is, place them down and inch or two from your roots otherwise you will have ringlets springing from your scalp. You have to make sure the pieces you thread on are not too thick otherwise they won&#x27;t pull through. And in my case, make sure the sections aren&#x27;t too small so I don&#x27;t have pubic hair frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now lets talk about the stick.. it sucks so bad! It is in two pieces for storage. But!!! If you pull too hard on it while you are threading, it separates leaving you with a mess partially in and out of the curler and half the hook inside! The stick might not be a problem if you have fine silky hair, but if you have thick textured hair, it separated every time! Luckily my husband poked a wire through. The pieces to hold them the wound smooth electrical tape around the wire to lock the together, otherwise I was going to throw them out.</li>
            <li> Saw a youtube vlogger use these on one side of her head with the real curl formers and the other side with these Vakind Hair curlers for the price.....these definitely WIN!!!</li>
            <li> These are just like the curl formers, but at a fraction of the price. I have exstensions and they do not damage them at all. I was my hair every three days and these curls stay in for the full time. It&#x27;s amazing. I do sleep in them which takes some getting used to. Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> I love them. the ones  in the store are so exspensive &amp; i couldn&#x27;t afford them. I did my research &amp; heard amazon had some that worked just as good, for a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;m glad &amp; very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I love these more than baking my cats in the oven! #whitegirlprobs.they came as soon as my cats were done in the oven. very reliable product, unlike my cats.</li>
            <li> It was so worth it!! It curled my hair with very little product. The only thing is, sleeping in them. They were a challenge, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Like many, my first couple of tries were frustrating, but afterwards I was installing these like a pro! Unfortunately 40 wasn&#x27;t enough and I had only realized this after I had done half of my hair, so I will be buying a second pack after the price goes back to the $15-$16 range (it&#x27;s $18 right now, not sure why, and I will not pay the extra $2 lol).&lt;br /&gt;I hope that my next purchase will be as great; I really liked the results on the half of my hair that I did get done since it was almost dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do recommend!</li>
            <li> I use them for cheer, w/a lot of hairspray and it turn out really cute. So yea, and they stay the whole day</li>
            <li> I have a daughter with long hair who loves to curl it.  This product works very well and the curls stay all day.  It takes a little practice to develop the technique, and it&#x27;s easy to pull the hair when you&#x27;re pulling it through the curlers if you try to get too much hair at one time.  It&#x27;s time-consuming, but easy to sleep in and she can remove them herself when she gets up in the morning. One package just gets her whole head done.  I just wish they were about and inch longer so I could always get all her hair in them without any hanging out the end.  This can be overcome by putting the top of the curler a little farther out from the root, but if the curlers were longer, it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> The curlers are wonderful. Very east to use and didn&#x27;t take long to be delievered. Easy to sleep in won&#x27;t give you a headache</li>
            <li> I love the curls I get from these rollers!!! It only took a few tries to get the hang of using the rod but after that it took no time for me to finish my hair. And even tho they may feel a little hard, for me they are not that uncomfotable to sleep in!! My curls where soft and bouncy and that&#x27;s a definite plus!!!</li>
            <li> Ive been natural for five years. most of the time i wear a fro but when i am looking for new techniques to style my hair i search online. I first heard about these on Youtube and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. so. I checked the price at Sally&#x27;s Beauty and they wanted $70 with the Sally&#x27;s beauty club discount. I decided to come on here and see if they had them for a cheaper price, and they did! MUCH more reasonable! I was so impressed with these curlers. I received two wands with the set of curlers and normally I use at least thirty of the forty curlers. No curlers have broken yet, although the wand can be a tricky to disassemble when finished especially since I apply oil to my hair sometimes my fingers slip, but other than that its great!</li>
            <li> I ordered two packs, one for me and one for my daughter. The pack for my daughter was missing the bottom half of the hook, not a big deal but disappointing. Luckly I had an extra hook. Overall great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers. They take forever to put in, but the results are spectacular.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I did like the product it wasn&#x27;t hard to sleep in and the results were what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just have to get used to the hook and find a better technique so I&#x27;m not yanking my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all Very Happy, will re-purchase if needed!</li>
            <li> I bought two packs of these as a Christmas gift for my sister. The order arrived promptly and they are JUST like Curlformers. My only criticism is that the styling hook was difficult to snap apart after. Otherwise, DEFINITELY buy Vankind instead of wasting a ton of money for the name brand.  Curls came out great!</li>
            <li> I have never used the actual Curlformers so I can not compare the two but the curls these rollers create are nice. Be careful with the hook so you don&#x27;t pull your hair out.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and these work great for me! I was having trouble with finding a low maintenance protective style and decided to give these a try. With the use of a little gel my curl will hold well over a week and it doesn&#x27;t take my hair 24 hours to dry! I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Ok, these curl formers are the bomb! I get perfect no heat curls every time I use them. You will defintely need to purchase two packs and there are not nearly enough for one whole head.</li>
            <li> So glad I decided to try this product before purchasing the $70 curl formers from Sally&#x27;s! After doing much YouTube research I was able to correctly use these and my results were awesome! I received soooo many compliments the next day! They are very very uncomfortable to sleep on so if you can avoid it please do so. Other than shipping was fast and the product was just as described! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product works amazing. Just remember to handle with care. It&#x27;s best to buy an additional hair wand. Preferably a curl former one</li>
            <li> They are amazing, they leave my hair in the perfect curl and they leave it so soft. I&#x27;m so glad I chosen these instead of paying so much for curlformers.</li>
            <li> I had such a difficult time putting these in my hair.  First, the curlers constantly slipped off the hook. Once I got a hold on the process, the hook started coming apart.  Once I superglued the hook together and asked for help, they were miserable to sleep in.  To me, it just isn&#x27;t worth the process.</li>
            <li> First, this took forever to apply to my hair. Started at 8 and finished by 11PM. I wish the wand was sturdier though but the ringlets are pretty tough. its not so much the tool but what you use with. my products weren&#x27;t the best the first time around. A cream and an oil would do. I used gel and idk why.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Curls came out perfectly. Easy to use. This product is just as good as the original with an affordable price.</li>
            <li> These work great! My daughter would have me put them in every night if she had her way! These last longer than any other curlers I&#x27;ve used in her hair!</li>
            <li> when i tell you these work mjust as good as the $40+ pack. i tell no lies!!!!! they hold up good</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t own the authentic ones but these work so so well.  My girls love having curly hair!  They have fine thick bone straight hair and no heat is the only way their hair will hold curl.</li>
            <li> Great product...I ordered 1 earlier from Yupengda. It came in a grocery store polythene bag. The curlers were bigger although they worked well. For my first try, they snagged my hair like crazy...I just ordered a second batch on Monday from Amazon on prime and received them today...curlers were smaller in diameter and I love these ones better...came in a neat Ziploc bag. Yet to try them...I think I like the ones from Amazon better.</li>
            <li> My family LOVED my purchase so much that I&#x27;m gonna have to order more, because all of us want to use them at the same time.  The curls were defined and cute.  I did my daughters hair, my sister did her hair and both were awesome. Definitely a KEEPER!</li>
            <li> I watched the reviews on Youtube and took a chance because they aren&#x27;t the Curlformer&#x27;s brand. But I will say they work and the feel of the material seems to be the same. They perform the same. So I got a very good product for much less cost than the name brand.</li>
            <li> I love the results!! I have theses smooth soft &amp;#34;Snoop Dog&amp;#34;looking curls LOL but the are so soft and feminine! This is a genius invention. Thank You!!!! For all the Naturals out there you must have a set in your inventory!!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting these for a while, so I finally decided to go ahead and order them. Every review I have read says these actually work BETTER than curlformers, so that&#x27;s a big thing considering the price difference. That being said, I LOVE THESE, and may order more once my hair gets longer. It got to me in a timely manner, and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this version of the popular &amp;#34;curlformers&amp;#34; because I really love the hairstyles I&#x27;ve seen on youtube using the curlformers, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the curlfrmer price. After reading the reviews on these I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give these a try especially since they didnt look any different than the real curlformers. I want to start off saying that I&#x27;ve only used these once so far and I LOVEEE the results. But here are my issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I noiced that the wand is cheaply made (duh, the set is only $16) and because of this the hook where the hair goes can snag on hair strands. While doing my set, I had a problem with this, but once I clipped off the extra plastic and used a nail filer to smooth it out, it seemed to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I&#x27;m not sure if it was me or the curlformer itself but 2 of the curlformers had their plastic tips broken off, and I punctured one. Either I&#x27;m completely unaware of my own strength (which does happen from time to time. I do break things easily) or they were just  cheaply put together. The ends that broke off were the ones at my roots, so I slipped the curlformers off my hair and redid the process again placing the unbroken end at my roots. No biggie !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) More of a personal issue - I have a lot of hair (it reaches just above my bra strap, but it&#x27;s really thick) so 40 wasnt enough for me. Luckily I had some pink perm rods and they worked just fine. I&#x27;ll probably order another pack of 40 in the next week or two to do the set again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall verdict - These are great for the price, but keep in mind, they are set at this price for a reason.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!  A perfect way to get heatless curls that last without hair spray even with fine, thin hair that is resistant to curling!  They are definitely going to take some time to get use to in regards to sleeping with them in my hair, but they really are incredible!  I may try them with a hair dryer instead of sleeping on them, but either way I will continue to use them!</li>
            <li> I watched several youtube videos on how to use these. I don&#x27;t know if my hair is too thick or too long, but I cannot get my hair to pull through the tube.  Also, these tubes are much longer than the wand, so it&#x27;s hard to grasp the end of the wand.  Pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They take some getting used to, but they work! Watch some Youtube tutorials on Curlformers to get started. If your hair gets tangled while you&#x27;re putting them in, make smaller sections and try again.</li>
            <li> I have very long, think and stubborn hair.  These curled my hair great.  I watched a few videos on youtube to learn how to put them in, and I will say they are not comfortable to sleep in, but they do work well.</li>
            <li> Very very happy with this product!! This is exactly what I wanted. My hair is natural and I was able to do heat-less curls that lasted for the week. My sister and mom have purchased some of their own now :-). I have wanted these for a long time but Ididn&#x27;t want to pay the price. With this set you get 40 for the low.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of time and money. It took forever to use the curlers and to get your hair set and the result was absolutely flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I only write reviews when nec. and this is nec. I can&#x27;t lie I was skeptical about getting some of these so I went to Youtube and checked out some comparison examples (Naptural85 has a really good one) and saw there were not to many complaints. I figured that if they didn&#x27;t come out so nice it was ok, they are cheaper than the curlformers I bought ($70 is tooo much, but yes I still bought some) I combined curlformers and these and my hair came out amazing. I used more of the Magic because the tubes are longer than the curlformers and my hair was more stretched out with them once I took them out. The only downside I would say and I&#x27;m pretty sure you&#x27;ve seen this in other reviews is the wand i have to admit mines did not close all the way without some type of struggle and just whined up using the curlformers wand. SN: the Magic spirals are too big for the curlformers wand. Other than that my hair lasted a week with the style and I think it was due to it being more stretched and I also did not seperate until my third day. because i had 80 formers i didn&#x27;t really need to seperate. thanks</li>
            <li> The price for these rollers was amazing compared to Curlformers and I&#x27;m glad I purchased. When I set my hair with these and some aloe vera gel, I have curls that I can switch up for about a week. They stretch the hair very nicely and everyone thinks I&#x27;ve straightened my hair. Putting the hair in the tubes was a little hard at first, but eventually you get the hang of it. Don&#x27;t add to much hair or it won&#x27;t go through/you&#x27;ll have poofy curls. Beware of trying to sleep on these, it was TERRIBLE the first time. I sleep propped up on a pillow or two.</li>
            <li> Loveeeeed these! My hair was shiny &amp; just overall nice, when I took them out my roots felt like I had a relaxer I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping took a while, which was disappointing I was willing to pay extra to get it here faster.</li>
            <li> because trying to put the stick together it broke so i had to tape it. i need a new stick where can i get one</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase. Item is quality made. The price is just right! Worth the buy. Would order again.</li>
            <li> The curls came out great without heat. But the are a pain to sleep on, next time I&#x27;m going under the dryer set on cool.</li>
            <li> They are well-priced and work great!! They are so easy to use, and they&#x27;re less of a pain to sleep in than rollers.</li>
            <li> These work very well. My only complaint is that the hook broke before I could even use it. I managed to get 3 of the curlers on before the hook fell apart completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are much cheaper than Curlformers and they do the same thing. My suggestion is to buy an additional hook if you get these Vakind curlers. Also, keep in mind that these come from China, so don&#x27;t expect to receive fast shipping!</li>
            <li> These are just like the more expensive major name brand, but at a fraction of the price. The end result are perfect, smooth curls</li>
            <li> Curl formers are really great. They keep your hair curly for a long time. It was quick and very easy to use. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I guess these are knock off....but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter. I can&#x27;t imagine how the outrageously expensive ones could be significantly superior to these, because I thought these  worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s definitely a slight learning curve....it&#x27;s nothing difficult, you just have to get used to it. Even when I cluelessly put up my lion&#x27;s mane for the first time, it went surprisingly fast. The process was quicker each subsequent time I used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got them my hair was down to my rear and these weren&#x27;t quite long enough to hold the entire length from scalp to end...so I played around with different ways of overcoming that. First I applied them all the way at the root &amp; let the excess hair at ends poke out freely a few inches. that wasnt so good. The next time, I applied them a few inches down from my roots so that there wouldn&#x27;t be any excess hair hanging out the ends. That worked much better. It was actually quite pretty. I imagine that these will be plenty long for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re not sure which size to get...or if you have short hair now but might have long hair later...I would say just get this size. It&#x27;s gotta be the most versatile. if your hair isn&#x27;t long enough to fill the entire coil it won&#x27;t matter. The unfilled part of the coil will just be there hanging off the end curling a whole bunch of nothing. And then if your length grows out you&#x27;ll be able to continue to use them. this sounds better than buying multiple sets, if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend watching a video on YouTube or on the sally&#x27;s website so you can see how it&#x27;s supposed to be done. I found that element helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had long hair nearly 30 years and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. these are definitely on my short list of items I wouldn&#x27;t go without. the curls are pretty and it&#x27;s way easier than other methods of achieving that look.</li>
            <li> So0o I thought these were smaller than they are. They are for long hair. lower back length. However. They did the job very well. You get sooo many for the money. One of mine was damaged but I mean I have 40 so who cares. It wasnt inoperable just missing a lil piece. Def purchase this! Cant beat it for the price. Shipped REALLY fast.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers! My only complaint would be that these are as long as they come and my hair needs them a tad longer. These are perfect for those times your hair just feels dead and you don&#x27;t want to put heat on them anymore.  I would suggest putting them in before bed when your hair is wet, the curls may be really tight when you first take them out but comb them out, they&#x27;ll relax, and they last days for me I just have to touch them up with a small curling iron.</li>
            <li> great product. good value for the amount of formers you get here. If you go directly to their site you&#x27;ll see just how much of a deal this is, but I&#x27;m fallin in love with these little things. very breathable, you can use about 20-30 mins of heat to set them, or let them air dry overnight but its a bitch to sleep on them.</li>
            <li> Loved it!!  This same set in the brand name &#x27;curlformers&#x27; was $72 at a store near me.... I actually think it&#x27;s better quality, and super easy to use. I recommended several others to purchase theirs here, and they did purchase several sets.  Thank you SO much!!</li>
            <li> These made my daughters hair super curly and cute for cheer competition. We put them in damp hair with a bit of gel and she slept in them overnight. Whala perfect curls, no curling iron needed. I&#x27;ll add that she has super tight curls and for competition she needed bigger spirals to match the team. These were perfect.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price.  I did a comparison to the ones in the beauty supply stores, the ones I ordered are a little harder than the ones in the supply store</li>
            <li> the best invention. I highly recommend to buy if you are looking for a new way to do heatless curls.</li>
            <li> Probably did not need a 40 piece, I have purchased a thinner former from Sally&#x27;s so I would know the difference in quality. There was absolutely no difference in quality, very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> These are great. They do their job. I am unsure why anyone would pay more for other sets. Heatless curls are awesome!</li>
            <li> These spiral curls are better than the expensive curlformer brand. I do prefer to use the original curlformer wand over the one provided. I would order again if needed.</li>
            <li> They are great. They work exactly like the real curl formers. I would use them over any other brand. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> I found this to be a really great product. I would definitely recommend it to others, a very happy purchase.</li>
            <li> Used this on my 4a/4b hair and have no complaints. No gel required. Just used water, oil and a little bit of shea butter and I was good to go</li>
            <li> The wand on one set has broken already. They were not as tight as I thought they would be.&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied though!</li>
            <li> Same product that sells for $50/$60 at the beauty supply shop...quick and easy to put on and gorgeous curls in the morning!</li>
            <li> I just received these yesterday. I tested them out on my daughters hair last night. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Came back today to buy two more sets (now we each have our own set.).&lt;br /&gt;Learning curve was like 2 rollers. After that, I was a pro.</li>
            <li> These were so much cheaper than buying the name brand. Perfect length for my slightly-longer-than-shoulder-length hair. I&#x27;ve been using them for months and they are still holding up well.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to dry, at least 7 hours but it is much cheaper and I love how bouncy my hair becomes after using it</li>
            <li> I love the  product for the price! The only thing I would suggest is purchasing the name brand stick to pull your hair through the curl formers. The stick that comes with the package isnt strong enough if you have long or course hair. other then that this is the beat thing since slice bread :-)!</li>
            <li> I have natural hair about 12&amp;#34; (breast length). After detangling really well these are easy to put in. Insert the rod into the curler, hook a small amount of your hair, and pull your hair through. I&#x27;m not sure if these are name brand but they came in a zip lock bag. I would think they would&#x27;ve come in a nice zipper container. They are no where near comfortable to sleep in. Put them on wet hair a few hours later you have well defined curls.</li>
            <li> We purchased these curlers to use for show choir curls and they work great! An extremely cheap alternative to the Name Brand ones from Sally Hansen! These curlers are simple to use and work great if you are looking for ringlet curls for Competitive Cheer, Show Choir, ect. But, just like other curlers, they are a bit hard to sleep on.  I wrapped mine up in a scarf to sweep them out of my face.  Overall a great product!</li>
            <li> great product, they&#x27;re actually really big and long, maybe too long for my hair, but id rather get them bigger than i need instead of smaller.</li>
            <li> Product is great quality, easy to use with great results, and much cheaper than the actual CurlFormers. If you want good curls that will last, this product is a must bu.</li>
            <li> The curlers worked great and they are so easy to use. I use them all the time and try to find styles to use them in.</li>
            <li> I also bought the large ones for my daughter who has waist length hair. They are pretty easy to use (watch You Tube first). I wouldn&#x27;t sleep on them - not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Hair-nista&#x27;s looking for fab curls... search no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Great price, Shiny bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was right on time. I will be ordering another set!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about how much I absolutely love these!!! Even though sleeping was extremely difficult and uncomfortable I still would 100% recomend this product. My hair is straight and long, to the small of my back, some weren&#x27;t long enough so I just slid the curler farther down. No biggy. My hair, for some reason, hates the forbidden curling iron and will not hold a curl for the life of me. With these I get perfect effortless spiral, Shirley Temple, curls every time! So happy and my man says they were worth every penny!</li>
            <li> These arrived maybe one week after ordering, much faster than I expected and were in great condition with no funny chemical smell I read about from other reviews. The material is a much harder plastic than the original Curlformers but I find this to be an asset and assume that the curlers will last longer do to the different material (several of my expensive curlformers have been trashed due to breaking). The hook is flimsy so I did not attempt to use and substituted it with one of my curlformers hooks. Installation was quick and simple just like with the name-brand product, and the results are smooth and shiny, bouncy curls. My only complaint is that I have yet to find the knock off version of the extra wide and long :-(</li>
            <li> These are amazing. It does exactly what it should and my hair comes out nice and soft. I will tell everyone about these</li>
            <li> This rollers are super chip and they do the job. I can&#x27;t compared them with the more expensive ones because I&#x27;m not willing to pay the $70.00 price. The plastic is a little hard, but you can leave them for only 3 hrs. if your hair is almost dry, and they work perfectly. I have long hair middle of my back, and a lot, and I only use 30 rollers. I&#x27;m buying another set for my niece.</li>
            <li> They work like a charm. Unfortunately, I have short hair, leaving 2 to 3 inches of unnecessary weight on the ends of my hair when I put them on. You may also want to purchase another wand. The one in the package barely holds together.</li>
            <li> We like these very much the only complaint we have is they are very uncomfortable to sleep in but the do make beautiful curls. So as long as my 4yr old doesn&#x27;t need her hair done for about 4hrs we like to use these. I will put up with them and sleep with them if I need my hair done for the morning.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product for the money spent. There was some slight tugging, but after you become familiar with how to use the curlers, you learn how to avoid it. Produced flawless curls!</li>
            <li> I currently have heat damaged hair and decided to do non heat styles to get my hair back into good shape. The package came in good shape, I just wish it came with two hooks to speed up the process. My first try took about an hour or so I ended up ripping a piece of my hair out with the hook so BECAREFUL. I will order again if needed</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think they would really curl my hair but they were great as well as easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about this because like most off brand curlformers they would be stiff and the tips would be hard to squeeze, but not this one. it was easy to use and very flexible and the value was even better. I would recommend you get this.</li>
            <li> This item is great!!! It made my hair have beautiful curls. I completely loved it. (Side note: My hair texture is identical to Alba Garcia&#x27;s.)</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. Less than 3 days. Took me a long time to figure out how to get them to work but once I did the process was fast. I have thick 3c/4a shoulder length natural hair and 40 wasnt nearly enough so I had to order a second. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I timed myself, I have medium length hair and about medium thickness.  Asian hair. I like beachy waves, but this gave me more curls. Not a negative, that just means it&#x27;ll last longer.  I tried curling it the night before to see what it looked the next day and it added a tiny bit of body.  I will not use this as a daily routine though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of starting out with damp hair, I spritzed my hair lightly with water and set  the curls, section by section. Once I set it all up a la La La Loopsy style, which took me approx, 20 minutes, i&#x27;d let it sit for about an hour. Then take it out, wiggle your fingers in the roots, spray hair spray, and arrange your hair. I try not to brush it at all to avoid the frizzy look.  I add a little pomade to make it piecey and for texture. Also a little hair serum for shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great heatless tool to have in your beauty stash.</li>
            <li> I really love these. It works just as well as the real curl formers. I haven&#x27;t had any problems out of these.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good quality product for the price. I could&#x27;t give it 5 stars because sleeping was near impossible.. Next time I will just air dry or sit under a hooded dryer... I recommended them to another friend who purchased them as well. So yes, I would suggest them again to others.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is passed her butt and curly at the ends but not so much at the top because it is so thick we used these and her hair turned out great and my hair is very very thin and it worked great on my hair as well</li>
            <li> I did not think this would work for my extremely thick long hair. Although getting the hang of using the wand and a few tangling incidents because of the wand it was so worth it. I had the most soft and perfect curls the following morning that lasted 2 weeks with just leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> These worked great. I used them on my daughters hair and the curls came out perfect. Glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> This was just as good as I expected. I had no learning curve at all since I&#x27;ve watched so many videos on how to put these in. Many people have said the wand is flimsy but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s flimsy at all, mine hardly ever bends. This is what&#x27;s keeping me sane through my transition and I&#x27;m very happy I bought it!</li>
            <li> these work like MAGIC!!! why didnt i buy them sooner!! makes great curls on my natural hair. i get tons of compliments when i have used them!! worth the money!</li>
            <li> Did not work on my hair. Took forever to put in, then when I brought them out, my hair was not curly at all.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because Naptural85 (a youtuber) and I thought it would make my life easier. Installing these was a challenge but I got used to it. I think my hair is a little too thick for these because I had to make small sections for them to be inserted without getting stuck. I used 37 spirals out of 40 (which took 3 hours). Taking them out was a breeze but the ends of my hair wasn&#x27;t as crisp and straight as my roots. That was probably my fault though since I only used water and argan oil. I read somewhere that you shouldn&#x27;t put any heavy products or leave in conditioners while installing these. Next time I use these will probably be when I have dry, straight hair.</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews I was a bit skeptical about purchasing these &amp;#34;ringlet formers&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m glad I did.  I have 4c natural hair and they worked beautifully. They arrived before schedule and none of the formers were damaged and torned in any way.  I found them very easy to use.  The only is have and it&#x27;s not with the formers, is finding a way to make the curls last longer than 2days.</li>
            <li> they came on time and as described. i must admit i had a little trouble getting used to them in the beginning but after the second time, i am now a pro at these! my first night using these, i put them in then went to sleep in them (which isnt very comfortable btw). the next morning i woke up, took them out, and was surprised to see that i looked exactly like shirley temple :/. not that she wasnt adorable, but thats just not the look for me.&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, after shaking the curls out and combing them through, my hair looked fabulous! these are great for an easy, low maintenance hair style</li>
            <li> These curlers arrived in tact, no issues.  They were easy to apply, but were really uncomfortable to keep in the hair for several hours.  I followed a YouTube tutorial on how to apply them, but unlike the women in the videos, there was no way I could have slept on these curlers.  They are worth trying, however, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for the number of curlers you get.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product, I watched an online video about how to use it. The first time I tried to put the curlers in, 2 of them broke. The material is poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the curlers in at night and tried to sleep with them in. It was the worst night&#x27;s sleep I have had in a long time. The curlers are hard and no matter which way I moved they were pushing on my head and face. The curls looked okay in the morning, but they were not worth the time, money, or lack of sleep. I won&#x27;t be using these again! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Use it weekly..very well made. And the price makes this a winner! Smooth, silky curls even with my very thick hair</li>
            <li> The only issue I had was with the rod, it kept slipping out of place; so I had to keep holding the center section when I went to slide the rod out.</li>
            <li> My hair is long to my mid back and very thick, this product kept snagging and pulling even though i took small amounts and the handle kept slipping out while i was pulling my hair through the mouth. I did look at youtube videos before purchasing but i thought it would have worked better than it did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once because I&#x27;m too lazy to do it again.  The one time i did set them using these I had so many compliments &amp; everyone loved them.  They were so soft.  As a natural curly girl...it was great to find an easy way to tame my mane!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. I watched a few YouTube vids before these arrived so I would know how to use them once they came. Needless to say, they were easy to use. I would definitely purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I bought some from ebay, horrible my hair is thick but straight my mom and I tried multiple times to place it on our hair it tangled, it hurt, this is a way to loose hair especially with that hook and trying to get it off and having to pull it off. Why should it take multiple times to get a product right I learned my lesson regular rollers are easier.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair and a lot of it. Two packages of these work great for her. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I learned about cur formers from u tube.  I suggest buying 2packages.  The curls will be even and last longer.  If possible use this size and a size smaller</li>
            <li> It would be a good product if I had received the entire hook, it only came with the bottom half.  I contacted Amazon and the only way to get it replaced is to send back my entire order and repurchase it.  That sounds like a major inconvenience to me.  I guess I am going to have to go to Sally Hansen and buy the curlformer hook so I can use this product.  What a bummer!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just put these on last night and they were annoying to install because sometimes the hair just didn&#x27;t go through. The fact that the rod pulls the hair through the curl former just says that if you use it wrong, there will be damage. Sleeping on them is uncomfortable and the people who don&#x27;t mind it must be crazy. It was slightly painful having them on and while I do like the results, it&#x27;s not worth the potential damage these could cause to my hair. I think I&#x27;ll try perm rods or something else.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the hook but it is sturdy and works great on my 3c/4a natural hair! Much better value than purchasing Curlformers. Definitely recommend purchasing to help stretch your hair and prevent single strand knots.</li>
            <li> Save your money and purchase these over the original Cutlformers. These work exactly the same. Great way to stretch natural hair 4b.</li>
            <li> Ehh... The curls look unnatural, and the ringlet formers are extremely uncomfortable! I tend to wear my hair loose even when its up in a bun, so I&#x27;m not really a fan of the pressure on my scalp and hair when I wear these.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product, but I&#x27;ve had some issues with my hair snagging through the curl former (especially when wet). I like using this product, but not too often because when using on wet hair it may cause thinning of the hair or potential breakage, according to my beautician.</li>
            <li> These are great.  The wand is a not great quality.  If you have long hair you need patience and I think this is better with damp slightly wet hair.</li>
            <li> Worked great! We use the curl formers for a cheer competition.  Made my life so much easier. They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I saw these at my hair salon...the hair one of the girls did was awesome. So, I ordered them on here. they come with NO instructions..LOL..NO clue how to use them, so will have to wait to go to get my haircut and find out. I didn&#x27;t know how many stars to give them because of this. UGH..</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase a generic version of curl formers. Well let me tell you that my hair came out great! The price is right on target!</li>
            <li> For the past year or so, I have used Curlformers on my natural hair (4A) on a regular basis to stretch my hair into glossy ringlets.  In all honesty, I used a combination of Curlformers and rod rollers because I did not purchase enough Curlformers to curl all the hair on my head. One kit covered about 3/4ths of my head.  I&#x27;m fairly thrifty, so I had a hard time justifying another kit - or even a single package of Curlformers at the exorbitant price of 14.00 per 10 pack at Sally&#x27;s.  So when I saw a (raving) positive review of the Vakind Curlers on YouTube - I practically ran to my computer to order them on Amazon.  What a fantastic purchase - at an amazing price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:  The plastic mesh is a little harder on the Vakind - which actually created a smoother curl.  The Vakind was a little wider than the Curlformers which reduced the drying time, provided I didn&#x27;t over stuff the Vakind with hair.  I liked the length (again a little longer than the Curlformers), which meant that my entire length of the curl was in the curler - versus the Curlformers which did not fully cover the ends of my longer hair (bra strap length).  I can use the Curlformer wand with the Vakind and the kit had a generous amount of curlers, allowing me to set my entire head of hair with the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could use a little improvement:  A couple reviewers mentioned that the curlers had a stinky manufacturing type smell to them, I agree.  I used a tiny bit of shampoo and warm water to soak and rinse them and then let them air dry overnight - voila - smell solved.  Also, the wand is made out of a cheaper plastic and would bend when I tried to use it.  So I would recommend purchasing a Curlformers wand ($6 at Sally&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 5 star product - I&#x27;ve recommended them to all my friends - fantastic purchase.</li>
            <li> Great rollers, great price. Huge issue the wand/stick is very weak and MUST be reinforced. Once I reinforced it with duct tape it was perfect. I suggest you reinforce it as soon as you open the box.</li>
            <li> My parents bought me these knock-off Curlformers or Christmas (the pack of 40), and I love the curls it gave me. There are a few obstacles to conquer:&lt;br /&gt;1) Sleeping in the curlers are quite a challenge due to the hard plastic material&lt;br /&gt;2) On must avoid creating large sections of hair to ensure there is no hair outside of hook&lt;br /&gt;3) Since these curlers are not name-brand, one must remove the durable plastic curlers by straightening the curlers&lt;br /&gt;4) Even though I personally have not experienced this, but I read other reviewers on Amazon and YouTube that when purchased the products are not always clean during the shipping process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these issues are acknowledged correctly, then I would absolutely recommend this off-brand product to anyone of all hair textures who want the option of creating curls without heat. Happy New Year!!!</li>
            <li> This product was beyond what I had expected. I agree with other reviewers that YouTube is the best resource for using these rollers, since the product did not come delivered with instructions. I have very fine, red hair that usually loses forced curls rather fast after using a curling iron. I slept with these rollers in overnight and VOILA!!! Perfect ringlets in the morning. These really do work! I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I would buy this over and over again because it works just like the original brand but it&#x27;s less than half the cost. These are very long. My hair reaches to the top of my bra strap but only fills up half way on the curlers. I could have gone with shorter ones, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these curlers after hearing a lot about them.  They were the perfect length for my medium to long hair.  Putting them in however was quite the process.  The hook did not fit together well and seemed to short for the length of the curler.  The amount of hair that each curler holds is very small and just one set on my average thickness hair took a long time to put in.  Once in, the curlers were heavy and uncomfortable, pulling hair if I moved my head to much.  After waiting a couple of hours for my hair to dry I removed the curlers (the easiest part of the whole thing).  The result was as I had hoped, pretty curls- a little more tangled than I had expected but they worked well enough.</li>
            <li> We have used another brand of this curler before that we borrowed from a friend. This curler and hook worked exactly the same and was only 1/4 the price of the other curler.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$!  Only downside is the curl former stick is a bit weak.  it bends where the one for the &#x27;curl former brand&#x27; doesn&#x27;t.  still the price is impossible to beat!  super quick shipment from the seller i bought from too!</li>
            <li> I would have given them a 5 if my hook didn&#x27;t break on the first use! Luckily I live literally 4 minutes from Sally&#x27;s and was able to replace it for less than $5. With that said the cost is still MUCH cheaper than buying name brand. My hair is a bit longer than shoulder length so I do the ends to give it a nice curl and still keep some length. They work wonderfully. I use Rocaholic defrizzer/detangler before putting them in and sleep on them (not very comfy) the curls are great. I have never pulled or gotten my hair stuck in the hook. These are also very easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I like new gadgets and love experimenting with new hair techniques. These curl formers were way too complicated to use. It pulled the hair and caused me to break some of it. I will stick to the flexi rods.  They were easier to use and resulted in a good outcome (i.e, curls with no breakage).</li>
            <li> At first a struggle to learn how to use them. Watch some YouTube videos. Also just about perfect length, depending on the day my hair seems a little too long for them but so far they have worked great. Works best if hair is blown dry with them in.</li>
            <li> I have only used them once but I liked the results. I have short, fine, very tightly curled natural hair. The curls only lasted a day but I think that was because I didn&#x27;t use enough product and I didn&#x27;t use any heat.  I really wanted narrow curlers but chose these instead because I could not tell if the blue and green were actually narrow.</li>
            <li> I would SO recommend this product to others. My only concern is that you get what you pay for. Meaning...they started to ..deteriorate..rather quickly. That I didn&#x27;t expect but then again, I used them a LOT when I first got them. SO..to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my deteriorating issue...I&#x27;ll just buy more so that they will have less stress per roller.&lt;br /&gt;I will also say that they grip nicely at the scalp, which I didn&#x27;t expect. Love these!!</li>
            <li> These things are awesome! I have 3 girls and have tried them on all 3 and they work great!  Once you get the hang of them they are easy as pie.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time researching the difference between Curlformers and the knock offs. I was so close to spending the $70 for the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34; but I figured for $20, what do I have to lose. On my first try to install, it was a fail. I blamed the curlformers, of course, but after a year of youtube videos, I realized it was my method and my product choice. I decided to try again. :) I have been getting nothing but compliments. I have already these two times in the past month. I always read reviews before making a purchase so I hope this review helps someone.</li>
            <li> These were pretty easy to use and the results were fabulous curls that lasted a couple of days. Love this!</li>
            <li> I really like how so many comes in the pack, that really helps with how the hair turns out.  If you take your time with applying, you get good results.  The only thing I wish they would have added was instructions. The shipping was  fast and the packaging was very good.</li>
            <li> I tried these last night so this is a fresh review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: affordable, gave great curls, pretty easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the wand is slightly tough to put together and oddly, it can come apart while you are putting the rod in your hair. It is very uncomfortable to sleep so i wouldnt suggest doing it at night. This took me two hours to complete because there werent instructions. I felt like I was going to rip my hair out during some installations because the hair didnt glide through the curler. This also worked a lot better on soaking wet hair than it did on damp so i had to constantly wet my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the key to this is perfectly separating your hair (making sure there are no stray hairs) and holding the wand/roller in one direction and your piece of hair in the opposite direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this and I plan on trying it again.</li>
            <li> Gave these as a gift and she loves these !  The curls are so pretty on this 16 year old&#x27;s long hair :) She said they were comfortable to sleep in too !</li>
            <li> The product is great! It came before time which is always a plus. The price is awesome... It comes with the black wand thingy as well... Excellent ...excellent... excellent!!! I will be ordering more soon ;)</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use and more there are more than enough curlers to use on my thick haired 4 yr old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the brand name Curlformers, I bought these as an alternative. They work wonderfully on my thick hair! While I wish they were the EXTRA wide ones, which I haven&#x27;t seen in a knock off yet, they still get the job done! I&#x27;ve used them twice already, and the first time my hair was a bit static-y, so I went out and bought some cheap curl defining cream and they look great today! I&#x27;ve also seen some people leave negative comments about the hook, which I don&#x27;t agree with. It&#x27;s not as flimsy as I thought it would be after reading some of the reviews, I&#x27;ve gotten my air stuck at least 8 or 10 times (trying to put too much hair in it..) And it&#x27;s held up very well! I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend sleeping in them, I tried that last night, and even putting only the bottom half of each strand in (So I could have some wiggle room.. Plus I didn&#x27;t want curl all the way up to my scalp) they still weren&#x27;t very comfortable. AND if you leave them in that long they will be TIGHT curls, and I like mine a bit looser, but it&#x27;s all in preference. Great seller, GREAT product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> They do take a little time to learn how to use them but I love the fact that they give me a soft curl that lasts.</li>
            <li> These are great! I pair them with my Softhood dryer attachment, since they are way too uncomfortable to sleep in, and the curls turn out perfectly every time. A great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I used it on my natural 4b hair and it turned out very nice! I didn&#x27;t use any heat to straighten it but it looked like I did!</li>
            <li> Love them. I used them for the 1st time, and I loved the curls they make. They were a little teadious to use at first, but I quickly got the hang of how to put them in. Youtube was a big help. They are great for less than half the cost of curlformers. I got a lot in this bag I ordered. Even after my whole head was done, I still had rollers left.</li>
            <li> They were a bit hard to sleep in, they are not as soft as curlformers. Due to this I might not use them as often if I have to sleep on them.</li>
            <li> I bought these to add to my curlformers pack since 40 just isn&#x27;t enough for my thick, kinky/curly hair. Plus curlformers sells their replacements too high (15 dollars for a pack of 6...outrageous). Depending on whether my hair is straight or in its natural state I can use all 80 of the  curlers (curlformers+the vakind) The wand that comes with it is trash compared to the real curlformers wand and I just use that curlformers wand instead. The look of the Vakind curlers is cheaper than the curlformers but they still curl the same,  but I&#x27;m not sure if they will last as long as the original curlformers. If you want to try the look without spending the money these are good, but I would suggest getting a curlformers wand from Sally&#x27;s. They really are excellent for all hair types from straight-kinky. I loved the uniform curl I got and that I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference in curl from the curlformers.</li>
            <li> The curlers work very well &amp; are an amazing deal compared to Curlformers. The hooks are not very sturdy at all. It&#x27;s still a great deal to buy them &amp; spend an extra $3-$4 for an actual Curlformer hook. That&#x27;s what I did!</li>
            <li> hard to use, and after I was able to use...they hurt! and when you go to remove it rips your hair....it did make hair curl....but would never recommend its use....not worth the effort</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bags of curlformers and like to use them instead of regular rollers.  You can either sit under the dryer and get a spiral curl or you can sleep in them to achieve the same spiral curl.  If you decide to sleep in them they will be kind of hard so you will have to get used to sleeping in them.  I didn&#x27;t have a problem sleeping in them because I don&#x27;t usually twist and turn when I sleep. I would recommend these to my friends too.</li>
            <li> The product worked great!  The seller was fast.  Only one issue...one of the curlers came damaged. Other than the one danaged curlee, all was well!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;brand-name&amp;#34; curlers are so expensive, so these &amp;#34;knock-offs&amp;#34; are a great deal.  I do not plan to use it to perm or blow-dry, so I&#x27;m not too concerned about the supposed issue of it not being the exact same kind of material as the brand name curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the advice of other raters in that I purchased the brand-name hook, but to me it wasn&#x27;t really necessary.  The brand-name hook comes apart the same as the hook that comes with these curlers...I think it&#x27;s really a matter of not trying to pull to much hair at once, or tangled hair, through the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls are lovely! The size is not too tight, and have lasted all day.  I&#x27;m also getting lots of compliments on my hair &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These things are awesome! They are very comfortable to sleep in and made very pretty and natural looking curls/waves!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I use Curler Magic for the first time and it was a bit intimating at first after watching Youtube video. However, these curlers are AWESOME!!!!!!!! especially for ALL hair types (natural, perm, weave) my hair length medium-long natural no perm and I whip these curlers thru my wet mosse hair quickly!! Amazing beautiful look and it took about 40 mins to zip it thru and hour to dry. I use a hooded hair dryer because it HARD trying to sleep in these curlers, but it can be done.(ie) after you completed adding all your curlers to your hair, grab a huge scarf and tie is down tightly without giving yourself a headache- boom- you can sleep with the curler- I did just last night 6/26/14</li>
            <li> Why pay all that money for the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; ones, when these work just fine.  No complaints at all.  They did the job as expected.</li>
            <li> I have hair that just wont stay curly with a curling iron so I was really excited to try this product.Okay due to the fact that my hair is long and that I have a lot of it, it took a little more time than I thought it would to get all the curlers in my hair but not too much longer. It would have gone much faster had the set come with a lot more than just one curliformer hook. The process of getting hair into the curliformer requires the curliformer hook to pull your hair through the curler which for me has been proven to be pretty harsh on my hair and even showed significant hair damage after only having used the curlers twice. In case anyone may think I was putting too much hair in at once let me assure you that was not the case. After my hair completely dried in the curlers I took then out to discover firm  curls as promised however you had to be careful not to brush or comb it because it would cause your hair to frizz and puff out like CRAZY. Through trying out the curlers 4 times I was able to figure out a cute hairstyle that works for me but because of the damage it has caused my hair I am not sure I will use them all that much if ever again. Oh and The curls did not stay in all day but they did stay in for a couple of hours which is a couple more hours longer than a curling iron ever did for me.</li>
            <li> The concept is great but the wand is flimsy and the pieces wont stay attached. You end up losing the bottom half of the wand when you pull it through which causes pain and pulling. You then have to start all over again. What appears so simple and easy on you tube turned into a bit of a nightmare for me. This wasn&#x27;t the product for me (I&#x27;ll stick to a curling iron), but might be okay for someone with more patience.</li>
            <li> Little bummed that some of these were busted already at the tips... though I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth sending back (since now they are at a higher price) or fixing myself with super glue... or just pointing the busted tips down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried two of them as a tester on my thin, straight hair, no product and blasted them with a hair dryer for 5 minutes, then let them cool naturally.  Curl looked nice but fell out within 30 minutes.  I&#x27;ll be trying at a longer wait time this weekend with slightly damp hair and updating my review.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair (3b/3c) and it can be a real pain to style it at times. I&#x27;ve never used curl formers so I cannot compare the two but I know that this makes my hair have smooth gorgeous curls every time. How I use it is right after I come out of the shower I put my leave in and oil in my hair then either use mousse or a styling smoothie/gel on each section I do before pulling it through the curler to insure that they stay. Then I go to sleep with them in (I leave them in roughly eight hours without any heat...one of the reasons why I love this so much is because it doesn&#x27;t do any heat damage).The style usually lasts me about 4 days (which is typically when I wash my hair again). I bought another one of these because the product is so fantastic. The only thing  will say as a word of warning if you have a tender head you probably will not be able to sleep in these and will need to sit under a dryer for an hour. They are not the soft mesh plastic like the original curl former brand; these guys are hard (but it makes for a nice straight curl)</li>
            <li> I apply these curlers at night and take them out in the morning and I have perfect curls! I have long thick hair and I can apply all 40 curlers in about 30 minutes. I would suggest using product, such as mousse or leave in conditioner to make the curls last longer. By the end of the day the curler are loose, but I also love that look. Can beat the outcome for the price.</li>
            <li> They are not as soft as Curl Formers, but they work great!!! Curls are straighter and smoother. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Good quality and design, but really difficult to use with long hair. It&#x27;s painful. You&#x27;re suppose to thread wet hair through the twists and dry that way, but I cant even get my hair through it. I&#x27;ve tried small bundles and thick bundles and every time, it just twists my hair and pulls it. It makes me want to punch whoever is closest to me. I&#x27;ve seen this done successfully on youtube, but I just cant make it work. I&#x27;ll just get a curling wand.</li>
            <li> these are ok if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money for the real thing. they are just a little difficult to work with but do work.&lt;br /&gt;They shipped from china i believe so it took a bit to get to the states.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I saw this for less than the price of two 8 count Curformer curlers... WELL, do not be skeptic. BUY.  The only difference is they go different ways than the Curlformers.  The pink in this set match the orange, and the orange in this set match the pink in the original set.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive Curlfromers like I did. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would suggest getting the original wand ($4).  The plastic molding on this wand looks scary and might snag tightly curled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.. I have tightly curled type 4 b-c hair and this gets it smooth and curly with no heat!</li>
            <li> They came very quickly and just as described online. Only reason they don&#x27;t get a 5 star is because its not any directions. But, youtube has many tutorials to help ypu with.</li>
            <li> I have 3c natural hair and this product actually worked! I was so happy and shocked, and it is so much less expensive than the actual curlformers. I have been wanting these for a really long time and they shipped in 2 days and i dont even have Amazon prime! I think this product would work on any type of hair especiall naturally straight hair. I definately recommend this item for anbody that wants beautiful curls wihout burning themselves or have heat damage!</li>
            <li> I paid WAY TOO MUCH money for Curlformers in Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. This product is sufficient/efficient. It is by far a better value. The rod is included in the price. I ordered these for my little sister&#x27;s Christmas present and they were on time, worked the same and a great value. Thank you Vakind.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing my hair don&#x27;t curl or hold curls well but with this product it is almost effortless.</li>
            <li> great curls. easy to use. two different curl patterns with each color spiral. great buy. would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly like I wanted it to. Just as good as the curlformers. I would recommend the cheaper brand. :)</li>
            <li> This is really Perfect!!!( I have medium straight long hair) not just talking or maybe you think i am one of this company to promote advertisement for their product but LISTEN!! first the ship is really fast it takes only 3 to 4 days they ship it to you and for affordable price i am please with the outcomes of my hair!!! like Hollywood!!! everybody gave compliments to my hair for the first time i used it.. i am so excited to try different style of my hair again...(I used all of them on my hair..lol!) the things is i wasn&#x27;t aware that the UPS the one who delivered and i am using P.O Box, but the shipping really fast!!! Thank you Vakind!! u did a good job!! an thank you to Amazon also!!</li>
            <li> The issue with these is the stick, it does not remain together, I&#x27;d have to glue it to be able to use it, or may have to purchase a stick that is intact so that when I pull down the hair it does not break. The actual spiral ringlets look to be really good quality. I would not buy the others for $60. But the stick is what made me give this product a 2 star...I could not even use it!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really give me the curls i wanted, also extremely uncomfortable to sleep in, i have quite a bit of hair and it was difficult to pull it through the curl former (probably caused more damage than anything) and i needed so many to cover my head, it was hard and pulled at my scalp when i laid down and the next morning the curls wern&#x27;t that mind boggling, pretty much i bought it, used it once, and haven&#x27;t picked it up since</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, all I knew was that I wasn&#x27;t pay $$ for Curlformers. The technique was a little daunting at first but once my hands got the hang of it, it was a breeze. These work so well! My curls were great! Awesome product. Easy to use. They hold up well. I&#x27;d just recommend moving them into a sturdy container or bag as opposed to the plastic bag they came in.</li>
            <li> One day I was browsing YouTube channels looking for a new, easy and cute style for my natural hair. Well, I came across a few posters who raved about these little amazing no heat spiral rollers. So here I am posting my review. Included in my package was, 2 packs of 40 count rollers (ordered two packs) and one wand for each roller set. Purchased 2 packs but only used roughly 50. Unfortunately, didn’t have an opportunity to try out my newly acquired toys that same day but glad I decided to wait. Before you attempt any styling please set aside at least an hour to get the hang of using the wand and rollers. My first time took me nearly 2 hours to complete my whole head and I only have shoulder length hair which may not be a bad thing. Do not forget to section your hair in small sections so you are not yanking your hair through the tiny opening. Ouch! Also, take your time placing your hair in the loop and if I was you, possibly looking in a mirror for the first few maybe a good suggestion. I also would suggest watching a few “how to” YouTube videos on using them. So far I have only used this item twice and was impressed with the results only after my second time of using them. I blame myself for using setting lotion on wet hair instead of a simple moisturizer on damp hair the first time around. My curls were rock solid tight, didn’t move but they looked extra cute! Lesson learned. The second time around after using a regular light moisturizer my curls were bouncy and had a shine yet didn’t last more than two day. :-( Now for anyone thinking about sleeping in them you may want to hold off. They are not comfy and may find yourself trying to reposition your pillow to elevate your head. In short, great rollers, does as stated, definitely economically affordable and girlfriend approved to praise.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the value but it wasn&#x27;t long enough to hold all my hair. Otherwise I&#x27;d be completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before  I purchased this and they mostly rang true.  The curlers were firm, but gave a smooth finish. The hook was not so sturdy, but because I was forewarned, I taped it up before using. In the end, I felt that I got a good buy for my money. It definitely beats the 70 bucks that the real curl formers cost.</li>
            <li> OK. I have the curlformer package (long and extra wide) by HairFlair and there are some differences I want to point out in comparison with these ones:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I&#x27;m supposing this curlformers are stiffer because they form tighter curls. Anyways, the plastic from the other ones is softer and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They work! Exaclty as the ones from HairFlair. You get pretty tight curls and I would recommend to put this on and sleep with them, though I guaranty you won&#x27;t have a tight sleep. They are soooo uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. They smell pretty bad. They have a cheap plastic smell and that smell kind of stays in your hair. So I would recommend to wash them and let them dry out before putting them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The hook that comes with this package is cheap. I would highly recommend to buy the HairFlair hook, since it&#x27;s easier to pass through the curlformer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Watch you eyes! I had a couple of hits when passing the hair through the curlformer, since they are spirals they tend to bounce, so just be careful :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say, don&#x27;t buy the HairFlair curlformers but only the hook. Be patient, putting these on took me some hair pulling and pain but practice made it simpler.</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully. I love the spiral results. I have bone straight hair past my ribs so I have to modify the method a little when using them but the curls still come out beautiful. My daughter is biracial and has an extremely curly coarse hair texture. These work wonderfully on her hair. I watched many YouTube videos before these arrived and our first try came out awesome. We did have to wash them with a little shampoo when they arrived because of the plastic type smell but once they dried they were perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 8 year old daughter because she wanted to have spiral curls. She has no problem putting them in on all her hair by herself. This is the second package I have purchased because 40 was not enough for all her hair. She has to use 55 to do all of her hair. She does have very thick hair, so 40 may be sufficient for most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has mentioned to me that these work best if your hair is lightly damp. If it is too wet, the hair doesn&#x27;t dry overnight and if it is to dry, the curl does not hold. Overall, this is a great product and my daughter has been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> these are so fun and easy and THEY WORK! I am terrible at using heating tools and I never get the results I want. These make it so simple and no burns. My hair is hard to style but these finally give me the option of perfect curls!</li>
            <li> love it. gives my hair life when I want some curls for my 4c natural hair.</li>
            <li> Oh my word LOVE THESE! I have 3 daughters and they love these 1. The price is amazing. Anywhere locally I could get half the quantity for 4 times the price. 2. I would invest in  as second needle. I have my girls load the next curler while I am putting one on. It goes very fast. I was intimidated at first but after watching a You Tube tutorial I had zero problems!!</li>
            <li> Hair profile:&lt;br /&gt;curl pattern: even though i dont love the Andre Walker hair typing system, I would guess that it would range from 3c-4b.&lt;br /&gt;Density: High(thick)&lt;br /&gt;Strand texture: normal-coarse&lt;br /&gt;NO relaxers, or texturizer, just natural hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review deets:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried this product three times. The first time I used it, I only used 39 out of 40. The products I used were the Creme of Nature spray leave-in, shea moisture gel, and grapeseed oil. The results were really smooth and shiny like I used a curling iron. The shea moisture curling souffle (aka gel) did leave a bit of a residue but after the new day it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used these, I used all 40 and used the same products. I still I same results great results. In order to preserve the style, I pineapple at night. There are many curlformer tutorials on youtube if you want to learn how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 3rd time I used it, I did not get as good results but it was my own fault because I used a leave-in conditioner that was too heavy. I feel that for this tool, you need a leave-in that is lightweight and be sure that the curlformers are COMPLETELY dry. otherwise the hair will be stretched out but not have a loose curl shape which is what you want from the product. Also, make sure that you do NOT pull too much hair through the curlformer. it&#x27;ll take too long to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the price of this product and I think that it will be successful for many different hair types. I think that if you have a higher density of hair like mine, then it would be best to get two packages of these so that you dont accidentally run out.</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to try these as I am always looking for ways to style my out of control hair without heat and damage.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  These are for &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; hair...well if your hair comes to your bra strap like mine, they are a little too short.  I had about an inch or two of hair sticking out the ends on my longest pieces.&lt;br /&gt;2)  You have to use the smallest amount of hair in each roller.  If you have a lot of hair like me, it would take forever and tons of curlers to finish it all.  Seriously, it&#x27;s like putting in perm rods lol.  They should make some that would hold a regular hot roller amount of hair.  The amount of curlers you need is impractical to use on any regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;3)  My hair is also very very fine.  It snags and catches/sticks to itself and anything else.  My hair was slightly damp trying these and that made it even worse pulling the hair through.  It would constantly get caught half way thru the roller and I would worry that I would end up losing some hair each time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if you have shorter hair that is not thick, these might work for you for special events, etc.  Everyone else, it is more hassle than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> They came enclosed in a plastic bag but had an invisible dust all over them.  Looked them up on line and claims are made that these are made with toxic components.  Sent them back.</li>
            <li> I love...love...LOVE these things! I went to Sally&#x27;s at first but once I saw the price, I has to search around. It works just like the real thing. No problems or issues! Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> These curlers aren&#x27;t hard to use, but they really hurt to have in for extended periods of time.  So far I&#x27;ve tried them 6 times.  Each time I ended up giving up about 4&#x3D;5 hours into it because they are so heavy and because they pull on the hair.  As a result, the curl isn&#x27;t the best.  Also, without having wet hair then the curl falls within an hour.  Just for reference: I have a good amount of healthy, fine, naturally straight, APL hair.  I plan on using these for my pre-teen daughter for cheer, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for frequent use.</li>
            <li> These are a decent alternative to paying the extra money for curlformers.  I actually started using these and then later received the real curlformers as a christmas present.  Both hair curlers will definitely accomplish the same thing, which is placing your hair in a good, heat-free stretched state with a lot of highly defined curls.  However, these curlers are thicker than the actual curlforers which means that your hair will take significantly longer to dry.  Additionally, these curlers are harder and I found that I absolutely could not sleep in them at all whereas I can generally sleep on curlformers.  All that to say, you get what you pay for but these definitely are not terrible!</li>
            <li> The curlformers came the next morning after ordering that night I was soo excited !! They were easy to install after watching a video on YouTube , it&#x27;s just time consuming &amp; for my 4b hair to dry it took 6 hours air drying also it took a full 40 &amp; I needed a few more but I made them work &amp; my hair is very thick , but overall I love them &amp; will be ordering more at a later date.</li>
            <li> Practice before you need to wear your hair style out side. I need to use the curlers a few more times to learn how to use them on my natural hair. Hair cream is a must.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for three years and have the curlformers from Sally&#x27;s about as long. My hair has out grown the short curlformers so I needed the extra long. I saw the Naptural85 review and I decided to purchase the Vakind.  They work just like the original and the plastic was the same as the original curlformers!! No different! I did wash them twice in hot soap water and rinse them (didn&#x27;t like the plastic smell).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Curlformers for some time now, but I just couldn&#x27;t afford to pay $70 for rollers. Especially with as many as I&#x27;d need to set my thick long 3c-4a hair. So I was very happy when I found this dupe product on Amazon for a much more reasonable price. I was NOT happy after sleeping on these. I woke up so sore and swearing never to use the again. Then I started taking them out and decided that I&#x27;d just have to find a way to make them more comfortable at night...or possibly put them in in the morning on a day off and remove them at night before bed. SOMETHING because these gave me the most perfectly smooth and firm curl set that I&#x27;ve ever had using no relaxer and NO HEAT AT ALL. I was shocked at the results. I would definitely recommend these as an alternative to purchasing a set of Curlformers. You get many, many more rollers for your money and I can&#x27;t imagine any better results.</li>
            <li> It took a couple times to get the hang of it but overall a cool invention. Makes my hair very springy. Shirley Temple hair!</li>
            <li> I am totally happy with this product. It&#x27;s a great alternative to the $70 curlformers.  The handle is sturdy and the curlers themselves are well made and produce some gorgeous curls! and for the price and the amount you get! CAN&#x27;T BEAT IT!</li>
            <li> I have heard many great things about Curlformers, watched many videos and saw great results so I always wanted to try them for myself. I couldn&#x27;t afford the $70 price tag so I was so excited when one of my favorite hair bloggers made a video comparing the results of her Curlformers and Vakind. Vakind worked just as well, even better than the Curlformers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these just before Christmas and received them 2 days after. I tried them out immediately and I didn&#x27;t even need to use all 40. My first thought was that these are super easy to install and my second thought was that these are hell to sleep in! Lol. When I took my hair out the next day, I hated the results! I was so disappointed. They curled but they were lifeless and I didn&#x27;t like the way they looked on my hair. (I&#x27;m African-American with natural 3c/4a curls, collarbone length if stretched.) I decided that it was the product I added to my hair, which is a homemade, heavy shea butter and oils mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave this another go on New Years Eve. This time, I didn&#x27;t sleep with them in. I installed them 2-3 hours before I was heading out and I used a lighter, water-based curl product to set them. I let them air dry while I got dressed and ready to go out for the night. Also, this time I used all 40 curlers. When I took them out this 2nd try, I was in love!!! My curls were beautiful and full of life! I wish I could upload pics. To anyone questioning if these are just as good as Curlformers, I&#x27;m sure they are! They work beautifully and are easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation would be to wake up a bit earlier to set your hair, if possible. Sleeping in them is no fun! Other than that, these are a hit with me!</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations. I have used them on natural thick long hair, relaxed fine short hair and super excited about the results. Not comfortable to sleep in.  So if you put them in in the morning, without heat they will be dry that evening.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t what I expected. S now they just sit on by shelf....I wasted money. :-( I&#x27;ve watched multiple videos on How To Do, but they didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Love them. Prompt delivery. Comes in a reclosable bag. Works excellent in my hair which is 3b-3c. My Mom has very fine hair and this did not spiral it a lot but did leave a lovely wave. My Mom is Native American if that helps. I&#x27;m mixed with black so my texture is different but it worked for us both more for me though. Only downside is I bought the longest ones they have but I have very long hair that sticks out the bottom that I roll on rollers. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is not as easy as it may appear! After two hours of struggling, I was frustated for so much time I wasted, had a headache, and my thumb was nearly numb from pushing the small rubber opening to pull the hair through with the wand. If the opening of the curler does not cover the wand completely or if held at a certain angle be sure your hair will get caught in the wand and you&#x27;ll have to start over again! I will say it gets the job done... it creates healtless curls. It was my mistake for not using gel or mouse and so the curls probably would&#x27;ve lasted longer. i only used Lotta Body which didn&#x27;t make a difference AT ALL. I may revisit this look again but not for a while. I can&#x27;t look at those stupid rollers without getting upset all over again!!</li>
            <li> Never heard of these things until my niece asked for them.  She sent me to the actual website where they required a small loan. I got these at Amazon for more than half the price and she loved it.  It arrived just in time for her to take it back to University with her.  Now that she lives in Europe, it&#x27;s not so easy/affordable to send her what she needs/wants.&lt;br /&gt;Pictures will follow I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare them to the real deal considering I don&#x27;t have the real curlformers, but these do the job! I put these in at night and took them out in the morning and had wonderful, smooth curls. Probably gonna be doing this for a while instead of twisting my hair every week. Very easy to use if you use 1 in sections of hair and be patient.</li>
            <li> these are really a great alternative to the name brand curlformers. u get twice as much for 1/2 as much, and  they work just as good</li>
            <li> this product is the same size as the Green and Blue, the only thing is instead of getting 24 you 40  or 50 I forget. OK so storage, your product comes to you in two different bags, the curl formers come in a type of  (ziploc bag) for the inner bag and then another bigger ziploc type bag to store your Curl formers in once you open the outer bag. Shipping was fast with both products.</li>
            <li> My daughter had to get Curl Formers for cheerleading. When I found out how much they cost, I had a fit. Then I went online looking for a sale and found these. They are wonderful and work great.  I compared them to the name brand, and the quality is just as good, and they are so easy to use. The curls they form are perfect too.</li>
            <li> I have not use curlformers yet, so i cant compare them to these Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets. I will say that i enjoy using them! At first they&#x27;re a little difficult to get used too, and sleep in. But the curls come out wonderfully. I have natural hair that is think (4a-4b) and it makes my hair looks as if i applied a flat iron to the roots! My hair comes out very shiny and bouncy. Definitely give these curlers a try!</li>
            <li> Cheap looking product (you get what you pay for) and the styling wand snapped in half the first time I tried to use it. I even cut my finger on the hard plastic. The product was shipped from China so the return shipping costs weren&#x27;t worth it. The company would not issue a refund but offered to replace the wand.</li>
            <li> I have the name brand curlers and these. The only reason I gave four stars is because a few of these were easily punctured with the stick, creating a hole. Other than that they are well worth the price and I would recommend them to anyone. They work just as well as the name brand curlers.</li>
            <li> ‘These worked just as well as if not better than the name brand ‘Curlformers but at a fraction of the cost. I used them on my daughter’s natural hair and the ringlets turned out perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I have been natural for 12 years.  I have never found another roller that does my hair as well as these.  They are simple to use, not-so-fun to sleep in, but work well under the dryer.  Everyone needs to own a set!</li>
            <li> This product was way better than I could have ever expected. I was able to use them with ease even though there were no instructions a quick YouTube search filled me in. I have natural African American hair with loads of shrinkage, it made my hair looked relaxed with only a leavs in conditioner. I would recommend this to anyone!!! It works.</li>
            <li> Love  my new curlfomers. I found them from a you tube&lt;br /&gt;video from naptural85 follow her direction  and&lt;br /&gt;my curls came out great.</li>
            <li> These gave me nice curl as promised, even on my natural hair. I let them set for six hours, because these are a nightmare to sleep in. I have no problem with the way the product works, but it just showed up in a bag, there wasn&#x27;t any actual packaging, nor were there any instructions. Plus, I can&#x27;t really get the rod to come apart after putting it together.</li>
            <li> I bought these so that I could have perfect spiral curls and these curlers delivered! They are a plastic flat mesh spiral. You slide the long hook tool through the middle of the mesh curler, hook a piece of hair, and pull the hook back out. This pulls the hair through the curler. You could air dry or since they are mesh, sit under a dryer or use a dryer. Be sure to put a small amount of product on your hair so that it does not get frizzy. The first time I used them, there were a couple that did turn out frizzy, but I wet them down and recurled them. I also did not do them in front of the mirror the first time, so I did not watch what I was doing. Love these!!!</li>
            <li> I really like these curlers. they do give my hair more length as opposed to flexi rods but i haven&#x27;t gotten my curls to last as long using this curl-former dupe. I will keep playing around with different techniques and products. Nonetheless, i really like this product and sleeping with them is not as bad as i thought it would be. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it is not comfortable to sleep with, but to me the discomfort is not overbearing .</li>
            <li> This product is garbage. I first wanted to buy this product because I was interested in no heat curls and this looked like the perfect answer. Once I tried it, it ended up horrible. Some pieces got into the little tube &#x27;things&#x27; but others got stuck. I found myself so frustrated trying to pull these through my hair, and it hurt so bad. It was as if I was pulling the hair out of my head. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE</li>
            <li> They are not the easiest to sleep in but my curls were silky and bouncy. I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I received the item before the estimated deliver date, which I was very pleased about. I haven&#x27;t used the product as yet, so I can&#x27;t say much about it. The only negative was the packaging. The curlers were in a ziploc bag, but for the price I guess I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I was so sure these weren&#x27;t going to work, but they are AMAZEBALLS! My curls were so defined and smooth; my hair so bouncy and soft, almost as if I came from the salon.  If you&#x27;re not able to buy the official Curlformers, these are a great substitute.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!!! My hair came out nice every time the only downside is that is you are not careful you can pull your hair out. Not good for someone like myself who is going natural. But yes these work the same as the actual curl formers from Sallys. Remember these are knock offs but they definitely do the job if you do them right. Check out you tube videos because they do not come with instruction. I also would not recommend you use them every day because the pulling on your roots can weaken your hair. But overall I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> They are great. Took me a few tries to get it right, but I love the results. Would def refer to a friend.</li>
            <li> To me these just take a lot of time to put in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair goes from curly poodle to pin straight in a couple of hours even with products; can&#x27;t blame that entirely on the curlformers, my hair plays an important role in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I take them out a lot of hair falls out as well, so I try not to use them too often.</li>
            <li> Worked as well as curlformers for less than 20.00, will be buying a second set soon for a tighter set. Highly reccommend</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the curlformers. They work exactly how they are intended.</li>
            <li> Works great and very sturdy. These curlers are now my go-to product for my hairdo. They allow me toI would purchase again. Great value for the price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have not used the Hair Flair Curlformers, but I don&#x27;t think I will need to seeing as how Alicia James (a YouTube Natural hair community guru) did a side-by-side comparison of the $70 product and the $18 product, both of which work identically to another. Why spend $70 when you achieve the same results after spending less?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would recommend, however, is that you purchase an actual Curlformer hook from the name-brand Hair Flair because the hook that I received with these Vankind magic leverage ones got caught on my hair because of rogue remnants of plastic left over from the mold. You do want to have a smoother, firmer, stronger, higher quality hook to safely pull your hair through the tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shoulder-length type 4A/4B hair and no blow dryer was needed to achieve heatless smooth curls! I simply washed and conditioned my hair, sectioned it off, and while still damp applied Miss Jessie&#x27;s Leave In Condish and Soultanicals Marula-Muru Moisture butter then attached the magic leverage curl former, adding moisture with a spray bottle as needed. The tubes do hold the hair flat and stretch it out, even with my hair being about 40% wet when I attached them. They were left in overnight (not the best night&#x27;s sleep unfortunately!) and easily removed in the morning. I would recommend a soft bonnet dryer for these as sleeping on them will not be happening again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also may want to wash them in warm/hot water with some shampoo before your first and after every use simply to keep them clean and effective.</li>
            <li> Loved the amount I received for the price. Would order again. Came just as they are pictured. Love the product.</li>
            <li> These work great and produce very cute curls! My daughter has really long hair that doesn&#x27;t stay curled with heat curlers and these do the trick!</li>
            <li> works as advertised. But there a little to big  and a few of them already broke.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice, but nice result. Not comfortable to sleep in at all, though.  In order to get a good curl on my thick hair, it needs a good 2-3 hours in (which for work, would have me getting up at 3am to put them in.)  I may try once more to sleep in them but this may just be a weekend thing...</li>
            <li> I did not experience any of the problems I have read in the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The product came in a very timely fashion.&lt;br /&gt;The price was right, the results were great.</li>
            <li> I love them , they are  easy to put on and take off my kids love their hair and the look after all</li>
            <li> These are great. And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I use these to do a set along with Camille Rose Naturals Aloe Whipped Butter Gel. My hair is natural and my set lasts me about 4 days before I have to put it up in a ponytail. These are easy to use and good quality. My only tiny complaint is some of them.have rough edges so my hair has been caught on it. It wasn&#x27;t many and can easily be avoided by flipping the roller around and using the part with the smooth edge. All in all I love these and if I ever lose them I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Product was easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works nicely, however, if you have long, thick hair, buy, at the least two packages (I wish I had).  Takes practice to use but one tip I&#x27;d like to share is use small strands because if it&#x27;s too much (you&#x27;ll have to decide based on the thickness of your hair) it&#x27;ll get stuck. :-)  Hard to sleep in too.</li>
            <li> Works very well, sometimes gets tangled when pulling the hair out, otherwise great product</li>
            <li> Rod broke after 2 uses but taped it together and still works, curls look nice but try not to put too much hair in one curl because it wont give it as much of a tight curl. Also it is time consuming but if you have nothing to do on a Friday night, curl your hair</li>
            <li> Okay first let me start by saying I do not normally do reviews. That being said, I have never been one to curl my hair, I usually kept it short and easy to manage.. (tomboy).. I now have hair almost to my waist and just keep it in a pony tail or clips. I decided to try these  on a whim and wanting some more curl to my hair. I have thick wavy hair. The curlers came in a ziploc bag and included one hook and there are NO instructions. I watched a ton of videos on YouTube before I purchased. From watching the videos I did go ahead and wash my hair and let it dry for a few hours so that it was still damp. The first curler went in with no issues. The second one I had too much hair and it did get stuck. DO NOT PULL THROUGH.. push the hook back up and remove your hair! Once I got in the swing of things the curlers went in very easy. I did sleep in them for the night and removed them when I woke up in the morning. They are not uncomfortable but not very comfortable either (to sleep in). The Results.. AMAZING CURLS!!! Yep I said it.. This product gave me, an amateur, AMAZING curls. I would highly suggest these for anyone wanting some curls without the major damage to your hair. The only CON is that the bottom of my hair sticks out of these curlers.. they are not long enough so I am hunting for a longer set.</li>
            <li> I gave it a three star rating because I couldn&#x27;t get them to work for me. I watched some of the videos on utube but still couldn&#x27;t get them to work. It looks so simple on the videos but I would get my hair hung up inside the curler and couldn&#x27;t get it out. I guess it would work better if I were using them on someone else where I could see what I was doing better, but it just won&#x27;t work for me on my own hair. The couple of curls that I got in did work good but I just couldn&#x27;t get many curlers in my hair.</li>
            <li> No instructions.  A gift for my 10 year old niece and had difficulty figuring out how to use.</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the cost of Curlformers, this is a great deal. I duct taped the hook wand as suggested in a previous review and it works like a charm. After using the set for the first time, I had great spiral curls and definition. However, just like Curlformers, you can NOT sleep in these. Very difficult to lay on, so expect to spend a couple of hours air drying or sit under some low heat if you need to be styled and ready to go to an event. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase of the Vakind curlers.</li>
            <li> This product is just perfect! I was going to pay 4 times more for a similar product. These curlers are the same product at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I have the original curlformers and at about 60 bucks back when i bought them at my local sallys, these curlers are a steal because they are just as good if not better than curlformers. Honestly if I had tried these first i never would have shelled out the $60 for the curlformers. these feel like they will hold up well over time unlike my curlformers which a few have already broke. They are also a little longer than the curlformers that i have. I just wanna say that i will be ordering another set soon.</li>
            <li> I have never used this product before or it&#x27;s rival. But I love them already. they were easy to use for a beginning naturalista. Not to bad to sleep in either.</li>
            <li> These curlformers gives me the curls I love without using heat. I use these once a week. Good for any hair type.</li>
            <li> my curls came out perfectly gorgeous.  I can only imagine these are as good as the real deal because I don&#x27;t think my curls could of gotten any better.  Love them!</li>
            <li> I used these two times and they an starting to brake. Some are to the point that I can not use them and some are still useable but not for long, These work great and I love them but they are already braking. I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This vakind hair curler worked well for my natural hair. I would try it if you want nice bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> These were so easy to use! I loved the results I got! The Vakind Hair Curler Magic Set is awesome! I would highly recommended them to people who are trying to use less heat on their hair.........I have a tutorial on how to use them: http://youtu.be/1s8ywmHxvzo</li>
            <li> These are awesome and totally worth the price. Glad I purchased them FROM VANKIND THROUGH AMAZON.COM. If you have natural hair this will work for you.</li>
            <li> I followed every direction on youtube and it still ripped my hair out! Should&#x27;ve known something was going to go bad. At least I got my money back.</li>
            <li> I wish someone would send me instructions on use.  I just cannot figure out it will be good to have for grand kids.</li>
            <li> So i have shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;not too long was happy to try this product however not too thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;wishing i could have made better decision then ordering.&lt;br /&gt;thinking of giving it away.&lt;br /&gt;other then that maybe i will give it anohter try with someone else&#x27;s hair. LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price. I&#x27;ve only had to throw away one curlformer because it was torn at the bottom and I didn&#x27;t want my hair to snag.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT TRY TO SLEEP IN THEM. It will just cause you pain and make you cry for relief at 3am in the morning...not that I would know anything about that.&lt;br /&gt;My first package came with just the bottom half of the hook but the seller responded quickly and sent me a new hook.&lt;br /&gt;My curls turned out great!</li>
            <li> I  haven&#x27;t used them yet but I look forward to using them soon. Every thing came as expected thank you.</li>
            <li> I found nothing wrong with the curl formers. I guess the only downfall was the packageing (?), the rollers came in a clear ziplock bag. I didn&#x27;t think it was that big of a deal... But to others it might, idk. I might post a picture, we shall see...;)</li>
            <li> hard to sleep in.... ugh... Not soft at all!</li>
            <li> I thought these where great and actually  worked they where also pretty easy to use</li>
            <li> It worked well and gave me a nice curl,patter for my 4c hair.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t wait to try this when i got them... it worked better on wet hair for me but i definitely should of blowdryed my hair because some spots were still wet and made my hair puffy afterwords but all in all i love the way the curls came out good product</li>
            <li> Love it! Just like the curlformers but you don&#x27;t have to spend an arm and a leg to get the same results</li>
            <li> As great as all the reviews stated. Would buy again! Can&#x27;t tell a difference between these or my actual curlformers (from wife of G. Delano)</li>
            <li> The curlers and wand arrived earlier than expected and worked perfectly. They did not come with instructions but I already researched the product online. Anyone looking for an inexpensive alternative to the name brand Curlformers would do well to purchase these curlers. I&#x27;ve used them at least five times and I get excellent results each time. The trick is twisting the hair at the root first and then pulling it through. Also, I noticed dramatically different results when I changed how much hair I put in each curler and using the curlers on dry hair versus wet hair. I have relaxed hair--using these curlers when wet gives me the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It is possible to pull out strands of your hair with these curlers if you pull too hard. My suggestion is to just push the wand back through and start over. There are some great videos on YouTube that show the process, just search for Curlformers videos.</li>
            <li> Loved it but the handle thing was very flimsy and it kept coming apart when I tried to put my hair through it so I have to buy the real curl formers handle thing from sallys. Other than that it was great.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use if you tape the hook together tightly.  Perfect spiral curls. Not frizzy. Really helps if you watch a tutorial.  Don&#x27;t pay all of tha $ for name brand.  Love, love, love</li>
            <li> This is my third set of the curlformers.  I absolutely love what they do for my hair.  I got the 3rd set a little longer, because my hair is really growing.  Not because of the curlformers, but it is growing.</li>
            <li> my hair is really long and i guess i assumed these formers would curl my hair i have to put in something to keep the curls prior to putting them on which is just not good for me so i let my girls use them.</li>
            <li> I ordered two packages after reeding the reviews and there not being enough in one package. I have been playing with these for a month now. Used them several times. My step daughter does my hair in them for me. I have yet to try it on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are rough to sleep in I will agree with that comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit longer then the name brand ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wond should be a bit longer cuz I find it difficult to hold my place on the head and scrunch the curler so I can grab the wind and pull it threw. I use be chest a lot when putting them in my daughters hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick and heavy so my curls don&#x27;t last all day even with hair spray but I&#x27;m going to go get my hair thinned out and see if that helps a lot!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!!! I have really thick long board straight hair and had pretty much given up on ever getting it to curl even a little bit after wasting literally hundreds of dollars over the last 20 years on every single kind of curlers, curling products, &amp; curling irons that is/has been on the market. These things are an absolute miracle tho and have turned this sceptic into a true believer!! &#x3D;) I am still in shock over the results I got from these! I&#x27;m not talking about just a little bit of curl but full out beautiful amazing curls like you would see in a magazine! I wish I could post pics of the results I got because it&#x27;s AMAZING!! I&#x27;ve only used em twice now so far and both times had complete strangers actually stopping me to compliment me on my hair and wanting to know what I had used to get such beautiful curls! &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I could handle sleeping in them because they are pretty bulky especially if you have a lot of hair like I do tho! &#x3D;\&lt;br /&gt;For me, I just take a shower in the morning, blow dry my hair about 1/2way, and then use a styling mouse on my hair before putting in the curlformers. I leave em in for about 30-45 minutes while I eat breakfast and finish getting ready and then use my hair dryer again over the curlformers to make sure my hair has completely dried in them before taking them out. All that&#x27;s left is to run my fingers through my hair a couple of times to separate the curls a little bit and get more of a natural look then I spray my hair all over with hairspray and I&#x27;m off to face the day with a beautiful head full of curls! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Love them, love them, love them!  Does exactly what my curl formers do. Wish I had seen these first. **order the extra curl former hook. It is a bit more sturdier then the one which comes with the Vakind brand.</li>
            <li> Product is great! Exactly as described! Great quality! Great price! Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This works wonders for my natural transaction hair</li>
            <li> THEY WORK GREAT GAVE AS A GIFT TO MY NIECE FOR B-DAY. NO INSTUKTIONS!! Found on the net by tidal full name.</li>
            <li> These are AWESOME! They&#x27;re a bitch to sleep in but I&#x27;ve tried the other more &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; ones and my curl isn&#x27;t as tight. Order two bags so you have enough to make as neat or as big as a curl you want. I find that I have to combine some when I get to the end of the process because I&#x27;ve run out. I will be ordering another bag. Curls came out AMAZING and it&#x27;s nice to have another way to do your hair without having to expose it to heat.</li>
            <li> Only used them a couple times, but so far I feel like they&#x27;ve been successful. My main recommendation is to BUY EXTRA HOOKS! LOL...snapped mine in half 2nd time out, so I&#x27;m buying a couple more. I don&#x27;t know if the name brand is sturdier, and the cheap one wasn&#x27;t fragile, but sure enough my thick hair and awkward movements snapped it at the connection. I&#x27;ll post a better review after I&#x27;ve gotten some real curl cream and stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 7yrs, my texture is 4c (coily ziggly). Put wrap foam on each portion of my hair right before I put the Curlformer in.(it&#x27;s best if your hair is a little damp not wet) Put a blow dryer bonnet on for about 30 mins. Slept in them and when I took them out the next day Fantastic spiral curls! :) Pinned them up at night and worn a satin bonnet to bed. This style last for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried the Curlformers without the dryer and the curl last almost a full day.</li>
            <li> After reading just about every review out there and watching numerous YouTube videos, I was sold. Though I had to wait several weeks for the curls to arrive, I have not been disappointed. I have used them twice since receiving them last weekend and woke up with perfect curls both times. I have seen the price that Curlformers charge...DO NOT PAY THAT PRICE. This version is exactly the same and works just as well and it&#x27;s nearly a $50 difference! The ONLY minor problem I have is with the hook as it tends to separate in the process of pulling slightly thicker strands of hair through--nothing super glue can&#x27;t fix! From someone who LOVES curly hair but can&#x27;t figure out how to avoid burning my ears with a curling iron, THESE CURLERS ARE AMAZING!</li>
            <li> These curlers are awesome. I haven&#x27;t tried the &#x27;Curlformers&#x27; brand, but i&#x27;m sure i wont have to because these work very well. They aren&#x27;t hard to install at all. If you have a problem doing so, just watch some you-tube videos for curlfomers; there are tons on YouTube. My only downfall i&#x27;d say flexi-rod curls last longer, but these are still a good buy. DONT SPEND 60 BUX FOR CURLFORMERS, these are just as good!!!</li>
            <li> These are amazing! Super easy to put in (once you know how) and looks great afterwards! Put them in with slightly damp hair and let sit for an hour or two and stayed nice tight, defined bouncy curls for 2 days with no product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these things! I am African American with 4b and 4c hair. With some Shea Butter, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Eco Styler gel on damp hair, I popped these bad boys in before I went to bed and got a head full of curls the next morning. They are so easy to put in and take out! Now keep in mind that these things are not all that comfortable to sleep in. However, I managed and it wasn&#x27;t that bad for me. I woke up twice to change positions and reposition the curlformers so that I could lay my head down comfortably. I highly recommend this product. Great buy! I&#x27;ll be using these for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This product is clearly an illegal and counterfeit product. The curlers are sub-standard, and are not the size advertised. They also give off a smell (like burned tyres) which could indicate the use of cheap (and probably illegal) plastics (that is also probably why they are so cheap in comparison with the original Curlformers). As well as this, the hook provided is very weak and breaks easily. However, the most urgent issue is that these products are being sold illegally. Next time, I won&#x27;t be duped by the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll buy the real thing and tell everyone else to do the same.</li>
            <li> Very very happy with this product!!  This is exactly what I wanted.  My hair is natural  and I was able to do heat-less  curls  that lasted for the week. My sister and mom have purchased some of their own now  :-). I have wanted these for a long time but Ididn&#x27;t want to pay the price. With this set you get 40 for the low. These are stupid expensive at  the beaty supply so this is a much better option yo get the same thing for cheap.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a mixed AA woman with wavy, curly, and kinky hair textures. my hair is almost mid back length. i have fine to normal strands with normal density. i have 50-60% shrinkage all throughout. my hair fits in the curlers perfectly. i have plenty of room left over in them so i can see me using these for a while to come. i brought two packages to be cautious. glad i did because i did go thru one whole pack. i did not sleep in these. i used a soft bonnet dryer before i went to bed. since my hair is fine, the curls didnt last long (about 2 days) but thats normal for my hair. i&#x27;m lucky to get 3 day hair. the only thing i would say is not to put the curler too close to your root. i did and went you slide them up it makes the curler move even closer to your scalp. so, my scalp was aching but that was my fault. all in all, its worth it</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE these knockoff curlformers! My hair dries super fast and the curl lasts for days! My hair is 100% natural with a hair type of 3b/3c. These are excellent.y curls look like I did them with heat!</li>
            <li> Purchased this set for my sister who was trying to locate this down here - Jamaica. She was shocked by the low price and the quality of the set.</li>
            <li> I love it. I wish I bought 2 packs instead of 1. I have a lot of hair . I&#x27;m gonna order 1 more</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a friend, however I was disappointed by it.  First, my hair is long and blonde.  If the hair didn&#x27;t go in perfectly, it came out looking ratty—almost matted.  Also, there were random crimps in the top and bottom of the curls from where the curler closed.  I think in darker hair, it may not be as noticeable.  Some of that may be attributed to my lack of experience using these rollers.  I also noticed that the wand wasn&#x27;t long enough to go through the entire curler, so I had to try to scrunch the curler on the wand...all while trying to keep my hair sectioned off, and then pull it through.  I found this process annoying and it was way too much work compared to other hair curling methods.</li>
            <li> I love love love my curlformers. I use them weekly. They are so much easier than using a curler set. And after I wrap the curls around my head to stretch them, they look even more amazing! I love curformers.</li>
            <li> works perfect and gives nice curls</li>
            <li> I just received my curlers, and I will say for the price these are pretty good. However, a few of my curlers were missing the rubber tips. The hook is very hard to put together, I had to take my pocket knife and kind of carve it that way it would fit properly. It still take a good bit of strength to put it together though. I may order a different one. Other than that I like it. The weaving is a little harder than the real curlformers, but you get what you pay for right? I think it gives me better curls anyway. I would not sleep on these though, as I said they are harder therefore it will be very uncomfortable sleeping on these. Would definitely recommend to all my natural sistas!! It&#x27;ll give you beautiful bouncy curls!</li>
            <li> Just tried this for the first time and it was very easy to do. The curls were beautiful and very  bouncy. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The hook thingy was melted at the bottom and couldn&#x27;t connect.  Had to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between the curlers but had to purchase the original Curl Formers rod</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try these on my daughter during cheer season!  They left her with the most adorable silky looking ringlets.  Very easy to use and she slept well in them.  Great price too compared to the name brand ones!</li>
            <li> Takes a little time to get used to but definitely worth it when you do!  You will never use old-fashioned curlers again!</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to use, and my hair wash&#x27;t tangled. It make my hair sooo curly though. Also hard to take off. The hair seems to catch onto the material :/ I felt like i lost more hair then i should have.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my curlformers!! I&#x27;m a black woman of Carribean decent with thick, natural hair that falls a little past my shoulders. When I first placed my order, I was afraid that 40 curlformers wouldn&#x27;t be enough to do my whole head (I have A LOT of hair), but I found that 40 was just enough. Once you get around the learning curve, putting them in is a breeze. Plus, you don&#x27;t have to use heat if you don&#x27;t want to, so you&#x27;re spared the heat damage. My curl come out better &amp; better each time I use them &amp; with the right styling products my curls last me all week (5-6 days). Curlformers are DEFINETLY worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I like them. They&#x27;re easy to use. They don&#x27;t come with instructions, but you can find them easy enough online. Just know that the difference in colors indicates the direction of the curl. I really want some that results in bigger (looser) curls so I will try to find some other ones.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE! THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS THAT THE WAND IS RATHER SHORT AND MAKES APPLYING THE CURL FORMERS A BIT DIFFICULT. BUT OVERALL YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT THE PRICE AND QUALITY!!! I DEFINITELY RECCOMMEND TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR CURLERS AT AN AMAZING UNBEATABLE PRICE!!!</li>
            <li> Had to look at a You Tube tutorial to know exactly what I was doing; after a while  I was able to get the hang of it. it took about an hour to do, which I didn&#x27;t mind. the only negative thing I have to say about these curlers is that they really aren&#x27;t that comfortable to sleep in, but the results are GREAT!!! I have thick hair and I rarely use heat on my hair so these curlers were perfect for me!!!</li>
            <li> You need to read tutorials on youtube before you attempt these.  They are great for girls that have poker straight hair and those that have curls but want more pretty perfect hair body.  Loved them and the curls last longer than any other thing we&#x27;ve tried.  Price is way better here that in stores.  Telling all of our cheer moms to order now.</li>
            <li> Makes tight, long lasting curls. Very good product. I use the rods to curl my hair as well as my 71/2 year old daughters hair. She has medium length hair and I have long hair. The product works equally well with our different hair lengths.</li>
            <li> Awesome curlers, so easy to use. I curled my grnaddaughter&#x27;s hair, easy to put in, comfy to leave in and perfect curls. Really drys quick also.</li>
            <li> These are very easy to use.  Works on my very thin straight hair!  Start with almost dry hair and  put some product in your hair to help hold the curl if you want it to last.  Leave in for a few hours and pull them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with the out come.  I was able to do my entire head (I have long hair) no problem the first time.  I also used them on my daughter&#x27;s hair that is very thick and it again worked great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CAN NOT BLOW DRY your hair with these....it will not work.  I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to start with ALMOST DRY HAIR!!</li>
            <li> Better value than Curlformers! They do the exact same thing for way less of their price. Not as comfortable to sleep in overnight. But all in all, a recommendable buy!</li>
            <li> These are awesome for curling your hair! There is a learning curve to using them but there are lots of online videos that help, my hair never holds curls for more than 2-3 hours and this held ALL day! Works even better than heat curlers!</li>
            <li> These are great dupes for the original curlformers. The we quality is good and they work just as good as the curlformers. The price point is amazing and they gave me some awesome beautiful spirals. You get a lot for your money. I will purchase another set as soon as I find room to store them in.</li>
            <li> Tried these on a friend who&#x27;s hair never takes a curl and they worked so well she bought her own set right away. She got beautiful waves and gentle ringlets instead of the Shirley Temple style my hair likes to emulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No instructions included-plenty of YouTube videos out there if you need them but it&#x27;s very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Just assemble the hook (comes in two pieces as it&#x27;s long), push it hook end first though a tube, put a bit of hair in the hook near your scalp/roots, hold the end of the tube closest to your scalp in place as you pull out the hook and your hair will go inside. Curls take better and last longer if you have slightly damp hair, either water or a setting lotion/mouse/whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus half star only for being available in only this one curl intensity/size. My hair is dry and takes curls very easily so it came out in the exact shape of these curlers, ie Shirley Temple. Takes a fair bit of work to relax my hair back down to something normal looking so it would be lovely if Vakind offered a fatter, looser curler set, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus another half star because they are ridiculous to try to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 40 pack is enormous. Enough to do all of my thick, longish hair and 80% of my friend&#x27;s thick,  dry long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Do pay attention to the color coding (pink spirals one way and orange the other) and don&#x27;t try to cram too much hair into each tube.&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#x27;t experience any pain or hairloss unless we tried to overload the hook.</li>
            <li> Satisfied, feels and looks like the original cyrlformers, but this is much more affordable</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and these work great! I love the curls I get with them</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, but the wand is a bit cheap and doesn&#x27;t click together properly</li>
            <li> First off,I have long and thick hard to hold a curl hair, the roller length said 50-51 inches, my hair length is 46in and it tends to leave a good inch off! I still love the results gives me flat iron like curls except they feel so soft and last for 2-3 days! LOVE them and definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend at that price.  Good quality and easy to use. It did not come with instructions but you can youtube it.</li>
            <li> I first suggest you super-glue the hook, because I have heard complaints of it breaking. I have seen people use it on wet hair, but I get soft and bouncy curls on dry hair that is moisturized and a little bit of gel to hold them up. I have used them twice and while they are very uncomfortable to sleep in, the results are amazing. NO need to spend $70 at Sally&#x27;s like others to get curls when these work just as well.</li>
            <li> I am 3 years natural. hair is quite long now. been looking on youtube and kept seeing curl formers. I was not going t pay $70 for the real ones and was shocked to find these knock off brand here for $14 so I jumped on them lol they came from china so it took about 3 weeks to receive but well worth the wait. they work great for heatless curls. my new go to item for 2014 protective styles!</li>
            <li> I opened the package and immediately got worried, because there were no instructions. Quick fix: Google and YouTube, I love you. Same instructions for Curlformers, any one of the zillion videos will do. Now, you think I would of had this down pat.....No. I messed up 3 times before I got it right, but when I did, it was amazing. I made the mistake of sleeping in them. They do not have anywhere to go, so it was super uncomfortable.Put these in when you have a few hours of house work to do, or lay around watching movies. I have bra strap length hair and fine, but a ton of it. I used all of the 40 included, on damp hair. Took me about an hour to put them all in. I assume this will go down in time once I have done this more than once. I took the curlers out after 8 hrs. in, at 5 am, it is now 8am and my curls are almost all straight. It looked gorgeous at first, I still love the curlers, but it&#x27;s my fault for not putting some sort of mousse or setting lotion. So far though, love these things. No heat, no damage.</li>
            <li> These hair curlers are as good as the brand ones if not even better. At first I struggle with insulation but after a while it was quick simple and easy. I have used mines now several times and they still stand strong to the test. I do not have any bad odor, as I was worried about from previous reviews. Do your self a favor and save allot of money and buy these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the product. Easy to use. Don&#x27;t force the wand through the hair. If there is resistance, start over!! I can&#x27;t compare Curlformers but my hair which is textured black hair responded well and curls were soft and flexible!!</li>
            <li> Got this set for my daughter,  She has very fine hair and doesn&#x27;t hold curl well.  Not the case with these curlers.  Used them with her wet hair and she slept in them.  Removed them before school.  Curls held all day!!  One happy little girl!! :)</li>
            <li> I saw them at Sally Beauty for $13.99 for a set of eight, plus the &amp;#34;needle&amp;#34; was sold separately for $5!  When I found 40 of these including the threader needle for $11 (and I have prime) I scooped them up ASAP.  Ordered on a Saturday and they arrived Monday!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately tried them out on my shoulder-length, naturally curly hair (my curls are unruly and I wanted these to help them lie differently).  I had read the reviews that stated you need to use small sections, should smooth the hair out first, watch youtube videos... the only advice I heeded was use small sections and I never had any issues.  Never had any hair that got tangled, only set the curler too far away from my scalp twice, and loved the results.  VERY easy to use, a little tougher to get the hang of and get the right style from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used no styling product, no water, no heat, nothing (although it has been raining here for days and the air was damp).  just pulled the hair into the curlers and left them in for a few hours.  My curls were a tad frizzy, so next time I&#x27;ll try a slightly different approach and see what kind of difference it makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly I was happy that they gave my hair body.  I have a cowlick on the back of my head near the top so from the side my hair, even when left to dry naturally curly, is flat in that spot.  These helped set the hair at that part of my head better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and when I need to refresh the look between washings, I don&#x27;t have to use heat and damage my hair, just pop in a couple of these curlers and leave them alone for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer stated, file down the sharp edge on the needle first, or you&#x27;ll get it caught on your hair and in the curler, which could eventually cause damage.  I also did 90% of these by touch- without looking in a mirror at all.  My new favorite styling product!</li>
            <li> Love these! So much cheaper than the original curlformers. Took a LITTLE over an hour to put all of them in, I had 5-8 left over and have shoulder length(when stretched) hair that has really kinky/tight curls that resembles an afro when shrunken.Put them n my hair at night and took one out in the morning but it was still wet. put a dryer over them for about 15 minutes and my hair was completely dry once I removed the curlers. My curls were tight spirals. My suggestion would be to put these on in the morning, dry them a little with a hair dryer and allow them to air dry for a few hours. I say this because sleeping on them was pretty uncomfortable. Not because they tugged on my hair, but the hard plastic made it hard for me to find a position to lay my head comfortably. And also because my hair was still wet  the next day. My hair came out soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> The hook was too small for the curlers and because I bought them through amazon, the company wouldn&#x27;t help me.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them twice and I&#x27;ve had great results each time.  My only issue is that the wand is a bit flimsy, but that caused a really minor inconvenience.  I see no reason to pay 70 bucks for Curlformers when you can get these for so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Came in the expected time. Worked well on natural hair. Love the curl definition. Packaging was ziplock bags with tape wrapped arround it though. But with the price that wasnt a real issue for me.</li>
            <li> I love my curl formers! Better results for 4c hair if used when damp. YouTube was my bestfriend for these bad boys because they did not come with instructions. But overall a wonderful product</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair. I am Hispanic and was looking for a way to get natural spiral looking curls without applying heat. I have tried many things including the peach colored perming rods (results were very similar). I was super excited to use them because my friend had great results but she has a different hair texture than me (mixed girl hair). When I received them they had a long brown hair stuck between a curl former which I thought was pretty gross. However, they are very easy to use if you watch video tutorials and such but unfortunately just left me with some really ugly curls. They were not very tight and they would just clump up into one giant curl which I hate. Also tons of my hair would rip out. I was disappointed but then again, I believe it all depends on the hair texture!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected. On time too.</li>
            <li> love them but they are a little cheap looking but i guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> The curlers do work, however, I found it impossible to sleep with them in.  I can&#x27;t sleep face-down and that&#x27;s the least painful sleep option. They would be great if you have a couple hours for your hair to dry.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair is so thick and down to her bum. These are the first curlers to work! Love them!</li>
            <li> I love my ringlets! I had a ton of compliments. The only down fall is the hook. I had to replace it with another one!!!</li>
            <li> These are a cheaper way to go to get the same outcome that you would get purchasing the ones in the store - HOWEVER, these are NOT comfortable to sleep in so I suggest doing them early in the morning then taking them out before bed. They can cause a headache if you are doing them tight or trying to sleep on them</li>
            <li> Gets the same results as curl formers long and wide size. Did notice when receiving this package a few pieces were torn on the mesh...very minimal that it wasn&#x27;t much of a problem to put them on. Delivery was decent it didn&#x27;t turn out to be several weeks to show up at the door. Product comes from china.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference between these and curlformers official brand is the ends are a slick rubber (hurts slighty more then the original). The original curlformers have a matte finish on the ends of the curl tube.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been experimenting with different hair products and we so these in a beauty supply store and decided to give them a try, she found them on your website for less then what the BSS was asking. Thank you.</li>
            <li> These curlers work fine, but they are a hassle to put in; I had some problems with my hair getting tangled in the curlers, especially when curling the back. Once they are in, they aren&#x27;t very comfortable and I immediately want them out. The curls come out nice but they are tighter than I&#x27;d like. I wish they made them in extra wide size so I could try those. I also have problems with my hair looking frizzy at the top but I think that&#x27;s just how my hair is. I tried these twice and I don&#x27;t think I will be using them again.</li>
            <li> OMG!! You don&#x27;t need to purchase expensive curlformers...These work just as well and are soooooo much cheaper!!!! Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> Curls are soft, sleek and bouncy but they are hard to sleep in and the needle will tear your hair if not careful. You get what you expect for the price. The needle had some jagged edges that I had to file and melt down after the first piece of hair was snagged. Online tutorials on the tube of you were quite helpful but it was still a challenge for a first timer like myself to put them in. I didn&#x27;t quite have the method down until I got to the last few pieces of hair. I started with wet hair and twisted each piece of hair at the root (small pieces of hair strung through the needle more effectively). Package arrived before expected and like I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, the plastic curlers do have an odor to them so I just soaked them in some soapy water and rinsed, the odor dissipates. For storage, they needed to be placed in a container because the thin flimsy plastic it is came in ripped. . Docked one star for the less than stellar needle hair hook thing.</li>
            <li> These look and work exactly like my Curlformers, maybe a little better. They seemed to make my hair appear shinier than the originals. I loved them and they are very easy to install and gives you great spiral curls.</li>
            <li> shipped to me in Illinois in 7 days.  works amazing! and I have kinky/coily hair.  Wish they were the Extra Wide &amp; Extra Long but they make amazing soft curls.  glad i saved and did not buy the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; kind&lt;br /&gt;have not had any problems with them breaking (and if i do i have 40 of them...i have lots of hair and it took 20 max to do my entire head)&lt;br /&gt;will repurchase from seller - great product</li>
            <li> Often times people say, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; With this being a significant amount cheaper than Curlformers, I was a bit skeptical. They worked great. If not better than Curlformers, then just as good. The only thing I would suggest is the products you use while installing these. Play with products such as different types of gels or setting lotions and test them out in your hair first. I used Eco styling gel and my hair hated it. While my curls WERE there and amazing, I hated my results ONLY because of the products I used. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give you tight curls.  Go ahead and spend more money on real curlformers</li>
            <li> Hard to do but it works.</li>
            <li> Took about an hour to install all rollers (but I also took my time to make sure I didn&#x27;t snag any hair.....uncomfortable to sleep in which is why I did not give the 5 stars.  However the results were very beautiful and lasted several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a woman with curly hair or even straight hair this is a wonderful product and a lot cheaper than the actual brand itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Wet/damp hair&lt;br /&gt;2.) Take a small section of hair&lt;br /&gt;3.) apply leave in conditioner&lt;br /&gt;4.) attach roller&lt;br /&gt;5.) dry (I prefer air drying to avoid heat on my natural hair)&lt;br /&gt;6.) remove roller and wah-la!</li>
            <li> What a great first time experience. This product works great! I&#x27;m so glad I checked online before buying the name brand at Sally&#x27;s. I have kinky textures hair and I did not have it soaking wet. I dampened my hair with a water spray bottle and some moisturizer and that&#x27;s it. I slept in it overnight., which by the way was not so comfortable. I recommend air dry throughout the day or sitting under a hair dryer. But overall great product!</li>
            <li> I just love these. If you looking for more volume to you hair, this product most definitely gets the job done. I do suggest getting lotta body if you want some good, yet affordable wet-set lotion to use with the rollers.</li>
            <li> This is a really cool product. I only gave it 4-Stars because of three reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1) It came in a ziplock bag: I was hoping it would come in the original case, but unfortunately I have to buy that separate. No biggie, just my expectations were different.&lt;br /&gt;2) The wand is flimsy: The wand seems to bend easily at the attachment part and it kept coming apart when I would install the spirals. I had to glue them together so this would stop happening.&lt;br /&gt;3) Doesn&#x27;t hold curl long without a holding product: This product produces GORGEOUS curls, but if you want them to last long, make sure to apply a holding product on the hair prior to installing the ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an African-American woman with very thick, kinky hair. I only wet the hair, applied a moisturizer and installed the spirals. They came out very pretty and looked as if I used a curling iron. I would definitely use it again, but next time, with a setting lotion so the curls will last.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I just apply a mixture of oil and water (spray bottle) and the curlers are installed easily! It gives me long lasting curls. I would suggest buying TWO packs .. this will give you a fuller head of curls and you wont have to separate your curls as much and mess up the pattern</li>
            <li> These take a bit to get use to and I watched a bunch of how to videos on youtube to get the hang of it. My daughter loved the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried the name brand but these worked great! They were easy to install and remove. Worked well on my type 3 hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about the curl formers (The 80 dollar kind) &amp; these may even work better from the results I&#x27;ve seen from others. I use these every other week, as a3c natural who just hit phase 2 length, and I use mousse for my set and LOVE these with all of my heart. If I had to choose one styling product, it would be between these and my flat iron</li>
            <li> This version of the product is good.  I&#x27;m glad i didn&#x27;t spend the extra money on the real curl formers product.  This only gets 4 stars because they are HELL to sleep on and a I had a bit of a learning curve to get them on right.  Other than that I&#x27;m sure I will use them more in the future.  Oh and just liek a few reviewers said, you do have to cut and file down the little &#x27;nub&#x27; on the pulling tool.</li>
            <li> The curls come out really tight if you leave them in for an hour and half an hour for very soft curls. I really love these and will be buying some for myself.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and I go long periods without relaxing it, so for a quick and easy style this is it. Makes the perfect curl.</li>
            <li> I got express shipping for these because I&#x27;m going to a formal event, and needed spiral curls for the base. I had been wanting to try these for a while with the more expensive brand, but didn&#x27;t have the money. Someone that I watch on Youtube reviewed this brand, and that review (as well as the amazing price) made me more inclined to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got them yesterday and installed the curlers. They were very easy to use, but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve seen tutorials on how to do it. The curls turned out great! I think this is my new favourite hair tool! The only thing is that it would be nice to have directions in there for people that don&#x27;t know how to use them already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely order more because when I initially put them in, I ran out! I had to redo everything to get all of my hair done, but overall, I really love this product! I also recommended them to a friend!</li>
            <li> They work so well for my 4 year old daughter. Saves me a lot of time and the curls are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I decided to purchase these instead of spending all that money on the curlformers brand. It took some practice at first but  it got easier. I&#x27;ve only used them once because they are time consuming to put in and even harder to sleep in. I would suggest doing this earlier in the day so they can air dry or sitting under the hair dryer so you don&#x27;t have to sleep in it. They are not comfortable at all. :-) Also do not put too much hair in these otherwise its not going to work.</li>
            <li> does not create nice curls</li>
            <li> I love these. If they are fake then I can not tell the difference they do the same thing as the real ones and my stick did not break as I read in the past. My hair is natural and very thick and I had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Yale</li>
            <li> Wonderful, it curl my hair very quick. I also like how they feel and how long they are. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try Curlformers for a while but couldn&#x27;t get past the price for a set. I saw a You-Tubers review the Magic Leverage version and decided to give these a try. Admittedly, I have never tried the Curlformers brand so I cannot compare the two. However I can say that the Magic Leverage version works amazingly well. I have natural 3c/4a hair and my curls same out sleek and frizz free. Perfect for getting almost \\&quot;flat ironed hair\\&quot; without heat. I did read negative reviews about hair getting stuck on the hook that comes with this set. I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances with having my hair snagging that so I purchased the Curlformers brand hook at Sallys (it retails for like $5) and used it instead. Even with purchasing the additional hook, this set is still a bargain compared to the Curlformers set.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! I 100% recommend this! i slept  with  these  over  night (a  bit  uncomfortable  but  managed). In  the  morning I  had  the. most  beautiful  tight curls.I then seperated the tight curls n I had  beautiful  hair n  soo  much  volume.I  wish I  could  upload a  picture  with  the  final  results.The  item  did  take a  very  long  time to arrive in my case.It wasn&#x27;t complete as far as the hook.I received 2  of  the  same top hook  instead  off  top n  bottom  to  connect  but I  taped them  together lol  and  made it  work.I  didn&#x27;t  mind  will  definitely  repurchase  this  item  in  the  near  future :)</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these curlers, we&#x27;ve used them twice win two weeks.  She&#x27;s three and they don&#x27;t bother her at all to sleep in and the curls are adorable!!!  They are easy to put in and don&#x27;t fall our during the night.  I&#x27;m so excited to use these for many years to come!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE theses things I will purchase many more in different sizes. The only thing is that they are hard to sleep in</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my new curlers. I have figaro but this is very easier way to get that look. It is very practical and you can do it on yourself. The results are amazing. I love them and I recommend to all.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic! I love the curls and they&#x27;re easy and quick to put in. I normally just lightly spritz my hair ( not wet or even very damp), get them in my hair and by the time my makeup is done I have great curls. I&#x27;m more then happy with them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if these are the generic version, I STILL LOVE THEM. They are absolutely amazing and really easy to install. My package came right as expected and I&#x27;ve been using them ever since. They give your hair a wonderful, tight and bouncy curl. I received plenty of compliments and they are really easy to style. However, it may be difficult for the first few nights to sleep in. Over all, I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my six-year-old daughter who has long hair. We love to do waves in her hair with a curling iron, but after an hour or so, they are limp and not very curly. These curlers are amazing (and super simple). It took about 20 minutes to put them in her hair (and will probably go faster next time now that I know what I&#x27;m doing). We let it air dry for about 3 hours and then easily slid them out of her (extra tender head, might I add!) These curls were gorgeous! She wore them two days in a row without any touch-ups. I am recommending these to all my friends with little girls who want to have beautiful curls without all the styling products, heat and trying to twist curlers into their hair. Can&#x27;t wait to try them again on her!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look further than here for the amazing curlers that everybody is talking about. My straight hair now has so much bounce and body. I love these curlers. Can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
            <li> I had trouble with this item&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t get shipped to my house on time&lt;br /&gt;I paid for 2 day delivery and came to me within a week (not cool)&lt;br /&gt;Also some of the curl former where either missing the round parts at the end of them or they had holes in them&lt;br /&gt;which caused me to throw some of them out cause they where of no use. I had to go to the beauty store to buy the one that I had lost. This wasn&#x27;t a good buy for me and wish I never bought this</li>
            <li> The product came within the expected time frame (10-17 business days) and was clean and ready to use! Like other reviews have stated, the hook that came with the curlers made installation a bit tricky at first, but it wasn&#x27;t anything that I couldn&#x27;t work around. The only issue I&#x27;ve had so far was having the curls hold for second and third day hair. I&#x27;m african american, my hair is naturally curly/kinky, and I&#x27;ve used mousse and setting lotions, but nothing seems to keep the shape longer than a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this company and this product to friends and relatives. I just have to find a product that helps to hold the curl without leaving it crunchy and dry. The cost and the service make this product a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great curls! Use a curling creme beforehand and it will reward. I would keep them in for at least an hour depending on the thickness of your hair.</li>
            <li> These curlers are AWESOME!  I bought them to use for my 8 year old daughter who always wants her hair curly.  She takes a shower at night and then we put in the curlers.  In the morning we take them out.  Her hair is dry and has awesome ringlet curls.  It&#x27;s really curly, though, so she usually will wear a high ponytail for most of the day.  Then later in the day when she takes the ponytail out, her hair is wavy curly and looks really pretty down.  The wave/curl will last for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hardest part with this was initially learning how to put them in.  There are plenty of youtube videos to teach you, though.  After one time, in and out, I had it all figured out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other concern with these was that they would be too uncomfortable to sleep in.  My daughter has not problems sleeping in them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely suggest buying them if you have long straight hair and want it to be curly.</li>
            <li> Pros: Fairly easy to use, nice results. Easy enough for my 5 year old to use on her older sisters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Would not recoment for hair longer than mid back, curler is not long enough.</li>
            <li> I used these on my daughter and her hair came out so great and very bouncy Amazing! That is all</li>
            <li> These create such a cool effect and they&#x27;re so easy to put in your hair!</li>
            <li> I love them! Had to get use to the process at first, even watched a few YouTube videos. Now I love them!</li>
            <li> did not come with hook, had to order another package just to get the hook, other than that they are o.k.</li>
            <li> This is not near as easy as it looks on you tube!</li>
            <li> My wife has been very pleased with this product. It has worked for her hair (natural - no relaxers), and my daughter&#x27;s as well.</li>
            <li> Works on natural hair. Can easily make cute hair styles. Don&#x27;t really even need product, just conditioner. Love this thing</li>
            <li> Im just using them on 1/26/14  so I&#x27;ll let you know, but I was cheated out of some of the curlers. The package wasn&#x27;t complete, How does that happen? Did they think the curlers wouldn&#x27;t be counted to make sure all were there? Disappointed with that, will see how my hair comes out. had to figure them out, but once I did using them was alrite. It would be nice to offer different sizes within the package as well for a better effect and look of &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; of the curls. Thanks and Be Blessed..</li>
            <li> I had micro braids in my hair when the product came and I used them to curl the ends of the braids. My spiral curls came out great!</li>
            <li> They were kind of hard to put in and they hurt to sleep on. Other than that, it was a great buy</li>
            <li> The curls are beautiful. The curlers themselves are incredibly uncomfortable though, so i wouldnt recommend trying to sleep in them.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  My daughters hair is very hard to curl so I was a little skeptical that this would work.  Not only does it work,  but it works GREAT!  The curls lasted all day , and the next day they turned into soft loose curls.  Thank you for your amazing product.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Got it on time.</li>
            <li> Great product and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price, totally worth it! Works as promised. One was broken which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Great for making curls! Great versatility especially for African American hair. I have type 4 hair (Kinky curly) and these made perfect defined curls with no frizz! Watch a YouTube tutorial before trying! These are better than traditional roller setting!</li>
            <li> Theses worked just as well as curlformers that I have used but for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> These do great on hard to curl hair. Curls last for days!!</li>
            <li> They take a while to place but the results are lovely!</li>
            <li> Why spend 4 times as much on actual curl formers.these with awesome. My daughter has thick very hard to curl hair abd the other daughter had thin poker straight hair abd it cheeks both of them perfectly. If you have very long hair like mine you might need two curlers on one section of hair to curl the hike piece. I bought a pack of 2 i4 abd did my 5 year old entire head. I&#x27;m going to purchase this pack of 40 so I can do both girls in one night. I highly recommend, you can audio do permanent washing with these there is a curlformer tutorial on it.</li>
            <li> Very quick service. I wanted no heat curls for my wedding and these did just the trick. I had my friend put them in, and she got the hang of it pretty quickly. I have thick hair and didn&#x27;t use the whole set when I curled my hair, which surprised me. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product works well and makes beautiful ringlets; however, it takes hours to do a full head.  Maybe it is me but I watched the videos on youtube, practiced, practiced, practiced, and still could not do it well.  In my opinion the wand needs to be made a little stronger and that would help and the end of the hair curler needs to have some type of bigger opening so you can get the hook out.  I did not try having someone else do it while I just sat there and maybe that would work and then the results would be wonderful.  I brought a product someone recommended to use on your hair to make it pull the curler easier, no go.  Good luck if you buy it.  Make sure you are patient because you do not want to get your hair all tangled up in the wand and curler.  It is a great idea but too frustrating.</li>
            <li> Love these ! I&#x27;m in college and my hair is natural (struggle). I&#x27;ve been watching videos from nap85 and always wanted to use curlformers but I never had the money they are 70 bucks a pop. Peeking around amazon I found these which, look, smell, and act just like curlformers but a cheaper price. Get these NOW</li>
            <li> ok, so I heard and read all good and bad things...bet here is my personal opinion after I used it&lt;br /&gt;the product does what its supposed to, which is curling hair without heat damage. I watched several videos on youtube to learn how-to. Gotta say, I did rip lots of hair before I realized its better to start over. If you do everything right, by the 5th-7th time, youll nail it like a pro. It took a while for hair to dry out, I was little impatient and used hair dryer for less then 5 min at the end to make sure and when I took curlers off, the waves looked beautiful! You can style it as you desire. But for my  hair it didn&#x27;t last till morning, I have very light hair so it didn&#x27;t hold. So as an advise for thin hair, use some gel.&lt;br /&gt;Great length for long hair and  I had few left over</li>
            <li> I like this product. My curls were really nice.... until I went into the heat and humidity and those poor curls did not stand a chance. Also, I slept ( or tried to) with these in overnight..... BAD IDEA!!!! So uncomfortable and annoying. I could not get comfortable, my neck hurt in the morning. Overall, I would use them if I did not have anything to do all day. I wonder if the name brand curlformers are more comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> For a fraction of the cost you can have these instead of the name brand. They work just the same. Some of the other reviews said they had problems with the hook but the one that came in ours works fine. I bought two sets of 40. I am glad I did because I ended up using nearly 50 on my 7 year old&#x27;s head. I&#x27;m sure that means I will need to use more on my own when I try them out on myself. Just make sure the hair is damp and has some kind of hair product like mousse on before putting them on. Then make sure they are totally dry when removing. There are some excellent tutorials online for how to use them.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used them, and through trial and error, have perfected putting them in.  It was about an hour to get them in and figure out how to use them.  I had to watch a couple of you tube videos to figure out some issues.  I ended up pulling some hair through and it tangled, I then pushed the hair back to the top of the curler to untangle.  I attempted to sleep in them (DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT SLEEP IN THESE) and tossed, turned, put a satin bonnet on, and tossed and turned, and finally removed them.  My curls were so bouncy, and pretty that I was taking selfie&#x27;s and finally realized it was 3 a.m!  I have no perm in my hair and was SHOCKED to see how straight my hair was after using these and how well the curl formed.  The only issue I had was the hook that came with it.  Flimsy, feels as if it will break if you attempt to pull to much hair.  Lucky for me, I purchased a curlformer one ahead of time and had it handy, and it worked great.  I would recommend using these over the more expensive brand to anyone.  Had no quality issues with the rollers.  Would give 4 1/2 stars (minus 1 for the flimsy hook).</li>
            <li> These are great and easy to use! Shipping was right on point as quoted in my order (2 Days)! The only difference between these and Curl Formers is the smoothness of the material. I did notice that my hair snagged a couple times on a couple formers, but well worth the HUGH price difference. All in all I would definitely recommend!  However, I would suggest that the makers consider a longer wand and maybe even include an extra wand.</li>
            <li> These do what they are supposed to do. I would recommend, especially for those who are trying to stay away from heat. I have natural, kinky hair and these still do a great job on my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things to warn about. One, the hook broke on me from the first time I tried to assemble. Snapped right in half. The second is that I had to toss a few curlers away due to pulls in the fabric or cracks in the plastic that I feared would damage my hair. However, at the price, I don&#x27;t feel bad at all for having to discard some curlers.</li>
            <li> I ordered my 1st pack and received them in a week and a half from China.  My sister ordered the exact same curlers 2 weeks before me from a different vendor in California, and she still hasn&#x27;t received hers...LOL and we both live in the same city.  I have insisted that she gets her money back from the other vendor and orders from Vakind Tech.&lt;br /&gt; I am about to order my 2nd pack now because I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Curlformers.  I have natural hair and the end results are silky smooth  bouncy curls NO HEAT NEEDED!  My hair looks and feels as though it has been pressed or relaxed.</li>
            <li> Does not keep the curl tight. Not good for ringlets. When pulling out of curler it breaks the curl&#x27;s stiffness.</li>
            <li> These curliformers are a great deal! The price was excellent, and the product was quality. We have used them seeral times now with no issues.</li>
            <li> Package came as described. very vibrant colors. they came packaged in a zip-lock bag with none broken or damaged. delivery was super-fast! thank you</li>
            <li> LOVE! these work just as well as the name brand and are SO much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I have tried curling irons, tried to flat iron curl, brush curlers, bendy curling rods, hot, overnight, perms, you name it, but these are the first product I can do all by myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a bit of a tomboy so when it comes to dressing up for an event I tend to have quite the time trying to get my hair \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; but with these it&#x27;s a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things you need to keep in mind...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Use as many formers as possible! Trying to cram as much hair as possible into a single former will leave you with damaged locks, and no one wants that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Leaving them in overnight seems to work best for soft, natural looking curls. They are hard to sleep in but if you don&#x27;t apply them to tight and figure out where to push them aside it is worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) WATCH A YOU TUBE VIDEO! There are no instructions with the kit so take 30 minutes and watch some videos! The revisited videos (someone&#x27;s second attempt) are very informational and can give you very good hints to make your style more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so thick that I will need to order additional curlers. I knew going in that I usually need more than the average person when it comes to curlers (this is also why I can never heat curl my hair cause it takes WAY to long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality wise they are very nice and well worth what I paid. There were two defects 1) the hook had a scrap of plastic left on it from molding that I cut and filed down, but it&#x27;s perfect now so no biggie! 2) one of my orange curlers has a snag close to the end, so I worry that eventually it might separate but for now it seems fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see even though two pieces were faulty,(OH AND BECAUSE I LOVE THESE THINGS!) I have given this product five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only will I most likely order a few more in this size, but I am very interested in the bigger barrel curls size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you have as much fun with these as I have. Happy curling!urls size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you have as much fun with these as I have. Happy curling!</li>
            <li> Creates great alternative styles for my 4a hair. I get faster and faster at putting the curlformers in.</li>
            <li> I love this product and its way cheaper here than buying it at a beauty store (plus it has more!). It works well on me and I have thick and straight hair. Perfect uniform curls depending on the time set. So far my hook hasn&#x27;t broken yet and I&#x27;ve had it for quite a while already. The curls last me for a day or two. Got mine on scheduled delivery if not a bit earlier. Do recommend~</li>
            <li> Perfect, but very hard. You cannot sleep in these.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Best product ever. The curlers are EXACTLY like curlformers without the price tag. Literally the exact same thing. i have curly hair(spanish) and my hair comes out like if I did little rollos on each curl.. its really cute! It saves time and its a different look if you want your hair curly but not with just gel and hairspray. Comes out looking like if you went to a salon. Thanks seller!!! Recommended++</li>
            <li> I bought these and have tried once, I left them in my hair for several hours to take them out to mostly straight hair. Hoping to give them another shot soon when i have a little time. If my hair turns out well i will update my review at that time.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know how they work because I received two hook ends so I cannot attach them to use! Guess I have to order a new hook just to use the things. So far, not impressed.</li>
            <li> Very hard to work with. Put in as directed and watched tons of videos, but leaves weird bumps at the top of my head where the end of the curler stops.</li>
            <li> Love these! Very easy to use and curls up nice.</li>
            <li> These rollers are amazing. I&#x27;m African American with very coarse hair and they make my hair nice and curly. I would recommend purchasing two packs of rollers to ensure you have enough. The sticks are cheap, so be very gentle on putting them together. If it doesn&#x27;t fit don&#x27;t force it. It works just fine without the sticks being perfectly clamped together. The rollers are uncomfortable to sleep in. So I would suggest sitting under a dryer. The rollers also didn&#x27;t come in a bag to store them in so you will need to find something to put them in. Lastly my rollers arrived in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I loved it, much easier to sleep in than the benders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have bought the short style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend.</li>
            <li> These curlers are easy to use and work great. They arrived quickly and everything about the experience of the purchase has been great. However, they arrived just the wand and curlers rolling around in a box with packaging materials. There were no instructions or container included. I understand a container not being included had they been in some sort of temporary bag, but no instructions was odd. I had to ask the mom that suggested them to me how to use them. My overall experience was very positive and I&#x27;m happy we got these curlers.</li>
            <li> Never buy any product via tribalsensation . I have made a payment of Rs,1078 for the product Vakind Hair Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets Former&lt;br /&gt;Leverage Stretched Length 50CM Circle Roller Pack of 40) . But Instead I got some cheap product (with shorter length and only 18 curlformer) worth around Rs 400.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me that they dont understand BUSINESS ETHICS ,and solely interested in making money , even if this accounts to FRAUD.&lt;br /&gt;. My experience have been pathetic with tribalsensation and would not advise anyone to fall in this loop .All I can say is PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE .</li>
            <li> I read quite a few reviews prior to purchasing this product. The original Curlformers were supposed to be so much better than the knockoffs. However, the quality of Vakind&#x27;s curlers is very similar to Curlformers. Its not cheap plastic. The mesh feels good and soft - its not plush like Curlformers but I like it better. The only qualm I have is with the wand that comes with Vakind&#x27;s curlers. Now it is cheap and hard to put together. I had three different people try to get it together and no one could. The plug-in bottom and top of the wand do not fit together in a flush manner but it will hold up and do the job. I wish I would have bought the Curlformers wand separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the service and speed with which I received my product is exceptional. It renewed my faith in Amazon&#x27;s service. I didn&#x27;t even pay for expedited shipping and I got my rollers in two days!!!! And no, I don&#x27;t have Amazon prime. I had paid for expedited shipping before for products and not gotten them in seven business days before. So thank you to the seller! I appreciate your service and will be ordering again. And referring you.</li>
            <li> i first saw these at Sally&#x27;s but thought they were way too expensive (it was the brand-name Curlformers).&lt;br /&gt;When i saw these Vakind on Amazon so cheap i just had to try them! I have not been disappointed, these work just fine!&lt;br /&gt;i bought them for my two daughters, who are 5 and 4.&lt;br /&gt;their air is about shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;These are pretty long, much longer than their hair. My oldest daughter&#x27;s hair is about 14 inches long, these curlers are more like 30 inches.&lt;br /&gt;it took me about 30 minutes to do each of their hairs, i used hair mousse before putting the curlers, to help the curls last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend watching some tutorials on youtube to learn how to use these, it&#x27;s not as difficult, but there are some useful tips online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used the actual &amp;#34;Curlformers&amp;#34; but I have a girlfriend who has them and she said mine are just as good as hers. I can set my hair and it will last for an entire week.  The curls are bouncy and have a great shape to them.  It takes a little getting used to putting the rollers in, but once you get the hang of them they work great.  I&#x27;m going to buy more!</li>
            <li> They make my hair shiny and bouncy! And my hair looks great even after i comb the curls out. Its exactly what i needed, but they are hard to sleep on.</li>
            <li> These got here later than promised and it caused a major issue. Quality-wise, the hook is really flimsy and I expect I&#x27;ll need to replace it soon. Some of the molded curler ends are stuck together and have to be pried apart. It&#x27;s not a huge deal but still an inconvenience. I read all the reviews and watched all the videos for women with reasonably thick hair. My daughter&#x27;s hair is inhumanly thick and very long. It took 37 curlers to wrap just her ponytail. You have to take extremely tiny sections and I had to put a second curler after the first for the longer sections. If you have long, thick, hair - you will probably need two sets to do a full head. It pulls a LOT. If you or your child has a sensitive scalp or issues with their hair being pulled, this is probably not the right product for you. Once you get the section size figured out and the curler ends pried open the technique is pretty simple to master and goes fairly quickly. I dampen each section with a spray bottle containing a mixture of diluted mousse. When finished wrapping I have a soft dryer bonnet that I put over the ponytail for fifteen minutes and then let cool. I was reasonably satisfied with our first run-through but will continue to practice and experiment before they&#x27;re needed for a cheer tournament.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like rods because they pulled my hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use them yet but they seen pretty durable. The wand was a little bit if a challenge for me to disconnect once I put it together but it wasn&#x27;t an issue. Seems like a sound purchase.</li>
            <li> The order came a whole day ahead of time! I&#x27;m excited to use them! Once I do I will update this review! I was skeptical to order but thanks to other reviews I saved money buying the \\&quot;dupes\\&quot; I&#x27;m pretty confident the results will be great :) just order them too :)</li>
            <li> Got this Hair Curler Spiral Ringlets a few months ago and i LOVE them. They work really great, curls last long, and they are very defined. The quality is great!</li>
            <li> Never tried the authentic Curlformers so I can&#x27;t compare but these are EXCELLENT! I watched 5,000 videos on YouTube just to get it right and I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> I ordered these to see if they would function and curl my hair anything like the real curlformers.  All I got was was hours of frustration just trying to get these to stay in my hair.  When I finally got them all to stay and went to sleep in them I was exhausted. By the next day I was more frustrated because the results were no where near curled. I missed the deadline to return them but I will not be ordering them again.  I will be ordering the real thing from now on, it&#x27;s worth my spending the money to get the results I want.  First product I&#x27;ve ordered on Amazon that I wasn&#x27;t happy with.  Good thing it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I definitely used it wrong the first time because my hair came out in my natural texture but stretched. So I will be trying again because I know they have great potential.</li>
            <li> Loveeee these but beware.I ordered two sets and didnt notice they were from two different venders. Pacific express&#x27;s was perfect and high quality while the  other was bad quality and smelled. I have to return them to be refunded and reordered from pacific express again. I recently began being natural and have 2-3 inches of relaxed hair left. Rolling hair on rollers didnt give me a shiny frizz free look. I tried these on towel dried hair with cantu leave in conditioner. The result is shiny bouncy curls! Very easy to put on and take off. Def can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I was really quite impressed with these. The curlers feel sturdy, and the hook is better than expected from the reviews I&#x27;ve read. Sure, it&#x27;s cheap, but I&#x27;m inclined to believe that any broken hooks were user error. It did come apart a couple of times, but it&#x27;s not at all a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about 30min to get them into my waist length hair, and aside from trying too-big sections and having to start over it was easy. I&#x27;ve never been able to effectively use wet set rollers, but these are darn near idiot proof. As long as the sections aren&#x27;t too big, you get all of the section into the hook, and you run a comb through each section immediately before hooking it it&#x27;s a cake walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO watch instructional videos. I watched quite a few while waiting for my curlers and I had no problems on my first try, and have them back in my hair right now for a second go.</li>
            <li> The curlers work very nicely and may be hard to use at first,  but I love them.  Im giving 4 out of 5 because the rod is hard to put together and mine snapped in half</li>
            <li> Your hair needs to be wet and you need to grab small portions of hair (or else, you&#x27;re hair will get stuck, trust me.) and everything will be smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> easy after the first time,no instructions included,so you have to figure out to put the stick through the curler,but after I got it it was easy!beats other spiral systems.about half hour setting,another half drying,perfect!and hair should be almost dry before you roll,see youtube!</li>
            <li> Great product. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The hair is at a mess after treatment by using this tool. They are the same length, which do not work well for different curls I would like</li>
            <li> So Cool i had to ge the Small Curlers ! i have not used those yet. But this is easy and fun for a fancy and fun look!</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Works well.</li>
            <li> VERY FRUSTRATING TO USE AND MY STICK BROKE FIRST ATTEMPT.</li>
            <li> Just has good as the original curlformers</li>
            <li> So, I tried them for the first time last night and was disappointed that the plastic tool does not work.  It is not manufactured well and, therefore, does not snap into place.  Although you can connect the two ends, they do not stay in place and it comes apart when you try to pull your hair through the curl former.  I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars, because I think the curl formers themselves are probably fine, especially for the price, but now I have to order a new plastic tool from another company.  I&#x27;ll follow up with an updated review when I receive my new tool.</li>
            <li> I really like these as they provide a great quality curl without heat! Works great on those with natural hair. My hair is very very kinky/curly and it worked great. Would give 5 stars, but these things are truly torturous to sleep in (AKA the first time I tried them, I woke up in the middle of the night and pulled them all out of my head so I could get some zZZzzzs.... but I still had great curls for the next day!!) Also, I bought these in February 2014, so I don&#x27;t know if the packaging has changed, but I was a bit disappointed the packaging was just all the curlers stuffed into a large sandwich bag, but... hey... whatever works!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and works wonderfully on my hair. As soon as it arrived I took out a couple of the curlformers to try them out first (was kind of worried jajajjaha) but I loooooveeed the end result. So the next day did all my hair. Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> i have used this product now for about 5 weeks.  I love the curls and how they fall, perfect every time.  I took me at least 2 tries to learn how to put them in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a woman has ever tried rolling her hair with flexirods and then trying to sleep in them, it is nearly impossible.  With these you can do just that, sleep in them (a little uncomfortable) and have a spiral set that is pretty.</li>
            <li> I was so glad when I saw a company that mad a cheaper version of the Curlformers.  These work beautifully.  They were better that I expected.  I&#x27;ll definitely recommend these to others.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.  They&#x27;re even better than the flexi-rods.  I&#x27;ve grown out my relaxer, so it&#x27;s been hard to stay away from the flat iron to keep my curls, but these do a wonderful job and I don&#x27;t have to use any heat on my hair.  I just use a little bit of Nairobi setting foam or the fluffy shea butter that Naptural85 shows you how to make on Youtube.  Absolutely beautiful, bouncy curls.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on buying the &amp;#34;Curlformers&amp;#34;.  Too much money for the same product, just without the name.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price! I have seen these rollers in the stores n refused to pay the price but to be able to try them for the price I paid was awesome!  When used correctly they produce beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to put in the first five curlers, but I learned how to do it after a while. The trick is not to put too big of a chunk of hair in the curlformer and to make sure the hair doesn&#x27;t escape the rod as you pull it through the curlformer. If it escapes the hair will get stuck and you will pull your hair hard.</li>
            <li> Since I am just trying these out, I wasnt going to spend a lot of money on them.&lt;br /&gt;These look exactly like the original ones and hey, they are working for me.&lt;br /&gt;Should have gotten two bags!</li>
            <li> They do what they say they&#x27;re just kind of painful to sleep in</li>
            <li> Very good product that gave excellent results for a fraction of the price. I would highly recommend purchasing the actual curlformer hook for about $4 though. The one that comes with this set is kind of weak for kinky textured hair.</li>
            <li> the curlformers came just like in package.the shipping was neat and the package came really fast. Great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;only thing I would consider if you are interested in purchasing is buying a stronger hook from the real curlformers company. these one&#x27;s are really week. Also, take care when using these curlformers, they rip easily. I didn&#x27;t mind If one or two of them ripped because I got them for a bargain.</li>
            <li> I have curlformers and thought they were the best thing since sliced bread. The only disadvantages about the curlformers were price and the end result on natural hair (as compared to the vakind curlers now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to the Vakind curlers the price is right!!! I like the hook a little more because my hair is held in place while inserting curlers. The plastic is a little firmer than curlformers so my curls are a little straighter on my naturally curly/kinky hair texture 4a/4b. I love these curlers wish I got these before dishing out the price tag for the curlformers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love these curlers cause I hate the process of trying to wrap my hair the right way around regular rollers like perm rods and flexi rods and the take downs. The Vakind curlers stay in place and easy to take down. The only disadvantage is if you choose to sleep on the curlers they are uncomfortable. You can air dry during the day if you have time and depending on hair texture.</li>
            <li> Great product and more for my money. I enjoyed using the curl formers. I have recommend the product to friends.</li>
            <li> I used these on my daughter&#x27;s hair, she is 8 and has very thick hair to her waist. It took all 40 curlers, probably could have used more but we managed with 40. It did take about 45 minutes to put them...she slept on them and said it was a little uncomfortable. The curls however were absolutely beautiful! We used curl cr&amp;egrave;me and they held all day at school--a first for her! If you are considering CurlFormers, these are a great alternative at a much better price.</li>
            <li> These are great!  Get ready for alot of curl!</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t to bad to handle, but its tiring. Also it was too long, I should have gotten shorter ones.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t used this set yet, I noticed that there are several lengths and I really didn&#x27;t like that they were rolled together in bunches of 5. It stretched many and they appear useless. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> The curl formers are not bad at all and was as expected.  The only issue I had was with the hook itself, they are not as strong as I would have expected therefore it would be my recommendation to purchase the original curlformers hook to use with these.  Overall the product is good and works well.  There is no need to purchase the original curl formers but however, you would need to buy the original curlformers hooks as a backup.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packs. works just like the expensive versions. I have long natural 4a/b  hair and it works perfect in my hair. Please make longer versions!!!</li>
            <li> These curlers are AMAZING!! My girls do Irish dance and need curls when they compete. I was not looking forward to using curlers because it&#x27;s usually time consuming, uncomfortable and the curls don&#x27;t hold. The curlers are very quick &amp; easy to put in and take out. They are comfortable enough for them to sleep in. There is no heat applied so there is no damage to the hair. And the curls last all day, even after a full day of competing. They are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The curlers are fine but the wand they came with was cheap and didn&#x27;t attach to each other properly therefore cannot us them until I&#x27;m send a new wand.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and I wanted to achieve curls without heat. I&#x27;ve used this only a handful of times and the curls do come out beautiful and nearly perfect each time but application can be a pain. My hair gets tangled very often when trying to pull through with the hook and the only way to prevent that is to take very very small sections. They&#x27;re not very comfortable to sleep in. It can feel a little heavy when you have so many curlers on your head. I don&#x27;t think this product is something I would use on a regular basis because application can be long and annoying.</li>
            <li> This is so like it has been advertised my hairdresser wants 2</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have curlformers but I imagine that these are just as good.</li>
            <li> These no doubt are a good product and a GREAT value.......&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 sets, one for me and one for my 3 year old daughter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here were my complaints :(&lt;br /&gt;-My hair gets tangled when pulling it though as does my daughters&lt;br /&gt;-I try to put more hair in the curler to get less curly sue curls and it won&#x27;t allow it (I read reviews that the &amp;#34;bigger&amp;#34; curlers are not actually bigger so I just bought extra of these)&lt;br /&gt;-I do notice a slight crease from where the end sits at the scalp - this doesn&#x27;t affect my styles too much but it does affect my daughter&#x27;s styles.&lt;br /&gt;-They are VERY uncomfortable to sleep in. I feel like they are pulling strands of hair out of my head. My daughter does not complain.&lt;br /&gt;-the wand sometimes comes apart when I am pulling the hair through.....kind of frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus:&lt;br /&gt;-Once the curls set, they are not going anywhere. I can NEVER get my hair to keep curls over a few hours. I half way dried my hair the other night, put in the curlers, let them sit for 3 hours, took them out, went to bed and the curlers stayed all day long! They did calm down over night, but that is what I wanted them to do...they were very tight curls.&lt;br /&gt;-my daughter &amp;#34;loads&amp;#34; the curlers, so it&#x27;s super easy! Because I have 2 sets, while I am pulling her hair though one curler she is loading another curler on the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My MAIN complaint is that I want bigger curls, but that is not a quality issue.</li>
            <li> Can be tricky to use at first. But once I got it down my hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li> They work.  I have a natural Afro and guess what ... My hair came out looking like i had a professional rollers et under a dryer. I was floored.  So if you want to take a no heat challenge...these rollers will work.  And yes they are easy to use.  Just watch a tutorial first if you arent sure about how to. Like magic.  Get two packs if your hair is curly/kinky/ coily so you can use little sections.  You cannot use big chunks of hair and expect smoothness.</li>
            <li> The quality of the curlers is very good. I have long, thick hair and the curls last me all day. Also I did not have a problem with the hook breaking apart. Maybe they improved it after all the complaints.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, nice . It creates very nice curlers. Better than all the rollers i had before. Go for it.</li>
            <li> These things give my 4c natural back length hair amazing curls!! It looks like I have had a relaxer! Also they are super easy to use! I can do my entire head in no time!</li>
            <li> Nothing negative regarding the product, they work very well, I just ordered the wrong size...  I used them on my grand daughter&#x27;s hair, she loved it, and the style lasted a week... She has may be a 3a in curly type (fine, but curly)...</li>
            <li> I used these for my first time setting my natural hair. I used setting lotion on damp hair and sat under the dryer for about an hour, then slept on them (which took some getting used to but wasn&#x27;t terribly uncomfortable).  The curls were well defined and neat.  After removing I used my fingers to separate each curl to add volume.  It took me awhile to get them all in, but once I can figure out how to keep the style longer than a day, it will be worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I love these sooo much!  I have 1.5 year old dreadlocks and these work!  The first day at work after using these, some of my coworkers thought I had gotten rid of my dreadies.  My hair was shiny, in awesome curls, and incredibly bouncy.  When I want my curls to last for a few days, I use knotty boy aloe vera lock tightening gel.  If I just need curls for a night, I just put them in without treating my hair with anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first ordered these, I was frustrated.  They hurt to put in and took forever.  Then, I realized that by putting the hook just on the last 3 inches of my dreads and pulling the tube up to the root (or however far up I want), pulling the dread through last, it was quick and painless.  We are having a fundraiser at work tomorrow and it only took 15 minutes to put these in (I don&#x27;t have to section my hair :b)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t pay the outrageous price for the real deal.  Get these and get real results!  They are truly amazing</li>
            <li> These are nice quality they are made of a sturdy plastic like material  and seem to look like they hold a really good curl I am going to try them tonight before I go to bed to see how they do on my braids I trust though that it is a great product!</li>
            <li> I bought my first set of generic curlformers in May. It did take me two tries before I completely got the hang of doing it properly. Two of the curlers were unusable, but the rest were in good condition. I ordered a second set a month later and they are nothing like the first set. They arrived rolled on top of each other and had to be separated. Once I did separate them it was pretty obvious that the second set was of a much lesser quality than the first. The plastic is thinner and the ends are made with cheap, flimsy, rubber instead of the more firm rubber the first set had. The first set had &amp;#34;JXL&amp;#34; imprinted on the ends and the second set didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;d give four stars to the first and two to the second, simply because I know about the difference. Still, I was able to use both sets and get good results. I doubt the second set will last very long and I&#x27;ve had to throw out several already. But, the price is so cheap that I&#x27;m not complaining too much. I did throw out both of the wands that came with the sets and bought two name brand wands. Don&#x27;t even bother using the cheap wands. They&#x27;ll break or you&#x27;ll get your hair tangled in them. The real wands are about $3.50 at Sally&#x27;s. I like these curlformers, and would like them even more if the quality were consistent.</li>
            <li> Great no damage curlers.  Recommend using on wet hair for best results. Great price.</li>
            <li> I have thick coily hair, and these really smooth everything out for soft, bouncy curls. The only thing I would say is invest in the curl former hook, because the one in the package was a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> The wand is ever so slightly shorter than the real curl formers but hey for this price you can&#x27;t beat it. I did purchase the real ones from Sally&#x27;s and from amazon and compared and you can barely tell the difference.  The pink and orange are slightly shorter than the original but I&#x27;ll take it. This is a great way to curl your hair. I watched a bunch of tutorials on YouTube before I took the chance on these. I&#x27;ve only used them twice since I got them because my hair is so long and its work for me to do alone, my hair texture does not lend itself to stay curly for a good while.</li>
            <li> I have arm pit length hair that is a mixture of natural (4A/B) from the roots to several inches down, and the rest down to the tips is straight from old relaxers. These curlformers get all of my hair uniformly smooth, shiny and bouncy. You couldn&#x27;t tell that I have two different hair textures. The waves this product creates last for days. I love it because I no longer have to worry about the tangles I was getting in the natural-textured part of my hair after washing, can always get my hair styled and ready to go within 5 minutes in the mornings, and will never again have to wonder whether I&#x27;m going to have a bad hair day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took multiple tries to put in each of the first 4 curlers, but I quickly got the hang of it. By my third curlformer set (which is in my hair right now!), I am sliding these curlers on like a pro. I just wash my hair, spritz a small strand, twist the strand at the root, and the hook slides right over the hair strand and the hair glides down into the curlformer. Generally, I use 38 of the 40 curlformers that come in the package, but I&#x27;m thinking of ordering about 8 more because I want to make the sections even smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I put Krazy Glue all over the hook part as soon as I opened the package, because I&#x27;d heard horror stories from others about hooks breaking on first use. The Krazy Glue should help prevent breakage. This product does NOT come with instructions, so you should search YouTube for \\&quot;curlformers\\&quot; to see how other women are putting theirs in. If you need your curlformers in a hurry, keep in mind that this product will take several weeks to arrive, as it ships from China.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely hard to curl and tougher to keep a curl.  These worked and the curl lasted most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep in them.  I need some more practice, but look forward to using them often.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I use these. Works perfect for my natural 3c/4a hair. Still playing with the best products to use with it but none of the products have made it hard to take these off once the set is done. Don&#x27;t use big sections of hir with these!</li>
            <li> I love them. They are very easy to use. I only had one user error in that I broke my hook but a piece of tape and it was good to go. I plan to purchase some of the smaller sizes as well. I am recommending this to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> They are to hard to sleep in. Gave me a headache. I am sorry but other than that the curls came out fine.</li>
            <li> Really Love this product. It was what I expected and came earlier than I expected. I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading about Curlformers for some time now but refused to pay the high price for them.  I came across these and most of the reviews were favorable and the price was worth the risk.  I got 2 bags and I&#x27;m glad I did because I needed 1.5 to do my whole head.  I have to say the result was great.  I have unprocessed, thick and fine coiled hair.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is 4b or 4a, but it shrinks and fuzzes up terribly.  I used Infusium leave in conditioner and lotta body with a little jojoba oil and curled while wet (not dripping).  I let it air dry and my curls came out soft and perfect spirals.  People thought I had permed my hair.  The only cons, and it&#x27;s not the fault of the curlers, is that the style doesn&#x27;t last long and I did have trouble with my ends getting fuzzy, but that may be technique.  Lastly, I did rip the rubber off the end of a couple of the curlers the second time I used them.  Not sure if I can fault the quality or not.  I simply turned it upside down and slid my hair through the other end.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use unless someone else is doing it for you.  Even then it&#x27;s cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Saw the product on YouTube and decided to give it a try.  It came quickly in basically a piece of plastic, but it looked like everything was inside so I wasn&#x27;t too bothered.&lt;br /&gt; I used the tools on freshly washed hair and I don&#x27;t know whether my hair was too thick or I used too much hair product, but my hair would not go through the tube if my life depended on it.&lt;br /&gt; It took around 30 minutes to get one rod latched on, but by then my hands were killing me from holding my hair taunt.&lt;br /&gt;When I was half way through my hair, the wand snapped.... and so did my patience.&lt;br /&gt; I sent it back ASAP.This product is not worth the time effort and money. If you want curls, just go buy some hair rollers.</li>
            <li> They work excellent I love them they are fast and easy they didn&#x27;t get 5 stars because a few maybe two of them were broken!</li>
            <li> Great results!  curls lasted for 1 week. Very easy to use &amp; remove. Not so easy to sleep in. ;)</li>
            <li> This came fast! They work great and we love the curls they make!</li>
            <li> Great product! Excellent, and fast shipping! Fair pricing! Would recommend to a friend anyday! Compared to the original curlformers this is a very good dupe!</li>
            <li> These were really hard to put in my curly hair. Although it did leave a fabulous curl, I might just stick to rollers.</li>
            <li> It works great! Loved the results! The curls were smooth, shiny, and beautiful. So glad I purchased this product instead of paying so much more for Curlformers.</li>
            <li> These were delivered to me yesterday.  Unfortunately it came with only one half of the hook that is used to pull the hair through.  I wanted to try these out before attending a wedding, but this will not happen because the event is in just a few days.  My advice is to definitely order these with sufficient time in mind and check the package right away to make sure everything is included.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Works as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li> After watching loads of tutorials about curlformers I just had to try them, but affordably, and these did the trick. Yes, a little painful to sleep on, but I was able to sleep soundly. The results were as expected.</li>
            <li> The product arrived ahead of schedule which was great because we were excited to try.  The product does not come with instructions but after watching a YouTube video on how to use, it was really quite simple. Glad I didn&#x27;t have to spend money on the expensive alternative.</li>
            <li> These did a good job making pretty spiral curls in my natural 4a hair. My hair is very tightly coiled but these made my hair very smooth and elongated. They were a little hard to work with though and my hair frequently got tangled in the hook.  I think with practice my technique will get better. I slept in these overnight and if was very uncomfortable....won&#x27;t be trying that again.</li>
            <li> These are the easiest hair curlers I&#x27;ve ever used. One issue I had however is that sometimes the hook snags on my hair as I&#x27;m feeding it through the curler so I have to re comb and restart that strand.</li>
            <li> The learning curve on these is really easy - i felt competent at it after just a couple minutes and did my whole head. The curls it produced were gorgeous and lasted for days - all with no heat! I just spritzed my dry hair with a leave in conditioner before pulling it through the curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip: if you have trouble pulling your hair through, you may have too much hair or your hair isn&#x27;t combed out well enough, or your hair might need to be wetter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i look like a total fewl with these in, but i don&#x27;t even care because they make my hair look so good later!</li>
            <li> My seller was JLTech1, and I&#x27;m honestly so pleased with my order. It came WAY before the expected arrival date, taking only 10 days to ship from China to California! :) The hook is obviously a cheaper quality than the real one and one of my curlers had a snag in it, but everything still works great! Don&#x27;t waste $70+ buying the brand name when these work excellently! :)</li>
            <li> This product received one star because it arrived ahead of its scheduled delivery date. The cons: the rod is cheap and it took me forever to somewhat attach the pieces. I gave up, so it&#x27;s not attached all the way. The spirals are cheap quality as well and thank goodness I did not have to pay more money for this product.  I HATE IT. I will rather go to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply store. I DO NOT recommend anyone to buy this product. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I just got my Curler Magic curlers yesterday - 10 days earlier than expected.  They look just like the picture.  I read reviews about this and other products like it and lots of people said they had broken the wand easily.  I guess they were maybe a bit rough on them.  I can see how you could break it with little care but I found mine to be stronger than I expected.  Also, the many people who complained about them being difficult to use must be doing it wrong.  I watched several YouTube videos about how to put them in and I didn&#x27;t have an issue.  It does take a bit of time but it is much fast and more effective than using a curling iron!  I don&#x27;t think I could sleep in them as the ends are a flexible rubber which sort of pinches on your hair to hold them in.  I felt like it pulled my hair a bit and I am sure that would be worse if I were trying to sleep in them.  All in all I am super happy with my purchase and am very happy about the price I paid.  Now to get some different sizes!</li>
            <li> I found these extremely difficult to use, despite watching several YouTube tutorials. Really yanked my hair and didn&#x27;t pull through smoothly. I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> It really work, is really easy to use and it make really perfect curls i love it i used allways</li>
            <li> I love this product! Only down side is how long i waited to receive it. Took an entire month +..othet than thay no issues. Thanks!</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve. But once you get the hang of these you will love them! We do!</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> so easy to use and really do make Shirley Temple like curls.  So inexpensive for the quantity you get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basing this on having used authentic curlformers and having 4C curly hair. As far as the quality the curlers go, they are fine. The hook though, is pretty terrible. I had two and snapped one putting it together. The second kept separating while I was doing my hair. I recommend just buying the Curformers one for under $5. Additionally, the one that come with it is just not long enough. The &#x27;extra long&#x27; from Curlformers will be much easier to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how it is with 4c hair. Meh. I have very curly but fine hair. This gave fat limp curls. The Curlformers long and narrow worked much much better for me. My hair looked very smooth with those just using water, coconut oil and aloe vera gel. The same combo with these larger ones was a little frizzy, didn&#x27;t hold and kind of limp. That&#x27;s more about my hair than the product.  I did use these on a 4a/4b friend which MUCH thicker hair and the orange and pink ones were great.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and I cannot curl my hair using curling irons, this was the product for me. I like them.</li>
            <li> This product does not work well for those with unpermed thick nappy hair. The hair must be very slick and well for application or the hook will hitch and not pull your hair through the tube. Ouch! Also, they are extremely heavy once you are done. It&#x27;s worse if you have a big head. It takes forever to dry and finding a hooded dryer to fit your head once done is next to impossible. You must only do this if you have all day to let your hair dry. Without a perm, the curls are not that great and tend to be frizzy.</li>
            <li> too large for short hair lengths. Will have to wait for a grow out to utilize</li>
            <li> Works like the original without the experience price. Works best with 60-70 % dry hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!!! So glad I found these for a fraction of the cost of traditional curlformers! They work great!</li>
            <li> These are too hard for one person to use on their own hair. I gave them to a friend of mine who has a teenage daughter and they can help each other. I watched TONS of videos and tried them but I was never able to get one in my hair.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best curlers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;They are quick and easy to get into my hair. It takes a little practice but with in one use I was a pro. I did watch a youtube video for pointers and to make sure I was doing it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i saw that my product was being shipped from China I was a little bummed that they would take over a month to get here. But I figured I would be patient and they would arrive when they arrived. Would you believe it? They arrived in about 10 days. I was thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the easiest, fastest way to use these curlers is to do a ponytail. And then separate the strands of hair and pull my hair through. I then blow dry my hair to set the curls with the curlers in.  These work so well, and my hair has the most beautiful curls. NO frizzy ends either. I highly recommend these to anyone looking to get beautiful curls with little fuss. The downside is that you can&#x27;t  sleep in them very well. It is not comfortable at all. However not many curlers out  there that you can comfortably sleep in.  My 12 year old daughter has mastered these and can pull them through my hair in less than ten minutes. And she can pull them through her own hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these now!  You wont regret it!</li>
            <li> I love these Curler forms, so easy to use and worth buying. They are way cheaper than the ones sold in store and I get the same results. My hair looks really good after I put these in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would of put 5 stars but I got 2 curlers that were torn and I had to throw them away. Either then that they are perfect. The material is a lot rougher than I thought but it does the work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going through the whole hair transition from relaxed to natural and I really wanted curls throughout my hair without using the curling iron. I refuse to put heat in my hair due to breakage. So I heard about Curlformers through YouTube and thought, hey, that looks like something to try. Well the problem is, is that I didn&#x27;t know what length to buy at first so I went to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and bought them. Okay for a pack of the Extra Long and Wide, your looking at $15 a pack if your not a member, wth? But I bought them anyway cause I wanted to see if they worked. I ended buying 4 packs which came up to almost $60 and I had only 20 curl formers all together. Needless to say, it got the job done but I wanted my hair to be full of curls. So I found these on Amazon for less then half the price that I paid! They are equal to the Extra Long and Wide name brand Curlformers just a tad shorter but no big deal. I&#x27;m glad these came in a pack of 40 so I just added them to the 20 that I already had. I am so happy and pleased with them! My hair takes almost 50 of them at shoulder length hair. They feel and look just like the name brand ones so don&#x27;t waste your money on them. Just buy these! Now for the wand, buy the actual Curlformer wand cause it&#x27;s sturdy then the one they send. It&#x27;s only less then $5.</li>
            <li> There is no way I&#x27;d pay full price for some Curlformers when these do a great job at stretching my natural 4a hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and brought these after seeing them used in some Youtube videos. For some reason I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of Flexi rods but these were much easier. However don&#x27;t try sleeping in them, lol.... complete torture. Otherwise they work wonders.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect dupe for the original curlformers. My daughter has tbuch 4b hair and these curled her hair with a added smoothness. However, this wasn&#x27;t enough for her entire head about 15 more would have done the job. I love them and will be buying more!!!</li>
            <li> It was okay for me. I should have gotten the short narrow ones instead.</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy if you have long hair (waist length/ hip length) I couldn&#x27;t even use these curlers for my hair; my hair was way tooo long for these. My hair is around 20 in long (some parts are 22 inches long), so I knew that I would have to put the curlers lower on some parts (and it wouldn&#x27;t be as tight on the roots). However, I tested these curlers on my bangs (which I purposefully cut short and is about 16 inches long) and I STILL had hair hanging out the bottom. On the parts of my hair that are around 19 inches, I had about 4-5 inches hanging out the bottom! These curlers are supposed to be 20 inches but I think they&#x27;re much shorter. Ahhh... I guess I&#x27;ll have to give them to one of my friends :( (BTW: I am a natural with tightly curly hair!)</li>
            <li> The hook comes apart easily, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.  However, these curl formers are fabulous, and are an easy way to get cascades of beautiful ringlets - even for hard to curl hair, like mine.</li>
            <li> Works great and they don&#x27;t fall out!</li>
            <li> I really love these.  They are so great for the price instead of shelling out a lot of cash.  I purchased two sets of these.  I am not disappointed with them at all.</li>
            <li> This is slightly bigger than real curl formers, the real pink and orange ones are smaller. This is comparable to the real magenta and yellow curlformers.</li>
            <li> First, the shipping was so fast! I ordered on Saturday and received it on Monday. I just tried them and wow! I can&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t need any heat for this style. Take your time to get the hang of using the hook. Awesome results. I was looking for a heat free styling option for the holidays. This will definitely be a keeper in my natural hair regimen.</li>
            <li> These curlformers were the best find I have ever gotten on this site. There is no difference between these and the copyrighted official Curl Formers. They make perfect curls when used correctly, and are strong and durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these over the name brand curlers any day, and have in fact. Perfect find, perfect buy, and am currently looking to buy more.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I really wanted to try the CurlFormers on my natural hair but did not want to pay $70 for them. I found them on Amazon and OMG my spirals came out beautiful on my natural hair! I plan on buying more to share as gifts!</li>
            <li> We would have given these a 5 star, but the color combination and the length we received was not what we ordered (if you want to color coordinate your hair supplies, don&#x27;t rely on this seller to send you the colors in the photo).  The curlers we received were shorter and the colors we received were blue, green, pink, and yellow.  The curlers themselves are soft and not too bad to sleep in.  The curls you get are pretty nice, but you can&#x27;t put too much hair in the curlers.</li>
            <li> I only received 24 of the 40 curlers (and I ordered 2 packs: 24 in each) and this was after having to wait the weeks for it to ship from China. Luckily the seller reimbursed me for the missing curlers but this was a major inconvenience for me since I still had to go back and purchase another pack and so ended up paying more in the long run. At least if I had purchased from an Amazon fulfilled store I would have gotten it sooner and with a lesser chance of error on the part of the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the curlers do as they should. Given that these are the generic brand, I took it upon myself to order an extra curlformer hook (directly from their website as it&#x27;s cheaper than getting it from amazon). And looked to youtube for instructions. I also made sure to wash these twice before using (since HELLO cheap mass-produced Chinese brand here). All in all a good investment.</li>
            <li> You get better results if you use gel in your hair when using it. It&#x27;s amazing! Would recommend it to friends and family</li>
            <li> love it, it works fine just like i wanted to.. it takes time to put them on and take off but i love it.</li>
            <li> If you have tried or heard of Curlformers and wanted a cheap alternative then this is definitely the product for you! Just tried it for the first time and I was very satisfied with the results! I got very nice defined curls and I have 4b/4c natural hair that is very thick and kinky and these really gave my hair nice fluffy curls. Never have I got these results from any other curlers. I can&#x27;t compare to Curlformers because I never tried them but so far I don&#x27;t plan on buying them due to the high price. I seen some bad reviews about these breaking or bad quality material not at all for me! They are very durable, I got everything the description provided and I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So easy! We&#x27;re delivered on a Sunday because I have Prime.  Worked exactly like i expected. Hard to sleep in, but my curls came out FAB!</li>
            <li> Nice ..Easy and realy work</li>
            <li> i need to figure out if these work or not.  they take awhile to put in, but once you figure out which way to put the rod over the hook you fly through it.</li>
            <li> very hard to use. do not get this product. would have returned it, if it weren&#x27;t to China.</li>
            <li> I loved this item! My curls were beautiful and looked as if someone curled my hair with a curling iron or a wond curler. I&#x27;m african american and have thick coarse hair but when I put these in my hair, my curls were beautiful, soft, flexible, and full of shine! I recommend this product to all viewers. I wouldn&#x27;t worry about sleep because I sleep like a baby with them. All I did was add a little oils to my hair and put the curl formers in. I usually do mines when my hair is very wet. It&#x27;s a perfect way to get the curls you want.</li>
            <li> My initial purchase of this item was a gift for my daughter, she loved the produce so much.  She said MommieMe, you have got to get yourself a set and so i did. She was so right they are great.  Thanks Vakind and Amazon was an awesome product, Sdesta</li>
            <li> I just received these today &amp; wow!!! Now I have about mid back length hair which is very fine and very hard to curl and keep a curl. I put a few in just to try them out and the results were incredible. I lightly sprayed my hair with water and put a few curlers in. I left them in for only about 10-15 minutes and I got perfect romantic loose curls. I was not expecting it to work in that time frame. I&#x27;m curious to see how nice they will be after a few hours in!! . The curls are perfect every time. No more awkward crimped or straight ends. I can tell these are better then hot curlers, regular rollers, flex rods, and even my clipless curling iron. The only downside is that I know I would not be able to sleep in them, but that is me, it may be different for someone else. Over all, especially for the price, you cannot go wrong, especially being heatless&gt;&gt; no damage!!</li>
            <li> Does the job. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I ordered these because they are so much cheaper than the brands out there and I really like them. The curlers are very long, longer than my hair (hair is mid back length), which is great because I won&#x27;t have to replace as my hair grows. Only suggestion I would make is to make the hook a bit longer, because the curler is so long it was a bit difficult to use, but doable. I would definitely recommend this over the brand, you get more for your money here and results are the same ( I have used the brand curlformers in the past). Will be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li> They work great for my daughter hair.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. They arrived very quickly. They exceeded my expectations, and they were very easy to use. No harsh smells like the other postings.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions on how to use these, so they are useless.</li>
            <li> It works but the wand will come apart often.  I almost want to glue it together but then it might be hard to store.</li>
            <li> a really good dupe for the real thing, they came super fast, and if you dont want to pay the extra money, very worth while.</li>
            <li> I loved these! Honestly I think they are a little bit of a headache to put on (time consuming) but if your like me and want every ounce of sleep you can get then this is for you. I put them in the night before and sleep on them. It&#x27;s not comfortable as you first lay down but once your asleep, it&#x27;s no longer a problem. I guess the main advantage is the variety you&#x27;ll get by using these. I normally have wavy hair and love that I can now get it curly without having to wakeup extra early. Plus Curls always look extra special. I do them half way sometimes and love that look as wel as the curled from root to tip.</li>
            <li> These are one of the best hair gifts I have ever bought myself. It is the greatest heartless hair tool I have. My hair comes out soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use on my young daughters hair. these curlers you&#x27;re only effective if you have some type of setting lotion in your hair and you&#x27;re able to sit under the dryer ,if you can&#x27;t then it kind of hard to maintain.Their curls came out  frizzy ,I guess with more heatand product it be better .</li>
            <li> Watch the YouTube videos for instruction on how to put these in and you will be so happy you did! Like others have said...you definitely want your hair towel-dried/damp, and if you are having a hard time putting them in, it is probably because your hair has dried too much, or you need to keep the wand at more of a 90 degree angle. They make excellent, tight curls - which can be easily loosened if that is your preference. My hair DOES NOT normally curl with curling irons, and if it does, it goes flat so quickly...but the curl I get from these rollers lasts for THREE days!! No kidding! I&#x27;ve convinced my sisters to buy these, and they love them too. You might want to buy a hood-drier attachment for your blow drier if you don&#x27;t want to wait for your hair to air-dry.</li>
            <li> With a continued practice I am getting better with each set and am conquering the learning curve, which is a bit steep. I watched quite a few Youtube tutorials for pointers, which is helpful, but actual practice on your own head, is how you learn what works for you.  I am Caucasian with a lot of medium weight hair that is naturally wavy and layered -length is roughly 2 inches below my shoulders.  I believe that this set of 40 is equal to the brand name of Extra Long and Wide set (NOT the Extra Long Extra Wide, which I would have preferred, but I make do by using slightly thicker sections of hair in each curler), sold by Sally&#x27;s and also here.  Don&#x27;t spend 70+ for the CurlFormers Salon kit - this set is equal to that one for less than 20. I don&#x27;t sleep in them, too uncomfortable. I spritz each section of my dry hair with a dilute mix of Infusium and water,  or use on freshly washed, slightly damp hair, for about 4hrs.  If I&#x27;m in a hurry I speed up the process a bit with a soft bonnet attachment to my hand held dryer. I am pleased with the resulting long lasting, shiny curls - and the compliments :-) - well worth the effort and investment. These are sturdy curlers that will last a long time.  Not so sure about the hook....UPDATE _ I was right about the hook - flimsy - worth it to invest in 1 or 2  brand name CurlFormers hooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; **Of note - they had a weird chemical odor that lingered for a few days, even after a soak in a strong Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint soap bath.  Be wise and air them out or bathe them before 1st use.  I have no idea what residue was on them.**</li>
            <li> Ringlets worked great on my hair but they were hardly enough for my whole head. To combat this problem I tried to make bigger sections but all that did was make my hair break off while trying to pull through the ringlet. The product would have been much better if more came in the package and if there was a backup hook.</li>
            <li> This works great.  My hair curls so great.  It is so easy to use.  I do need to put less hair in each curler because my hair is already curly.</li>
            <li> Awesome !!!!! this item is so cool. They really work and your hair stays for days. Ohhh natural nice curls.</li>
            <li> They pretty much mold your hair to the exact shape of the curlers (I used a product with them, fyi).  I used them a couple of times and got what I expected.  The technique can be a little tricky, they&#x27;re not super user-friendly as you can break hair and tangle it in the process.  But overall its not terrible and they do what they&#x27;re supposed to.  I decided the curls were a little too small for my hair to work out,  but that&#x27;s not reflected in my 4-star rating, as its a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Pretty much like the other kind.. cheaper plastic but get great curls!</li>
            <li> OMG! I love it love looooove it! I&#x27;m going to buy some more! I actually like these even better the Curlformers! They are firmer and more durable than the Curlformers. AND THE PRICE! You just can&#x27;t beat it! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This product worked really well.  I received them in three days, which was ahead of the scheduled delivery date. As with the CurlFormers after reading those reviews, the first time using them was tricky, but I got the hang of it and my hair turned out just like the pictures!  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers expecting them to take up to a month to arrive at my house since they were coming from China. I received them within 2 weeks. There was a small hiccup with my order but I contacted the company and it was fixed immediately and I was very impressed with the customer service, they went above and beyond to make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;My only warning is it takes some practice. I bought them to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair but I am so glad I tried them on myself first because it can pull your hair and it is very, very painful! Once I&#x27;ve got the knack down I&#x27;ll try them on my daughter but not just yet.&lt;br /&gt;I received a ton of compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve started using them, they work much better than conventional curlers and my curls last days.&lt;br /&gt;Have fun but remember to be careful!</li>
            <li> This was is a really good product.  I thought since they were an off brand that the quality wouldn&#x27;t be there.  The curl formers were made very well and created smooth curls in my 4B,C natural hair.  I have long, thick hair and I used as many as possible and still have about 8 extras in the package.  I was afraid I would run out formers before completing.  After working with these formers for a few minutes it became very easy and fast to put in and take out.  My hair wasn&#x27;t fully dry so I ended up sleeping in them.  It wasn&#x27;t as bad as the other reviewers have reported.  I would sleep in the again.  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> They worked out perfectly.....money well spent!!!&lt;br /&gt;If there was one con, I would say a couple of the curlers were defective</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  It is easy to use and actually works better than a curling iron in my opinion.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is poker straight and it will not hold a curl with a curling iron for more than a few hours.  These curlers gave her tight spirals that lasted more than a day.  The best part is no heat damage.  I also really like the speed. It took me about 30 mins to put in all 40 curlers.  I could never do her full head of hair with a curling iron in that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are they are not very comfortable to sleep in and a few curlers had some fraying of the mesh but nothing that would prevent you from using the curler and certainly nothing to warrant buying the $70 version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get these!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, uncomfortable to sleep in, but beautiful results.</li>
            <li> Just fell out of my hair.  I watched the videos, but apparently some details escaped me.  Return process we very easy. I&#x27;m thankful for that.</li>
            <li> Works exactly how it should. Worth the money. Only problem I had was with some of the rubber/plastic ends are cracked on the side and pull the hair, so I had to dispose of 4 of the them. I would suggest buying 2 packs if you are natural or have thick hair. My sister has thin/fine Alicia Keys hair and only uses 1 pack.</li>
            <li> These are great curlers! Excellent price! No need to pay full price for a &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brand curler.</li>
            <li> I love the curler. They take a little more time to put in but the result are great with my hair being NATURAL.</li>
            <li> These rollers are amazing not to mention when compared to the $80 curlformers.  With a little practice, you will look like you stepped out the salon.  I used these one time and all my coworkers thought I actually had been to a shop and got my hair done. I would definitely recommend these rollers to anyone who wants to look good on a budget. The trick is to go on you tube for a tutorial.</li>
            <li> This was packaged horiible and was to big nd pr my hair but if you he long hair it will work well and also</li>
            <li> Got this product wanting to copy Naptural 85&#x27;s new twist out method. For all the kinky girls out there (no clue what my texture is - probably a mix of 4a,b and c lol) this is actually better than the one in Sally&#x27;s because it&#x27;s plastic, which makes the hair a lot more sleek. Haven&#x27;t tried the one in Sally&#x27;s, but I felt the cloth and I could immediately tell that the texture would result in frizz. Great for the price. I didn&#x27;t even use all of them, but if you think it&#x27;s necessary, feel free to buy two. You&#x27;re still paying less than you would at Sally&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> They work well but are not comfortable to sleep in. I just leave them in for a couple hours then hit them with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My girls love this product.  It is easy to use and the curls come out perfect and last all day.</li>
            <li> I have used these curlers ony a few times but so far I like them. You need to leave them in for a while while your hair dries, and I am impatient. But with the results I have gotten I am impressed. Definately would purchase again over curlformers. Better price all the way! The wand is a bit large but it works. Recommend watching a video on YouTube how to do it first. Instructions not included but who needs them.</li>
            <li> I love the product (Vakind Hair Curler Magic Spiral Ringlets Former Leverage Stretched Length). They are exactly like the product named Curlformers. I used them on my natural black hair and they were as promised. They stretched my hair and formed perfect ringlets.</li>
            <li> I always had a hard time curling my hair, curls would fall flat within an hour. And doing a roller set on yourself isn&#x27;t exactly easy. After trying these Curl Formers I will never use anything else! My curls stayed in all night! And they are super easy and fast to put on, just sleep with them and wake up with gorgeous curls every single time!</li>
            <li> For the price certainly a great value! I have never used the name brand Curlformers however these I&#x27;m sure work just the same. A little tricky to put on the first time I used but started to get the hang of it at the end and my curls the next day were wonderful! Super happy I made this purchase :)</li>
            <li> I have the straightest hair in the world. Definitely need to start with wet hair - maybe some product would help, too, though water really helps.With other curlers, I try to just start with damp, because wet would never dry, but with these, they keep the strand being curled totally separate and open to air, so it dries amazingly quickly, I think (probably only a couple hours - faster, with a blow drier, I&#x27;m sure). I like how it kind of forces you to use only a limited amount of hair (only so much will fit into the hook), since that&#x27;s good for even curls and for drying faster. Have tried every other type of roller, I think, and nothing else has ever worked as well and as quickly. True rag curls were the the only other thing that came close, but they take forever to dry, and I&#x27;m tempted to use irregular sections of hair. This uses the full length of your hair, so don&#x27;t under-estimate how long your hair is, or else, expect to pull it away from your scalp a little to make sure you&#x27;re sure to curl the ends. LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised with the quality of these curlers. My sister has the real curlformers. She says there&#x27;s no difference btwn them in quality. Warning: these curlers are 19 inches long. The real ones are 22 inches long. It was hard to sleep the 1st time I used them. But now I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. What I have not gotten used to is the time it takes me to put them in! 2 hours!!! My hair is armpit length. I&#x27;m used to wash and go&#x27;s, not roller sets. I think I&#x27;ll get faster with practice. I&#x27;m able to keep the curls down for 2 days and in an updo for another 2 days. I have even recurled prior to washing by dampening the hair, adding a tiny bit more styling product, and sliding on the curlformers. I was so happy with purchase that I purchased another set. Go on out and get a set or 2 for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have edited my review: I still love these curlformers, and have used them a total of 6 times. It still takes me about 2 hours to put in about 46-50 curlformers even though my technique has improved.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another set from the same company in order to make my sections smaller. However they were shorter than the 1st set...why?  I&#x27;m not sure! I&#x27;m wondering if the company can tell me. I will contact them.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use. I sleep with them in and wake up with beautiful curls. You can also blow dry for fast results.</li>
            <li> Great product. Results mirror a salon spiral roller set. Great product construction. Arrived quickly. Nice little generic zip lock bag to store them. They didn&#x27;t have a chemical plastic smell. Contends equally with the name brand formers.</li>
            <li> Pretty much like the original curlformers. It was super difficult to get the hair through at first. I watched a bunch of youtube videos and it&#x27;s nothing like doing it in person. The videos help so definitely watch a few. After doing a few I found my groove and I was so pleased. It was quick to do. I also have a hooded (soft) dryer so that speeds up the drying process. Not comfortable to lay down in but with a dryer I didn&#x27;t really need to. If you&#x27;re wondering &amp;#34;should I pay $70 for the name brand or $17 or so for ones that look the same but may not be the same&amp;#34; DO IT!! Do it do it do it!! They are almost identical and give gorgeous curls! I am beyond satisfied. I need like 10 more because I have a lot of hair but I made 40 work. I got the extra long and wide because my hair is long (below arm pit) and growing. I&#x27;m sooo happy!!!</li>
            <li> These really works, seen on you tube decided to get them I use in my daughters hair every Sunday curl last at least 3 days</li>
            <li> the plastic is a bit hard to sleep on but it worked very well.  you will have to wash them when you just get them because mine came dirty as in factory floor grime.  but other than that great product. i heard the original curl formers are soft but you get a better curl for these because they are harder.</li>
            <li> The curlformers were too wide for my hair.  My hair basically slid right through them, and I have 4b/c hair, too.  My hair is very soft,  porous, and about 7 inches long.  I ordered some narrow curlformers and I hope they&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> I use these like every week to stretch my hair without heat. I love them. After you get the hang of putting them in initially, they become a breeze to place in your hair with no effort. I&#x27;ve put them in my hair, my mother and my sister&#x27;s. Both love how their hair comes out after using these. Although some are starting to unstitch at the tops, I&#x27;m not worried, as they are a cheaper brand, you get what you pay for and seeing as my friend bought the more expensive brand and those are doing the same thing, I&#x27;ll stick with these less expensive ones. I will definitely buy another set as my hair get&#x27;s longer and I want the curls to be more defined.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to use this ringlets since I was looking for way to use less heat on my relaxed hair. The curls were ok and the stick broke into two before I finish setting my for the first time. Am not sure if I will use it again.</li>
            <li> First of all, these came VERY fast. They warn you the shipping may take several weeks because it comes from China, but mine came in about 5/6 days. They were in convenient and small packaging. I found these because I was a little surprised how expensive the name brand (&amp;#34;Curlformers&amp;#34;) was, so I went online looking for something like this. They are perfect knock-offs. They are also easy to use, even if you have never used these before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a VERY strong grip, so once you slip your hair through them, they definitely stay on. If you place them correctly, you will have natural-looking curls. The ends of them also don&#x27;t grasp too tightly in a horizontal fashion, so you won&#x27;t have the annoying dents in your hair after it dries. That being said, you should take care how you take them off, because if you just pull them you will end up pulling out some of your hair, and it&#x27;s kind of painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also comfortable and easy to sleep in! I was worried that they would bother me throughout the night and feel uncomfortable against my scalp, but this was not the case. I didn&#x27;t even notice them, and forgot I had them on when I woke up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls also last across 2/3 days, depending on how well your hair holds. If you keep them on for a long time (or sleep in them), the curls are very tight and bouncy. The good news is they don&#x27;t get frizzy if you brush or comb through them. I personally have somewhat thinner hair that holds curls very well, but based on how long they last for me, it seems that someone with thick hair will be highly satisfied with how well these curl &amp; hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick it comes with is very good compared to others I have used before. It has a nice grip, but your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught easily in the hook. Although, if you are new to using these, it would be helpful to look up videos before trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using these with freshly-washed, 95% dried hair, and fully dried hair. The 95% dried hair yields the best results, but I was happily satisfied with the semi-curls I received from fully dry hair as well. This means if you are just wanting to quickly curl your hair without damaging it on the heat curler, but don&#x27;t want full curls, this is perfect for that! They held for a good 3/4 hours. I suggest putting hairspray on before using the curlers and leaving them in for about 30 minutes, and maybe blowdrying them for a minute after they are in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they are exactly what I was looking for. Very efficient, cheap for the quantity, reliable, and comes with a good hook!</li>
            <li> Would have given 4 stars had the hook not broken. Good price.  Formers were good.  Wish I would have purchased 2 packs.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought these!  They were budget friendly, easy to use, fast shipping and excellent durability!  AWESOME PRODUCT!  I just bought another pack just in case I want smaller sections next time I use them.  THANK YOU for such a great deal!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t pay the extra money for the name-brand version. Super super easy to use. I tried them out for the first time last night and woke up with beautiful curls :-)</li>
            <li> The heated curlers are to hot for my hands. They have small, medium and large. You have to find the right size for your hair length so it would work good. I use garnier curl spray with this, but you don&#x27;t need to use it. They have regular curlers and spiral. Watch you tube video of snail curls.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it worked pretty good, but the second time I used it the wand snapped in two and I cannot find a site where you can just buy the wand and not curlers.  It broke really easy, was not happy</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! It is easy to use and actually works better than a curling iron in my opinion. My daughter&#x27;s hair is poker straight and it will not hold a curl with a curling iron for more than a few hours. These curlers gave her tight spirals that lasted more than a day. The best part is no heat damage. I also really like the speed. It took me about 30 mins to put in all 40 curlers.</li>
            <li> Perfect, worked as expected. Fast shipping. I recommend this as a reasonable alternative for Curlformers. Less expensive and gave me excellent curls.</li>
            <li> the wand had to be taped but the formers work great. they are losing a lil threading already but still work</li>
            <li> At $15, this compares very favorably with the brand name version. Pro: worked very well, gave me lovely spriral curls with little work. Con: no instructions, at all!  Go to Youtube for helpful how-ti instructions.</li>
            <li> Honestly though, I was hesitant until I tried it...because it wasn&#x27;t the actual CurlFormer (Like honestly who have the money for the brand name when this product does just the same okay boo boo). Let&#x27;s be real, One of the pink curl former did break on me but that&#x27;s okay because I had tons more. it&#x27;s not going to make or break me mkay. I used the Jane Carter setting and wrap as followed by a Youtuber because I did decide to go natural and I like these curls a lot. I may even post a pic up of before and afters. Before I even put these former in my head I let them soak in HOT water to rinse of any manufacture stuff you know. (: Just have fun with it. I know beginner can take a while ti figure out to make the process go faster with putting them in. it took me a good hour to put them in but taking them out is like 5 mins? Not even then the styling after is up to you.</li>
            <li> It did exactly like it says it will do. It puts curl in your hair like nothing else will. I have tried perms, rollers, curlers, irons, etc. theses were the only things that ever worked....I never thought I would say this, but they are almost too curly! I wanted more of a beachy wave and volume. This is straight up curly.</li>
            <li> I had seen the Curlformers brand of these curlers in Sally.  One of the shopgirls had done her hair with them and I was really impressed by how great her curls looked.  I was a bit flabbergasted at the price . . . $70!!!  After burning myself repeatedly with the new curling irons that don&#x27;t have the clamp on them, I decided to give Curlformers a go.  I only bought a starter kit to test.  They were reasonably easy to use, so I considered investing in the full set.  Then I came across these.&lt;br /&gt;They cost as much as my starter kit of 6, so I went for it.  I figured if it turned out to be a mistake, then I was only out less than half the $ of the Curlformers.  I am pleased to say that I am completely satisfied with my results.  Any kinks--no pun intended--in the process are due to operator error, not the curlers themselves.  They are not comfortable to sleep in, but I already have sleep issues.  Waking up with impressive hair is worth the annoyance.  Also, I used one of those neck pillows that people use on airplanes for sleeping upright and that helped a lot.  I may come back and revise this post when I see how long they last me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have definately paid more for these!! This product gave me salon curls for about 1% of the price!!! THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> These were really worth my money !! I&#x27;ve had these things for at least 2+ years now and they&#x27;re still holding strong . I have probably never been happier with purchase and these things work wonders, they do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do and it even came with its own little carrying case to hold all the curlers and stick . Very satisfied .</li>
            <li> It a goOd product for any girl with curly hair. Especially tight curls, it helps you stretch your hair without he heat of a blow dryer .</li>
            <li> These looked sooooo easy to use but they are very difficult to put into your hair. It takes a lot of time and practice to get to the point where you can thread you hair through them with ease. I&#x27;ve tried them once and haven&#x27;t had the desire to try again yet.</li>
            <li> awesome results&lt;br /&gt;we use it all the time for my 5 yr old easy to use on children!&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> So easy to use. One of the curlers was missing a piece and I contacted the seller. They responded very quickly and replaced the curler. I am very pleased and would definitely order from them again. I used these on my daughters hair and I was able to get them in quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is so much cheaper than the Curlformers and does the same thing!  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about them is that the hook keeps coming apart.  I think I am going to buy a Curlformers hook.</li>
            <li> Loved them, I am not very good with a curling Iron and such but these were very easy and gave me great curls I loved</li>
            <li> I read the mixed reviews and was super nervous!! I watched vids on how to use these before purchasing these. The first few were tricky BUT!! After the 5th it was simply a breeze!! Everyone says to go from the bottom up, I learned to go from the top down, it&#x27;s just easier, I use Redken Fresh Curls Curl Spray and my spirals  come out perfect. They are VERY tricky to sleep in, but if you watch videos on how to sleep in them, it&#x27;s easily done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand that pulls the hair through the curler is perfectly sturdy, IDK what other people&#x27;s problems are but, I had no issues with it, the curlers are perfectly sturdy as well. Will update my review if anything happens to them</li>
            <li> I am pleased with item</li>
            <li> I have to get use to the style to makes after it drys.  I do love that I can use it with my hair wet.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to work with at first, but once you get the hang of them they are great.  I made the mistake of thinking my hair was dry before it actually was, so some of my curls frizzed and didn&#x27;t hold. But in comparison to the name brand expensive ones, I would definitely purchase these again over those.</li>
            <li> These things are great! Order two packs if you have a lot of hair. The more rods you use, the more curls you&#x27;ll have that don&#x27;t need to be separated (which can sometimes puff the curl a bit). These are a steal compared to the name brand and they actually smooth your hair a bit more. The wand does suck, but I just used electrical tape to literally tape the two halves together once I snapped them in place (this is important bc thick hair will constantly pull the wand apart if you don&#x27;t tape it). Watch a YouTube video or two and practice. They are incredibly easy once you get the hang of it and sleeping in them isn&#x27;t too bad. If you use a lot of rods, take a large section in each side of your head and out a hair tie over it. This makes sleeping soo much easier. Be sure to use some type of product in each section before putting it in the curl former (curly pudding, can&#x27;t shea, etc) and moisturizer. Good luck!</li>
            <li> The hook was trash and wouldn&#x27;t even snap into one piece, but the curlers were great and I just bought a hook at Sally&#x27;s. The curls were adorable on my little girl, but it takes some practice.</li>
            <li> No need to spend more on the name brand.</li>
            <li> They work really nicely.  If you have really long hair (below shoulder blades) you&#x27;ll want the extra long curlers.</li>
            <li> The stick comes in handy and they really make your hair so soft without heat! Great I might need to get more!</li>
            <li> Bought these after I bought the Curlformers, which were way expensive! These are unbelievably similar to the curlformers and work just the same. I put them in my daughters hair, she slept on her belly, but the results were worth it! Great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a few weeks. I absolutely  Love them! I&#x27;ve had great results  each time i use them.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!! I was a bit skeptical because some were saying it was ripped and it didn&#x27;t work but it works better than I anticipated. A must buy!</li>
            <li> I am growing out my hair more, and have been using the original Curlformers for many years now (love those ringlets!). After getting a nightmare haircut, my hair length journey sadly left me to start literally all over. It was so short that it would just lay on my head. Well about 9 months into the process, it FINALLY is back to where I can start using these beauties again!! (sigh of relief) However, after using the Curlformers for so long, many of them are being to kind of fall apart (the openings get loose and will slide around the hair, especially when damp), so I needed to replace some of them. However, the original company are incredibly expensive (you can get about 10 for $13 at Sallys- nooooo thank you), so I looked into the alternative. WOWWWWW, to these imitations! I actually like these better than the ones I have! The openings look much more quality! And I didn&#x27;t realize that these were so long! They to be about 18 in long, when pulled all the way out. But that is fine, because I am aiming for about that length in the very back down the road, hopefully in about 2 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;  Just FYI, I never ever EVER write comments (ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!) but between the speedy delivery and the quality of the product (plus another hook for my use- yaay!!) I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. If you are in doubt, don&#x27;t be!! They are AWESOME.&lt;br /&gt;  And for those of you that say they don&#x27;t work, you HAVE to use these on wet/damp hair. I always use them as though I am doing a wet set. And it will last me forever until I wash the curls out. Telling you, they rock. You&#x27;re welcome. :o)</li>
            <li> After reading about these curlformers, I&#x27;m glad I got them. Watched a couple of youtube videos to see how to put them in. I loved the curls. Don&#x27;t try sleeping in them, worst mistake ever. I will sit under the dryer from now on!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and curled my daughter&#x27;s hair perfectly. We bought this set to curl our daughter&#x27;s hair for cheer comps. We tested it out a few days ago and the curls we adorable. It was so simple to use and she didn&#x27;t complain when I put them in. I can&#x27;t wait to try them out with her sleeping in them. We just used them after her showet and until her hair was dry. I know we&#x27;ll get a better outcome when she sleeps in them.</li>
            <li> That plastic handle is too weak, but the curlers are magical</li>
            <li> Why pay for CurlFormers? Great results for natural hair!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length frizzy, wavy, curly hair under normal circumstances that has a mind of it&#x27;s own when humidity is high. I watched so many YouTubers have excellent results with CurlFormers but I couldn&#x27;t wrap my mind around that $70 price tag. When Naptural85 did a POSITIVE review comparing these dupes to CurlFormers, I jumped on the dupe-bandwagon. I purchased from the seller PacificExpress and received them within 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL items were in excellent condition, no missing pieces and worked well with some practice. I used them on wet/damp hair and they took 5 hours to completely air dry for perfectly smooth ringlets or the frizzies will appear! They&#x27;re a bit uncomfortable to sleep so a hair dryer make figure into your beauty equation. There are no written directions but a YouTube search will provide provide demonstrations from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need a spray bottle with PLAIN water to dampen your hair if it dries before you get to the sections to use the curlers. IF you opt to re-wet with setting lotion or gel you may increase your chances for crispy curls and breakage...eek. I will buy a spare hook to have on hand for my own peace of mind.</li>
            <li> I have thin 4a type natural hair. I used these with Jane Carter Setting Foam and my curl came out great. They are soft, bouncy with no frizz. I&#x27;m not sure how long they will last though. I set the. On dry, stretched hair  with a little coconut oil and the Jane Carter, sat under the hood dryer for 30 minutes, and perfection! The price is just right also. I wouldn&#x27;t try to sleep in these because they are a hard type plastic and your head and neck might ache in the morning.</li>
            <li> Got these curl formers for my wife.. she absolutely loved them. And best part is the price...way cheaper than the other brands but works just as well !.. the only negative being that the  hook is very delicate and may break apart on rough handling .&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend it !</li>
            <li> I had my eye on curl formers for a while now, saw plenty of  youtube tutorials  and loved it. the only thing that stopped me was the price. then i came across a youtuber by the name of Napturals (or something) and she did a comparison between these and the more expensive kind and her results from these were actually better than the more expensive ones. I have thick hair and wasn&#x27;t too sure what to expect. when i took them down my hair looked like i had a relaxer. it was sooo sleek and straight looking, it was shocking. im happy i brought too packs. application wasn&#x27;t too bad. the back was difficult but just watch  few youtube videos and you&#x27;ll be fine. i wish i could show a picture of my hair to show how sleek it looked</li>
            <li> These work very well in my hair.  The first package too a while to get to me, but the next package was delivered very quickly.  I&#x27;m still learning how to install them, but they give great results.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Overall, this was a great curling tool. There are no directions on how to use (hence the great price) so I would recommend watching a few you-tube videos to understand how to use. After I did the first couple of curls, it went pretty quick. A word of caution: Regardless of the size of the curls, if you don&#x27;t have the entire piece of hair captured in the wand, the hair won&#x27;t go through the mesh material and you may risk snagging and pulling some of your hair. At least that was my experience. Also, make sure you use plenty of setting lotion and don&#x27;t plan on putting these in quickly the first time you use. I would also recommend air drying or hood drying as opposed to sleeping in them as they are not real comfortable. Even though my curls didn&#x27;t last more than a day or so (I think that&#x27;s just my hair) I would order more and recommend others to buy. In fact, to get a more defined curl, you&#x27;ll want to make the curls as small as possible. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the actual curl formers and almost work even better! Once you get the hang of putting them on they are so easy and could take only 20 minutes to do! The only hard part is finding a comfortable spot to sleep on them!  But for the price and results, can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> These are great, work exactly like curlformers and are much less expensive. I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t pay an extra $40 for the same thing.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair below the shoulders, and this product tore my hair and pulled my hair out. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the curls look great, there just hard to sleep with. Even my daughter uses them cause she likes how the curls look like</li>
            <li> I love it! Easy to put in and curls come out beautiful. I should have been bought this. Great buy.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old girl has long very straight hair.  It is very hard to curl and if it does curl is usually flat 1 hour later.  I put these in her damp hair at night, had her sleep on them.  Took them out in less than 3 minutes the next morning with perfect curls.  They lasted all day even after she took a nap.  Watch the video&#x27;s on youtube for instructions.  These work as well as the expensive ones.  These do not come with any sort of carrying case but for the price are awesome.</li>
            <li> This size is perfect!  The product is perfect!  The price is perfect!  I am so glad I found these on Amazon for a fraction of the price of the original Curlformers.  I would never buy the name brand as these seem to work just as well.  My daughter looked absolutely adorable and her curl is still going strong 2 days later.  The only down side is she didn&#x27;t think they were very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fast and very Easy to use. Beautiful curls by morning.  Love them.  Daughters whole cheerleading team loves them. Great product</li>
            <li> The original curl formers which I also own sells at just a little over 57.00 for the kit so I saved more than half the price. side by side they have the save design and ease to  use. Overall great product it produced  beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> I love them overall. I wish I would have gotten the other ones to prevent so much shrinkage but I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the store brand&#x27;s do at a fraction of the cost! I use these in my daughter&#x27;s hair - it is very fine and will not hold a curl with a flat iron or curling iron.  These placed in her hair while slightly damp then drying makes curls last the entire day - and sometimes into the next morning.</li>
            <li> The product worked great.  They are exactly what I expected when ordered.  Would recommend to anyone.  Save your money.  Buy this brand instead.  (BTW...I&#x27;ve never tried the other brand)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! They are so easy to use! I watched a few tutorials on YouTube and tried it last night. I have layered medium length hair and when I took these out the curls were so tight I looked like shurly temple. To fix this and loosen the curls so they looked more natural I simply sprayed my hair with a spray bottle to dampen them and they loosened. I love the way it curls my hair. And yes, it is a challenge to sleep with them in but the curls are totally worth it! The curlformers themselves are very well made. I only had one problem with one because when I put it on the hook it broke threw but all I did was flip it over and it still worked. U have to be careful with how much hair you use because if you use to much it will snag and it WILL hurt. The hook is a very good plastic and works just fine. Over all very pleased with this product and recommend it as a fast way to curl your hair with no heat. If I had to rate it I would give it a 4.7</li>
            <li> If your deciding to get these or the 69.00 dollars one at Sally don&#x27;t bother paying all that. This is so much better then the other one and worth the money 10 times over.</li>
            <li> The rollers were good. They gave me beautiful curls the only negative was two rollers came broken without the ends.</li>
            <li> Just like the brand name one but half the price. They work great with no problems and last me a long time.</li>
            <li> 4.5 for sure. The only dislike was the the black bar, it snagged my hair a bit but otherwise the product is amazing. The sturdiness gives a great curl and straightens very well.</li>
            <li> The plastic is super hard, not malleable enough for fragile relaxed hair. The openings of the curlers have rigid edges that snag the hair. The wand broke the first time I used it because the plastic is too cheap for snapping together and unsnapping when finished using; so if you snap it together leave it because it may break when taking it apart. My curls looked nice, but at the expense of ripped hairs when threading the hair through the hard plastic curlers. I will buy some curl formers since The plastic is supposedly better quality and more pliable.</li>
            <li> Got these for my BF for Christmas and she loved the heck out of them.  Very happy she liked them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with these curlformers! They made my daughters transitioning hair beautiful and my natural hair beautiful. I definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery. Has several sizes so you can use on your bangs as well. Colors indicate the size and the way the curl faces.</li>
            <li> These curlers worked great and I loved the results. The wand was a little difficult to use at times but I was able to work through it.</li>
            <li> They take some time (45 minutes) to get in but they are a blast and give great curls! The price is right too.</li>
            <li> These work great. My hair is shoulder length, semi straight, and is average leaning towards thin. I had no problems putting these bad boys on after watching a few YouTube tutorials. I put them in when my hair is damp and go to sleep (not the best night of rest I&#x27;ve had but beauty is pain sometimes lol.). In the morning I have beautiful curls. My only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t mastered getting the curls to stay all day. At most they turn into loose curls and stay for a half a day, after which they turn into more like a messy wave. I will say in the defense of these curlers that I&#x27;ve recently started learning to use hair products so I&#x27;m not the best at knowing what to use to make the curls stay. Word of advice: The stickier the product you put into you&#x27;re hair, the more difficult it will be to pull through the curlers. (And by difficult I mean PAINFUL lol)</li>
            <li> Worked great! My friend ordered the $70 brand and I ordered this one. Same results.  Save your money on this one and get twice as much.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! 40 is more than enough for one person. If only I could find these in a larger curl size.... I&#x27;d be set. I used these but taking a shower at night then sleeping with these in. The next morning I have perfectly formed curls that do not fall out!</li>
            <li> These are hard to get on your hair at times and not at all comfortable to sleep in however, they do make a lovely curl.</li>
            <li> These curlers are very difficult to open and, if you are not extremely careful with the rod, you will pull your hair out while attempting to pull your hair through the curler.  The ends are extremely stiff, making it difficult to hold the rods in the open position while you&#x27;re trying to remove your hair from them.  Finally, I would NOT recommend that you attempt to sleep in them.  I made that awful mistake.  When I opened one to slide my hair out, the hair stayed inside.  Apparently, the super tight grip on the end worked with my tossing and turning to &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; my hair off.  More unfortunately, this particular curler was positioned near my face.  There was no hiding it. I don&#x27;t know if my problems were the result of this particular maker or if it is the nature of this type of curler to invite breakage.  I just know they will not be going back on my head ever again.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  They work great on  my daughter&#x27;s hard to curl hair.  We love them!  They are so easy to put in.</li>
            <li> Very Easy, and quality is great, would highly recommend this to all my friends. Curls come out flawlessly, make sure you have some sort of setting lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the no heat curls. It does a terrific job stretching and curling my hair in curls that last quite a few days.</li>
            <li> Used these yesterday on damp hair/ long/ thick with a little mousse. Didn&#x27;t have the issue some people have reported with pulling because of the technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered 2 sets so I got two rods. I don&#x27;t think the rods are super flimsy but you do have to be careful. Watched my fair share of videos on how to put these in and I was off to the races!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work awesome, not sure what I would be missing by ordering the off brand but I don&#x27;t care - these work for me! I would say that you need to watch videos on how to put these in, take your time the first time (there is a learning curve) and let them dry completely. I got awesome spiral curls with zero heat (left them in for 3 hours) that lasted all night and into the next morning. They did relax a bit but I think that&#x27;s my hair and not the curl formers. I could have gone to work as is this morning because it still looked awesome even after sleeping on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy these again for sure - love them!</li>
            <li> actually ended up buying more after this set. bought for a 14 yr olds hair that is baby fine yet thick hair.. love theses curlers. they are so easy to use. fast and does not damage your hair. would recommend seller and product to anyone!</li>
            <li> THEY ARE GREAT IF YOU AREN&#x27;T WANTING TO PUT ANY HEAT ON YOUR HAIR AND STILL HAVE CUTE HAIRSTYLES.&lt;br /&gt;I AM TRANSITIONING FROM RELAXED TO NATURAL HAIR AND AM AVOIDING HEAT AT ALL COSTS AND THE CURLERS ARE GREAT FOR SMOOTH EDGES AND LITTLE TO NO FRIZZ.</li>
            <li> The product is nice but I expected way more defined curls, plus my hair matted after the day with this style.</li>
            <li> I like these curlers, they don&#x27;t take a lot of practice, I got the hang of it after just two tries.  My hair was dry with just a light mist when I put them in and they did curl but not greatly because there just wasn&#x27;t enough moisture which was my fault.  I will try them again when my hair is damp and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> A few things about me to give you some context for my comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thick and down to the middle of my back.  It has a natural wave to it but it is unruly and I never leave it to its own devices unless I&#x27;m dressing up as Medusa for Halloween.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 40 so I don&#x27;t want to look like goldilocks or like I&#x27;m trying too hard to be young and cute.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also prone to migraines and headaches if I yank on my hair too hard.  If I want to get a headache to avoid going to an event, I just think about the old school days when you pulled highlights through one of those caps with a hook.  Ouch~ See I need an Imitrex just for writing that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I bought:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said I have very thick hair and it is long, so I bought 2 packs of these (80 curlers).  I used everyone of them except for 3 and I honestly could have used those.  I also took the advice of the other reviewers and bought a Curlformer hook as many said that worked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the first three curlers I was about to throw the whole thing away as I was terrible.  However, by curler number 10, I was a pro (and I&#x27;m not a very patient person).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best practices:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Watch a couple of You Tube videos.  They make it look easy, and be forewarned that your first few will be a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Do not attempt to take a larger section of hair than the &#x27;mouth&#x27; of the curler.  It will snag and pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Hair should be 90% dry.  If it is purely wet, the curl looks a bit mushy to me.  I actually did mine on Day 3 hair and just used a water bottle to spritz the sections lightly and it turned out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  I didn&#x27;t see much difference between the hook provided in the kit and the curlformer hook.  I ended up buying the extra long and that was so long it was unwieldy.  Therefore, I used the hook in the kit and it was just fine (in fact better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  The most important part of the entire thing is to get the full section of hair inside the mouth of the curler. Then the hair will slide through nicely.  Again, don&#x27;t try a section wider than the mouth or it  really makes a messy curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.  You will snag your hair because it will come untwisted and the hook will be in the middle.  The trick is as soon as you feel any resistance to stop, unwind the curl and start over.  When you have it right it will pull smoothly.  When it is wrong, it will give you resistance immediately.  To avoid breaking hair or creating tangles, stop as soon as you feel any tension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  I used this teasing brush (which I LOVE) to brush out the sections before I twisted them to go in the curler.  http://www.amazon.com/Spornette-Little-Wonder-Teasing-Colors/dp/B000I82POI  If you don&#x27;t have one, get it now.  I love this thing for teasing, up do&#x27;s, etc.  It is the only thing that helps me tease without breakage.  However, it also did a very nice job on smoothing each section and getting out a few of the knots I made when I tried to put in too much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  If you are struggling, you are trying to get too much hair in the curler.  This became my mantra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.  Don&#x27;t expect your first time to be a style that you can go out with :). You could tell I was a beginner as I didn&#x27;t have a lot of uniformity to the sections I took or whether I used the clockwise or counter clockwise ones in the right places.  I could have gone over to a friend&#x27;s house, but not to an event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10.  It takes time.  It took me almost an hour and a half to do it.  I also thought I&#x27;d put them in and clean my house, but I really couldn&#x27;t.  They kept falling all in my face.  I don&#x27;t know how people can sleep in these comfortably.  With that said, they are not uncomfortable or heavy.  Again, I get headaches and wearing these didn&#x27;t trigger a headache for me.  I did start to get one when I was tugging on the crown of my hair, but that was because I was cramming too much hair in because I was losing patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11.  When taking them out, stretch the curler out completely and squeeze at the mouth.  They should slide out effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls were beautiful.  They reminded me of Phoebe from friends and they were soft and bouncy.  However, there were a lot of them (77 curlers full).  These are the extra long and wide ones.  I think I would have been better with extra wide.  These came out as lovely spirals.  Seriously the most beautiful curls I have ever had.  However, they were too tight for the look I wanted.  Still, I will use these on the bottom layers and order the wide set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine that the real curlformers could do any better of a job than these.  The results were outstanding.  However, if you want waves and big curls, get the wide ones.  They will look short, but I thought my hair would go to the bottom of these  since it is so long.  However, I had several inches left at the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you are able to sleep in these, I don&#x27;t think these will save you much time.  It takes a while to put them in.  However, if you are more concerned with results than efficiency, these are great!  I can image that you&#x27;d also get several days out of the curls themselves.  Definitely give them a try.  They are fun and the results are lovely, soft, bouncy curls.r in because I was losing patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11.

            <li> but i COULDNT SLEEP AT ALL !!! Next time i will do them early in the morning and take them out by night</li>
            <li> I recieved the product promptly which is great, however, great difficulty with the application. The first ringlet former was easy but trying to put in the second one was very hard. I gave up and substituted another style till I have a little more patience.</li>
            <li> I got these for my 14 year old daughter and she loves them! It took a couple of times to figure it out but they have awesome you tube videos on how to do this. She uses them at least once a week and two of the curlers are starting to come apart or I would have given five stars.</li>
            <li> These are very similar to curl formers, they are difficult to sleep in. But i simply rubber band all the curlers into a high ponytail to keep them out my way while I sleep. LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM !</li>
            <li> I do not like using hair products like curlers, straighteners, or blow dryers. I just don&#x27;t find them easy to use and they usually damage my hair. These were super easy to use. I put a little leave in conditioner in my hair to smooth it a bit and never got my hair snagged. It didn&#x27;t take me more then and hour to put 30 in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE TO SLEEP IN. In case you were unaware.</li>
            <li> These curled my hair very well. You have to work carefully to avoid ripping any hair out, but I got the hang of it quickly.  Putting them in was very fast compared to other curlers.  Their are some Youtube videos that were helpful especially when you need to remove the curlers. These are not comfortable to sleep in, but it was possible.  I used the whole bag in my hair, but I have VERY thick hair so there should be plenty.  These should be the right length for hair as long as mid-back.  My hair is below shoulder length and it didn&#x27;t fill up half of the tube. There was no problem ordering longer than needed.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to be the first of my friends to try this product. Everything was fine with the shipping but once I actually used the product, half way through the hook snagged at the bottom in a piece of mesh and snapped. I sat there staring in disbelief. My hair is thick And long but that has never been a problem for me. I tried to contact the company but something about about a domain error. The email wouldn&#x27;t go through. Now I have a product I didn&#x27;t even get to use once. Sheesh! I wanted to Order another pack but they need to make the hook more durable or send two.</li>
            <li> Package came relatively fast compared to where it was coming from. The process is pretty simple. Part, twist, pull. The key is to have the hair saturated so that it can be pulled and to pull the stick and move the roller to the root at the same time. If you are tender headed or have thin hair, I do not recommend this. There were often times that I pulled out chunks of my hair. The results were soft flowy ringlets. Not really my favorite because they don&#x27;t hold up as well as a flexirod set, but something worth trying to not put stress on your hair with heat. On thing that flexirods don&#x27;t do but this product does is the ends are protected. If you dont set a curl right on a flexirod, it may not dry correctly. My ends came out uniformly the same. So if you have split ends, this may show that. My hair is past my shoulder so there were a few that I had to pull down from the root because the ends were sticking out from the roller. Products I used to set were in this order: Oyin Gregg Juice mixed with Infusium 23 leave-in deep conditioner, Jamaican Castor Oil and Oyin Shine and Define. I set my hair right after a Nupur treatment. I slept in the rollers. I laid my face on the pillow and let the rollers hang over the pillow. After 6 hours or so all but a few were dry. If I had to do it again I would not make the parts as thick, but also not as thin. Starting from the back helped me, but my hair was already dry once I made it to the front. I prefer a tighter curl that will drop to ringlets once it is old. I am used to having a set that will last 2-3 weeks. I don&#x27;t know how this could last 2-3 days. I did read the colors denote the direction. Pinks go on the right side and orange go on the left side of your head. Unfortunately I did not figure that out until I had finished, better luck next time.</li>
            <li> Another great product. Works better than the $80 ones at Sallys beauty supply. Left my hair full and curly.  Love them!</li>
            <li> Orderd these and the blue and green set. My hair is naturally wavy with a loose curl, I use these when my hair is wet to form the mess into something workable. I am very glad I bout these things. And unlike other reviewers, I havent had a problem with the hooks breaking at all.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with this product, the seller however, didn&#x27;t include all 40 curlers and I cant even use the 39 I have because I only got 2 top halves of the hook. I recommend this product but not these distributors!!</li>
            <li> Seller communication could be better, but as far as the curlers themselves, I really love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These curlers are pretty easy to use once you get the hang of them. However, 40 curlers wasn&#x27;t quite enough for all of my medium length mostly 4A hair. Thankfully, the curlers dry relatively quickly. In total, I needed about 55-60 curlers for my whole head. Having to wait for my \\&quot;round 1″ curlers to dry before applying \\&quot;round 2″  made the application process somewhat longer (and annoying). But, the results were well worth the extra annoyance. These curlers created beautiful, bouncy curls that rival any set of professional magnetic rollers I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go here for my full review: hairdiary.wordpress.com/2014/01/29/curlformer-dupes/</li>
            <li> I thought that these would be a cool way to curl my hair--not. There are no instructions and who knows how to use the wand. There are also no clippies or anything that might be used to secure each curler. I&#x27;m going to have to contact Amazon to see what to do. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them...</li>
            <li> Quality of product is good in relation to original Curlformers. Easy to use and produced great results. I will purchase an additional set</li>
            <li> These are just like the &amp;#34;name Brand&amp;#34; Lots of curlers for the $$ and very quick shipping. Thanks so much!! I will recommend to other cheer Moms!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly. The curlers are all in good condition. The hook is faulty. I could not connect the edges and it broke while I was trying to put it together. It is VERY poorly made and the pieces do not fit together. I will try to contact the seller to get a new one, but don&#x27;t hold out much hope for that to happen. Will most likely end up buying one at a beauty supply store or another online retailer. You can&#x27;t use the items if you don&#x27;t have the hook, so I haven&#x27;t been able to try out the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 4/23/14 - Seller contacted me for feedback and when I mentioned the broken hook, they immediately sent me a new one at no charge. This impressed me very much! The curler formers work well and produce really nice curls. I used them on dry hair with no product added and they came out soft and springy. I put them in before going to bed, but have to say that they are very uncomfortable to sleep in. My hair takes at least 8 hours to curl with these in dry. I will try them on wet hair and sit under a hair dryer the next time.</li>
            <li> These were really easy to use once I got the hang of it. Even with my super curly, coily hair, I was able to achieve sleek, smooth, bouncy curls. Amazing product, great price.</li>
            <li> I had been dying for Curlformers for the longest but.... didn&#x27;t want to pay so much due to needing 2 packs. I have a lot of hair. When I purchased these, I figured that even if they didn&#x27;t work, or i didn&#x27;t like them at least I didn&#x27;t pay much for them. Since receiving them I have used them twice and I love, love, love them. They were very easy to use and the curls came out great. I did purchase a curlformer hook separate due to having read many reviews that were not positive about the hook that comes with the formers. After receiving it I completely understand why. It was flimsy and not smooth so I can see how it would snag hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely recommend that if you have been wanting curlformers you should definitely try these.</li>
            <li> The delivery of this item was great, received the package the day before the due date....too bad that I big chopped my hair a week after I order it. So I can only stare at it for the next few months....or next year depending on my hair growth.</li>
            <li> I found out these were two short for my hair. It may be a good idea to measure your hair before using them. I didn&#x27;t really get to use them. I found some 25&amp;#34; ones on ebay from a company without a name! There should be here soon!</li>
            <li> The curlers are very easy to use and the results are nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a little while to receive the order but I got a very good service when I contacted them for it.  They even offered a 10% off for the late delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This are the most uncomfortable things to wear your hair and even sleeping on them for a night they only stay in for about a half an hour after words.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, fine hair. I bought these and watched a bunch of videos on how to use them. Once I got the hang of how to apply these, I was very pleased with how fast I can get them in my hair. The curls are absolutely amazing, holding for three days. My hair does not respond to heat curls very well, and often will be flat by the end of the day. Every time I curl my hair with these, the curls last! This size pack worked for my hair, but if you have thick and long hair, you should probably order more than one pack.</li>
            <li> 1-2 of my forms had holes, but other than that they all work great and so much cheaper than name brand! Curls last at least 24 hours. Want to find fatter ones that make big waves rather than tight ringlets.</li>
            <li> Didnt get the ones i ordered but i still used them and i love how my hair turned out</li>
            <li> A great buy.It has a good quality.I am very satisfied.But I need to do a little hair at a time, if you do too much hair ,the hair will stuck in the tube.</li>
            <li> I had to return them because they weren&#x27;t long enough for my hair.  Be sure to measure the length of your hair and compare it to this length before you buy!  I had to leave about 3-4 inches of hair out of each ringlet at my roots and this changes the fullness of the curl overall.  They are great, though.  The curl in my hair lasted for almost 6 days and I have VERY thick hair.</li>
            <li> Loved this purchase.  My hair looked beautiful.  This product was easy to use.  This price was much better than that of the regular curl formers.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> The curlers are great, but one if the tools were broken in one of my packages when I received it. I bought two sets of these. I had to go out and purchase a curlformers tool from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in January for my daughters to keep their hair from being knotted in the mornings.  We put them in their wet hair at night and in the morning they have nice ringlets and no knots.  They don&#x27;t have any problems sleeping in them, but for 2 girls with thick hair I just didn&#x27;t have enough curlers, so last week I bought another set.  This set is definitely not as good. They do not hold tightly to the hair and they are not as firm a curl.  The original ones are marked with &amp;#34;JXL&amp;#34; on their cuff, but the new, inferior ones, have no markings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get a good batch they are great, but if you don&#x27;t they just won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I saw this because I didn&#x27;t want to use heat on my hair and my hair is naturally straight so I though, hey, maybe this will work... It looked easy to put on so I ordered it. Mistake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler might work if your hair is short... and if someone says long, they means shoulder long, not actually long long. My hair  touches my butt so it is very long and I&#x27;ve spent most of my morning trying to put these on ... after a while I thought I&#x27;m just going to give up because my head hurt so much from pulling out so much hair but I kept putting it on (two curlers per one streak because one wasn&#x27;t enough). After about 5 hours of having it on my head hurt so much I couldn&#x27;t wait to get them out... just to see that out of like 15 streaks, maybe 2 were somewhat curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this might work for some people, it is too painful and non-effective for me, so I am returning it and will keep searching for something else.</li>
            <li> Great price and they work really well.  Be warned - they do not come with any instructions at all - but there are several youtube videos with demos (that is how I found out about them in the first place).  They are pretty comfy too!  Nice ringlet curls.</li>
            <li> Love it for stretching my curly hair without using heat! Also a bonus because it didn&#x27;t cost me 70 dollars!</li>
            <li> The curls that it gives are awesome...More barrel then spiral but very pretty. However, the wand sucks..really sucks. Mines would not close completely so it kept falling off but I already had the curlformers wand so I was able to work with that one. So despite the wand making it impossible for you to actually put these things in..everything else was great.</li>
            <li> These were so big and they didn&#x27;t keep my hair in the roller. They were useless slipping off  would not recommend these at all.</li>
            <li> Just ok I had a hard time getting them on my hair first of all, a couple of the bands cracked on the top part of the ringlets poor quality I suppose and they are not for sleeping in I would suggest you use them during the day while you&#x27;re doing chores</li>
            <li> I love these and they work very well.  I watched a few videos on how to use them so when I received them, it was easy to get use to it.  The only thing that makes gives my hair beautiful curls that last all day with no heat.  Definitely not comfortable to sleep in but that&#x27;s to be expected.  If you want them to work faster, you can take a blow dryer to them so your hair dries faster.  I only use a leave in conditioner before putting them in, then I let it air dry for 4-6 hours or more if I&#x27;m not going any where.  Then I use a light hairspray after and the curls stay in all day and even into the next day.  I&#x27;ve packed my curling iron and wand away since these work way better.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the name-brand, and they work very well.  I&#x27;ve never used the name-brand, so I can&#x27;t compare the two.  However, these were easy to put in, the wand seems pretty strong, and I have had no problems with the curlers breaking.</li>
            <li> I had to do a little extra research to figure out how to use them....and I think that the more you use them the easier it becomes. Getting the technique down is a little tricky. Also, make sure to get the right size. These were really long- way longer than my hair- and I think it might have been better to have shorter ones. Overall, I liked the way my hair looked the next day. Once I get the hang of it, and fine tune my product selection to fight frizz, I&#x27;ll be able to create a &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; look with relative ease. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay for the more expensive ones......</li>
            <li> Excellent product! They work just like the super expensive one sold at Sally&#x27;s! Best purchase ever! I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> These things are fantastic I use them to curl my hair while out and while in twists. They work wonderfully every time as long as your hair has enough time to fully dry. They give the perfect spiral curl and I feel like they trap the moisture in my hair because it always look shine and soft when I take them out and stay that way after a week. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this size if  you have short hair because it will give you a shorter curly style unless that is what you are looking for. But there are smaller curlers available.</li>
            <li> Works very well and shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> These make do curls on my daughters hair amazing and the curl also stays in!  Would recommend these for girls of all ages!  The length is perfect</li>
            <li> They were delivered on time. I just wish that it came with 2 extra Hooks since I ordered 2 sets. It would have allowed me to roll faster</li>
            <li> My first attempt wasnt bad.. It took a few attempts to get my hair to thread through the spiral rod, but I will use again.</li>
            <li> I just used these last night and they are pretty cool! I watched a couple of YouTube videos a few days ago and I was able to do a really good job, it wasn&#x27;t that difficult. It took me about 1.5 hours to do my whole head. I&#x27;m sure it will get faster the more i get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some leftover when I finished. You can make bigger or smaller curls depending on your preference. I usually do Bantu knots as my go-to, no-heat, curl style. I still love Bantu, but I felt like thse made it a bit easier, and it&#x27;s a different type of curl. I get much more of a &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34;  curls with the Bantu Knots. These are definitely more sleek, smooth and defined. So now I have choices for my no-heat looks, which is pretty cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely difficult to sleep in them. I was kind of uncomfortable all night. Having a neck pillow or something to keep your head from being flat helps. next time I&#x27;ll see how well it does with just putting them under some heat and taking them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going off other reviews, I bought an additional Curlformer wand, but the one that came with theses seemed to work just fine. If anything happens, I will update the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(BTW, I&#x27;m an African-American female, I know that info makes a difference for hair product reviews! Lol)</li>
            <li> I really like using these. My hair looks really nice when I take them out. They are horrible to sleep in so I recommend doing it early so you can take it out before bed.</li>
            <li> Work like a charm. Got many compliments on the end results!</li>
            <li> What took me so long to order these!! I LOVE them. The curls are pretty and smooth and the formers are really easy to use. I watched a couple of YouTube videos before attempting to use these and that helped. One tip is to work with smaller sections of hair - especially if you have super thick or long hair. These are the long and wide curl formers and they make really pretty curls!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these curlers.  They are easy to use once you watch some youtube tutorials.  They weren&#x27;t too terribly uncomfortable to sleep in and they produced some lovely spiral curls.  Crazy reasonable price compared to the real deal at Sally.</li>
            <li> We had bought a smaller starter kit of these type rollers 6-8 months ago.  And they worked well.  The Kid&#x27;s hair has grown quite a lot, and the starter kit didn&#x27;t have enough rollers, nor were they long enough.  These rollers were inexpensive, there are plenty of them for our needs, and they handle plenty long hair.  With the other kit, I tended to try to pack the hair into the few long curlers I had, resulting in sometimes uncomfortably pulling on the Kid&#x27;s hair, to the point she didn&#x27;t want to use them anymore.  This set, I could take little clumps of hair at a time, pull them through.  You&#x27;ve got 40 curlers to use if you want.  We probably used 20-25 the first time.  With all that said, these things allow you to QUICKLY setup a kid for a headful of curls in the morning.  We typically do it after bath night.  Takes me (a guy), like 10-15 minuted to get the kid all setup.  And she sleeps fine on them.  I tried some other regular sponge curlers, and looked at other styles of curlers...  but these are so simple.  Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive these hair curlers. I wanted to try them out for a while. They were easy to use and did not disappoint. I&#x27;d say yes&lt;br /&gt;go ahead and give them a try.</li>
            <li> Oh, these were great for my sister&#x27;s wedding.  They arrived right away.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> it looks extactly the same. took 4 days to get it. and using it is quick and easy...</li>
            <li> I love these! On my kinky-Curly African American hair my curls came out smooth and soft and they held with no heat! I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t buy the name brand ones for 50 Bucks, these work great! My hair is about bra strap length and my hair just barley fit so if you are longer than that you might want to look for longer ones.  If this is your first time I would recommend watching some YouTube tutorials on them to save you a lot of trial and error. Oh and the black hook that comes with detaches in the middle to make for easy storing, but the darn thing kept detaching in the middle of pulling my curl through! No biggy, my thick haired sistas just add a piece of duck tape to the middle works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I love my curlers. I would give it five stars, but I think the wand could be a little better. It sometimes pull the hair.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! The curls are fantastic and take a lot less time and effort than the heated curling iron.</li>
            <li> Just what I asked for. It all came in one big package. Lotion didnt smell all that great but that was my fault.</li>
            <li> These ringlets are amazing! They work so nicely in my hair. Also they are very easy to use once you get the hang of it. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly weren&#x27;t hard to use. I did watch several youtube videos before using them. I think I need to buy more because my hair is very thick and the curl definition is better on smaller sections.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it should.  It gives me great, smooth ringlets.  They are horrible to sleep in (despite several tips on youtube).  My 3 star rating is less about the product and more for the results... After lusting after the beautiful curls of the ladies of YouTube for well over a year, I finally bought a curlformers dupe and discovered that I absolutely hate that perfectly coiffed curl look on myself.  Give me big hair (and honestly, a little frizz) any day.  This product makes me feel like an adult Shirley Temple (and not in a good way).  I am definitely keeping them though because the price was great, I did not have any frizz (and I am not exaggerating when I say that my hair dried very smooth), and I plan to use them on my younger sister/niece/cousins, etc. (all of whom have medium to long hair and are in elementary school).</li>
            <li> These are awesome and so much more affordable than the &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; version.  I am really bad with doing hair, but these are pretty much fool proof.  I get great results with my daughter&#x27;s hair every single time.  And we get so many compliments when we use them in her hair.  There are some great video tutorials out there on the internet that shows you some tips for easily putting them in, but I promise you, once you watch one video, you will be an expert...they are so easy!</li>
            <li> Once the curler is actually on, they do their job perfectly.  However, the curlers are longer than the hook which makes it a little hard to maneuver.  Also, the hook doesn&#x27;t stay clicked together very well so if you have to pull on it the slightest bit to pull the hair through, it comes apart.  It takes me longer than 15 minutes because of this.  I&#x27;ll still use them, but not when I&#x27;m rushed for time.</li>
            <li> I love these things!! They were pretty easy to use and quick. Super difficult to sleep in, so next time I&#x27;ll try to use a bonnet hair dryer in the morning rather than sleeping in them at night. Recommending to everyone.  Love that I got such awesome results without heat though.</li>
            <li> The curlers work great when your hair is fresh from the shower. But never put to much of your hair in the hook/curlers it will clump your hair and wont slide in smoothly as it should. a lot of the time now that I have used it about 5 time the hook starts to break in the middle so I recommend to get one that&#x27;s not into two pieces. after all this, my hair looks great. but if you don&#x27;t let your hair completely dry with the curlers  in they wont last you all day long.</li>
            <li> Although these could technically fit all of my waist-length hair into them, I needed a LOT to compensate for the thickness which took a very long time. It is difficult to get my hair into the formers because (even after de-tangling and combing for several minutes) the hair would snag in the middle of the former. When I finally got all of my damp hair into the formers (40 minutes of work) I left them in all night. In the morning I pulled the formers off, which were snagging and breaking hair, and the curls were very slight, not the tight spirals I was hoping for. I tried again a few nights later with similar, even worse, results. I suppose these would be good if you hair short/medium length thinnish hair... I am disappointed. Oh, and the hook thing they give you to pull your hair through the former fell apart constantly.</li>
            <li> These curlformers are stiffer the wand not so sturdy. However take your time to install or buy a hook of a another brand. The curls come out perfectly!!! Price is more than reasonable!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that delivers great results for an affordable price. I would especially recommend this product to individuals with natural hair that want a different look with soft curls.</li>
            <li> These should have had instructions on how to use them. I wish I could return them. I should have done more research on this product before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Came on time and is as described. It also came with the hook! So Glad I order these and the green and blue pack, Can&#x27;t wait to try them this following Monday!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> These are excellent! My hair turned out as smooth as if I had flat ironed it. Great product! Very impressed</li>
            <li> The curls are great the wand wasn&#x27;t it comes a part if you use too much force so be gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Overall good buy since they are cheaper than the curlformers</li>
            <li> These curlformers work,but I need to practice installing them in my hair. It took me about 2 hours to install them in my hair,I left them in for about 6hrs. When I took them out my hair looked a hot mess...lol I would recommend leaving the curlformers in your hair for a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have very long thick hair so I ordered two packages.  I did my whole head with one pack.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> Great job, lasts long, works on short and long hair!! Love them.  No hairspray needed and no frying with a curling iron!</li>
            <li> The curlers work great but within one month or maybe 3 weeks the hook broke. We tried to tape the hook back together.</li>
            <li> These definitely work. A little too well actually lol. They give me perfect corkscrew curls which is not what I wanted unfortunately. I wanted soft waves but these are tight, tight, tight perfect little curls lol. So, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then you want these! I&#x27;ll be giving mine away.</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to the expensive curlformers. You get similar results if not better. Im here ordering another set since I want to make smaller sections for sleeker results. It does the job &amp; curls hair very nicely. It takes time and practice but once the curlers get used a few times the hook goes through easier. I struggled using the orange ones my first two times but after that they worked perfectly fine. As I said I use the name brand curlformer hook that I purchased from Sallys for like $5-7  too many complaints about the hook that came with this package so I just threw it out &amp; didn&#x27;t even bother with it. I sleep on these not the easiest but its bearable. Make sure the curlers aren&#x27;t to tight on your scalp creating more tension then necessary !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my ONLY complaint is that it took like a month for me to get mine ! The longest ive ever waited for a product however after ordering my second pair it says that should be here by next week. I assume that it  just depends on the demand at the time the order is placed. If your browsing purchase them now you wont regret it !</li>
            <li> These curlers are great. I used them on my daughter&#x27;s hair and they worked perfectly. She had nice bouncy  curls. I watched some youtube  videos and knew what to do from the beginning which is good because it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions.</li>
            <li> I give it only four stars because it is impossible to sleep in these!! They are really easy to put in and to take out. The price is amazing! Can&#x27;t get any better than this. :)</li>
            <li> Loved the curlers. Very easy to learn how to use. I watched a few youtube videos about curlformers that were helpful. Was able to catch on very quickly. I can do my daughters hair all up in these in about 15 minutes. I put a lot of mousse in slightly damp hair. Left on for at least 3 hours. Curls came out perfect and held. I am not curling iron efficient and these were a lifesaver!!&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I recommend is buying the actual curlformer hook. The one that comes with this set sometimes pulls apart. Cost is cheap and well worth it. I actually bought 2 hooks so while I&#x27;m using one my daughter can load the next one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these, they came quickly, the only downside is that they arrived in a Ziploc bag</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time as described.</li>
            <li> There are easy to use and give a good shape to my 3c natural hair.</li>
            <li> These are some great rollers. My first time using these was years ago with the shorter ones. I had no clue what to dovso after the fail in using them, I gave them away. After watching Nap85&#x27;s vid on YouTube, I had great success.  The only negative I can say is that I received 39 instead of 40 and two of them were frayed and not usable. The curls turned out smooth and sleek, and I have what some would say is 4a type , AA, kinky, coily textured hair. Other than the damaged ones,  these were worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once. The little wand ripped my hair out a little bit but after using smaller amounts of hair I didn&#x27;t have that problem. The curls were beautiful</li>
            <li> Curls come out shiny, as if I had gotten a press and curl. Wish this one had instructions that came with it so that way It wouldnt have been so much trial and error.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4b hair and I thought these would create great curls but I was wrong. All the hype is false. There is major shrinkage and the curls do not form properly. However after a night with these in my hair, I notched how soft my hair felt. The curlers are a great way to lock in moisture, just not very good for curls.</li>
            <li> These things cost so much more in Sally&#x27;s.  It is a pain to learn to use.  But so worth the effort when you get the results!</li>
            <li> EXTREAMLY time consuming. not easy at all</li>
            <li> Oh, Love, Love, Love!!!!!!!!! This product is amazing, easy to put in, and easy to take out. 5+stars!!</li>
            <li> I have frizzy fine type 4 collar bone length hair that shrinks substantially when I wash it.  After hearing a few recommendations, I bought these to air dry and stretch my hair.  The formers stretched my hair perfectly, and without any sort of heat involved.  Next time I will try the smaller rollers with some setting foam and a hood dryer to see if I get ringlets that hold better, but great job so far.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Does the same as the higher priced ones. Totally worth the buy. If you&#x27;re on the fence, go ahead and jump off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.&lt;br /&gt;The curlers are really huge. I didn&#x27;t realize how big they were honestly. I have short hair, so I may wait until it grows out or return them for some smaller curlers.</li>
            <li> These make perfect curls, just not good for sleeping.</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t long enough for my 22 inch length hair, so please order the longer ones if you have really long hair, but I really love these! You don&#x27;t realize how many come in a package until you get them and you have so much extra.  I&#x27;d buy an extra hook and use half of your set to give to a friend! These are great for spiral curls, but now that I know it&#x27;s a good product, I&#x27;ll probably try out the long and wide ones too! Also, I would like to add that these do significantly less damage to my hair than the foam curlers, and I don&#x27;t pull out a lot of my hair trying to put these on/take them off.  However, these didn&#x27;t come with instructions, so please watch a video first!</li>
            <li> I like using this product, pretty cool.  The tool has some snags at the top and sometimes pulls my daughters hair, but otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> They work and are priced very well</li>
            <li> The wand that comes with these is a little short for the curlers leaving you trying to push the wand through while still holding your hair but overall I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. I saw somewhere that you could buy an extra long needle so I&#x27;ll just do that.</li>
            <li> I had been considering curl formers for a while. One thing I didnt want to do was sacrifice quality for the price but such is not the case here in regards to the curl formers. The wand, however, could be much better. The curl formers did the right thing by my hair and afforded me one day of heat-free curly locs! I have thick type 3c/4a hair. The appication process took about an hour. It could have taken less if the wand behaved better...but it was a naughty, naughty wand!</li>
            <li> Tried for the first time and the curls were great. I read other reviews and these recommendations really helped. I bought the the Jane Carter Solution Wrap and Roll. I put a small pump on each strand before I rolled. I also recommend leaving at least  a 1/2  inch from the scalp to let the rollers lay flat while drying. Does not hurt the scalp as much and easier to sleep in. I also bought the name brand curlformers wand which is a lot nicer. First of all it is much longer making it easier to work with. It also has a sort of stopper on the end that holds the curlformer from coming off the end of the wand when using. I bought 2 packs for my daughter&#x27;s long hair. I only used a few from the second pack but these are relatively inexpensive. Nice to have the extras in case some get lost too. It took me about an hour. My daughter sat on a stool and watched tv while I wrapped. Kept her busy. I bought the curlformer case to hold these but a ziplock baggy would be fine. I also bought the dryer from curlformers. So she can have faster drying. My daughter is freshman cheerleader and see these being a great for years to come. I also want to say that for special occasions before I bought these I paid to have her hair curled like this. One appointment cost as much as I spent on all of these things accessories included. These look amazing and will not pay for that appointment again to have her hair curled. Saving me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> They work fine. Not good to sleep in so I don&#x27;t use them much. I find it works best when you use the form too then I just blow dry my hair in the curlers.</li>
            <li> I loved these, I was glad I found a cheaper version than the $60.00 ones I always see in the beauty supplies. The curls lasted the entire day I wore them, they only wore out because I combed my hair out. I recommend this to everyone who wants no heat curls.</li>
            <li> These curlers are a great deal. I did have to watch a YouTube video to learn how to use them. My daughter doesn&#x27;t mind sleeping in them and the curls are beautiful in the morning. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is on some of the curlers the plastic has started cracking.</li>
            <li> They are hard, feel cheap, both of which I could live with. Except they really really cause soreness and pain to the scalp. I did as suggested and affixed it to my hair with enough room and still it hurt like hell. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again or recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love these! I had read a lot of reviews on these versus curl formers and they looked the exact same so I wasn&#x27;t going to spend $70 for the other ones.  I am on my third time using them and I am definitely getting faster.  I actually slept in them the other night.  It felt weird at first like I was never going to go to sleep but I eventually fell asleep no problem.  :)  It does take some getting used to but once you have done it a few times I think I can actually get them in faster than it takes to curl my hair using my flat iron.  Although, I have to leave these ones in :)  I have done them with dry hair and wet hair and I have gotten better results with my hair wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint (and I am sure I can fix this with superglue) is the wand can break when I pull it through the curler.  So you have to be careful about that.  I also want to find wider curls but have found if I brush them out a bit they can be wider.</li>
            <li> Yes! I am very pleased!  I have baby fine and thin hair that never holds a curl. Fell in love first time I used it.  Started with dry hair and spritzed with water. Inserted the curler and waited around 2 hours. Had curls for 9 hours!  There is a learning curve for using this product, but don&#x27;t be too impatient. Especially if you have hair like mine.  It&#x27;s worth getting used to for the results - especially for the bargain price.  Saw the brand name at the beauty supply store for over $60.</li>
            <li> returned item.  the rod kept breaking and would  not allow me to pull the hair thru..</li>
            <li> A bit stiffer than the name brand, but same great curl result.</li>
            <li> I like them, I&#x27;m not 100% sure how to get the exact results I want, but they work perfectly fine for my super thick 3b/c curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for a couple of months now and overall I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  I have shoulder length natural kinky hair and these tame the frizz and are fairly easy to use.  I have had a few problems with hangups and snags, but it just requires a regroup or maybe the use of a different curler.  I&#x27;ve seen where some people have had issues with the hook breaking but mine is holding up just fine.  I definitely would recommend these over the more expensive name brand product.</li>
            <li> So easy!  The curls came out amazing on my daughter&#x27;s hair!  Once I was accustomed to how the curlers worked, I was able to place them in my daughter&#x27;s hair quickly.  The curls were amazing!  This also shipped to my home within a day or two- very fast!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quicker than stated which was awesome, however they were of poor quality. I expected the formers to be a little more sturdy. It was difficult to squeeze open at the top to put the long hook through and remove them. I guess you get what you pay for. I tried them out but it was a fail on my part but I do plan to keep them and try again.</li>
            <li> They are good quality and came very fast. This curl is just a little tighter than I wanted I should have got the extra long and extra wide set. The curls last a long time. I did them on wet hair after a shower with a little gel in my hair and they lasted for 3 days. I recommend putting super glue on the hook to glue the two parts together. I have heard stories about the hook breaking apart inside the curl tube.</li>
            <li> Bought 3 sets already: for my wife and two of her girlfriends (they asked her to ask me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three very happy and now I have to buy more as the girlfriends of those girlfriends damn it learned the truth</li>
            <li> I decided to try these after a suggestion from my friend. She said that they were really good for people with natural hair (like me) because they give you very nice and defined curls. I washed and detangled and moisturized my hair, then used all the curlers in the bag. I slept on them over night and woke up to shiny bouncy ringlets! There great because they don&#x27;t pull out your hair when you take them out (which is a problem with many other hair curlers i have used before), and require no heat. The only reason why this product did not get 5 stars is because it took me a while to figure out how to use them and they are really uncomfortable to sleep in. Regardless, this product is amazing. No other hair curlers have worked this nice for my hair. I got so many compliments after using these curl formers and i will definitely be using them more often!</li>
            <li> They are highly uncomfortable to sleep in. I suggest sitting under a dryer sleeping on your chin. Other than that, they are good!</li>
            <li> One of my curlformers was missing the plastic tip but I bought two packs (because the first worked well and I have a lot of hair) and they&#x27;re great! I see zero reason to spend twice the money for real curlformers when these gave me such great results.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here, and there was no instructions in the package, so instead of being able to use them right away. I had to go google search for videos on how to. Very annoying!!! And they are NOT self explanatory, because of this I haven&#x27;t been able to used them yet, so I don&#x27;t even know if they really work or stay in&lt;br /&gt;I miss the huge packs of pink foam rollers we use to get in the store</li>
            <li> My curls came out really pretty. I just had a hard time sleeping with them. I think this is more of a hair dryer style. Where you sit under a hair dryer and let it dry. I got up in the middle of the night and took them curlformers out and went back to sleep lol. I have natural 4 type hair. I will try them again I&#x27;m just not going to sleep in them.</li>
            <li> These pulled on my hair really bad. I used them once and threw it out. Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these I highly recommend these. Great gift for family and friends. My hair is ver fine but my curls turned out perfectly.</li>
            <li> My girls love these. They are easy to put in and work so well! Don&#x27;t waste money on the more expensive brand. These work just as well!</li>
            <li> After trying initially on dry hair, the orange curls worked the pink ones did not.. I decided to give it a try on wet hair.. Same results.. The curls were puffy and not fully formed after staying in overnight, which was a task in itself.. Not sure if I will try for a 3rd just because inserting them is actually quite time consuming.</li>
            <li> I have only worn these once they are not as comfortable as i thought they would be but I brought the dupe not the real thing so i got what i paid for.</li>
            <li> An easy and SAFE way to curl your hair. I usually sleep on it overnight but I know people who allow them to dry in the morning for a few hours and they still look just as good. Love them!</li>
            <li> Comes with a hook.the hook will break the same day you start using it.not a good buy</li>
            <li> Works great!  Easy to use and super curly hair!</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and made in good quality. Exactly like the actual Curl formers but a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> Even though this is (I am assuming) the knock off brand it works just like the regular curl formers but they were much cheaper lol.</li>
            <li> They are so easy and the girls hair is so cute! Get comments on how beautiful their hair is every time i use them!</li>
            <li> Worked out pretty well for my natural hair. It lasted about two days and was really simple and pain free.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Dont forget setting lotion though.</li>
            <li> Harder to use than in the video and the two part hook keeps coming apart during application.</li>
            <li> These worked great! The only problem I had was the wand kept wanting to come apart after every few curls, but it wasn&#x27;t that big of an issue. The curlers themselves worked great and curled my daughters hair beautifully, and they are much, much cheaper than the name brand kind.</li>
            <li> I think my hair is too short to use with these. Curls came out ok. Very cheap compared to actual curlformers.</li>
            <li> This product works really good on my natural hair. I would recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy too use. I tried it on dry hair with a little conditioner and the curls fell as soon as I hit the door. Nothing to do with the product. Just the humidity. I&#x27;ll be trying it on damp hair with another product that holds better next!</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and these were a great size.  It took a while when getting the hang of it,  but the result was well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> These curl former&#x27;s really work and I love the lose curl that I get with these. I will be purchasing the thinner ones for a tighter curl.</li>
            <li> These worked great on my 6 year old for &amp;#34;dance&amp;#34; hair.  Once I got the hang of them they went in quickly.  I haven&#x27;t yet had a problem with the wand breaking and have used it 3 times so far.  Enough in the pack to do both my girl&#x27;s hair and have some left over.</li>
            <li> decent and work well, but the company sent two hooks instead of the extension for the hook.  Makes it very hard to do the job since it&#x27;s half the length.  Will contact seller and have to wait to get the right part.</li>
            <li> Heatless curls for me started at bantu knots, twistouts, braidouts, and cocoon curls. The curls achieved by theses curlformers ARE amazing. For those of us that still remember shirley temple and her iconic curls, you would be gussing over your soft bouncy curls. So stop looking at the price and get them now, 40 in a pack is more than enough. I wish I could post a pic for everyone to see. If you have any daughters, this would be the most adorable hairstyle, but I don&#x27;t know how little girls would enjoy sleeping with these curlformers over night. They haven&#x27;t quite learned that with beauty comes pain lol. I have been told when you are in a rush you can just pop your head under a blow dryer but I do no not recommend any form of heat with these curlformers. These curlformers are made with some sort of plastic and heating up plastic can be very dangerous. When plastics heats up their bonds break and when these bonds break, the things that make up the plastic like dioxins are released and they are extremely toxic and carcinogenic (cancer causing). I know natural divas out there would not even dream about using heat now ;)&lt;br /&gt;Still gussing over these curls because the compliments never stop. Be the trend setter among your friends make them green with envy then give out the name of this magic tool and they will surely follow. ENJOY!</li>
            <li> The seller, Vakind, was great and communicative so I had no problems with my order even though it was shipped from over seas. It even arrived fairly quickly. The curlers made perfect curls in my African American hair. If you&#x27;re into hair typing, my curl pattern ranges from about 3C - 4b and in some places it doesn&#x27;t really curl at all there&#x27;s just this frizzy kinda wave. I used put the curlers on using nothing but leave-in conditioner and hair oil directly after washing and without drying. They weren&#x27;t any trouble to attach and took me about 20 - 30min to get them all on. I slept with them on overnight, which I&#x27;ll admit wasn&#x27;t all that comfortable but not terrible, and the next morning when I took them out I had curls that looked like I&#x27;d gone to the salon (or at least had used a curling iron). I never applied any hair spray or gel and the curls stayed up and nice for 4 days: they might have stayed longer but I usually wash my hair ever 2 - 3 days so 4 was pushing it for me. I would defintely buy from the same seller again and I&#x27;d abosultely invest in more of these curlers if I needed to. In fact,  I&#x27;m planning on getting smaller and larger ones!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am a natural lady with 3c mixed with 4b hair. I don&#x27;t like using heat on my hair and these curl formers make my hair curly and stretches it out. I received it fast too. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> My hair would get tangled when I tried pulling into the curler.  Also I wanted something I could sleep in however did not have a good experience with that.</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully. I would have given five starts EXCEPT the wand that came with the set would not snap together. I had to tape it together until I was able to go to Sally&#x27;s and buy the real one.</li>
            <li> It is the same as the expensive formers but with AA natural hair using this size doesnt define my hair well enough..you need the skinny green and blue formers these are too large.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and it only took about 11 days to get here. I watched a billion youtube videos before I could finally get it right but I managed to get them in, I am actually sitting with them in my hair right now. my hair relaxed is just past arm pit length and these are long enough for all of my hair with a few inches left. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the stick either</li>
            <li> This would be the 3rd purchase of these curlers I have purchased.. They worked.. Takes a minute to get the hang of using them properly, but all in all I like them. Great purchase for me..</li>
            <li> It was hard to pull the hair through, but the results were very cute.  Used with eco-styler gel on natural african american hair.  Curls lasted about 5 days.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than form-curlers from sally&#x27;s and function just the same. For the price it&#x27;s worth a try. I would much rather curl my hair this way than with a hot tool.</li>
            <li> First Off, They Arrived Really Quickly. I Am Transitioning From Relaxed Hair To Natural, So In The NYC Summer Heat I Needed Something To Help Me Manage My Hair. I Am Not A Big Fan Of The Wash And Go Because Much Of My Hair Is Still Relaxed. I First Saw A Video Review Of Curlformers But I Wasn&#x27;t In Love With The Price. This Product Works Well And Is Fairly Easy To Use.</li>
            <li> Same quality as those sold at beauty supply stores and they are much cheaper. They didn&#x27;t come with directions, but there are plenty of YouTube videos to help you.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine in December and they work very well if you use small sections.  Too much hair and it takes forever to dry. A few of them have since torn and I had to throw them out but at the price I paid the loss of them didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Did not come with any instructions</li>
            <li> This is perfect for a no heat curl.</li>
            <li> Oh I had such great hopes for these...but not only are they too short (about 4&amp;#34; of my hair sticks out of the bottom and doesn&#x27;t get curled - I have hip length hair), but the curl is not tight enough and it doesn&#x27;t add the fullness I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have never had the orginal curlformers. These were a great price and they provided me similar results to those I saw on youtube. I would definitely recommend these and they have been durable. Honestly I just can&#x27;t see myself paying more for the curlformers.</li>
            <li> Forms a nice curl.  I watched a YouTube video for assistance.  My only complaint is about the &#x27;ends&#x27; of my hair.  I wish there was a way to keep them smoother while in the spiral for a more polished finished product.  This could be my technique and not have anything to do with the spirals...not sure.</li>
            <li> I dont understand how to use them! Search for a tutorial on youtube but still no able to make them work because this product dont have the same accesories as others.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! So easy and simple to install and the curls are just gorgeous!! :D</li>
            <li> Came with some defect curlers and a defective wand. Exchange for new item was easy and fast.</li>
            <li> I tried a friend&#x27;s name brand curlformers and loved them, but could not afford to buy a set.  I ordered these because the price was great, but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure if they&#x27;d be the same.  Well, they are, at least on my head.  The hook is nice and sturdy, and the openings on the curlers are easy to pinch open.  They stay on securely (unlike ordinary rollers).  I will say that if you have very long hair, as I do (to my lower back), you may find that the ends of your hair don&#x27;t fit at the very longest part of your hair, but the name brand are the same.  Really, I am thrilled with the price, the quality, and the shipping time.  Will try more varieties from this brand!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like is for a while. After getting used to it I had no problem putting them into my hair and taking them out.</li>
            <li> Great price and there are a lot in this bag. They are just as good as the original if you ask me.</li>
            <li> havent used them just yet but i have messed arounf with them and put a few on my hair and none&lt;br /&gt;has broken nor cracked. I love these things !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c hair and it worked perfect...did not see a difference with the original curlformers except the amazing price.  I will need to order more &amp;#34;curlers&amp;#34; as 40 was not enough. There is a learning curve when you start out but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s sooooo easy.  You must make sure all of the hair is in the hook, or you may accidentally pull/ tangle you hair.  But I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving these to a coworker. To be fair I have fine hair. No matter how much gunk, time, or cursing I used, these just wouldn&#x27;t produce anything resembling spiral curls in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were extremely simple to use and i loved the idea, but it appears the only way to get bounce in my hair is to braid it wet, let it dry, and poof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these would work on hair that can be permed and hold it, but alas, I am cursed with recalcitrant straight hair.</li>
            <li> Worked awesomely on my natural (4c) hair. Only complaint is that the wand wouldn&#x27;t snap together completely. However, it was still easy to use.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved them and her hair looks beautiful without heat damage.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE these.  My daughter loves having her hair curled, but I have a hard time getting her hair to hold a curl.  In the past I&#x27;ve used foam rollers, but I have to put them in so tight so they don&#x27;t fall out that I end up with super tight curls and some still fall out.  I used these for the first time last night and my daughter woke up with beautiful curls. They all stayed in.  These are totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the way my curls look when I use them. They are easy to use and I have never had a problem at all. Curls last a long time and look pretty even after a few days maybe even more depending on your preference and hair type.</li>
            <li> These create amazing curls!</li>
            <li> Great I was pleasantly surprised,I love it so much definitely a good buy. Perfect for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li> So disappointed. Doesn&#x27;t work for long, thick hair. I broke the brush almost immediately after trying it for the first time it was so cheaply made. I taped it, tried again, and still couldn&#x27;t get anything through the curl former, the ends are pinched together so tightly that I could barely get the stick alone to go through. Instead of having to watch youtube videos and having to rely on coming back here to find out how to use them, the direction should be in the box.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girl and the only thing bad she had to say about it was that the stick broke after just one use. She taped it and still uses it from time to time, so other than this company should produce a more durable stick for usage, I would say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> These took forever to put in my aunts hair, and pulls your hair out if not properly done. Not that impressed.</li>
            <li> They work great! They make nice smooth curls in my 4c type hair. The curls last several days if I tie my satin scarf on. Wish the curlers would&#x27;ve come with some kind of carrying bag or case though. Still, totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> These are AWESOME!!! I bought them after watching many YouTube videos on how to use them and how BEAUTIFUL the curls came out. I tested them out on my 5 year old daughter who has naturally soft and curly hair (she&#x27;s in between 3B/3C hair type) and they came out fab!!!! I used a little Jane Carter Solution Wrap n&#x27; Roll (which is a wonderful product as well) and the results were shiny, bouncy curls that she just loved!!!!!! I can&#x27;t WAIT to try these on myself next. Shipping time was super fast and received them within a week when they said they would be here in a month&#x27;s time!!!! Will order more soon :)</li>
