            <li> the brush came in handy but when i used it the bristles pulled out my hair as i applied dye. not very happy</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. It does the job well and is super easy to clean! After dying, I just pop this sucker in a sink full of warm, soapy water and use my hands to wash it.

            <li> So  much easier to use then the dumb toy brushes that come with some hair dye. This makes it easier to apply the dye where I want it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, great price</li>
            <li> Delighted in its coverage. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Oh muh gawd! This sleek stylish dye brush is juuuust to die for! Fits beautifully in the hand and slides across your hair like a skier on ice is Spring time. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but, when I took this gem out of it&#x27;s envelope it was loooove. My world would end if we were ever seperated.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a dye brush, it&#x27;s plastic, it&#x27;s bendy and you use it on hair. What more is there to say about this? Would I buy another one? Well, yeah.</li>
            <li> Too large for me. It was clunky and the bristles where bad quality and already frayed</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s not too spendy but it&#x27;s really good about coating the hair precisely and evenly.</li>
            <li> Not much to be excited about. It&#x27;s only a dye brush. It served and continue to serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> This was product came at a great price and shipped really fast. Great quality, i&#x27;m so Impressed.</li>
