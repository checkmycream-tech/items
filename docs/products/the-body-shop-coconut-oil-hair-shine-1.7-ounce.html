            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchases from this company!</li>
            <li>and he loved it, he has super curly hair and the oil takes away the fuzz on it.</li>
            <li>The coconut oil hair shine has an amazing scent, and truly does add shine as well as help to smooth flyaway strands.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The Body Shop products haven&#x27;t caused me any problems whatsoever-only some work better for me than others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this coconut oil for years and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the cheaper versions you can get in the drugstore.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>THEE best pomade for European curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite product after I style my hair</li>
            <li>P.S. TBS hand creams are the best, and they come in nice little tubes!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to use a lot just rub your palm in it and smooth it on.</li>
            <li>coconut oil hair shine calms my hair and gives it a fabulous shiny look.</li>
            <li>Also, thanks to Amazon for stocking these products, since TBS central sometimes runs out when I really need something-it&#x27;s great to have backup!</li>
            <li>tames flyaways and makes my hair look super</li>
            <li>This is the absolute perfect product to tame frizzies on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the smell is suitable for men and definitely not too strong.</li>
            <li>This would be a good product for a hipster who doesn&#x27;t want to lug around jars of pure coconut oil, but still wants to feel eco friendly and natural hehe.</li>
            <li>this paste is really soft and does not have that strong coconut smell,i use it to do my daughter hair</li>
            <li>Its not like using regular virgin coconut oil ( which I love and use as well).</li>
            <li>It does have a pretty cannister though, and fits well in the purse.</li>
            <li>Better to have learned that now than later!</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair; I have short hair</li>
            <li>I dont see any positive results to my hair.  </li>
            <li>tried straight coconut oil and it made my hair too greasy.</li>
            <li>shine between both my hands, and gently run it over my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent, but compared to the amount of pure coconut oil that I could get for eleven bucks - this is a joke.</li>
            <li>I love the Argan Hair and Body Oil, but only for VERY dry ends, or itchy winter skin.</li>
            <li>For fine hair (such as mine), I have to be cautious how much I apply as it can easily get very thick and cause hair to appear too oily closer to the roots.</li>
            <li>its much smaller of a container than i thought it was going to be, but decent product for the price!</li>
            <li>sad that they changed the great vintage packaging but still can&#x27;t get enough of this product.</li>
            <li>It is very concentrated, so less is more and should last a long time.</li>
            <li>You only need a pinky full, on dry hair.</li>

            <li> I bought one 5 years ago, and guess how long it lasted?</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> However raw coconut oil is easier to apply, and I use less to get the same sheen on my newly bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Use it on dry hair after a wash and it will keep your hair bouncy and shiny all day!</li>
            <li> Only need a little dab of it.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected....</li>
            <li> and I especially like it to tame sides.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and a little frizzy and it works well for it</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday in my hair.</li>
            <li> ~waste of money.</li>
            <li> messy to use</li>
            <li> This stuff has a few other ingredients and a subtle shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> I like to put my palm smack dab into the center of the tin, rub the thin layer of hair</li>
            <li> For the price, Its very small.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> He has very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Sadly I bought two.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about getting this product worried that it would cause my hair to be greasy or appear to be greasy.</li>
            <li> It smells awful.</li>
            <li> I did find out WEN has some NASTY ingredients.</li>

            <li> Great product, great value.</li>

            <li> I bought ir for  my bf and he loved it, he has super curly hair and the oil takes away the fuzz on it.</li>
            <li> It smells awful. Sadly I bought two.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought one 5 years ago, and guess how long it lasted? 5 years. A little goes a long way. Its not like using regular virgin coconut oil ( which I love and use as well). You only need a pinky full, on dry hair. It smoothes out the frizz and flyaways. It is very concentrated, so less is more and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent, but compared to the amount of pure coconut oil that I could get for eleven bucks - this is a joke.

            <li> This is a great moisturizing balm.  I wore it on beach days on vacation to keep my hair hydrated.  My husband also uses it as a styling balm, and it smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> great product.  I have very thick curly hair and it&#x27;s the only thing which works.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It keeps my curly hair under control and shiny too.  Only need a little dab of it.</li>
            <li> I understand why this isn&#x27;t adored by some, but for me, it works, so does the Argan balm. I love the Argan Hair and Body Oil, but only for VERY dry ends, or itchy winter skin. After having used WEN for years, my healers begged me off the stuff. It was causing me severe physical problems. The Body Shop products haven&#x27;t caused me any problems whatsoever-only some work better for me than others. So far, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchases from this company! I did find out WEN has some NASTY ingredients. Better to have learned that now than later! P.S. TBS hand creams are the best, and they come in nice little tubes! Also, thanks to Amazon for stocking these products, since TBS central sometimes runs out when I really need something-it&#x27;s great to have backup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this coconut oil for years and love it. It&#x27;s much better than the cheaper versions you can get in the drugstore. It smoothens and conditions hair and helps to style it. My hair is wavy and a little frizzy and it works well for it</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday in my hair. Great product!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for years on his hair. He has very thick curly hair. just a dab of this makes his hair look shiny and keeps it from getting frizzy. the smell is suitable for men and definitely not too strong.</li>
            <li> its much smaller of a container than i thought it was going to be, but decent product for the price!</li>
            <li> I didnt care for this product. For the price, Its very small.  being that its a BALM, it leaves my hands and hair.  Also i notice it leaves my hair tangled..  I dont see any positive results to my hair.  I prefer the organix coconut spray.  I would not recommend nor would I buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about getting this product worried that it would cause my hair to be greasy or appear to be greasy. I received it and I love it. I have really long hair and I just put it in the ends. You don&#x27;t want to use a lot just rub your palm in it and smooth it on. Good product.</li>
            <li> This is essentially coconut oil and doesn&#x27;t have any side effects. Use it on dry hair after a wash and it will keep your hair bouncy and shiny all day! Also improves health of the hair.. helped with my split ends!</li>
            <li> sad that they changed the great vintage packaging but still can&#x27;t get enough of this product. THEE best pomade for European curly hair. I am always running out of it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great for dry hair; I have short hair and I especially like it to tame sides.</li>
            <li> my hair is gray/white so keeping it in line is a bit of a job.  coconut oil hair shine calms my hair and gives it a fabulous shiny look.</li>
            <li> Started using this product 4 years ago.  It&#x27;s my favorite product after I style my hair I rub some of this in my hands and work through.  Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> did not smell at all like coconut~waste of money.</li>
            <li> this paste is really soft and does not have that strong coconut smell,i use it to do my daughter hair</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected....messy to use</li>
