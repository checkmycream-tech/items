            <li>So bottom line is that the mirror itself is great but the wobbly stand is not!  </li>
            <li>wonderful product....is there a travel size?  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>The clarity of the mirror is perfect, however, I think because I&#x27;m so nearsighted</li>

            <li>This brand is the best you can buy!  </li>
            <li>The best magnifying mirror I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is the best magnifying mirror without a doubt.</li>
            <li>What is especially nice is that the mirror does not distort your image at all.</li>
            <li>It arrived in good time and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>Great great mirror.  </li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Magnification and clarity are great.</li>
            <li>Acrylic and not glass, optically perfect and great for traveling because it comes apart making it easy to pack.</li>
            <li>vanity wise.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it because I could use it without using my reading glasses to pluck eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I received the item quickly, well packed, and in perfect condition on receipt.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing mirror I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend that everyone should own one of these mirrors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it as gifts to my friends and they love it too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Magic Focus goose neck mirror for years</li>
            <li>love this mirror....</li>
            <li>Love buying USA.  </li>
            <li>LOVE these mirrors.  </li>
            <li>I cannot see without my eye glasses and with the Magic Focus mirror</li>
            <li>I can do eye make-up, do eyebrows and so much more at closer view.  </li>
            <li>I just would have liked for Amazon to make it easier to find, I did many searches without success.  </li>
            <li>With magic focus can apply makeup without the glasses and do a professional job and look great.</li>
            <li>This meets the requirement, but will fall over easily if you hit it accidentally.  </li>
            <li>This is far better than all the mirrors that cost hundreds of dollars!</li>
            <li>This in itself is not a bad thing</li>
            <li>It was worth going out of my way to pick it up.  </li>
            <li>So worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have to get right on top of the mirror for it to be clear.  </li>
            <li>It is ok, and I&#x27;ve looked for a hand mirror to be able to pick up and hold in one hand while I hold a brush in the other.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like my right arm;</li>
            <li>pricey but worth every penny ,light, can be removed from the stand for hand held no distortion super crisp and clear</li>
            <li>It is one of the first things I pack when going out of town.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey, too.  </li>
            <li>Wall units are nice for makeup, but I like to be able to check out my hair from behind, so it has a dual purpose.  </li>
            <li>I got this new one because the old one got scratched and the goose neck version is no longer available.</li>
            <li>I have had a big eyes mirror in the past, and this one is as good as the original.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>For the price, I expected a stand that was more substantial.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it can be used as a hand mirror as well, very convenient.</li>
            <li>Too bad they could not stay in business because it&#x27;s a really great product!!</li>
            <li>but when my 26 year old daughter comes home she uses it too!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spray cleaner directly onto the mirror, spray it onto a cloth.  </li>
            <li>Have needed glasses in order to apply makeup which turned out to be pretty messy.</li>

            <li> It allows me to do my eyebrows, eye makeup and use the other side to check the back of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Whether you buy a model with little or big mirror surface, your image is always in focus - no fuzzy spots.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, take it on trips (packs easily because the mirror separates from the base).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other 5X make up mirrors</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for over 15 years and use it daily. I&#x27;ve given it as gifts to my friends and they love it too. It is one of the first things I pack when going out of town. It&#x27;s like my right arm; vanity wise.  I&#x27;ve used other 5X make up mirrors and they distort and give me a headache. This one was invented by an eye doctor and doesn&#x27;t distort at all. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> I have had this mirror for perhaps ten years.  I use it daily, take it on trips (packs easily because the mirror separates from the base).  It allows me to do my eyebrows, eye makeup and use the other side to check the back of my hair.  Great great mirror.  I&#x27;m 58 but when my 26 year old daughter comes home she uses it too!  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that the mirror was meant to be used as both a hand mirror and a stationary mirror.  This in itself is not a bad thing but the problem is that when the mirror is placed into the base it&#x27;s wobbly.  I&#x27;ve had the Magic Focus goose neck mirror for years and I loved it because I could use it without using my reading glasses to pluck eyebrows.  I got this new one because the old one got scratched and the goose neck version is no longer available. So bottom line is that the mirror itself is great but the wobbly stand is not!  It&#x27;s pretty pricey, too.  This is a disappointment.  Bring back the goose neck!</li>
            <li> love this mirror....although unweildy, I travel with it, have give to my daughter, etc...wonderful product....is there a travel size?  thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these from Merle Norman in 1997.  It has gone with me on every vacation and I can&#x27;t believe it hasn&#x27;t even broken, but it is showing signs of wear. I actually left it behind in a hotel once and retrieved it a few weeks later.  It was worth going out of my way to pick it up.  Wall units are nice for makeup, but I like to be able to check out my hair from behind, so it has a dual purpose.  I&#x27;m ordering another to keep in my camper.  Take care in cleaning it.  Don&#x27;t spray cleaner directly onto the mirror, spray it onto a cloth.  Although the directions say to use only water and a cloth.  My daughter loves my mirror too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how valuable this mirror is to me for putting on make-up, plucking hairs, etc. I think it&#x27;s one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made. Thank-you!</li>
            <li> The clarity of the mirror is perfect, however, I think because I&#x27;m so nearsighted I have to get right on top of the mirror for it to be clear.  I can basically see only one eye at a time as I get dizzy unless I&#x27;m about 1 inch from the mirror.  I&#x27;m keeping it, but wish I could see 2 eyes at the same time without being dizzy.</li>
            <li> I have used this mirror for 20+ years and it is a must for doing anything to your face if you require glasses.  So worth the price. I had to replace mine because I forgot that this mirror can only be cleaned with soap and water.  Made in Kansas.  Love buying USA.  I just would have liked for Amazon to make it easier to find, I did many searches without success.  Found it by searching big eyes.</li>
            <li> Have needed glasses in order to apply makeup which turned out to be pretty messy. With magic focus can apply makeup without the glasses and do a professional job and look great.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing mirror I&#x27;ve ever used. Acrylic and not glass, optically perfect and great for traveling because it comes apart making it easy to pack.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Best mirror out I have ever used. If you are having issues seeing up close stand back cause this will help you.</li>
            <li> This is the best mirror ever made. It is optically correct for every user.&lt;br /&gt;Just lean in to your desired level of clarity and voila perfect vision.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> best makeup mirror ever made</li>
            <li> This brand is the best you can buy!  Whether you buy a model with little or big mirror surface, your image is always in focus - no fuzzy spots.</li>
            <li> Great. Big. For the eyes. It worketh.</li>
            <li> The best magnifying mirror I have ever owned. The 5X magnifier is so helpful. I would strongly recommend that everyone should own one of these mirrors.</li>
            <li> LOVE these mirrors.  I found out they were going out of business and ordered several.  It&#x27;s the only way I can see to put on makeup without wearing glasses.  Too bad they could not stay in business because it&#x27;s a really great product!!</li>
            <li> pricey but worth every penny ,light, can be removed from the stand for hand held no distortion super crisp and clear</li>
            <li> Have the Big Eye for myself and purchased this one as a gift.  It arrived in good time and in perfect condition.  This is the best magnifying mirror without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I cannot see without my eye glasses and with the Magic Focus mirror I can do eye make-up, do eyebrows and so much more at closer view.  What is especially nice is that the mirror does not distort your image at all.</li>
