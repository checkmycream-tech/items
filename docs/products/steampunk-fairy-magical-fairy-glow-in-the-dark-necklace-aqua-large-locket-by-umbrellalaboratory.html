            <li>Beautiful, but for some reason I thought it was going to be antiqued silver-tone.</li>

            <li>Very pretty I loved it</li>
            <li>Looked darker in the photos but it looks more like a you bronze.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like it better if it was darker or silver colored.</li>
            <li>If you are having second thoughts, trust me its the perfect gift for someone</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just what i ordered, and it looks so lovely.</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift but wanted to keep it for myself because it was so lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love the design and metal, but the glowing inside</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still lovely.</li>
            <li>Good value, very secure and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>So pretty and glows brightly...</li>
            <li>Would have been a really great gift for my 13 year old cousin, however the locket arrived damaged with no time to return.  </li>
            <li>BUT , there is a defect  when I put it to the light it immediately started glowing pretty bright to  .</li>
            <li>great buy, shouldn&#x27;t open, leads to temptation of touching glowing stuff inside.</li>
            <li>Hold it in strong light for a minute and it glows.</li>
            <li>Quickly charged, just hold it to a light!</li>
            <li>but it just looks too cheap.</li>
            <li>After holding it up to the light, it glows just like what the picture shows.</li>
            <li>Put flashlight right on it for several minutes and produced incredible glow.</li>
            <li>isnt as luminescent as the pic - but it still is super cool, love it</li>
            <li>LOVE this thing, glows very very well.</li>
            <li>Really cool item.</li>
            <li>Its brass color really makes it look more steampunk.</li>
            <li>I love this necklace, the color is as vibrant as the picture shows.</li>
            <li>the right size and just the right fit for my neck.</li>
            <li>Works and looks exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very pleased with both the product and the speed of delivery; would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to get something with a unique twist.</li>
            <li>It glows really well (not to mention, I absolutely adore the color) and looks incredibly stylish even when not lit up.</li>
            <li>but it is still a pretty cool looking necklace</li>
            <li>Such a shame since it&#x27;s a nice piece otherwise.</li>
            <li>at first opening it is very nice and pretty cool the way it glows in the dark  </li>
            <li>Exactly how it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>But the glow fades after a few minutes or so and needs to be exposed to strong light again.</li>
            <li>I also really like the chain length.</li>
            <li>and it really works</li>
            <li>This product definitely glows like the picture shows after it has been charged in the light.</li>
            <li>But I expected that, so I was okay with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I think I need a different light than what I have been trying.</li>
            <li>everyone wants to know were</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ordering one, unless you&#x27;re willing to live with a defective product.</li>
            <li>Just to be clear this glows as show in the picture for about 2 minutes after being exposed to light, particularly black light (UV).  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and did stay lit up for longer than I expected it would!</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 9 year old niece.</li>
            <li>Probably wouldn&#x27;t wear it myself as an adult.</li>
            <li>Just a few moments under a light</li>
            <li>Wow is all i hear when i were this necklace...</li>
            <li>The metal is nice, but the picture is false advertising.</li>
            <li>The outer engravings remind me a little of the original StarGate.</li>
            <li>But I am thinking of rigging mine with a flat LED light and flat watch battery instead of relying on the glow in the dark stuff.</li>
            <li>It shows through and makes the design appear inconsistent when in the light, and only provides partial glow from the bit of area that isn&#x27;t burnt when in the dark.</li>

            <li> I like the piece itself, but I expected it to actually be put together well</li>
            <li> Its bigger than a US quarter but smaller than a Kennedy half dollar.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the gold finish is starting to fade after having it for a few months.</li>
            <li> The inside is coated with glow in the dark stuff no different than any child&#x27;s toy.</li>
            <li> Only half of it glowed.</li>
            <li> The charm is just a little bit bigger than the coin.</li>
            <li> These darker areas were noticeable even when the locket was closed.  </li>
            <li> A bit flimsy but expected that.</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers here, I received a pendant with burnt areas in the glow-in-the-dark material that&#x27;s inside the locket.</li>
            <li> These dark areas would not fluoresce.</li>
            <li> The glow shines even when its not all that dark.</li>
            <li> I received this and the half the glow in the dark plastic inside is burned and orange</li>
            <li> so I opened it and half of the rubberie substance was discolored  dark brown  and will not glow at all ...  </li>
            <li> then I notice one half of it wouldn&#x27;t charge</li>
            <li> This is soooo small compared to what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very small.</li>
            <li> The glowing aspect is a where its a little bit of a fail.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

            <li> I love this necklace, the color is as vibrant as the picture shows. I just set the necklace in the window before I wear it out and it glows brightly. Wonderful buy.</li>
            <li> Would have been a really great gift for my 13 year old cousin, however the locket arrived damaged with no time to return.  The glow material was really dark in places, particularly near the edges, perhaps from rust. These dark areas would not fluoresce. These darker areas were noticeable even when the locket was closed.

            <li> I received this wonderful necklace for Christmas. It glows really well (not to mention, I absolutely adore the color) and looks incredibly stylish even when not lit up. I also really like the chain length.</li>
            <li> Looked darker in the photos but it looks more like a you bronze. I&#x27;d like it better if it was darker or silver colored. I read all the mixed reviewed and figured I&#x27;d try it. I wear a lot of costume jewelry and compliments. I like the glow and it really works but it just looks too cheap. Gave it to friends daughter.</li>
            <li> This necklace is BEAUTIFUL. Exactly how it looks in the picture. It glows so bright still and I&#x27;ve had it for a while. It even survived showers and swimming in a chlorine pool. The glow shines even when its not all that dark. This is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought online.</li>
            <li> i was just scrolling through when i saw this necklace and i didnt have any money at the time so i just added it to my wish list and it was a while before i could buy it. When i got enough money i bought it. Shipping was fast and it was just perfect. the right size and just the right fit for my neck. The charm is just a little bit bigger than the coin. If you are having second thoughts, trust me its the perfect gift for someone or you could keep it for yourself i would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Very cute necklace!  Arrived quickly and did stay lit up for longer than I expected it would!</li>
            <li> Thought it was bigger. It&#x27;s very very small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just what i ordered, and it looks so lovely. i&#x27;m very pleased with both the product and the speed of delivery; would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to get something with a unique twist.</li>
            <li> Very pretty,my Daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> Really cool item. Its bigger than a US quarter but smaller than a Kennedy half dollar. It is a brass color. Totally not gold. Its brass color really makes it look more steampunk. The outer engravings remind me a little of the original StarGate. The glowing aspect is a where its a little bit of a fail. This is basically a locket, which is hinged, and can open. (Don&#x27;t open as it is a bitch to try and close again.) The inside is coated with glow in the dark stuff no different than any child&#x27;s toy. Hold it in strong light for a minute and it glows. But the glow fades after a few minutes or so and needs to be exposed to strong light again. Even with its glowing flaw, people still ask me about it and comment on it every time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Cool conversation piece. But I am thinking of rigging mine with a flat LED light and flat watch battery instead of relying on the glow in the dark stuff.</li>
            <li> This product definitely glows like the picture shows after it has been charged in the light. The only thing is that it does disappear quite soon after that (like 5 minutes later). But I expected that, so I was okay with the purchase. I bought it for my 9 year old niece. Probably wouldn&#x27;t wear it myself as an adult.</li>
            <li> does not glow real good</li>
            <li> Purchased two for best friend 8 year olds. Put flashlight right on it for several minutes and produced incredible glow. Girls loved them. Cute Cute Cute! Fashion jewelry not heirloom so get a grip people.</li>
            <li> Only half of it glowed.</li>
            <li> So pretty and glows brightly...I gave this as a gift but wanted to keep it for myself because it was so lovely.  Thanks</li>
            <li> isnt as luminescent as the pic - but it still is super cool, love it</li>
            <li> Just to be clear this glows as show in the picture for about 2 minutes after being exposed to light, particularly black light (UV).  After that, the glow fades and it looks nothing like the picture.  The metal is nice, but the picture is false advertising.</li>
            <li> Smaller than a imagined</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and very magical looking. Quickly charged, just hold it to a light! Im glad to have bought it!</li>
            <li> I received this and the half the glow in the dark plastic inside is burned and orange so it won&#x27;t actually glow! I like the piece itself, but I expected it to actually be put together well and I wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> great buy, shouldn&#x27;t open, leads to temptation of touching glowing stuff inside.</li>
            <li> I got this necklace for my girlfriend because she seems to like this style of jewelry .. at first opening it is very nice and pretty cool the way it glows in the dark  BUT , there is a defect  when I put it to the light it immediately started glowing pretty bright to  . then I notice one half of it wouldn&#x27;t charge so I opened it and half of the rubberie substance was discolored  dark brown  and will not glow at all ...  so I kinda feel like I got jipped for the money I paid .. but it is still a pretty cool looking necklace</li>
            <li> This is soooo small compared to what I hoped for. Not much bigger than a quarter plus a short chain. I love the design and metal, but the glowing inside doesn&#x27;t charge well or glow too bright.</li>
            <li> I like this but have not figured out how to get it to glow! I think I need a different light than what I have been trying. In any case, it is attractive and so Steampunk!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, but for some reason I thought it was going to be antiqued silver-tone. It&#x27;s not (it&#x27;s bronze-y looking) but it&#x27;s still lovely.</li>
            <li> Just a few moments under a light and it glows for hours. I get many compliments on this beautiful locket.</li>
            <li> Works and looks exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> Very pretty I loved it</li>
            <li> The gel inside the locket was corroded. Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> A bit flimsy but expected that. Good value, very secure and fast delivery! A+!</li>
            <li> LOVE this thing, glows very very well. Only problem is the gold finish is starting to fade after having it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Wow is all i hear when i were this necklace... everyone wants to know were i got it....it glows so bright</li>
            <li> This necklace is very cool! After holding it up to the light, it glows just like what the picture shows. My pre-teen daughter really liked it!</li>

It shows through and makes the design appear inconsistent when in the light, and only provides partial glow from the bit of area that isn&#x27;t burnt when in the dark. Seems like a problem with their manufacturing process and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend ordering one, unless you&#x27;re willing to live with a defective product. Such a shame since it&#x27;s a nice piece otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love the way the pendant glows and its the perfect size. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that you can&#x27;t put a picture in it without blocking out the glow.</li>
