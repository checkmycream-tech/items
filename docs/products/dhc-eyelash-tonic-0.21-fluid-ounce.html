    <ol>
            <li> it is ok. little help</li>
            <li> I liked the applicator, and the product went on smoothly but very thinly.  I had to continuously brush to get a good amount on, and then it felt like something was in my eyes all day, even after trying to flush it out with water.  I will not use again or recommend.</li>
            <li> Japanese products, especially DHC from Japan are the BEST...</li>
            <li> Shipped faster than I  expected with a  surprise paper crane! Haven&#x27;t used it but I buy DHC products a lot and they all works well.</li>
            <li> I use it about twice a day and have been for about three weeks.  I learned early on to be careful not to get it in my eye.  It will burn a little. Nothing major though.  Don&#x27;t know if it is doing anything.  I am withholding judgement until I finish the tube.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are long but they&#x27;re so thin. They fall out really easily.&lt;br /&gt;With this eyelash tonic they stay moisturized so my eyelashes become stronger and don&#x27;t fall out that easily anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I love it, it works just perfect for me. Fyi, I wear no makeup on daily basis, so I don&#x27;t know if you could put on a coat of mascara over it. And it does make your upper lash line a little (just very very little) oily. So I guess that means..no liquid liner?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure because I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday. But for nighttime, or without makeup, this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Meh. Doesn&#x27;t cost much, doesn&#x27;t do much. No love lost, but none won either.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect, but I love DHC products and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I&#x27;m a sucker for anything that claims to make my eyelashes longer or thicker, I can&#x27;t help myself. Well, I did NOT expect for it to work so well! My eyelashes are noticeably longer and it looks like I have more of them growing...no idea how this stuff works, or why, but I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;ve even started using it on my sparse eyebrows and it&#x27;s making them grow thicker. Such a pleasant surprise to find a product that does what it promises!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 2 months now, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the amount of lashes I had or any new growth, but I did notice that my lashes seem longer and fall out less. They also seem a lot healthier.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This is the best stuff you can buy. I love DHC and will continue to keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect when I bought this product. I bought it because I needed an eyelash tonic and it was a good price. I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now and I already see a good amount of growth. I use it on my top and bottom eyelashes and it makes it thicker and longer. My bottom lashes use to grow in every direction but now it&#x27;s noticeably longer and it&#x27;s not growing in every direction. I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> My lashes did get a bit longer! Cheap and effective!</li>
            <li> This is a great high quality product.</li>
            <li> It is like only half of the origin size...</li>
            <li> There are no directions in English! I&#x27;m going to try using it 2x a day like other brands. So far I&#x27;ve only used it once and have had no problems. I&#x27;ll update this later if I can, and hope I&#x27;ll be ab le to give it 5 stars since my lashes are so sparse and short from chemotherapy/age.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet, but it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch. I&#x27;m a die hard DHC fan :)</li>
            <li> dont know if its just my impression, my eyelash did get longer... try it. wont not regret. im kinda obcess with it actually...</li>
            <li> the price is good. I just started to use it, so I cannot tell if it is really working. but it seems like it would work</li>
            <li> First off, I have very unruly curly lashes and the results were rewarding. I used for two weeks straight, day and night, and this product actually made my lashes less chaotic and darker. This is definitely a tonic I&#x27;ll be re-buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHC products for years! High quality products and don&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes. The DHC Eyelash Tonic seems to keep my lashes from falling out and they are also getting longer. You can visibly see the new grow on the lashes.</li>
