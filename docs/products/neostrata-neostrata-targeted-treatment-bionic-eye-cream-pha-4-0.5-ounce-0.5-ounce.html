            <li>I am still looking for that magic bullet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING it promises, instead I feel it gives me more lines and dries my eyes.</li>

            <li>I love Neostrata products - have been using the Smoothing cream for years</li>
            <li>I have used it for 6 moths and love it</li>
            <li>It was available!  </li>
            <li>I loved I appreciated</li>
            <li>love this cream as it is totally not irritating to my eyes</li>
            <li>I had great hopes for this product after reading other reviews however I didn&#x60;t think it was that exceptional have used many eye creams &amp; would consider this very average</li>
            <li>It really help with the fine lines and bags.</li>
            <li>Good quality as expected</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>

            <li>This product does help with wrinkles but it is not the magic eraser of dark circles some might lead you to believe.</li>

            <li>but I do not see a change in puffiness, which was my main reason for purchasing it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Conversely, I also use glycolic face wash and bionic high potency cream - and I noticed an immediate benefit from and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The puffiness and dark circles are almost gone, I love this product so much I am considering buying future skin care products.</li>
            <li>and I am not allowed to put anything on my face until the skin under my eyes is completely clear and normal.</li>
            <li>When asked how she looked so young</li>
            <li>I have used neostrata face cream plus for several years and have never had a reaction to that, so this cream must either be much stronger or have something in it that I reacted to.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves the skin under the eyes really soft.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, noticed an improve in under eye swelling in the first few days.  </li>
            <li>it is all lies I expected too much from it</li>

            <li> great product and good price</li>
            <li> A great product, recommended by our dermatologist.</li>

            <li> Circles and bags disappeared within a couple of weeks.  Change was remarkable.  Will continue as a must have product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do ANYTHING it promises, instead I feel it gives me more lines and dries my eyes. And the dark circles? DID NOTHING! I wasn&#x27;t noticing any difference so I started using it with another eye cream that doesn&#x27;t address dark circles and the other one did a much better. I would put one cream on one eye and the other on the other eye to compare. After about a week, you could see the difference. The one with the neostrata bionic eye cream looked much worse. &amp;#62;:/</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t worth the the money, not better than cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I have been using it since last February (for 8 months), I can tell that there is a decline in the appearance of black circles under my eyes. I tried many products, but this one was the most helpful one. They are not gone by %100, but it certainly helps.</li>

            <li> this eye cream is the top o the line, everybody should get it. Helps the puffy eyes to contract and lines disappear</li>
            <li> This eye cream actually does work.  I am always skeptical, but this product delivers!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while but I do not see a change in puffiness, which was my main reason for purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this 3 times.  I think I see a little difference, at least more than with any other cream.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and my mom loved it. Shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> My dark circles have lightened.  I am quite happy with this product.  I&#x27;m using it both morning and night.  Great!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, noticed an improve in under eye swelling in the first few days.  Looking forward to more results in the weeks to follow.</li>
            <li> I love Neostrata products - have been using the Smoothing cream for years and my skin is still beautiful at my advanced age.  I have used this Bionic Eye Cream however, and I don&#x27;t see an improvement and I&#x27;ve used two tubes.  Sorry!</li>
            <li> Good quality as expected</li>
            <li> Does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream! Great price!</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and I love Neo Strata products overall.  I am not sure that this particular product is doing much for me. While it is moisturizing, I have been using it twice daily for several months and I cant see any improvement in the eye area.  Conversely, I also use glycolic face wash and bionic high potency cream - and I noticed an immediate benefit from and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I loved I appreciated</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, sorry</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of this product.  It has eliminated my dark circles and as a bonus my eyelashes are longer and thicker too!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell one bit of difference.</li>
            <li> It really help with the fine lines and bags. Also makes my dark circles less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it. Good way to spend money.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and shortly after using the cream the skin under my eyes got puffy and red. My dermatologist recommended I try it out and use it every other day to have my skin get used to it but my skin continued to react to it. Wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> Disappointing . Did not work.</li>
            <li> This cream did not work on me at all  as I ordered it bec of its rating it is all lies I expected too much from it</li>
            <li> I saw Cher interviewed on T V. When asked how she looked so young she gave credit to this cream. I have used it for 6 moths and love it it lasts a long time. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this product after reading other reviews however I didn&#x60;t think it was that exceptional have used many eye creams &amp; would consider this very average</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to my wife about three months ago. According to her  no good result were observed so far. .</li>
            <li> great product, arrived on time</li>
            <li> This is a great line of products and the eye cream does not disappoint!  I also love the vendor I purchased it from!</li>
            <li> I had a severe reaction to this after using it for 3 nights.  For 3 weeks after, I experienced severe redness and swelling in the area under both eyes where I applied it.  I had to see a dermatologist twice since my eyes were almost swollen shut.  Only a very strong steroid ointment helped it to go away.  I have used neostrata face cream plus for several years and have never had a reaction to that, so this cream must either be much stronger or have something in it that I reacted to.  Please be aware that this can happen.  My doctor had me throw it away and I am not allowed to put anything on my face until the skin under my eyes is completely clear and normal.</li>
            <li> love this cream as it is totally not irritating to my eyes</li>
            <li> I first tried this product as a sample giftbox from Birchbox.  I loved it.  I went on-line to see if I could order it through Amazon.  It was available!  When I received the product, it did not look the same when I dispensed it from the tube.  It was discolored, looking more yellow than the sample I had originally tried.  It does not seem to work as well as the sample did either.  I am disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the NeoStrata eyecream for years. It gives you the hydration and exfoliation that you need without spending a fortune. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 so I don&#x27;t know how this affects wrinkles but i can assure you that it brightens dark circles. It also leaves the skin under the eyes really soft. I buy different creams all the time and I think this one has been the best so far !</li>
            <li> This eye cream is amazing!  I have tried everything and nothing seems to take away puffiness under my eyes like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;A fancy plastic surgeons office reccomended it but I found it on amazon for a better price!</li>
            <li> A very good product that was recommended by my doctor.</li>
