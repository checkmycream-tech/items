            <li> works well, travels too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for doterra oils</li>
            <li> a little difficult to remove roller ball</li>
            <li> These are decent little roller bottles, they shipped very quickly and arrived packaged well. They seems to be fairly decent at rolling, one or two are a bit sluggish at rolling but that may be due to a lemongrass blend in it? I did receive my droppers as well they are  handy, though I am sure if one needed these they would buy them in bulk as they are quite flimsy. They also do not seems to leak, I store them on their side in a case and have not had any leaks, so I plan to start carrying one in my purse.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Quick service and item was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> These clear roll on bottles will work great for essential oil blends that will be used up quickly. (Essential oils need to be in darkened bottles to prolong shelf life.)  Since I&#x27;m new to  essential oils, I didn&#x27;t take the need for dark bottles into consideration when I ordered these.  The bottles themselves are well made, and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll find another use for them.</li>
            <li> These roller bottles have made it so easy to fix essential oils to use instead of perfumes. They are easy to assemble after filling. Packaging &amp; shipping was perfect.</li>
            <li> These work great! No mess at all!</li>
            <li> Well there&#x27;s not much to say about this product except that they are exactly what they are supposed to be. The quality of the bottles is fine, roller ball seems to roll pretty evenly. The roller ball fits snug, and to take it out you just slip your fingernails in the crack and pull up. The caps screw on fine. I haven&#x27;t experienced any leaking, but if I do in the future I will update this review. Overall, very satisfied with my order!</li>
            <li> Great buy. They are perfect for my oil mixtures.</li>
            <li> I had wanted and ordered clear bottles, the ones I received were blue.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was cracked when I opened them.</li>
            <li> Love these! I bought them to mix up my essential oils for on the go. They arrived quickly and as described. I love how they came with pipettes to measure out oils and such. They are the perfect size to pop into your purse or store at the office. The rollerball attachment is easy to place into the glass bottle, and works great when rolled onto the skin. There is no stopping or skipping with the rollerball when in use. The glass bottle is made from thick glass, and doesn&#x27;t break when dropped, even on a hard surface. The cap screws on tightly, with no leaks or mess. Highly recommend these bottles for all your beauty or oil needs.</li>
            <li> I use these for essential oil blends that I keep in my purse and for use at home. They are perfect, have never leaked, and I can label with vinyl decals without any peeling.</li>
            <li> Great! everything arrive great!</li>
