            <li>I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It worked great</li>
            <li>the dome shape might work great on finer hair as well as on ear hair.</li>
            <li>Great litte nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this 10+ times and it works great on my nose -</li>
            <li>but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work great.</li>
            <li>I got a Panasonic that works great</li>
            <li>Works great, cuts hair, it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out.  </li>
            <li>One of the best nose hair clippers, does not pull and cuts amazingly.</li>
            <li>(Great price too.)</li>
            <li>Great looking design and feels sturdy.  </li>
            <li>For the price its an attractive buy.</li>
            <li>Works great for ears, nose and eye brows.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s extremely attractively priced (can you imagine spending $30-$40 bucks to cut nose hair)?</li>
            <li>This is a great item.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Great item for the price.</li>
            <li>My son said they worked great.  </li>
            <li>Really great item.</li>
            <li>Shipping was great as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this and tried it thinking Wahl was a good brand.  </li>
            <li>Wahl seems to have good product.  </li>
            <li>Does its job and was a good price.</li>
            <li>All in all - good deal for the money.</li>
            <li>If you put your thumb on the slide lever and push - good luck.  </li>
            <li>good stuff, reliable, dependable.</li>
            <li>I bought this because Wahl is supposedly a good brand name for trimming hair.  </li>
            <li>this item worked as advertised and was shipped on time in a good manner.</li>
            <li>rides and getting along fairly well.  </li>
            <li>so I guess they must work good for them.</li>
            <li>He has the \\&quot;Manx cat syndrome\\&quot; and the clipper is the perfect solution to keeping him neat and clean.</li>
            <li>After about 4 months of use, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>he said it works great and would recommend for sure..</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my Wahl nose and ear trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>great product, I am very glad to have him, is the best and original, thanks for the sale</li>
            <li>Cheaply made but does the job and great price</li>
            <li>Uses a rechargeable battery with no problem, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I cannot honestly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very happy, he uses this very often.</li>
            <li>Which will require some kind of tool to pry out.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and recommend to friends.the two separate pieces are awesome.</li>
            <li>He liked it alot</li>
            <li>got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband and he liked it..</li>
            <li>liked the way of working and effectiveness</li>
            <li>I need something to keep me looking neat and tidy.</li>
            <li>far, this has been the best rotary-head trimmer I&#x27;ve owned, and at an almost unbeatable price!  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I find the mustache trimmer suitable for trimming my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This Wahl trimmer is better, but has its own issues.  </li>
            <li>Have a great day right now</li>
            <li>The price was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>It seems very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Fast, easy, profgessional, all very good stuff</li>
            <li>I appreciate it so light super happy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering two more just in case....</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok for me</li>
            <li>I am satisfied</li>
            <li>I used one of these for several years and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It was ok, but I replaced it with a Panasonic which in my opinion is much better product.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow trimmer works OK, but as a nose and ear hair trimmer, this product is horrid.  </li>
            <li>It worked much better.  </li>
            <li>Word to the wiser, either save your money, or invest in a better product.</li>
            <li>His nose is as bald on the inside, as his head is on top.</li>
            <li>I was expecting better performance</li>
            <li>Although it satisfies my need, it takes more time.</li>
            <li>The circular clippers are much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the protective cap because when you remove it, the top part comes off with it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Wahl needs to work on making a more efficient motor for these things.</li>
            <li>Everything was there in the package and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It works very well and the price was just right-Thanks for the great deal.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I might should have invested more and got a plugin model for more power.  </li>
            <li>But this will be okay.  </li>
            <li>My husbands favorite razor was a wahl</li>
            <li>so when I saw this I knew he would love it</li>
            <li>and he does, it works better than others.</li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Save your money and put it toward a better made model.  </li>
            <li>and I hope it is very useful!</li>
            <li>This cuts very cleanly and thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job, but feels flimsy.</li>
            <li>After all this long, this product is still holding up great!!</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to snap on and off the nose and brow trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and has a 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li>Most important (to me), the rotary head cuts painlessly when trimming nose hair.  </li>
            <li>So far great results.</li>
            <li>You really have to work this around to get good results.</li>
            <li>My package arrived quickly recommend it highly efficient and perfect packaging weighs nothing to send him thank you very much</li>
            <li>and I can choose to use rechargeable or non-rechargeable and can easily acquire a replacement battery while I am traveling.</li>
            <li>I suppose it would be easy to review a nose trimmer</li>
            <li>The heads are easy to attach &amp; detach.</li>
            <li>This particular brand has always been good to me.</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>It arrived fine and on time &amp; works as described.</li>
            <li>Besides not being rechargeable this works just fine.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply constructed and feels cheap when you hold it in your hand</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer, but the nose hair round attachment is awesome.</li>
            <li>My dog hates the sound of it, but it gets the job done...</li>
            <li>Cheap is cheap.</li>
            <li>I will definitely enjoy using this item</li>
            <li>Light &amp; portable, would recommend.</li>
            <li>I works great and is supper quiet.</li>
            <li>So far so good-</li>
            <li>So far so good,</li>
            <li>Very useful for this cheap price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I know exactly how many of them I&#x27;ve purchased.    </li>
            <li>This should not have the name “Wahl” attached, but it&#x27;s not a bad cheap trimmer.</li>
            <li>Feels a bit cheaper than my original SHAPER IMAGE</li>
            <li>The small Wahl clipper is perfect for shaving my Manx cat&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>so I could rinse it clean.  </li>
            <li>Works well and is super cheap.  </li>
            <li>of course not rechargeable but blade rpm is adequate... feels cheap but sturdy in hand...</li>
            <li>The nose trimmer I found useful and working all right, an OK product.</li>
            <li>and so that my Grandsons will likely someday also have good trimmers....</li>
            <li>Better than those so called nose straight razors that don&#x27;t catch hairs.</li>
            <li>And at $9 if it last me a year,  I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for ear and nose hairs, not very useful for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Best nose-hair cutter I&#x27;ve ever bought (and I have bought several over the last 10 years).  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>The 2nd one works just as good as the first one</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>trimmer is totally worth</li>
            <li>worth buying and trying</li>
            <li>The Panasonic has a better built, except it had one very major deal breaker problem.</li>
            <li>If you are buying it for the nose hair trimmer and do not mind taking your time, then this product is right for you.</li>
            <li>price is right for what it promises.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They went right into the trash.  </li>
            <li>This one is much more powerful and actually does the job as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Nice and small for easy storage anywhere</li>
            <li>It came to me very fast and it&#x27;s excatly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It pulls and gave me watery eyes after first stop.</li>
            <li>It was also pretty durable, as it got knocked around the bathroom drawer and put in and out of bags and suitcases for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Love how quiet it</li>
            <li>Just starting using it it so perhaps with more use, I&#x27;ll notice the difference.  </li>
            <li>will be back to buy more</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does...</li>
            <li>It works better than the others I have had, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I bought a few, they do good</li>
            <li>I was surprised as I am very happy with my other Wahl beard trimmer, but this nose trimmer did not work properly.  </li>
            <li>This one cuts clean with no pulling so far.</li>
            <li>The cover and heads fit tightly, yet attach/detach easily.  </li>
            <li>It is silent and non-abrasive and runs on a AA battery which is easily replaced.</li>
            <li>Does what is supposed too, simple &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>Had one like this before, and this new and improved version seems much better than the one I got several years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the blade is just a little too protected by the cover to be really effective.</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still using the taped up Wahl because it still works very well.</li>
            <li>that work very well.</li>
            <li>It lives up to its name and at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>and I really like the hair pulling</li>
            <li>/&gt;Couple of things which might help you in your decision:&lt;br /&gt;The cutter mechanism on this one is a straight cylinder with fast rotating blades.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>For under $10 this is really the thing.</li>
            <li>But this trimmer is not so useful as the old one.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a very desirable attribute, as you know if you&#x27;ve ever owned an inferior trimmer that PULLS hairs out</li>
            <li>This Wahl doesn&#x27;t take up much space, in cabinet or luggage.</li>
            <li>You have to put your thumb at the very bottom of the switch and push up.  </li>
            <li>It does what&#x27;s supposed to do at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Trimmer works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t at all.  </li>
            <li>This one is cheap and tinny, doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to the skin.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that the switch on mine is very sensitive and easily turned on if placed in a bag--</li>
            <li>Light weight and seems to run a long time on the battery.</li>
            <li>Is super simple!</li>
            <li>I had a cheaper version that didn&#x27;t last but actually trimmed better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While plain looking, the trimmer and attachments appear of good quality, especially considering the sub-$10 price.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, if mine ever breaks or gets lost I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>There is really little more to say about this...it works.</li>
            <li>It works with one hand okay as long as you don&#x27;t do the obvious.  </li>
            <li>(would give it five stars if it worked the way slide switches normally work).</li>
            <li>Pretty basic I&#x27;m thinking, so it&#x27;s just very ineffective.</li>
            <li>What can one say about a nose and ear trimmer other than either &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t&amp;#34; --- this one works just fine</li>
            <li>When I lost it, searched for new one.</li>
            <li>live and learn....</li>
            <li>It broke after a few uses- very cheap- spend a little more to get one that will last longer than three uses!</li>
            <li>The first one was made in eastern Europe, the second one in China</li>
            <li>I bought this to complete the package since there was no ear/nose attachment with my new groomer.</li>
            <li>and I found that the cylinder type cutting mechanism of this unit provides a much faster, easier, pleasant, no pain</li>
            <li>Works just as well as other wahl nose trimmers I&#x27;ve used, but it gets really hot really fast.  </li>
            <li>Works well just a little light duty feeling compared to my old Wahl.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a cutting edge product.</li>
            <li>no pulling, completely painless.    </li>
            <li>My old one was water proof</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s as far as I went.</li>
            <li>This Wahl trimmer is by far the simplest and easiest to operate.  </li>
            <li>Brand name does not always mean better.  </li>
            <li>It is small, lightweight, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, it is not as powerful and as sharp as the Con-Air brand that I lost.</li>
            <li>Not typical for Wahl products.</li>
            <li>Sadly, his father passed away in March from double pnuemonia,  I only knew he used it on his eyebrows a couple times and said they worked great.</li>
            <li>The power button is very sensitive; I accidentally left it on and didn&#x27;t realize it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different brands before, and they&#x27;ve mostly been pretty lame.  </li>
            <li>I may be dumber than most, but I can&#x27;t find the use of the brow trimmer, either mine doesn&#x27;t work or I&#x27;m too dumb to figure it out.</li>
            <li>I reverted back to the personal trimmer we normally use.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer worked fairly well, but was a little loud and somewhat inconvenient because you had to switch the heads back and forth to get the right angle.</li>
            <li>Battery life is a tad shorter than I expected, my first battery lasted 3 months; I don&#x27;t mind as long as it cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t exchanged gifts in many years, but this past year we&#x27;ve been helping each other with medical appt.</li>
            <li>Dont expct it will last too much, but gets the job done, no hair pulling or other issues</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not minor.  </li>
            <li>Not much more exciting stuff to say.</li>
            <li>It turned on once, but after only rarely and only after a round of vigorous shaking / slamming.  </li>
            <li>Not a great product, especially if you compare it with earlier, more solidly built models.</li>
            <li>With the Panasonic ER-GN30-K it took many more more painful tries to accomplish the same task as the cutting head either did not end up getting the hairs or pull them...</li>
            <li>Very neat little device.  </li>

            <li> Everything is perfect!</li>
            <li> When I stumbled on this it seemed too perfect!  </li>
            <li> Great Deal!!!</li>
            <li> The product is very good as it does the work and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it... and the price was very fair.</li>
            <li> For the purpose it does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> 100% satisfecho, very good.</li>
            <li> All good!</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It worked great</li>
            <li> the dome shape might work great on finer hair as well as on ear hair.</li>
            <li> Great litte nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 10+ times and it works great on my nose -</li>
            <li> but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work great.</li>
            <li> I got a Panasonic that works great</li>
            <li> Works great, cuts hair, it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out.  </li>
            <li> One of the best nose hair clippers, does not pull and cuts amazingly.</li>
            <li> (Great price too.)</li>
            <li> Great looking design and feels sturdy.  </li>
            <li> For the price its an attractive buy.</li>
            <li> Works great for ears, nose and eye brows.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely attractively priced (can you imagine spending $30-$40 bucks to cut nose hair)?</li>
            <li> This is a great item.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great item for the price.</li>
            <li> My son said they worked great.  </li>
            <li> Really great item.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this and tried it thinking Wahl was a good brand.  </li>
            <li> Wahl seems to have good product.  </li>
            <li> Does its job and was a good price.</li>
            <li> All in all - good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> If you put your thumb on the slide lever and push - good luck.  </li>
            <li> good stuff, reliable, dependable.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Wahl is supposedly a good brand name for trimming hair.  </li>
            <li> this item worked as advertised and was shipped on time in a good manner.</li>
            <li> rides and getting along fairly well.  </li>
            <li> so I guess they must work good for them.</li>
            <li> He has the \\&quot;Manx cat syndrome\\&quot; and the clipper is the perfect solution to keeping him neat and clean.</li>
            <li> After about 4 months of use, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> he said it works great and would recommend for sure..</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Wahl nose and ear trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li> great product, I am very glad to have him, is the best and original, thanks for the sale</li>
            <li> Cheaply made but does the job and great price</li>
            <li> Uses a rechargeable battery with no problem, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I cannot honestly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very happy, he uses this very often.</li>
            <li> Which will require some kind of tool to pry out.  </li>
            <li> I really like it and recommend to friends.the two separate pieces are awesome.</li>
            <li> He liked it alot</li>
            <li> got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband and he liked it..</li>
            <li> liked the way of working and effectiveness</li>
            <li> I need something to keep me looking neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> far, this has been the best rotary-head trimmer I&#x27;ve owned, and at an almost unbeatable price!  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I find the mustache trimmer suitable for trimming my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Wahl trimmer is better, but has its own issues.  </li>
            <li> Have a great day right now</li>
            <li> The price was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> It seems very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Fast, easy, profgessional, all very good stuff</li>
            <li> I appreciate it so light super happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering two more just in case....</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok for me</li>
            <li> I am satisfied</li>
            <li> I used one of these for several years and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but I replaced it with a Panasonic which in my opinion is much better product.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow trimmer works OK, but as a nose and ear hair trimmer, this product is horrid.  </li>
            <li> It worked much better.  </li>
            <li> Word to the wiser, either save your money, or invest in a better product.</li>
            <li> His nose is as bald on the inside, as his head is on top.</li>
            <li> I was expecting better performance</li>
            <li> Although it satisfies my need, it takes more time.</li>
            <li> The circular clippers are much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the protective cap because when you remove it, the top part comes off with it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Wahl needs to work on making a more efficient motor for these things.</li>
            <li> Everything was there in the package and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It works very well and the price was just right-Thanks for the great deal.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I might should have invested more and got a plugin model for more power.  </li>
            <li> But this will be okay.  </li>
            <li> My husbands favorite razor was a wahl</li>
            <li> so when I saw this I knew he would love it</li>
            <li> and he does, it works better than others.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Save your money and put it toward a better made model.  </li>
            <li> and I hope it is very useful!</li>
            <li> This cuts very cleanly and thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job, but feels flimsy.</li>
            <li> After all this long, this product is still holding up great!!</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to snap on and off the nose and brow trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and has a 2 year warranty.  </li>
            <li> Most important (to me), the rotary head cuts painlessly when trimming nose hair.  </li>
            <li> So far great results.</li>
            <li> You really have to work this around to get good results.</li>
            <li> My package arrived quickly recommend it highly efficient and perfect packaging weighs nothing to send him thank you very much</li>
            <li> and I can choose to use rechargeable or non-rechargeable and can easily acquire a replacement battery while I am traveling.</li>
            <li> I suppose it would be easy to review a nose trimmer</li>
            <li> The heads are easy to attach &amp; detach.</li>
            <li> This particular brand has always been good to me.</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> It arrived fine and on time &amp; works as described.</li>
            <li> Besides not being rechargeable this works just fine.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply constructed and feels cheap when you hold it in your hand</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer, but the nose hair round attachment is awesome.</li>
            <li> My dog hates the sound of it, but it gets the job done...</li>
            <li> Cheap is cheap.</li>
            <li> I will definitely enjoy using this item</li>
            <li> Light &amp; portable, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I works great and is supper quiet.</li>
            <li> So far so good-</li>
            <li> So far so good,</li>
            <li> Very useful for this cheap price.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I know exactly how many of them I&#x27;ve purchased.    </li>
            <li> This should not have the name “Wahl” attached, but it&#x27;s not a bad cheap trimmer.</li>
            <li> Feels a bit cheaper than my original SHAPER IMAGE</li>
            <li> The small Wahl clipper is perfect for shaving my Manx cat&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> so I could rinse it clean.  </li>
            <li> Works well and is super cheap.  </li>
            <li> of course not rechargeable but blade rpm is adequate... feels cheap but sturdy in hand...</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer I found useful and working all right, an OK product.</li>
            <li> and so that my Grandsons will likely someday also have good trimmers....</li>
            <li> Better than those so called nose straight razors that don&#x27;t catch hairs.</li>
            <li> And at $9 if it last me a year,  I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for ear and nose hairs, not very useful for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Best nose-hair cutter I&#x27;ve ever bought (and I have bought several over the last 10 years).  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> The 2nd one works just as good as the first one</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> trimmer is totally worth</li>
            <li> worth buying and trying</li>
            <li> The Panasonic has a better built, except it had one very major deal breaker problem.</li>
            <li> If you are buying it for the nose hair trimmer and do not mind taking your time, then this product is right for you.</li>
            <li> price is right for what it promises.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They went right into the trash.  </li>
            <li> This one is much more powerful and actually does the job as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Nice and small for easy storage anywhere</li>
            <li> It came to me very fast and it&#x27;s excatly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It pulls and gave me watery eyes after first stop.</li>
            <li> It was also pretty durable, as it got knocked around the bathroom drawer and put in and out of bags and suitcases for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Love how quiet it</li>
            <li> Just starting using it it so perhaps with more use, I&#x27;ll notice the difference.  </li>
            <li> will be back to buy more</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does...</li>
            <li> It works better than the others I have had, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I bought a few, they do good</li>
            <li> I was surprised as I am very happy with my other Wahl beard trimmer, but this nose trimmer did not work properly.  </li>
            <li> This one cuts clean with no pulling so far.</li>
            <li> The cover and heads fit tightly, yet attach/detach easily.  </li>
            <li> It is silent and non-abrasive and runs on a AA battery which is easily replaced.</li>
            <li> Does what is supposed too, simple &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> Had one like this before, and this new and improved version seems much better than the one I got several years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the blade is just a little too protected by the cover to be really effective.</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still using the taped up Wahl because it still works very well.</li>
            <li> that work very well.</li>
            <li> It lives up to its name and at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> and I really like the hair pulling</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple of things which might help you in your decision:&lt;br /&gt;The cutter mechanism on this one is a straight cylinder with fast rotating blades.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> For under $10 this is really the thing.</li>
            <li> But this trimmer is not so useful as the old one.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a very desirable attribute, as you know if you&#x27;ve ever owned an inferior trimmer that PULLS hairs out</li>
            <li> This Wahl doesn&#x27;t take up much space, in cabinet or luggage.</li>
            <li> You have to put your thumb at the very bottom of the switch and push up.  </li>
            <li> It does what&#x27;s supposed to do at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t at all.  </li>
            <li> This one is cheap and tinny, doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to the skin.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the switch on mine is very sensitive and easily turned on if placed in a bag--</li>
            <li> Light weight and seems to run a long time on the battery.</li>
            <li> Is super simple!</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper version that didn&#x27;t last but actually trimmed better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While plain looking, the trimmer and attachments appear of good quality, especially considering the sub-$10 price.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, if mine ever breaks or gets lost I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> There is really little more to say about this...it works.</li>
            <li> It works with one hand okay as long as you don&#x27;t do the obvious.  </li>
            <li> (would give it five stars if it worked the way slide switches normally work).</li>
            <li> Pretty basic I&#x27;m thinking, so it&#x27;s just very ineffective.</li>
            <li> What can one say about a nose and ear trimmer other than either &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t&amp;#34; --- this one works just fine</li>
            <li> When I lost it, searched for new one.</li>
            <li> live and learn....</li>
            <li> It broke after a few uses- very cheap- spend a little more to get one that will last longer than three uses!</li>
            <li> The first one was made in eastern Europe, the second one in China</li>
            <li> I bought this to complete the package since there was no ear/nose attachment with my new groomer.</li>
            <li> and I found that the cylinder type cutting mechanism of this unit provides a much faster, easier, pleasant, no pain</li>
            <li> Works just as well as other wahl nose trimmers I&#x27;ve used, but it gets really hot really fast.  </li>
            <li> Works well just a little light duty feeling compared to my old Wahl.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a cutting edge product.</li>
            <li> no pulling, completely painless.    </li>
            <li> My old one was water proof</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s as far as I went.</li>
            <li> This Wahl trimmer is by far the simplest and easiest to operate.  </li>
            <li> Brand name does not always mean better.  </li>
            <li> It is small, lightweight, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> However, it is not as powerful and as sharp as the Con-Air brand that I lost.</li>
            <li> Not typical for Wahl products.</li>
            <li> Sadly, his father passed away in March from double pnuemonia,  I only knew he used it on his eyebrows a couple times and said they worked great.</li>
            <li> The power button is very sensitive; I accidentally left it on and didn&#x27;t realize it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands before, and they&#x27;ve mostly been pretty lame.  </li>
            <li> I may be dumber than most, but I can&#x27;t find the use of the brow trimmer, either mine doesn&#x27;t work or I&#x27;m too dumb to figure it out.</li>
            <li> I reverted back to the personal trimmer we normally use.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer worked fairly well, but was a little loud and somewhat inconvenient because you had to switch the heads back and forth to get the right angle.</li>
            <li> Battery life is a tad shorter than I expected, my first battery lasted 3 months; I don&#x27;t mind as long as it cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t exchanged gifts in many years, but this past year we&#x27;ve been helping each other with medical appt.</li>
            <li> Dont expct it will last too much, but gets the job done, no hair pulling or other issues</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not minor.  </li>
            <li> Not much more exciting stuff to say.</li>
            <li> It turned on once, but after only rarely and only after a round of vigorous shaking / slamming.  </li>
            <li> Not a great product, especially if you compare it with earlier, more solidly built models.</li>
            <li> With the Panasonic ER-GN30-K it took many more more painful tries to accomplish the same task as the cutting head either did not end up getting the hairs or pull them...</li>
            <li> Very neat little device.  </li>
            <li> I tried 3 other trimmers (Norelco and 2 other brands) and this one was the only one that really worked.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned this long enough to vouch for its durability</li>
            <li> You are at that age, and, if you&#x27;re anything like me it is likely that you needed it long before this!  </li>
            <li> I do not have much nose hair and it is not even thick, but it took a solid 5 minutes in and out of my nostril to get rid of my couple of hairs.</li>
            <li> I used to own 2 Panasonic nose hair trimmers, but they were complete crap as they both stopped working in just under a year.  </li>
            <li> They must be doing something wrong because mine works fine.</li>
            <li> but that is just a minor thing.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly long battery life too.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wanting on for a long time so</li>
            <li> So I have finally entered that time in my life where the hair from my head is relocating to other areas, which sucks as much as this product.  </li>
            <li> The only pros are the cost, the blades were sharp (no snags or pulling) and well protected (no cuts to the skin).</li>
            <li> Breaks shortly after due to water residue.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> My son and his fiance had been living with my ex-husband for awhile and the fiance had gotten a Finishing Touch trimmer (for eyebrows and other facial hair for ladies).  </li>
            <li> He found it to be uncomfortable and much too loud.  </li>
            <li> As we all know, these nose trimmers have a limited life.</li>
            <li> Many other ear and nose hair cutters (like the Panasonic ER-GN30-K) have a dome shape cutting mechanism.</li>
            <li> Fair for nose, not worth crap for ears.</li>
            <li> So long as the switch, motor, and blades last, there doesn&#x27;t seem much that can go wrong with</li>
            <li> A waste of my money, it&#x27;s back to Panasonic for me.</li>
            <li> It is minimally acceptable.  </li>
            <li> I thought that the Wahl would have some sort of guage to control the depth, but no, it doesn&#x27;t - you have to control it yourself, which is harder than using a scissors.</li>
            <li> When I came back to use it, the battery was dead.  </li>
            <li> It´s not a great trimmer but does a fair job cutting nose hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These work very well. Five years ago, I dropped mine and cracked the case, I taped it up. I purchased a Norelco...afraid my broken one would quit, it doesn&#x27;t work as well. Emergency trimming was needed in another state and I purchased a Conair, it doesn&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using the taped up Wahl because it still works very well. I&#x27;m ordering two more just in case....and so that my Grandsons will likely someday also have good trimmers....that work very well.</li>
            <li> Is super simple! Dont expct it will last too much, but gets the job done, no hair pulling or other issues</li>
            <li> Works just fine. I did not expect it to need AA batteries but that is just a minor thing. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a great product, especially if you compare it with earlier, more solidly built models. Could use a wider trimmer blade</li>
            <li> I bought this and tried it thinking Wahl was a good brand.  This thing is horrible!!!  It does not cut hair.  It&#x27;s truly like the blades are missing.  Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> It meets my expectations, I recommend</li>
            <li> It arrived fine and on time &amp; works as described. There is really little more to say about this...it works.</li>
            <li> Having a Wahl beard trimmer I had no reservations about the product. It lives up to its name and at a very affordable price. Easy to use and clean. Light weight and seems to run a long time on the battery. Would recomend and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> My package arrived quickly recommend it highly efficient and perfect packaging weighs nothing to send him thank you very much I appreciate it so light super happy, it works perfectly and I really like the hair pulling I had one of another brand and pulled a little bit this no, all is not cropped but that&#x27;s ok for me I am satisfied</li>
            <li> All good! excellent product!</li>
            <li> For the price paid it does an excellent job. My only gripe is that the switch on mine is very sensitive and easily turned on if placed in a bag-- also it&#x27;s not the quietest trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I used one of these for several years and was very happy with it. after a couple of years the motor started struggling a bit but it was no problem. It worked great and I was very happy. Until the day I dropped it and broke it into 4 different pieces... After reading reviews on Amazon I bought the Panasonic ER-GN30-K. The Panasonic has a better built, except it had one very major deal breaker problem. It pulls and gave me watery eyes after first stop. So I searched and searched until I found this unit. The 2nd one works just as good as the first one I owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of things which might help you in your decision:&lt;br /&gt;The cutter mechanism on this one is a straight cylinder with fast rotating blades. Many other ear and nose hair cutters (like the Panasonic ER-GN30-K) have a dome shape cutting mechanism. the dome shape might work great on finer hair as well as on ear hair. But I have thick and coarse nasal hair and I found that the cylinder type cutting mechanism of this unit provides a much faster, easier, pleasant, no pain experience.&lt;br /&gt;Partially becuase the blades of this rotate faster, and the end of the cutting mechanism is fully open, hairs have no place to go other than to end up under the cutting blades. With the Panasonic ER-GN30-K it took many more more painful tries to accomplish the same task as the cutting head either did not end up getting the hairs or pull them... So if you too have coarse hear I recommend the&lt;br /&gt;Wahl 5567-200.</li>
            <li> Fair for nose, not worth crap for ears. The brow trimmer is a throw-a-way. A waste of my money, it&#x27;s back to Panasonic for me.</li>
            <li> As we all know, these nose trimmers have a limited life. I can&#x27;t say I know exactly how many of them I&#x27;ve purchased.    This Wahl trimmer works as it should. You can try to find a trimmer at a store, or you can order this one and get what you need.</li>
            <li> It was ok, but I replaced it with a Panasonic which in my opinion is much better product.</li>
            <li> Previously used a manual one that would sometimes pull out the hairs from my nose  -- not fun.  This one cuts clean with no pulling so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace a Sharper Image one that finally wore out after a number of years of use.  The eyebrow trimmer works OK, but as a nose and ear hair trimmer, this product is horrid.  I had to push it against the skin of my ears to the point of pain to get it to work at all.  I am buying something different to replace it.</li>
            <li> This iten is the best in its line. I have used Wahl for years but couldn&#x27;t find one recently so I used another brand. i had to throw it away and wait for Wahl</li>
            <li> Great litte nose hair trimmer. Awesome for the price and quality. Surprisingly long battery life too.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this.  It broke after one use.  And since the package was opened, we could not return.  I do not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 10+ times and it works great on my nose - no pulling, completely painless.    Highly recommended, if mine ever breaks or gets lost I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you paid for. I mean it works but not that well. I bought it for the nose hair trimmer so I can not comment on the other functions. I do not have much nose hair and it is not even thick, but it took a solid 5 minutes in and out of my nostril to get rid of my couple of hairs. I mean it does work but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work great. If you are buying it for the nose hair trimmer and do not mind taking your time, then this product is right for you. If you are impatient or just have thick hair i would recommend something else.</li>
            <li> So I have finally entered that time in my life where the hair from my head is relocating to other areas, which sucks as much as this product.  The cutting system does not come close to trimming the hair.  I got a Panasonic that works great and I ordered another Panasonic for travel.  Nose trimmer - go with any Panasonic, not this...</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay in the on position.  I guess if it stayed on it may do what I bought it to do but, every time you take your finger off the off.on switch it stops.  I&#x27;d send it back but its to inconvenient, its already in the garbage.  Don&#x27;t buy one.</li>
            <li> All I can say total waste of money does not work at all The reason why I gave it one star because I like the name and have been buying their other products it&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s attached to this one</li>
            <li> it cuts nose hair. Not much more exciting stuff to say. It is cheaply constructed and feels cheap when you hold it in your hand but it works well.</li>
            <li> This should not have the name “Wahl” attached, but it&#x27;s not a bad cheap trimmer. Uses a rechargeable battery with no problem, which is nice. Probably won&#x27;t be your only trimmer.</li>
            <li> Face it, after 35 hair grows in all kinds of weird places and this thing takes care of it rather than some caustic remark.  Do yourself a favor and get the &amp;#34;bush&amp;#34; out of your ears and/or nose.</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer on my husband&#x27;s ears.  He found it to be uncomfortable and much too loud.  I reverted back to the personal trimmer we normally use.  It worked much better.  He has not tried the nose trimmer attachment yet, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  I cannot honestly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product is very good as it does the work and the price is perfect. I travel a lot so the size is perfect for me to carry it on my toiletries bag. No need for cords or external power sources.</li>
            <li> I had this trimmer for several years before the plastic on one of the heads broke just enough so it wouldnt stay on unless i held it.   This trimmer worked fairly well, but was a little loud and somewhat inconvenient because you had to switch the heads back and forth to get the right angle. It only took one AA battery, which usually lasted for at least 2 months using it about every other day. It was also pretty durable, as it got knocked around the bathroom drawer and put in and out of bags and suitcases for traveling.  3 stars because it did the job but not as well as some of the others out there. As a replacement, my wife got me the [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110 Precision Nose and Ear Trimmer]] and it works really well. Plus, only one head.</li>
            <li> Had one like this before, and this new and improved version seems much better than the one I got several years ago.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wanting on for a long time so when I saw this one for him I just had to get it! He says it works great!</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used which does not hurt or tickle me. I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer, but the nose hair round attachment is awesome. I&#x27;m not going to use the other attachment as i have no use for it. For under $10 this is really the thing. I would buy it again if i lost it or broke it. Uses 1 AA battery. It does not hurt or pull the nose hair at all...!!! I&#x27;m always scared to put trimmers up my nose cos it hurts or pulls the hair. This does not. My husband loves it too.</li>
            <li> So far so good- Feels a bit cheaper than my original SHAPER IMAGE trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is totally worth the price- I recommend buying if you need a nose trimmer ASAP. I have not experienced any pinching and I have nose hair! NOT ANYMORE</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I have owned.  Works great, cuts hair, it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out.  Wahl seems to have good product.  The first one was made in eastern Europe, the second one in China</li>
            <li> Love how quiet it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minor issue, the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on for me. I&#x27;ve already lost it. It never seemed to snap on.</li>
            <li> This was one of the worst product&#x27;s I have purchased. Perhaps I just received a defective item, but, this trimmer only worked once, and it never turned on again. Word to the wiser, either save your money, or invest in a better product. I would not recommend this product, nor will I repurchase.</li>
            <li> It´s not a great trimmer but does a fair job cutting nose hair. it takes some time to cut as well as you want.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. He&#x27;s very happy, he uses this very often. His nose is as bald on the inside, as his head is on top.</li>
            <li> I had used another trimmer formerly. When I lost it, searched for new one. But this trimmer is not so useful as the old one. I was expecting better performance Although it satisfies my need, it takes more time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does the job and is very quiet when on. However, it is not as powerful and as sharp as the Con-Air brand that I lost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer only because it has the Wahl reputation attached to it.  Brand name does not always mean better.  I have had a Remington for almost twenty years that will outperform this product any day of the week.</li>
            <li> While the nose hair trimmer will get the job done eventually, the cutter head is a very poor design. The guards on the cutter head are very wide and square, causing it to push down the hair rather than into the cutting slots.  The cover  does not prevent the switch from turning on.  Twisting the cover while installed will cause the cutter head to pop off and become stuck inside the cover.  Which will require some kind of tool to pry out.  Also, not sure where the wet in the wet/dry comes from.  Looks like you can rinse out the cutter head in water but the motor body is not water resistant. The only pros are the cost, the blades were sharp (no snags or pulling) and well protected (no cuts to the skin).</li>
            <li> One of the best nose hair clippers, does not pull and cuts amazingly. Better than those so called nose straight razors that don&#x27;t catch hairs. The circular clippers are much better. My only complaint is that this should have came with a battery.</li>
            <li> After about 4 months of use, I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this trimmer.  Most important (to me), the rotary head cuts painlessly when trimming nose hair.  That&#x27;s a very desirable attribute, as you know if you&#x27;ve ever owned an inferior trimmer that PULLS hairs out (ouch)!  This cuts very cleanly and thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While plain looking, the trimmer and attachments appear of good quality, especially considering the sub-$10 price.  The cover and heads fit tightly, yet attach/detach easily.  It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and has a 2 year warranty.  Battery life is a tad shorter than I expected, my first battery lasted 3 months; I don&#x27;t mind as long as it cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this has been the best rotary-head trimmer I&#x27;ve owned, and at an almost unbeatable price!  If I broke or lost it, I&#x27;d buy another in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> My old one was water proof so I could rinse it clean.  Works well just a little light duty feeling compared to my old Wahl.  But I like the brand.  My last one lasted 14 years.</li>
            <li> You really have to work this around to get good results. I had a cheaper version that didn&#x27;t last but actually trimmed better. It&#x27;s like the blade is just a little too protected by the cover to be really effective. I will continue to use it, but I just wish it worked a little faster - without the maneuvering.</li>
            <li> I tried 3 other trimmers (Norelco and 2 other brands) and this one was the only one that really worked.  It&#x27;s easy to use and very effective.  I&#x27;d recommend it... and the price was very fair.</li>
            <li> Cheap Made in China crap.</li>
            <li> Works well and is super cheap.  I&#x27;m sure there are better products out there but for the price I would recommend the Wahl.</li>
            <li> Does its job and was a good price. These things seem to be broken every time you need them. This one seems to be hanging in there.</li>
            <li> Have used a couple of times. So far great results. (Great price too.) Looked locally before ordering but could not find. Since received have found at about same price..</li>
            <li> This replaced a beard and mustache trimmer which had a blade head which could be switched for a nose and ear trimmer. The battery on that prior unit eventually deteriorated to the point where the trimmer no longer held a charge. This Wahl unit uses a  common battery and I can choose to use rechargeable or non-rechargeable and can easily acquire a replacement battery while I am traveling. This Wahl doesn&#x27;t take up much space, in cabinet or luggage. So long as the switch, motor, and blades last, there doesn&#x27;t seem much that can go wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why three stars, instead of four? The blade and the mechanism which spins the blade seems fairly delicate. I haven&#x27;t owned this long enough to vouch for its durability and I&#x27;m a little concerned this is a point of weakness in this unit&#x27;s manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the brow blade attachment yet. Frankly, I find the mustache trimmer suitable for trimming my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Wahl 9906-2001 &amp;#34;The Mustache&amp;#34; Cordless/Battery Operated Beard and Mustache trimmer at the same time.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job, but feels flimsy. The battery compartment cover comes off during use quite often. All in all - good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a couple weeks.  It is minimally acceptable.  It doesn&#x27;t always start when I turn it on, and often I have to shake it.  It seems very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> and found that they would clog up and  stop.  I was constantly taking the head off but this one works like a charm and I think it&#x27;s cheaper than brand &amp;#34;P&amp;#34;.  Only one draw back and it&#x27;s not minor.  The on/off switch was designed by a gorilla.  If you put your thumb on the slide lever and push - good luck.  The one I got can&#x27;t be pushed on if you put downward pressure (pressure towards the barrel) on it.  You have to put your thumb at the very bottom of the switch and push up.  It works with one hand okay as long as you don&#x27;t do the obvious.  (would give it five stars if it worked the way slide switches normally work).</li>
            <li> good stuff, reliable, dependable. all anyone could expect from these batteries. Highly recommended. Fast, easy, profgessional, all very good stuff</li>
            <li> This one replaced a similar Wahl device I used for 10 years with no brow clipper. The quality and performance of this product is great!  Rob _</li>
            <li> Great price...does what it is supposed to! Wouls recommend this product to anyone. Nice and small for easy storage anywhere</li>
            <li> Great looking design and feels sturdy.  But the extra trim blade doesn&#x27;t cut as well as the trimmer I owned before.  Just starting using it it so perhaps with more use, I&#x27;ll notice the difference.  I love how easy it is to snap on and off the nose and brow trimmer.  I have a Wahl electric razor and consider it a really well made product, I hope in a few months I&#x27;ll be saying the same thing about this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to complete the package since there was no ear/nose attachment with my new groomer. Besides not being rechargeable this works just fine.  No frills basic clipper that has an interchangeable head.  For the price its an attractive buy.</li>
            <li> Breaks shortly after due to water residue.&lt;br /&gt;Very fragile&lt;br /&gt;Frustrating to fix, but then the thing works again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not recommend</li>
            <li> works. uses 1 aa battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for ear and nose hairs, not very useful for eyebrows.  No pinching the 3 times I&#x27;ve used it.  For eyebrows, I like to use a small scissors, since they are easier to control the depth and uniformity of the cut.  I thought that the Wahl would have some sort of guage to control the depth, but no, it doesn&#x27;t - you have to control it yourself, which is harder than using a scissors.</li>
            <li> It does what&#x27;s supposed to do at a reasonable price. I have used for over a year and it works well.</li>
            <li> using this for my hairy ears , im going to buy something different, it does not give a close cut, I still have to use my razor to finish the job, which I was using before I got this. whats the point?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brands before, and they&#x27;ve mostly been pretty lame.  This one is much more powerful and actually does the job as advertised.  I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very useful for this cheap price.I really like it and recommend to friends.the two separate pieces are awesome. will be back to buy more</li>
            <li> I bought this because Wahl is supposedly a good brand name for trimming hair.  I used to own 2 Panasonic nose hair trimmers, but they were complete crap as they both stopped working in just under a year.  This Wahl trimmer is better, but has its own issues.  It doesn&#x27;t trim as closely as the Panasonic did.  I have had mine for about 2 years, so it&#x27;s durable.  The power button is very sensitive; I accidentally left it on and didn&#x27;t realize it.  When I came back to use it, the battery was dead.  The power button probably turned on when I went to put it away.  I stopped using the protective cap because when you remove it, the top part comes off with it.</li>
            <li> It broke after a few uses- very cheap- spend a little more to get one that will last longer than three uses!</li>
            <li> Great price for a cutting edge product. Includes 2 different types of blades for trimming. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Excellente hair trimmer!</li>
            <li> Trimmer works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this for me and it broke within a week, it sucked!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand it, such a pos. If you feel like throwing away money, this is the product. The thing barely cut any hairs.. am I doing it wrong? Pretty basic I&#x27;m thinking, so it&#x27;s just very ineffective. It&#x27;s hard to believe they would even put out a product like this</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl trimmer. Works great for ears, nose and eye brows.</li>
            <li> would be a bit different.  This made in China crap is just taking money out of the USA and&lt;br /&gt;creating unnecessary landfill waste.  What a shame.  It ran for a while and then just basically stopped.&lt;br /&gt;Spend your money on European or Japanese hair cutting supplies.</li>
            <li> Hey guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing does the trick with no pulling!&lt;br /&gt;The price is right for what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;The battery consumption is low, so I like this thing all around.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend needed a nose hair trimmer and this was perfect. He liked it alot and it got the job done! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> These did not have enough power and the nose hair attachment didn&#x27;t work.  They went right into the trash.  Not typical for Wahl products.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as other wahl nose trimmers I&#x27;ve used, but it gets really hot really fast.  Wahl needs to work on making a more efficient motor for these things.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does...My dog hates the sound of it, but it gets the job done...</li>
            <li> You are at that age, and, if you&#x27;re anything like me it is likely that you needed it long before this!  This trimmer does the job, it runs on one AA.  The trimmer head looks like a tiny coffee grinder.  The warranty mentions that if the user experiences any snags or discomfort they will replace the head for up to one year after purchase.  So far so good, and I had no idea how one would use such a thing.</li>
            <li> What can one say about a nose and ear trimmer other than either &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it doesn&#x27;t&amp;#34; --- this one works just fine and it&#x27;s extremely attractively priced (can you imagine spending $30-$40 bucks to cut nose hair)?</li>
            <li> I suppose it would be easy to review a nose trimmer but this product also is a eyebrow trimmer as well.  It does a magnificent job in both areas!</li>
            <li> Never again nose and ear hairs. still cutting after a few months never gotten a pulled hair. i use it regularly.</li>
            <li> The price was too good to be true.  I was surprised as I am very happy with my other Wahl beard trimmer, but this nose trimmer did not work properly.  It turned on once, but after only rarely and only after a round of vigorous shaking / slamming.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made but does the job and great price</li>
            <li> Shame on Wahl for having their name on ths  product. If you have your hand around the unit and operate the on/off  switch the battery cover comes off. The battery cover latch doesn&#x27;t stay in place. That&#x27;s as far as I went. Cheap is cheap. It&#x27;s made of the cheapest Chinese plastic. Overall piece of crap. My bad/&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> After all this long, this product is still holding up great!! I appreciate the price that I bought it for !! Thx!!</li>
            <li> Product is excellent.  Everything was there in the package and I love it.  Would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> This Wahl trimmer is by far the simplest and easiest to operate.  It does not pinch or anything and the price was unbelievable</li>
            <li> got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband and he liked it.. he said it works great and would recommend for sure..</li>
            <li> This is a great item. It came to me very fast and it&#x27;s excatly what I wanted. I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This has worked well for over a year.  It is silent and non-abrasive and runs on a AA battery which is easily replaced.</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect! Thank you very much! That is what I wanted! I will definitely enjoy using this item and I hope it is very useful!</li>
            <li> I will not continue to use this for nose hair trimming, these are somewhat painful unlike other trimmers I have purchased. Not for me.  I chose this one based on the low price.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after one use.  I tried changing batteries, but has not worked since.  Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It works very well and the price was just right-Thanks for the great deal.  Have a great day right now</li>
            <li> Does what is supposed too, simple &amp; easy to use. The heads are easy to attach &amp; detach. Light &amp; portable, would recommend.</li>
            <li> dont pick this one, go with Remington, I should have never tried this....live and learn....</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to trim between my dogs paw pads after I&#x27;ve done the big trim on her.  Works okay.  I might should have invested more and got a plugin model for more power.  But this will be okay.  And at $9 if it last me a year,  I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite razor was a wahl so when I saw this I knew he would love it and he does, it works better than others.</li>
            <li> This rating is elegui its compliance&lt;br /&gt;I liked the way of working and effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;friends are encouraged to use all</li>
            <li> I also appears to be well built.  For the purpose it does a very good job.  This particular brand has always been good to me.</li>
            <li> The product does not work as well as I had hoped.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Very neat little device.  I was expecting it to hurt a little bit - but it really doesn&#x27;t at all.  Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Best nose-hair cutter I&#x27;ve ever bought (and I have bought several over the last 10 years).  This one hasn&#x27;t gone dull after awhile, as the others (I&#x27;m writing this review 8 months after my purchase).</li>
            <li> this item worked as advertised and was shipped on time in a good manner. I would suggest it to the next person</li>
            <li> Save your money and put it toward a better made model.  This one is cheap and tinny, doesn&#x27;t cut close enough to the skin.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the product. I need something to keep me looking neat and tidy. This little appliance took care of that in no time, works like a miracle. It works better than the others I have had, and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Wahl nose and ear trimmer. I works great and is supper quiet. Great item for the price.</li>
            <li> The small Wahl clipper is perfect for shaving my Manx cat&#x27;s bottom.  If I don&#x27;t keep him shaved he develops \\&quot;crusty poop\\&quot; which adheres to his hair.  He has the \\&quot;Manx cat syndrome\\&quot; and the clipper is the perfect solution to keeping him neat and clean.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Broke within months.</li>
            <li> Sounds like it&#x27;s cutting nose hairs but leaves hairs.</li>
            <li> I may be dumber than most, but I can&#x27;t find the use of the brow trimmer, either mine doesn&#x27;t work or I&#x27;m too dumb to figure it out. The nose trimmer I found useful and working all right, an OK product.</li>
            <li> I use this expressly for my nose, and it has been a lifesaver. It is small, lightweight, and easy to use. Everything that I need.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all these people are talking about when they say that it pulls the hair. They must be doing something wrong because mine works fine. No pulling or discomfort whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 pairs of these at the last minute for Christmas gifts.  My son and his fiance had been living with my ex-husband for awhile and the fiance had gotten a Finishing Touch trimmer (for eyebrows and other facial hair for ladies).  She confided she was afraid of the guys trimming their nose hairs with it. When I stumbled on this it seemed too perfect!  The ex and I haven&#x27;t exchanged gifts in many years, but this past year we&#x27;ve been helping each other with medical appt. rides and getting along fairly well.  Still, I hadn&#x27;t planned on gifts but the fiance mentioned there were gifts under their tree with my name so I hurriedly began to look for something for him.  My son said they worked great.  Sadly, his father passed away in March from double pnuemonia,  I only knew he used it on his eyebrows a couple times and said they worked great.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfecho, very good.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price...of course not rechargeable but blade rpm is adequate... feels cheap but sturdy in hand...worth buying and trying</li>
            <li> Really great item. You can&#x27;t beat the price. Shipping was great as well.</li>
            <li> great product, I am very glad to have him, is the best and original, thanks for the sale</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Very basic but gets the job done. If you need to trim your nose often I&#x27;d say get a nicer one</li>
            <li> I bought these as gifts and I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so I guess they must work good for them.</li>
            <li> Great Deal!!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I bought a few, they do good</li>
