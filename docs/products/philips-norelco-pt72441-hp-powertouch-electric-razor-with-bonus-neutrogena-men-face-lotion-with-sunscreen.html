            <li>easy use and easy charge, suitable at home or traveling</li>

            <li>The razor is also really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but it works well with a light beard.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best and fastest shaver I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and quiet</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>

            <li>Thus far they have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>He was all excited to tell me about it after he used it.  </li>
            <li>Fast and Easy!</li>
            <li>Cuts great with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>It does the job good enough to keep from using a razor at every shave.</li>
            <li>No cuts or razor burn and the battery last a good amount of time</li>
            <li>Much appreciated feature is that the top opens up for a quick rinse under faucet to clean.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full eight hour charge.</li>
            <li>beyond compare aptly That&#x27;s all I need for I&#x27;d recommend you to a friend Low price Practical Powerful Shaving is very clean</li>
            <li>This is a fast, strong razor.  </li>
            <li>The second one is much more advanced and does its job clean and neat without any irritations on the skin.</li>
            <li>Its OK i used it dry , i have had better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to bounce it around or lose it at this price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>So right now it&#x27;s pretty much as useful as a paperweight.</li>
            <li>Closer Shave, Simple design, Easy Cleaning!  </li>
            <li>, I broke out the first couple days I used it, but it works just like its supposed to the battery stays charged and</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with this unit.  </li>
            <li>So I looked through Amazon and found this razor, its really a man&#x27;s razor, but it works quickly and fast.  </li>
            <li>The same good quality and the type and the same product.</li>
            <li>For a cheap razor it works pretty good, not smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, close enough.</li>
            <li>it keeps a pretty decent charge.  </li>
            <li>It shaves as nice as the more expensive one.</li>
            <li>razors for women before,  they never seem to cut well, or fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not what I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like how the rotary head stays flip up for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is now getting better, as I learn various angles and such, to leave the skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t use it everyday, maybe every other day,but that&#x27;s a pretty good track record for a product at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>I have used cheaper models before, but this one is worth the extra 10-15 dollars.</li>
            <li>The battery has a long life and quick recharge.</li>
            <li>Always a boost when get new razor to replace old.  </li>
            <li>First one was purchased 10 years ago and served perfectly until last  month as the battery gave up, but not completely - the razor needed constant charging which became uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>If it died today it would have easily paid for itself with saved regular razors and last second shaves.</li>
            <li>It took a couple of days for him to get the hang of using it and not missing any spots</li>
            <li>I replaced my old Norelco that was just not holding a charge.</li>
            <li>Norelco offers a 2-year warranty.</li>
            <li>So far works well.</li>
            <li>I replaced an older Norelco that would only hold a charge for one shave.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and arranged in a way that shave pretty well.</li>
            <li>is a big improvement over my old razor.  </li>
            <li>I do not have a heavy beard, and razor rash when I first started using it</li>
            <li>I just got this and have been using it for a week, for you people that gave this a low rating and expected more then you have serious skin softness, I have fare skin</li>
            <li>They really hold up and in the newer ones the blades stay sharp for a long time.</li>

            <li> This is not a high quality product but it is made by Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The stubble does not really fall in those tiny holes, so that just slows down the shave.</li>
            <li> I shave every single day for work (military).</li>
            <li> was minimal and the Neutrogena took care of that concern, now after a month of using it no razor rash.  </li>
            <li> I had only had the small elec.</li>
            <li> whiskers, so I shave every other day.  </li>
            <li> one currently holds a charge for at least a week of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my husband for Christmas and he loves it and he couldn&#x27;t believe how little it cost.  </li>
            <li> Its head installation is also complicated and not properly explained in instruction manual.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it would work on thick or medium beard</li>
            <li> It cuts closer and is less irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs or dull...</li>
            <li> but the razor is little irritating after 3-4 uses.</li>
            <li> sick of slicing apart my sensitive skin with a razor.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as the price of razor blades is getting ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I have not used a  Norelco razor since the 80s, and at that time was never happy with the shave I received despite the advertising of a close shave.  </li>
            <li> the skin is not held tight, a lot of skin if (painfully) lost.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These guys make the best electric razors for the price. This is my third Norelco razor in 20 years. They really hold up and in the newer ones the blades stay sharp for a long time. The battery has a long life and quick recharge. I get close shaves every time with no problems.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen that has just gone on blood thinners.  I was shaving my legs with a razor,  and realized that I cannot afford to cut myself shaving,  it would take awhile to quit bleeding.  So I decided I shouldn&#x27;t use a regular razor.  So I looked through Amazon and found this razor, its really a man&#x27;s razor, but it works quickly and fast.  It plugs in until its fullycharged.  I had only had the small elec. razors for women before,  they never seem to cut well, or fast.  This is a fast, strong razor.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it, and I would recommend that you read the instruction manual when you get it. It gave good tips on shaving and how to really get the best use out of your razor. My husband was one who never used an electric because he didn&#x27;t like the way it shaved, but after following the guidelines he loves it now!</li>
            <li> beyond compare aptly That&#x27;s all I need for I&#x27;d recommend you to a friend Low price Practical Powerful Shaving is very clean</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best and fastest shaver I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and quiet and it is a pleasure to use. Great service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This razor trims close and smooth. The battery lasts a long time. It&#x27;s a great value for the price. I have used cheaper models before, but this one is worth the extra 10-15 dollars.</li>
            <li> I just got this and have been using it for a week, for you people that gave this a low rating and expected more then you have serious skin softness, I have fare skin and this don&#x27;t bother me at all, I broke out the first couple days I used it, but it works just like its supposed to the battery stays charged and the razor was a great price.</li>
            <li> This is not a high quality product but it is made by Norelco.  For the price, it is acceptable.  Norelco makes a good product though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dad, and he is so proud of it and it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs or dull...it just does an amazing job and well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This Razor was bought for my husband, and son for a present. Thus far they have been very pleased. It does the job good enough to keep from using a razor at every shave. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I got this razor for my husband for Christmas and he loves it and he couldn&#x27;t believe how little it cost.  Because of his opinion I have purchased one for my son and grandson and they both love them as well.</li>
            <li> First one was purchased 10 years ago and served perfectly until last  month as the battery gave up, but not completely - the razor needed constant charging which became uncomfortable. The second one is much more advanced and does its job clean and neat without any irritations on the skin. My husband keeps telling me that he is happy with this razor!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. It has everything he wanted in an electric razor.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loved it! He&#x27;s been wanting more of a clean shave and this was perfect. No cuts or razor burn and the battery last a good amount of time</li>
            <li> I wanted an extra razor to take to the club. I have another Norelco that cost much more than this one. It shaves as nice as the more expensive one. I&#x27;m not afraid to bounce it around or lose it at this price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not what I expected. Great service, tho!!</li>
            <li> The charger that came with it does not work. So right now it&#x27;s pretty much as useful as a paperweight.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I am happy with the razor. I replaced an older Norelco that would only hold a charge for one shave. It was about 4 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one currently holds a charge for at least a week of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy trails, cowboy Mike</li>
            <li> purchased for temp need for elec razor.  Does good, quick job on even overgrown beards.  Charges efficiently.  Much appreciated feature is that the top opens up for a quick rinse under faucet to clean.  I leave it open to dry before putting away</li>
            <li> Worked out great. Easy to use and shipped on time. The razor is also really easy to clean. The bonus Neutrogena face lotion works really good and smells great</li>
            <li> I use this on my head on days when I don&#x27;t shower and use a razor. For a cheap razor it works pretty good, not smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, close enough.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor.  I prefer it to the &amp;#34;dual precision&amp;#34; razor with holes for stubble, which are a gimmick.  The stubble does not really fall in those tiny holes, so that just slows down the shave.</li>
            <li> Works great my husband loves it. Works for a long time as long as it has it&#x27;s full eight hour charge. You can also use it while it is plugged in if you have too.</li>
            <li> Great electric razor.  Provides a close shave and is a lot faster than shaving with a razor.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Its operates well but the razor is little irritating after 3-4 uses. Its head installation is also complicated and not properly explained in instruction manual.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for about a year now. I shave every single day for work (military). I use this probably 2 - 3 times per week. The charge lasts for quite a while. Easily a week or 2 per charge. If it died today it would have easily paid for itself with saved regular razors and last second shaves. I would not hesitate to buy again.</li>
            <li> Always a boost when get new razor to replace old.  Cuts great with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these units for my son for Christmas, he likes it, so if figured what the heck, I would try one for myself.  I have not used a  Norelco razor since the 80s, and at that time was never happy with the shave I received despite the advertising of a close shave.  This unit I am happy to say works well on my beard.  I do not have a heavy beard, and razor rash when I first started using it was minimal and the Neutrogena took care of that concern, now after a month of using it no razor rash.  I enjoy the fact that you can was the head in warm water, does a great job cleaning it. Last  it keeps a pretty decent charge.  Overall I am satisfied with this unit.  Not sure how well it would work on thick or medium beard but it works well with a light beard.  I am a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Its OK i used it dry , i have had better</li>
            <li> This was a replacement and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> The same good quality and the type and the same product. It is cheaper than the one I bought in outlets.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it. His former razor finally bit the dust after about 5 or 6 years and it was a Philips too. He doesn&#x27;t use it everyday, maybe every other day,but that&#x27;s a pretty good track record for a product at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my BF. He love it very much!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as the price of razor blades is getting ridiculous.  It took a couple of days for him to get the hang of using it and not missing any spots but he&#x27;s very happy with how it shaves.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Razor.  This newer model is much quieter and the battery life is superior.  Closer Shave, Simple design, Easy Cleaning!  I really like how the rotary head stays flip up for cleaning.  Fast and Easy!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with this razor. I replaced my old Norelco that was just not holding a charge. They must have improved the battery because the charge life (with one use a day) is over two weeks. The blades are sharp and arranged in a way that shave pretty well. Even my neck hairs, which grow in all directions, shave well with this razor.  I like the fact that you can open it up and rinse it out under running water. Norelco offers a 2-year warranty. I would recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> So far works well. One of the cheaper razors but does a good job. My last Norelco lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Loves the shave and the trimmer.  He was all excited to tell me about it after he used it.  Think it&#x27;s a win.</li>
            <li> nice one! easy use and easy charge, suitable at home or traveling so I like this one, may be you will have one.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to move the razor in a constant circle pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the skin is not held tight, a lot of skin if (painfully) lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Neutrogena works to sooth some of the sting from lost skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now getting better, as I learn various angles and such, to leave the skin on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly fine (light?) whiskers, so I shave every other day.  It takes many passes to get most of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To do it all again, I would purchase a mid-priced foil razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband.  It was very reasonably priced and he says it does a very nice shave job.  I can attest to that!</li>
            <li> Son in Law says it works great. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I decided it was time to replace my old Norelco razor after many years of good service.  I chose to stay with Norelco and the model I chose is a big improvement over my old razor.  It cuts closer and is less irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> sick of slicing apart my sensitive skin with a razor. Got this device and I&#x27;ll never go back. Gives me an even closer shave than any razor ever did.</li>
