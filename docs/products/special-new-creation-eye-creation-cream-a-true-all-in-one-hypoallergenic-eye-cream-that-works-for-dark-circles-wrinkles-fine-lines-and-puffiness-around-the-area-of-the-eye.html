            <li>Probably good for oily skin.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>nice product, reduces and softens lines around the eyes but is not so effective at reducing puffiness which it lays claim to do</li>
            <li>Pretty good eye cream !</li>
            <li>The cream is very nice, smooth, no fragrance, great ingridients, it also works, my skin is nice and smooth (no dramatic improvements, but it does work)</li>
            <li>Many products irritate my eyes and skin, but I still want products that produce results.  </li>
            <li>but I put another eye cream on top to get the sense of sufficient moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become my favorite go to beauty product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love it .</li>
            <li>It was just okay for me .</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and my face feels a lot more smoother.</li>
            <li>I love this product -</li>
            <li>It is creamy, light wear, and very smooth on the eyes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good reasonably priced eye cream.</li>
            <li>My mother doesn&#x27;t use many cosmetics and rarely uses makeup so keeping her skin feeling and looking healthy is important to her.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that it has no artificial fragrances and colors!  </li>
            <li>The cream is light, creamy and moisturizing, however I was looking for a solution to eye puffiness, ( one of the claims) which this did not</li>
            <li>Fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Works great, just not enough of it for the price.</li>
            <li>It goes on cool and light and makes me appear more awake and bright-eyed quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am 50, so that&#x27;s a real complement to me!!!</li>
            <li>It is a lovely light cream and works very, very well.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a great product, goes on soft and velvety, and really helps diminish fine lines</li>
            <li>Its 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>I am 49 years old and I have tried a lot of products and to be honest...</li>
            <li>I bought this cream because it specified that it has a moisturizer, hypoallergenic and no bad smell.</li>
            <li>to my surprise it works great on my dark circles and it moisturizes all in one.</li>
            <li>New Creation Eye Cream is fabulous!</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS!!  </li>
            <li>Great product for those little problems around your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, it does not built up, and it really improve your skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all true it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>you are looking to reduce eye bags- Not so much!</li>
            <li>The rosacea on my face totally went away when I started using this cream, and my face feels better than it has felt in years.  </li>
            <li>It always leaks out of the container when screwing the top back on.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for me!</li>
            <li>and so this cream is not only likable</li>
            <li>Ian didn&#x27;t helps with the puffiness under my eyes but the cream is light and not greasy and I like it more than my previous eye</li>
            <li>Started using this a few months ago and pleased is an understatement!</li>
            <li>Really seems to work.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This cream really deserves the 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but I have not noticed as much difference there as I did with the crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li>My skin is highly sensitive, and every effort I made to find a good product resulted in rashes, burning of the area and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is long- lasting and very lightweight, but effective.</li>
            <li>The cream goes on very smoothly and only a tiny amount is really needed.  </li>
            <li>Also, it disappears quickly so that you are ready for your regular makeup.  </li>
            <li>This cream really deserves my five stars, as it is a revolutionary product to fight against the normal aging process.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a high end product without a high end price, It very affordable for all budgets.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this eye cream</li>
            <li>I noticed a distinct lessening of puffiness and it improves daily.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s on par with many other creams available - at far less cost.</li>
            <li>I used New Creation Eye Cream for about a month on the skin under my eyes and on the areas on the sides of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>- I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Maybe it was made on purpose for people to run out of it faster, I am not sure, as most of the cream stays on the side of the container ( when closing).</li>
            <li>In addition, I have had no irritation on the skin in those very sensitive areas near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I still need something for the little fine lines under the eyes.</li>
            <li>It had been helping with the puffiness around her eyes which causes her to be self conscious.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at this lightweight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This keeps that area soft</li>
            <li>Over time, I have noticed an age spot becoming less obvious.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much feel like I wasted 30.00.</li>
            <li>On my normal skin it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li>it is also more inexpensive than other eye creams I highly recommended it, but I am not sure that it will help all customers with their puffiness problems</li>
            <li>most eye creams are too irritating for me to use.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and could not use a single face cream sold at cosmetic counters or drug stores.  </li>
            <li>After the first few days of using it, I began to notice a big difference in my eyes.</li>

            <li> I cant give it five stars because I need to see if the dark circles clear up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I see much difference.</li>
            <li> How long does one jar last anyways?</li>
            <li> Because you only need a small amount, the jar of  New Creation  lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> After only a few days of use the dark circles under my eyes have nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it only around my eyes; I am using it as a face cream to treat other areas that also needed attention.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And a jar lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This results in pain, fatigue and several other symptoms.</li>
            <li> With her she itches on her face and eyes causing dry spots and redness under eyes.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes a bit dry</li>
            <li> There is only a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only thing that I was a little  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no skin irritation, yet it&#x27;s doing the job of keeping my skin moist while not clogging my pores.  </li>
            <li> only need a very little amount</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this eye cream to see what other changes will occur.</li>
            <li> disappointed was that the jar is not full to the top.</li>
            <li> The dark circles around my eyes are lighter and it keeps the skin moist.  </li>
            <li> The puffiness I always have had in the mornings was improving along with the dark circles disappearing.</li>
            <li> Does not adequately moisturese</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy</li>
            <li> If you tilt the container even a little bit, if the cream gets on the sides of the bottle (inside), it will leak and will be all over.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Sorry, expensive, and personally did not see any big improvements or changes.  </li>
            <li> I saw a dramatic change in less than 24 hours and have ever since!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, plus jar is very small for price.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it makes me break out at times around my eyes, which is a weird area for acne to pop up!</li>
            <li> I tried products that were labeled &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;, but they were just as bad for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is extremely annoying as the rest of the products in my cosmetic bag got this cream on them.</li>
            <li> The container holding the cream is HORRIBLY designed!!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy and I&#x27;m not sure I see much difference.</li>
            <li> The cream is light, creamy and moisturizing, however I was looking for a solution to eye puffiness, ( one of the claims) which this did not improve.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for moisturizing-- Good&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to reduce eye bags- Not so much!</li>
            <li> I really thought this cream would make a difference in under eye lines, but I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and have not seen any difference. I also noticed that it makes me break out at times around my eyes, which is a weird area for acne to pop up! I would not buy this product again, but I will continue using it periodically just because of the amount of money I paid for it...</li>
            <li> Works great! After only a few days of use the dark circles under my eyes have nearly disappeared. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Started using this a few months ago and pleased is an understatement! I saw a dramatic change in less than 24 hours and have ever since!</li>
            <li> This made my wrinkles stand out more...didn&#x27;t seem to work at all. It also made my eyes water quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I am a sentive-skinned redhead. Many products irritate my eyes and skin, but I still want products that produce results.  This product does!  It goes on cool and light and makes me appear more awake and bright-eyed quickly.  Thought out the day, I feel moisturized without the oiliness that dissolves make-up.  Over time, I have noticed an age spot becoming less obvious.  I highly recommend this product and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that it has no artificial fragrances and colors!  Amen!</li>
            <li> Sorry, expensive, and personally did not see any big improvements or changes.  Very tiny amount.  The design of the jar makes the inside smaller than it appears from the outside - which isn&#x27;t big to start with.  I think it&#x27;s on par with many other creams available - at far less cost.</li>
            <li> It works well but I put another eye cream on top to get the sense of sufficient moisture. Probably good for oily skin. On my normal skin it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Shannon you wouldn&#x27;t believe the difference in my bags underneath my eyes it&#x27;s amazing 😃😃😃</li>
            <li> This cream really deserves my five stars, as it is a revolutionary product to fight against the normal aging process. My skin is highly sensitive, and every effort I made to find a good product resulted in rashes, burning of the area and uneven skin tone. But &amp;#34;New Creation Eye Cream&amp;#34; is truly hypoallergenic and good for any skin type. I don&#x27;t use it only around my eyes; I am using it as a face cream to treat other areas that also needed attention.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy to have found this &amp;#34;New Creation&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and could not use a single face cream sold at cosmetic counters or drug stores.  I tried products that were labeled &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34;, but they were just as bad for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is called an eye cream, but I use it all over my face and neck.  The rosacea on my face totally went away when I started using this cream, and my face feels better than it has felt in years.  I was even told that I have a glowing complexion!!!!  I am 50, so that&#x27;s a real complement to me!!!</li>
            <li> Bought the product as a gift for my mother and she loved it. My mother doesn&#x27;t use many cosmetics and rarely uses makeup so keeping her skin feeling and looking healthy is important to her. It had been helping with the puffiness around her eyes which causes her to be self conscious. I would recommend the product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, plus jar is very small for price.</li>
            <li> Great product for those little problems around your eyes.  I have been using this product for about a number of weeks now and can see improvement!  The dark circles around my eyes are lighter and it keeps the skin moist.  I will continue to use this eye cream to see what other changes will occur.</li>

I noticed a distinct lessening of puffiness and it improves daily.  In addition, I have had no irritation on the skin in those very sensitive areas near my eyes.  The cream goes on very smoothly and only a tiny amount is really needed.  Also, it disappears quickly so that you are ready for your regular makeup.  The jar it comes in is very attractive and looks quite lovely on my dressing table.  Because you only need a small amount, the jar of  New Creation  lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> So I decided to purchase this eye cream thinking it would be just like all the others........ not work and sit in my cabinet  without being used.....to my surprise it works great on my dark circles and it moisturizes all in one. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good reasonably priced eye cream.</li>
            <li> I am using the eye cream daily since I received it.  It is creamy, light wear, and very smooth on the eyes. I cant give it five stars because I need to see if the dark circles clear up. There is only a slight improvement. I will review again. When the product finishes.</li>
            <li> Bough this for my wife and she loves it.  Really seems to work.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye cream! It truly works. After the first few days of using it, I began to notice a big difference in my eyes. The puffiness I always have had in the mornings was improving along with the dark circles disappearing. It&#x27;s become my favorite go to beauty product. Because it&#x27;s a high end product without a high end price, It very affordable for all budgets. And a jar lasts a long time! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love it . It was just okay for me . Pretty much feel like I wasted 30.00.</li>
            <li> I want my money back. I didn&#x27;t see any results. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchase this eye cream for my wife who has MS.  Multiple Sclerosis causes signals between your brain and spinal cord to malfunction. This results in pain, fatigue and several other symptoms. In her case she has sensations that feel like pins and needles causing her to itch. With MS the nerves in your skin or the nerves that send signals to your skin are damaged causing the itching.  Since the cause is neurological not physical like a bug bite or rash topical creams won&#x27;t work. With her she itches on her face and eyes causing dry spots and redness under eyes. I bought this cream because it specified that it has a moisturizer, hypoallergenic and no bad smell. Fragrance free. It&#x27;s all true it does exactly what it says. I would recommend this to anyone who has these issues. I&#x27;m happy to say that 5 stars are deserved!!!!</li>
            <li> Made my eyes a bit dry</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at this lightweight moisturizer. It is long- lasting and very lightweight, but effective. I put it on in the morning and still feel it in the evening. Love it and will order it again!!</li>
            <li> The cream is very nice, smooth, no fragrance, great ingridients, it also works, my skin is nice and smooth (no dramatic improvements, but it does work) so why only three stars? The container holding the cream is HORRIBLY designed!! Maybe it was made on purpose for people to run out of it faster, I am not sure, as most of the cream stays on the side of the container ( when closing). If you tilt the container even a little bit, if the cream gets on the sides of the bottle (inside), it will leak and will be all over. It always leaks out of the container when screwing the top back on. It is extremely annoying as the rest of the products in my cosmetic bag got this cream on them. Will not be buying again only because of the container.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been putting it all over my face because that&#x27;s what I read on the review and my face feels a lot more smoother. I would recommend this to my friends and families. I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 weeks now and I can feel the big difference. Im almost out though, so I need to order another one. I put 2 or 3 dab on the tip of my finger. How long does one jar last anyways? That&#x27;s the only thing that I was a little  disappointed was that the jar is not full to the top. Its 3/4 full. Is that how its supposed to be?</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product, goes on soft and velvety, and really helps diminish fine lines</li>
            <li> Does not adequately moisturese</li>
            <li> New Creation Eye Cream is fabulous! Goes on smoothly, it does not built up, and it really improve your skin around your eyes. This cream really deserves the 5 stars. Great product, great results! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> nice product, reduces and softens lines around the eyes but is not so effective at reducing puffiness which it lays claim to do</li>
            <li> Pretty good eye cream !</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It has helped get rid of my crow&#x27;s feet at the corners of my eyes after two re-orders. I still need something for the little fine lines under the eyes. This keeps that area soft but I have not noticed as much difference there as I did with the crow&#x27;s feet. Those are almost totally gone. It did help keep the bags under my eyes from being puffy and the darkness there had eased up.</li>
            <li> Works great, just not enough of it for the price.</li>
            <li> It is a lovely light cream and works very, very well.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have eczema that occasionally flares up around my eyes, so I need to keep the area well moisturized yet most eye creams are too irritating for me to use.  This one does the trick.  Absolutely no skin irritation, yet it&#x27;s doing the job of keeping my skin moist while not clogging my pores.  Love it!</li>
            <li> this cream did not do anything for me so I won&#x27;t be buying this in the future.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old and I have tried a lot of products and to be honest... This did absolutely nothing for me!</li>
            <li> Ian didn&#x27;t helps with the puffiness under my eyes but the cream is light and not greasy and I like it more than my previous eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;And only need a very little amount and so this cream is not only likable it is also more inexpensive than other eye creams I highly recommended it, but I am not sure that it will help all customers with their puffiness problems</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this eye cream but I am disappointed. I have been using it for about a month and I was hoping it would help moisturize the areas around my eyes but it didn&#x27;t. My search continues for a good moisturizing eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product - it moisturizes - I have very sensitive eyes and this doesn&#x27;t irritate them at all.</li>
