    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>So all in all It works, but its not the best.</li>
            <li>My search for the perfect sunscreen continues.</li>
            <li>This product is recommended in WebMD and is rated as one of, if not the best for sun block.</li>
            <li>This is the best price I have found also.</li>
            <li>Very Happy.</li>
            <li>and it is a great product</li>
            <li>Nice smell though!</li>
            <li>so rub it in but best part smells great and great for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This feels nice</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re okay with rubbing it in a lot and just want it for a day at the beach, I suppose it could be good.</li>
            <li>After hearing about the dangers of chemical sunscreens on Dr Oz show decided to try this and am glad I did-</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is ok.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>SOME sun exposure without spf is healthy for keeping sleep cycles, hormones and body&#x27;s chemistry balanced.  </li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>It smells really good (5*).</li>
            <li>Creamy texture that is easy to apply, but you must rub it in well.  </li>
            <li>This all natural alternative was perfect for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and it feels light and smells like cucumbers</li>
            <li>I realize that I could put the sunscreen all over and solve that problem, but I bought this primarily for my face and neck area.  </li>
            <li>Dr Andrew Weil mentioned two important ingredients that a mechanical sunscreen (as opposed to chemical sunscreens) should have, Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide which are the mechanical blockers.</li>
            <li>I have kids with fair sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I usually love YTC products.</li>
            <li>The smell is potent, and not my favorite, but a usual popular favorite</li>
            <li>so its not really natural b/c if you read the label there are tons of chemical in it, but I love that its gluten free and not tested on animals which is more than most chemical sunscreens can say.</li>
            <li>bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other sunscreen products claim that do not leave a greasy feeling afterwards, and yet when I use those products,my face feels greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for some time, I was watching Dr. Oz and his special guest Dr Andrew Weil were talking about sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>aside,  ot seems just  as good as  any  regular  sunscreen  </li>
            <li>Can leave a whitish cast if not rubbed in quickly</li>
            <li>I like this one best so far of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens, but am personally still on the fence about using a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t do the same job blocking as the &amp;#34;un-natural&amp;#34; options, which I think do a better job preventing burns.</li>
            <li>Being a titanium-based block, it does leave a white tint on the skin which does not rub in, but this is what blocks the sun, and you need to use a fair amount of it to keep the burning rays out (4*).</li>
            <li>good sunscreen that absorbs much more easily than other physical sunscreens</li>
            <li>You do get a bit of a white cast like most physical sunscreens,but it is not bad, for fair skin, and absorbs pretty well otherwise.</li>
            <li>this product came right off.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of this to use on myself and my toddler; it is more liquid than most physical sunscreens, which was nice for application, but as soon as we started sweating even a little bit (and how often are you in the sun without sweating at all??)</li>
            <li>When you initially put on the product it smells amazingly like cucumbers and not that normal sunscreen smell, but after having it on a couple hours, it no longer smells like cucumbers and does smell like sunscreen...</li>
            <li>it stays put, even when i go run in hot humid weather it doesn&#x27;t sweat off.</li>
            <li>at first...</li>
            <li>or if someone is darker skinned, but that seems to be the case with most physical sunscreens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the smell is interested.</li>
            <li>I might purchase again, but it&#x27;s more likely that I won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>No complaints about it burning anyone&#x27;s eyes (5*).</li>
            <li>I love the fact that they&#x27;re all natural (or mostly natural), not tested on animals, and smell divine!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t cake; iIt was actually a little watery with the consistency of a lotion more than a &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; (4*).</li>
            <li>I think this would be a good daily facial sunscreen</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I would really like to return this product, but I am unsure if I can because I have already opened it.</li>
            <li>I was really unsure what star rating I wanted to give this product.</li>
            <li>I just had to have the whole line!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that with my children rubbing their eyes every time they came up from underwater, the white got rubbed through, and it needed to be reapplied to faces often for full benefit (3*)</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this sunscreen, since I am a fan of their other products.  </li>
            <li>The main issue I have with this product is the plastic smell that you feel together with the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly recommended so that&#x27;s why I bought it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but when you try to rub it in it does not spread far very well.</li>
            <li>and if you DO manage to get it rubbed in well, you still will look a shade or two lighter than you normally would.</li>
            <li>I normally like this brand, but every time I used this product it seemed like it took days to</li>
            <li>It is water-resistant, so much so that you definitely need to use a wash cloth to get it off at bath or shower time, and even then, I couldn&#x27;t get it all off (3*).</li>
            <li>The places where I did not apply foundation were very obvious-- around my eyebrows, right under my eyes, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great and rubs in clear on medium-light skin, but looses effectiveness in water and is difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen smells nice, but goes on dry and chalky, and if you have ANY dry skin at all, it will stick to the skin and turn completely white and won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out and might have even made my skin a little bit better.</li>
            <li>According to the specifications this is a 97% natural product.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I kept reapplying and was able to keep my little one from burning, but she definitely tanned that day, and we were only outside for a few hours, much of that in shade.</li>
            <li>Not the best, but by far not the worst either.</li>
            <li>The one down side is that it does not absorb very well,</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It can still leave a faint white tint to skin, but much better than other mineral based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> so well it is worth looking a little pale.</li>
            <li> goes on a little thick as it is full mineral sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells like cucumbers, but it has a strange rotten smell that lingers all day.  </li>
            <li> Every other sunscreen either bothers my eyes or skin and the same goes for my family.</li>
            <li> I will not continue to use due to white cast.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews about the YTC sunscreen and noticed many people saying it was very difficult to rub in.</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion, and it looks odd to have a white face and neck area that does not match the rest of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Even after about 30 minutes, the sunscreen left a thick white film on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not okay for a cosmetic-grade facial sunscreen if you want to apply it under makeup.</li>
            <li> Also if you don&#x27;t rub it in well you will have white spots left behind...</li>
            <li> how odd.</li>
            <li> I would give it 3 or less stars for easiness to apply product.</li>
            <li> The kid&#x27;s version is harder to spread, but at least it stays put for a little while when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> This is a purely physical sunscreen, without dangerous chemicals or a dangerously small active ingredient particle size, and because of this it does not go on clear.</li>
            <li> When I tried to apply my foundation over it, it started rubbing and peeling off, leaving unattractive little gobs all over my face.</li>
            <li> No problems at all even when I get a little close to the eyes during application.</li>
            <li> However, it is so hard to rub it in and even harder to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Too thick, hard to apply evenly and leaves white residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> had to take allergy pills for a few days )</li>
            <li> It works well in blocking rays, but too hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> To sunscreen with the hopes that the product would have at least one of the two mentioned.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> ( swollen red itchy skin :(</li>
            <li> it does leave a white-ish color behind like all zinc oxide sunscreens but it works and stays put</li>
            <li> ( I guess the base stays on but the block part couldn&#x27;t hold up to all the rubbing in the water).</li>
            <li> and then it is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After hearing about the dangers of chemical sunscreens on Dr Oz show decided to try this and am glad I did- good sunscreen that absorbs much more easily than other physical sunscreens and it feels light and smells like cucumbers</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this to use on myself and my toddler; it is more liquid than most physical sunscreens, which was nice for application, but as soon as we started sweating even a little bit (and how often are you in the sun without sweating at all??) this product came right off. I kept reapplying and was able to keep my little one from burning, but she definitely tanned that day, and we were only outside for a few hours, much of that in shade. I think this would be a good daily facial sunscreen but that&#x27;s about it. The kid&#x27;s version is harder to spread, but at least it stays put for a little while when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> it stays put, even when i go run in hot humid weather it doesn&#x27;t sweat off. it does leave a white-ish color behind like all zinc oxide sunscreens but it works and stays put so well it is worth looking a little pale.</li>
            <li> I bought this after researching sunscreens that do not contain harmful chemicals that can seep into the bloodstream and wreak havoc on the body (hormone disruption, carcinogenic, etc..).  I really wanted to like this sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t.  First of all, it smells terrible.  I don&#x27;t think it smells like cucumbers, but it has a strange rotten smell that lingers all day.  It also leaves a ghastly white residue on my skin.  I have an olive complexion, and it looks odd to have a white face and neck area that does not match the rest of my skin.  I realize that I could put the sunscreen all over and solve that problem, but I bought this primarily for my face and neck area.  I would really like to return this product, but I am unsure if I can because I have already opened it.</li>
            <li> According to the specifications this is a 97% natural product.  From  my research this doesn&#x27;t  contain chemicals  which are  thought to be harmful to  developing children.  This is why we have  been  using this  product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside,  ot seems just  as good as  any  regular  sunscreen  in  terms of water  resistance and protecting  against  sunburn.  Doesn&#x27;t  seem  unreasonably  oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works  well for us.</li>
            <li> I was really unsure what star rating I wanted to give this product. In effectiveness I would give it a 5 star, it does work as a sun block. I would give it a 5 star for the scent...at first... When you initially put on the product it smells amazingly like cucumbers and not that normal sunscreen smell, but after having it on a couple hours, it no longer smells like cucumbers and does smell like sunscreen...how odd. I would give it 3 or less stars for easiness to apply product. It seems to be the consistency of Eucerin lotion... but when you try to rub it in it does not spread far very well. Also if you don&#x27;t rub it in well you will have white spots left behind... and if you DO manage to get it rubbed in well, you still will look a shade or two lighter than you normally would. One last note... my husband ended up having an allergic reaction to it! ( swollen red itchy skin :( had to take allergy pills for a few days ) So all in all It works, but its not the best. I will not buy this again. My search for the perfect sunscreen continues.</li>
            <li> I have kids with fair sensitive skin and eczema. This product does not irritate their skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;Texture is creamy. Can leave a whitish cast if not rubbed in quickly or if someone is darker skinned, but that seems to be the case with most physical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This feels nice and I like that it&#x27;s natural. It&#x27;s highly recommended so that&#x27;s why I bought it. But had to return because it left a white color on my skin and I just couldn&#x27;t stand that.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is ok. Not the best, but by far not the worst either. The smell is potent, and not my favorite, but a usual popular favorite so you may like it. You do get a bit of a white cast like most physical sunscreens,but it is not bad, for fair skin, and absorbs pretty well otherwise. I will not be buying this again, but I would recommend it to others who like the feel of lotions and aren&#x27;t quite as picky as I am.</li>
            <li> goes on a little thick as it is full mineral sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell is interested.</li>
            <li> works well and it is a great product</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I usually love YTC products. I love the fact that they&#x27;re all natural (or mostly natural), not tested on animals, and smell divine! I read the reviews about the YTC sunscreen and noticed many people saying it was very difficult to rub in. When I saw the product on sale at Target, however, I couldn&#x27;t resist-- I just had to have the whole line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I regretted my decision and had to return the sunscreen. I have medium deep skin and let me tell you, this sunscreen looked like I was wearing a foundation 5 shades lighter! Even after about 30 minutes, the sunscreen left a thick white film on my face. When I tried to apply my foundation over it, it started rubbing and peeling off, leaving unattractive little gobs all over my face. The places where I did not apply foundation were very obvious-- around my eyebrows, right under my eyes, for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not okay for a cosmetic-grade facial sunscreen if you want to apply it under makeup. However, if you&#x27;re okay with rubbing it in a lot and just want it for a day at the beach, I suppose it could be good. YTC, please make something with 30 SPF that&#x27;s easier to rub in-- I can&#x27;t wait to buy it!</li>
            <li> I actually like this sunscreen, but I&#x27;m rating it with only three stars because I know others won&#x27;t. This is a purely physical sunscreen, without dangerous chemicals or a dangerously small active ingredient particle size, and because of this it does not go on clear. I&#x27;m the whitest person I&#x27;ve ever met, and this makes too pale/pink of a cast on my face. I would use this when running, or going to the beach, but I do not use it daily or under make up, as it comes off if anything is applied over it. I think this may have been discontinued anyways. I might purchase again, but it&#x27;s more likely that I won&#x27;t. Nice smell though!</li>
            <li> Creamy texture that is easy to apply, but you must rub it in well.  It can still leave a faint white tint to skin, but much better than other mineral based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Works, but was too pasty for me.</li>
            <li> I recently had an allergic reaction to spray on sunscreen.  This all natural alternative was perfect for my sensitive skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this sunscreen, since I am a fan of their other products.  This sunscreen smells nice, but goes on dry and chalky, and if you have ANY dry skin at all, it will stick to the skin and turn completely white and won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> The main issue I have with this product is the plastic smell that you feel together with the fragrance. You do not feel it until you put it on your skin and then it is terrible.</li>
            <li> Too thick, hard to apply evenly and leaves white residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased because of it&#x27;s natural ingredients. Only using it for a week so I cannot tell the result.   However, it is so hard to rub it in and even harder to wash it off. Also it makes me looks ghostly white. Thus I give it 3 stars. It has been put aside. Will not order it again.</li>
            <li> This product is recommended in WebMD and is rated as one of, if not the best for sun block. This is the best price I have found also. Very Happy.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out and might have even made my skin a little bit better.</li>
            <li> I normally like this brand, but every time I used this product it seemed like it took days to until I felt like I got all the sunscreen off my skin.  It works well in blocking rays, but too hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  About a year ago I was recommended this product by a coworker of mine who knows that I put on sunscreen quite a bit since we are outside quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other sunscreen products claim that do not leave a greasy feeling afterwards, and yet when I use those products,my face feels greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for some time, I was watching Dr. Oz and his special guest Dr Andrew Weil were talking about sunscreen.  Dr Andrew Weil mentioned two important ingredients that a mechanical sunscreen (as opposed to chemical sunscreens) should have, Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide which are the mechanical blockers. I went over to Yes To sunscreen with the hopes that the product would have at least one of the two mentioned.  I was surprised and ecstatic to see that the two active ingredients for Yes To sunscreen were the same two Dr Andrew Weil had mentioned.  Ever since then, this is the only sunscreen I use.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen works well. No problems there. Every other sunscreen either bothers my eyes or skin and the same goes for my family. Well, this one does not. No problems at all even when I get a little close to the eyes during application. YAY! The one down side is that it does not absorb very well, Yeah, we all end up with a bit of that ghost look. If that part can be changed without changing how it works and feels then I would give it 6 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural.  It does NOT contain oil.  It has 11% zinc oxide and 6.2% titanium oxide.  Those 2 are the only sun protection ingredients in it, incase your wondering. It is water resistant and it DOES leave a white cast.  It is 3 oz.  I will not continue to use due to white cast.  I know parents may like the cast so they can see when it may need re-applying when at waterparks and such.  SOME sun exposure without spf is healthy for keeping sleep cycles, hormones and body&#x27;s chemistry balanced.  Maybe not 3:00 in the afternoon in 106 degrees, but some sun on occasion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to all sunscreen but this one. It does makes skin white so rub it in but best part smells great and great for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Okay so its not really natural b/c if you read the label there are tons of chemical in it, but I love that its gluten free and not tested on animals which is more than most chemical sunscreens can say.</li>
            <li> Smells great and rubs in clear on medium-light skin, but looses effectiveness in water and is difficult to wash off. I have somewhat acne prone skin, and I cannot use it on my face.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen went on smoothly and didn&#x27;t cake; iIt was actually a little watery with the consistency of a lotion more than a &amp;#34;paste&amp;#34; (4*). It smells really good (5*). Being a titanium-based block, it does leave a white tint on the skin which does not rub in, but this is what blocks the sun, and you need to use a fair amount of it to keep the burning rays out (4*). It is water-resistant, so much so that you definitely need to use a wash cloth to get it off at bath or shower time, and even then, I couldn&#x27;t get it all off (3*). I found that with my children rubbing their eyes every time they came up from underwater, the white got rubbed through, and it needed to be reapplied to faces often for full benefit (3*) ( I guess the base stays on but the block part couldn&#x27;t hold up to all the rubbing in the water). No complaints about it burning anyone&#x27;s eyes (5*). I like this one best so far of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreens, but am personally still on the fence about using a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t do the same job blocking as the &amp;#34;un-natural&amp;#34; options, which I think do a better job preventing burns.</li>
