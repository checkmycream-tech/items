            <li>Getting it through Amazon was the best price.</li>
            <li>very happy with this product</li>
            <li>BEST SMELL</li>
            <li>giftset purchase is an extremely great value!!</li>
            <li>smells great</li>
            <li>Iam very pleased with my purchase of the quorum giftset.</li>
            <li>I used this cologne 20 years ago and remembered that I liked the scent.&lt;br /&gt;The cologne arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Nice woody scent,it well leave a trail 15 hours</li>
            <li>People still ask what I have on, it has a good clean scent and they like it.</li>
            <li>I have used Quorum after shave and cologne for 25 years and get many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it on a man</li>
            <li>The aftershave is pretty good in that it moisturizes and smells well...</li>
            <li>Love this scent -- fast to confirm and deliver.</li>
            <li>Great price for a hard to fine product.</li>
            <li>but I wish Puig was still making Quorum in the splash bottle form too as I liked a handful neck rub of this refreshing and green scented cologne.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t praise the great price alone for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>Price and quality right on target</li>
            <li>Quorum is very soapy for a clean character.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what was represented.</li>
            <li>But no it stands apart from the modern scents of today.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s also been a light spice note similar to anise.</li>
            <li>But it all respect nothing wrong with the sprayer as it pumps out a great mist nicer than a lot of pricier colognes I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Three out of five star smells really good kinda afraid to finish it</li>
            <li>Very manly,woodsy yet clean and can be pulled off in the most plain casual wear to a sharp looking suit it doesn&#x27;t discriminate.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very mossy and green leafy to my nose with a faint touch of pine.</li>
            <li> Let me start off the review with noting a few things that the packaging has changed on this giftset.</li>
            <li> In truth yes Quorum came out in the early 80&#x27;s but you can&#x27;t define it as a decade era scent because it fails to become outdated.</li>
            <li> At least to my knowledge as it&#x27;s vanished from stores in my area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have used Quorum after shave and cologne for 25 years and get many compliments on it.  Getting it through Amazon was the best price.</li>
            <li> I used this cologne 20 years ago and remembered that I liked the scent.&lt;br /&gt;The cologne arrived on time. Was exactly what was represented.</li>
            <li> very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Let me start off the review with noting a few things that the packaging has changed on this giftset.It&#x27;s more of a flashy maroon color now...no big deal.It&#x27;s entirely preference related on my end but I wish Puig was still making Quorum in the splash bottle form too as I liked a handful neck rub of this refreshing and green scented cologne.But it all respect nothing wrong with the sprayer as it pumps out a great mist nicer than a lot of pricier colognes I&#x27;ve owned.The aftershave is pretty good in that it moisturizes and smells well...like Quorom.Can&#x27;t praise the great price alone for a few reasons.The cologne alone is eighteen bucks at K-Mart.Secondly the aftershave of regular Quorum isn&#x27;t sold individually anymore,only with the set.At least to my knowledge as it&#x27;s vanished from stores in my area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does Quorum smell like?&lt;br /&gt;New to this scent are we? that&#x27;s okay.In truth yes Quorum came out in the early 80&#x27;s but you can&#x27;t define it as a decade era scent because it fails to become outdated.But no it stands apart from the modern scents of today.Quorum is very soapy for a clean character.It&#x27;s very mossy and green leafy to my nose with a faint touch of pine.Lastly some elegance induced with bergamot and to me there&#x27;s also been a light spice note similar to anise.Very manly,woodsy yet clean and can be pulled off in the most plain casual wear to a sharp looking suit it doesn&#x27;t discriminate.Hands down probably one of the finest inexpensive men&#x27;s colognes ever made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5-stars!</li>
            <li> Love this scent -- fast to confirm and deliver.</li>
            <li> Nice woody scent,it well leave a trail 15 hours</li>
            <li> Great price for a hard to fine product.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>

            <li> BEST SMELL YOU CAN BUY</li>
            <li> Purchased two sets of this for my Father.. He has been wearing Quorum since the 80&#x27;s!!  It has become increasingly more difficult to find &amp; if you can find it in Department stores, it is quite expensive!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This giftset purchase is an extremely great value!! won&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else!!</li>
            <li> Price and quality right on target</li>
            <li> People still ask what I have on, it has a good clean scent and they like it.</li>
            <li> smells great I absolutely love it on a man</li>
            <li> Three out of five star smells really good kinda afraid to finish it, I&#x27;ll buy againðŸ˜…</li>
