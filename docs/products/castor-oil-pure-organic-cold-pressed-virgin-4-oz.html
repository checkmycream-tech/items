            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic and I am now a believer.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very cheap and worth it!</li>
            <li>It has a squeeze top so each time I squeeze the oil out of the top and onto a q-tip, it leaves the whole top oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil, along with coconut oil in my hair for a little over a month and the growth that I&#x27;ve experienced is unreal!</li>
            <li>I love this oil I use it right along with coconut oil to help my hair and my daughter uses it as well.</li>
            <li>As far as shipping it arrived just as planned. :)</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil so that I could mix my own pre-shave oil (I wet shave)</li>
            <li>First of all, the bottle I received does not look like the picture.</li>
            <li>I have been satisfied w/ the results so far &amp; the product was modestly price.</li>
            <li>this stuff really doesn&#x27;t work and know it said keep using and give it time and use it every day</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this alone because it is a very drying oil .</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;Neutral scent, so it mixes nicely with other oils and a scented essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased it only about a month ago still need a few months to completely be sure how well it works.</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve been using it to cleanse my face along with sweet almond oil</li>

            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I don&#x27;t expect to run through a 4 oz bottle of this, since I mix equal parts with three other oils, I will definitely be back for this brand and size on the next round!</li>
            <li> it is very thick and pure.</li>
            <li> some of the other reviews say.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil along w/ 2 other so that I could begin an oil cleansing regimine.</li>

            <li> Like this product it&#x27;s going to last me at least 6 years for what I&#x27;m using it for</li>
            <li> so I use very little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for the product to come out.</li>
            <li> And I do mean EVERYTHING!!!</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have a blackhead problem on my nose and since using these oils (2 weeks) there 85% gone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell anything bad like</li>
            <li> disappointed maybe my hair just can&#x27;t grow</li>

            <li> Like this product it&#x27;s going to last me at least 6 years for what I&#x27;m using it for but it&#x27;s very cheap and worth it!</li>

            <li> Delivered on time. Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> I got my package and I was really pleased (: I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> it served its purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. First of all, the bottle I received does not look like the picture. It has a squeeze top so each time I squeeze the oil out of the top and onto a q-tip, it leaves the whole top oily. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a decent product. I don&#x27;t smell anything bad like some of the other reviews say. I purchased it for the purpose of making my eyebrows grow. They are growing in some places but not in others. Although I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously every single night. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery,and over all great product!</li>
            <li> This is the last time I tried this product, it does NOT work on me at all. There has been no growth on my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Its really nice in a convenient bottle :)</li>
            <li> I purchased it only about a month ago still need a few months to completely be sure how well it works. As far as shipping it arrived just as planned. :)</li>

            <li> its good for hair growth, and dryness, made my hair grow and shine....going to purchase again, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil, along with coconut oil in my hair for a little over a month and the growth that I&#x27;ve experienced is unreal! It&#x27;s like magic and I am now a believer. Lately I&#x27;ve been using it to cleanse my face along with sweet almond oil and it&#x27;s even better as a cleanser! I unfortunately have a blackhead problem on my nose and since using these oils (2 weeks) there 85% gone! Highly recommend this oil</li>
            <li> Shipped quick, product is great just as advertised! I use this and the argan oil (purchased from the same vendor) in my weekly hair treatments, and my hair LOVES it</li>
            <li> Exactlly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I use it for the oil cleansing method. I have dry skin so I use very little. Still have half of the bottle left since I bought it on the 2nd of april . I think it does its job when it comes to  cleansing. I wiped a cotton ball with witch hazel over my face  and no traces of dirt ,makeup or grime showed up after using the cleansing method. I use it with Extra virgin olive oil fyi.I wouldn&#x27;t use this alone because it is a very drying oil .</li>
            <li> i use fort the castor oil pack..it is the miracle oil</li>
