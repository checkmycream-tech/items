            <li>/&gt;Right now, with all of these tools, I can floss faster and more easily!  </li>
            <li>I love this product; don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s being discontinued.</li>
            <li>I especially liked the double packet order.</li>
            <li>When I want to floss under my bridges, I don&#x27;t want to have to hunt around for threaders and floss; so much more convenient to grab one of these and get the job done.</li>
            <li>I wore braces many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I have used this floss for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love this floss.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product, especially when you have a permanent retainer.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than threading a &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34; and using the finer Floss.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to floss everything without it.  </li>
            <li>I use the G-U-M Go Betweens back here, also, because they are perfect for clearing packed food from between my brackets and around the arch</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up, and you will find the solution that is best for you.the Superfloss and these Platypus flossers work almost equally well.  </li>
            <li>I use the G-U-M Go Betweens back here, also, because they are perfect for clearing packed food from between my brackets and around the arch</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll buy more when we need them.</li>
            <li>This item is excellent, however is not availble in the USA at the present time.</li>
            <li>Love this floss for the between the teeth where I have a permanent retainer.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this product and I am so glad he did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While oral b has older products with a built in threader that are great, they seem to be phasing them out for this.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use that I tend to use it more often than the Platypus</li>
            <li>It smooges and puffums into all ybe wee cracks and craggles till you feel squeegy clean!</li>
            <li>I have a Maryland bridge and need a way to keep the space between my gum and the top of my &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>Good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Thank you for a good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Good price fast shipping</li>
            <li>I can easily tell by feel where to place the Platypus under the wire between my brackets.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The tip is coated so it&#x27;s easy to get it between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I saw it was available on Amazon, I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t even fit under the arch wire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very good for threading through orthodontics, and the fibers spread out  for cleaning other places, too.</li>
            <li>Since this item was totally unavailable in my City, I ordered it and am well pleased!!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for very tight dental places to floss.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old son really love these for flossing his teeth between his braces!</li>
            <li>A good length to clean between multiple teeth with one piece.  </li>
            <li>I use this product daily to maintain good oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>It is costly and does not do as good a job as generic floss from the Dollar Tree store</li>
            <li>Not a bad prices for 100 strands.</li>
            <li>First, the thicker floss quickly shreds, and the strings can easily get caught between your teeth.</li>
            <li>Great for use with braces or other dental work.</li>
            <li>OralB Super floss mint precut is just what the dental hygienist ordered.  </li>
            <li>I started using these Super floss when i got my braces on and now 24 years after having them off, I STILL use them for my permanent retainers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nothing does the job as well as Super Floss.</li>
            <li>Without the OralB Super Floss, I have no idea how I would manage...  </li>
            <li>so you can very easily thread in-between the two teeth since you can&#x27;t floss teeth that have a permanent retainer from the top and go down.</li>
            <li>It also says it&#x27;s good for \\&quot;wide</li>
            <li>the Super Floss was exactly what the dentist recommended.</li>
            <li>I used to get this at a local pharmacy that would special order them, and I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not if you have the right tools.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not if you have the right tools.  </li>
            <li>It arrived before the expected date, it arrived in good condition, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier to have my favorite floss back.  </li>
            <li>Again, the Platypus flossers work best in the rear of my mouth where the brackets are spaced more widely apart due to the larger size of the molars.  </li>
            <li>Again, the Platypus flossers work best in the rear of my mouth where the brackets are spaced more widely apart due to the larger size of the molars.  </li>
            <li>I have had many issues with my teeth and as a result, I now have several implants and a bridge.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted .</li>
            <li>(it took about 15 minutes), but after the second night, I was able to floss with no problem at all.  </li>
            <li>I went from being in tears trying to floss my teeth to finally heaving a sigh of relief with a smile once I figured out how to keep my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>Received them much quicker than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>However, these flossers do NOT work when the brackets are placed very closely together.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The thicker section really does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is much better than the other precut waxed self threading floss.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and the price was lower than at our local drugstore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can hardly find them anymore in stores, so i am glad that Amazon carries them!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product if you need to floss bridges, implants or braces.</li>
            <li>Actually, I rinse and dry a piece of floss and use it a couple of more times.</li>
            <li>It works even better than the stiff threader my orthodontist provided.  </li>
            <li>My hygenist loves that I have these because the fuzzy portion cleans better than just plain floss</li>
            <li>I will definitely say the first night of flossing was a little interesting</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror.</li>
            <li>These little pieces of floss are SO easy to use and so efficient.</li>
            <li>It has been quite the journey during the first week getting used to them and all their &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34;:  the sores in my inner cheek, the difficulty eating food and eliminating certain foods I used to eat, and especially the challenge of keeping my teeth and gums</li>
            <li>With the stiff end I can easily get under the wires to floss.</li>
            <li>I find it useful for teeth that are close together, making them more difficult to floss.</li>
            <li>Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn&#x27;t able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  </li>
            <li>Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn&#x27;t able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  </li>
            <li>These flossers that are already threaded are so hard to find in stores, but they are great for lazy flossers like me.</li>
            <li>Exactly what and when I expected</li>
            <li>The ends are sufficiently hard to make it easy to thread through the space between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>I can easily thread its tiny, narrow, stiff end right in between the narrowest of crevices (under the arch wire) in order to floss.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that I couldn&#x27;t find these local,, but wasn&#x27;t thinking they would alter a product without changing the name:</li>
            <li>, I used it on a bridge that I did not want to thread regular floss, I would not buy it again as the attached floss is of poor quality as well when compared to top brands.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t ever cut my gum, really do a super job getting that last little bit of plaque on the back of that back tooth.&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-6-2106:  </li>

            <li> Not a bad prices for 100 strands.</li>
            <li> First, the thicker floss quickly shreds, and the strings can easily get caught between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Great for use with braces or other dental work.</li>
            <li> OralB Super floss mint precut is just what the dental hygienist ordered.  </li>
            <li> I started using these Super floss when i got my braces on and now 24 years after having them off, I STILL use them for my permanent retainers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nothing does the job as well as Super Floss.</li>
            <li> Without the OralB Super Floss, I have no idea how I would manage...  </li>
            <li> so you can very easily thread in-between the two teeth since you can&#x27;t floss teeth that have a permanent retainer from the top and go down.</li>
            <li> It also says it&#x27;s good for \\&quot;wide</li>
            <li> the Super Floss was exactly what the dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> I used to get this at a local pharmacy that would special order them, and I was glad to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not if you have the right tools.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not if you have the right tools.  </li>
            <li> It arrived before the expected date, it arrived in good condition, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier to have my favorite floss back.  </li>
            <li> Again, the Platypus flossers work best in the rear of my mouth where the brackets are spaced more widely apart due to the larger size of the molars.  </li>
            <li> Again, the Platypus flossers work best in the rear of my mouth where the brackets are spaced more widely apart due to the larger size of the molars.  </li>
            <li> I have had many issues with my teeth and as a result, I now have several implants and a bridge.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted .</li>
            <li> (it took about 15 minutes), but after the second night, I was able to floss with no problem at all.  </li>
            <li> I went from being in tears trying to floss my teeth to finally heaving a sigh of relief with a smile once I figured out how to keep my teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> Received them much quicker than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> However, these flossers do NOT work when the brackets are placed very closely together.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The thicker section really does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is much better than the other precut waxed self threading floss.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and the price was lower than at our local drugstore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can hardly find them anymore in stores, so i am glad that Amazon carries them!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product if you need to floss bridges, implants or braces.</li>
            <li> Actually, I rinse and dry a piece of floss and use it a couple of more times.</li>
            <li> It works even better than the stiff threader my orthodontist provided.  </li>
            <li> My hygenist loves that I have these because the fuzzy portion cleans better than just plain floss</li>
            <li> I will definitely say the first night of flossing was a little interesting</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror.</li>
            <li> These little pieces of floss are SO easy to use and so efficient.</li>
            <li> It has been quite the journey during the first week getting used to them and all their &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34;:  the sores in my inner cheek, the difficulty eating food and eliminating certain foods I used to eat, and especially the challenge of keeping my teeth and gums</li>
            <li> With the stiff end I can easily get under the wires to floss.</li>
            <li> I find it useful for teeth that are close together, making them more difficult to floss.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn&#x27;t able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  </li>
            <li> Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn&#x27;t able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  </li>
            <li> These flossers that are already threaded are so hard to find in stores, but they are great for lazy flossers like me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what and when I expected</li>
            <li> The ends are sufficiently hard to make it easy to thread through the space between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I can easily thread its tiny, narrow, stiff end right in between the narrowest of crevices (under the arch wire) in order to floss.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that I couldn&#x27;t find these local,, but wasn&#x27;t thinking they would alter a product without changing the name:</li>
            <li> , I used it on a bridge that I did not want to thread regular floss, I would not buy it again as the attached floss is of poor quality as well when compared to top brands.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t ever cut my gum, really do a super job getting that last little bit of plaque on the back of that back tooth.&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-6-2106:  </li>
            <li> Apparently it is no longer profitable enough so discontinued in the US.  </li>
            <li> Due to how my teeth need to move and rotate properly, my orthodontist placed the brackets on two adjoining teeth (on each side) very, very closely together, so the Platypus flosser does not fit at all in between these teeth because the space between the brackets is too narrow.  </li>
            <li> I have bridge work in my mouth that is not removable and is difficult to clean.  </li>
            <li> They are long, pre-cut strands, and I can move down to the next unused portion before I throw it away.</li>
            <li> Nice product, just a little bit awkward to use due to severe arthritis.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps all those frustrated souls who, like me, struggle with very crowded teeth and newly placed braces and who were beginning to think flossing effectively would be impossible.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps all those frustrated souls who, like me, struggle with very crowded teeth and newly placed braces and who were beginning to think flossing effectively would be impossible.  </li>
            <li> Now they are just limp chain woven strings that work no better than regular dental floss.. Very sad as I have loved the previous design.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected date and as described.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of precut threaded floss but none compare to OralB.  </li>
            <li> have tried the other brands and frankly they suck.  </li>
            <li> Delivery time was less than I expected (no complaints).  </li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with the OralB Super Floss; I don&#x27;t like that each strand has 2 different textures.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find at times locally.</li>
            <li> Not your typical floss.</li>
            <li> When I first got braces, I was really anxious to see how difficult it was going to be to floss.  </li>
            <li> thread breaks with little use</li>
            <li> The plastic end should be a little stronger.</li>
            <li> They are no longer made in the USA, and are no longer little strands of brushes.</li>
            <li> I have had to use a different floss to extract the broken floss bits out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> When i got them off in 1991, my orthodontist put permanent retainers behind my upper and lower teeth to prevent movement over the years (in addition to retainers I wear at night).  </li>
            <li> the part of the floss that&#x27;s thick is very very short &amp; it requires at least 2-3 strands to floss all my teeth</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;regular floss&amp;#34; end is awful--quite abrasive and stiff.  </li>
            <li> It has a stiff end</li>
            <li> Previously, using a floss threader was ok, but hated reusing the threader, and they were too expensive to throw away.</li>
            <li> Second, the longer portion of normal floss is terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get between teeth and can break.</li>
            <li> They are too thick and my teeth are still just as they were when I got the braces off, so i need these to get between without issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not what I thought they were , not that it is not a good product.</li>
            <li> The fuzzy end tends to get stuck on my brackets and the thin end is too thin and hurts the gums sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I was horrible about flossing (gross, I know) until I discovered these!</li>
            <li> packaging is also terrible, given that they wrap all individual flosses around a piece of cardboard</li>
            <li> the floss shredded and was useless  2.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really disappointed with</li>
            <li> This is the worst dental floss I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> What a terrible product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product; don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s being discontinued. Great for people with dental implants.</li>
            <li> the part of the floss that&#x27;s thick is very very short &amp; it requires at least 2-3 strands to floss all my teeth</li>
            <li> OralB Super floss mint precut is just what the dental hygienist ordered.  Works perfectly for very tight dental places to floss.</li>
            <li> Exactly what and when I expected</li>
            <li> Good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Just what the Dr ordered.</li>
            <li> Since this item was totally unavailable in my City, I ordered it and am well pleased!!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of precut threaded floss but none compare to OralB.  It is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and could no longer find it at local outlets so went on line to get it. I know of its efficacy from my own dental history and would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Works swell cleaning between caps and partials .</li>
            <li> This is much better than the other precut waxed self threading floss. Especially for the wider spaces under bridges!</li>
            <li> I like the thicker floss.</li>
            <li> Finally found where to get it.</li>
            <li> nothing like It too reach around bridges</li>
            <li> been using for 40 years and are great</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected date and as described. This is not the first time I&#x27;m using product and it was excellent. I especially liked the double packet order.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! My 13 year old son really love these for flossing his teeth between his braces! He has tried different flossing type things  and this product seems to be the easiest to use. The shipping was quick and the price was lower than at our local drugstore.</li>
            <li> thread breaks with little use, I used it on a bridge that I did not want to thread regular floss, I would not buy it again as the attached floss is of poor quality as well when compared to top brands.</li>
            <li> While oral b has older products with a built in threader that are great, they seem to be phasing them out for this. The threader works great, and I like the idea of a portion of thicker floss, but there are two majors flaws. First, the thicker floss quickly shreds, and the strings can easily get caught between your teeth. Second, the longer portion of normal floss is terrible. It&#x27;s hard to get between teeth and can break. I have had to use a different floss to extract the broken floss bits out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;regular floss&amp;#34; end is awful--quite abrasive and stiff.  The &amp;#34;super floss&amp;#34; end and threader are excellent.  A good length to clean between multiple teeth with one piece.  I use it around an implant and it works perfectly.  Just cut off the &amp;#34;regular floss&amp;#34; end.</li>
            <li> Received them much quicker than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product, good service.</li>
            <li> I have two bridges and super floss is the best way to clean them.  Unfortunately it is difficult to find in stores.  Delivery time was less than I expected (no complaints).  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Good price. The tip isn&#x27;t very good to thread through your teeth. The plastic end should be a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Great floss for people with a bridge. You don&#x27;t have to use those threaders.</li>
            <li> These flossers that are already threaded are so hard to find in stores, but they are great for lazy flossers like me. When I want to floss under my bridges, I don&#x27;t want to have to hunt around for threaders and floss; so much more convenient to grab one of these and get the job done.</li>
            <li> I wore braces many years ago.  When i got them off in 1991, my orthodontist put permanent retainers behind my upper and lower teeth to prevent movement over the years (in addition to retainers I wear at night).  I started using these Super floss when i got my braces on and now 24 years after having them off, I STILL use them for my permanent retainers.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the other brands and frankly they suck.  They are too thick and my teeth are still just as they were when I got the braces off, so i need these to get between without issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can hardly find them anymore in stores, so i am glad that Amazon carries them!</li>
            <li> I have used this floss for many years.  However, my local stores no longer carry the product.  When I saw it was available on Amazon, I ordered it.  It arrived before the expected date, it arrived in good condition, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier to have my favorite floss back.  It is great for cleaning under permanent tooth bridges as well as between all my teeth.</li>
            <li> The only floss my husband will use!!</li>
            <li> Love this floss.  With the stiff end I can easily get under the wires to floss.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find Super Floss in stores anymore, so I was happy to find it here. I have a Maryland bridge and need a way to keep the space between my gum and the top of my &amp;#34;tooth&amp;#34; clean and healthy. Nothing does the job as well as Super Floss. I&#x27;ll be upset if it becomes obsolete.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> As stated on the package, Oral-B Superfloss is ideal for braces and bridges. It also says it&#x27;s good for \\&quot;wide spaces\\&quot;. I find it useful for teeth that are close together, making them more difficult to floss. Actually, I rinse and dry a piece of floss and use it a couple of more times. They are long, pre-cut strands, and I can move down to the next unused portion before I throw it away.

            <li> I LOVE these for flossing under my permanent retainers! I was horrible about flossing (gross, I know) until I discovered these! I definitely would recommend them to anyone who has braces or retainers to floss around!</li>
            <li> These little pieces of floss are SO easy to use and so efficient. They don&#x27;t ever cut my gum, really do a super job getting that last little bit of plaque on the back of that back tooth.&lt;br /&gt;Update 6-6-2106:  I was surprised that I couldn&#x27;t find these local,, but wasn&#x27;t thinking they would alter a product without changing the name: WRONG!

            <li> Wonderful product, especially when you have a permanent retainer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this in stores in my area for months with no luck.  It&#x27;s perfect for braces and permanent retainers!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than threading a &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34; and using the finer Floss.  The ends are sufficiently hard to make it easy to thread through the space between the teeth.  And, the &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; floss works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am a 46-year-old woman who just got braces.  It has been quite the journey during the first week getting used to them and all their &amp;#34;friends&amp;#34;:  the sores in my inner cheek, the difficulty eating food and eliminating certain foods I used to eat, and especially the challenge of keeping my teeth and gums clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research on different orthodontics flossing devices, and I ending up buying Platypus orthodontic flossers along with Oral-B Superfloss, G.U.M. Go Betweens Proxabrushes, regular floss to be used occasionally with the threader from my orthodontist, and a 10X magnification mirror.  I went from being in tears trying to floss my teeth to finally heaving a sigh of relief with a smile once I figured out how to keep my teeth clean.  Here is what I have found works best:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Platypus flossers are wonderful, easy to use, and the easiest of all the flossers in terms of &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34;.  That is, I don&#x27;t have to look in the mirror to use them.  I can easily tell by feel where to place the Platypus under the wire between my brackets.  However, these flossers do NOT work when the brackets are placed very closely together.  This is the case with my bicuspids and cuspids.  Due to how my teeth need to move and rotate properly, my orthodontist placed the brackets on two adjoining teeth (on each side) very, very closely together, so the Platypus flosser does not fit at all in between these teeth because the space between the brackets is too narrow.  It won&#x27;t even fit under the arch wire!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that case, the Oral-B Superfloss is my perfect solution.  I can easily thread its tiny, narrow, stiff end right in between the narrowest of crevices (under the arch wire) in order to floss.  It works even better than the stiff threader my orthodontist provided.  I wouldn&#x27;t be able to floss everything without it.  It is so easy to use that I tend to use it more often than the Platypus flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my premolars and molars, both the Superfloss and these Platypus flossers work almost equally well.  Again, the Platypus flossers work best in the rear of my mouth where the brackets are spaced more widely apart due to the larger size of the molars.  I use the G-U-M Go Betweens back here, also, because they are perfect for clearing packed food from between my brackets and around the arch wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the other indispensable part of my flossing routine is the stand-up 10X magnification mirror. Before I ordered it from Amazon, I wasn&#x27;t able to see in the way back of my mouth where I needed to floss because my jaw is so narrow.  I needed both hands to separate my lips and cheek from the flossing area, and I couldn&#x27;t do that while holding a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, with all of these tools, I can floss faster and more easily!  I hope this helps all those frustrated souls who, like me, struggle with very crowded teeth and newly placed braces and who were beginning to think flossing effectively would be impossible.  It&#x27;s not if you have the right tools.  Don&#x27;t give up, and you will find the solution that is best for you.the Superfloss and these Platypus flossers work almost equally well.

            <li> Great for use with braces or other dental work. I wish they made floss that was just spongy, as part of this is.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily to maintain good oral hygiene.  It is perfect for those with caps or implants.</li>
            <li> As advertised...amazing floss for bridges.</li>
            <li> Works excellent with braces</li>
            <li> Nice product, just a little bit awkward to use due to severe arthritis. Very nice vendor, quick  shipment. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have bridge work in my mouth that is not removable and is difficult to clean.  This product works wonderful and cleans under my bridge work easily,  thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great service!</li>
            <li> If you have any kind of bridgework and need this kind of floss, this is the best kind around. It acts like a brush as you pull it through. Very easy to thread, too.</li>
            <li> gets to those different sized spaces between teeth that I have</li>
            <li> These were recommended by my dentist and for good reason.</li>
            <li> Good price fast shipping</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with the OralB Super Floss; I don&#x27;t like that each strand has 2 different textures.  The fuzzy end tends to get stuck on my brackets and the thin end is too thin and hurts the gums sometimes.  I prefer, and will go back to, the OralB Pro Health Glide Threader floss.</li>
            <li> Order was timely and product just as stated.  Great experience.</li>
            <li> These things are good for flossing you teeth if you have bridge work.  They hold up well getting between the teeth, under the bridge work.  They took a while getting here, but find out they came from the &amp;#34;UK&amp;#34;.  Looking on the box, they&#x27;re made in Ireland.  Thats great, not made in China!  We&#x27;ll buy more when we need them.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dentist.  It works well if you have bridge in your mouth.</li>
            <li> No problems whatever and the Super Floss was exactly what the dentist recommended.</li>
            <li> Finding a great way to clean my bridge is wonderful! Previously, using a floss threader was ok, but hated reusing the threader, and they were too expensive to throw away.</li>
            <li> Not a bad prices for 100 strands.</li>
            <li> This item is excellent, however is not availble in the USA at the present time.</li>
            <li> The plastic threader portion is a bit wimpy if you have to thread way in the back of the mouth. My hygenist loves that I have these because the fuzzy portion cleans better than just plain floss</li>
            <li> Was delivered in good shape.</li>
            <li> New stuff is great! Kindaike flossing with a silk worm caterpiller but better! It smooges and puffums into all ybe wee cracks and craggles till you feel squeegy clean!</li>
            <li> Love this floss for the between the teeth where I have a permanent retainer. Very easy to use and it&#x27;s like it has baking soda or something to help give it an extra scrub when flossing. Not your typical floss. It has a stiff end so you can very easily thread in-between the two teeth since you can&#x27;t floss teeth that have a permanent retainer from the top and go down. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If you have a bridge this floss is great. Can pass between the bridge and gums with no problem.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without it. I have bridges and this is the best way to floss them</li>
            <li> This is the worst dental floss I have ever used.  It is costly and does not do as good a job as generic floss from the Dollar Tree store</li>
            <li> Not what I thought they were , not that it is not a good product. The return policy can not be beat.</li>
            <li> What a terrible product.&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended to me by my dentist and I&#x27;m really disappointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;It is just a glorified floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is also terrible, given that they wrap all individual flosses around a piece of cardboard so good luck storing it...</li>
            <li> i have a bridge and this floss is the only one i use</li>
            <li> Very good for threading through orthodontics, and the fibers spread out  for cleaning other places, too.</li>
            <li> Good product. Ideal for bridges.</li>
            <li> Great product. Hard to find at times locally.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product for folks with bridgework. Apparently it is no longer profitable enough so discontinued in the US.  I was happy to find a supplier in the UK!</li>
            <li> I have had many issues with my teeth and as a result, I now have several implants and a bridge.  My dentist recommended this product and I am so glad he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It works.  It allows me to get under my bridge and my implants.  The thicker section really does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s easy to use.  The tip is coated so it&#x27;s easy to get it between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s high quality so it doesn&#x27;t shred.  I made the mistake of trying a cheaper store brand and two things happened:  1.  the floss shredded and was useless  2.  it loosened my bridge.  So I say you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you need to floss bridges, implants or braces.</li>
            <li> These are the best available for Bridgework.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected. Good for braces makes it easier to floss!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted .</li>
            <li> Best floss ever for people with braces.  When I first got braces, I was really anxious to see how difficult it was going to be to floss.  I will definitely say the first night of flossing was a little interesting (it took about 15 minutes), but after the second night, I was able to floss with no problem at all.  Without the OralB Super Floss, I have no idea how I would manage...  You need to buy this if you have braces!!</li>
            <li> just what the dentist ordered</li>
