            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much one can write on the virtues of soap itself, other than to note that, if one wants to be a member of a civilized society, soap is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than other soaps because of the aroma it exudes and the fragrance it leaves the bathroom.</li>

            <li> Love this soap! Tried switching to others, but keep going back. Moisture blast is great for winter, I would go for original during the summer.</li>
            <li> Wow what a great aroma. A friend had a bar of this soap but he did not remember which one he bought. So I found the right one and will buy this one again. It is also as it claims-moisture based.</li>
            <li> Quality product received as advertised.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like horse manure, which is my number one criteria when selecting soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much one can write on the virtues of soap itself, other than to note that, if one wants to be a member of a civilized society, soap is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, it smells good, the bars are &amp;#34;durable&amp;#34; (they don&#x27;t dissolve into mush the way some others do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is good, delivery is prompt.</li>
            <li> This is soap and, as such, it meets with my approval.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap.  What more can you say</li>
            <li> Nice pack of soap.  I like the scent it leaves on their skin.  I can clearly tell if the little guys washed as good as they need too!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and feel of this soap. If you&#x27;re buying this on Amazon, I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the best idea though. I got it for 50% less by going to a store. Thought that might be helpful to some, as I would have preferred to purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would not use any other soap...</li>
            <li> Better than other soaps because of the aroma it exudes and the fragrance it leaves the bathroom. It is a moisturizer in soap form .</li>
            <li> Good smell.  Latherrs good.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Great price</li>
            <li> They smell fantastic and I love of the clean sensation I get from using them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Irish Spring bar soap, what more of a review do you need?</li>
