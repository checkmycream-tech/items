            <li>, I ordered 4 more!!</li>
            <li>Good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Took a while to arrive, so better order it before summer hits!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice, lightweight sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Effective.</li>
            <li>Very easy application.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients, Uvinul t 150, Uvinul a plus and octinoxate provide good UVA and UVB protection, based upon available literature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect product for added protection that you can&#x27;t buy in American stores.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>No smell which I love.</li>
            <li>i love the water-based formula which goes on without any stickiness.</li>
            <li>Also love the size of the bottle</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look radiant and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>What the heck, I&#x27;m more worried about melanoma risk.</li>
            <li>Seller is highly responsive and courteous!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as ideal as others simply because the alcohol content causes my eyes to burn.</li>
            <li>But honestly, I think this is great for long days out in the sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and also moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and the shipment fee is free.</li>
            <li>, the spf30 feels like water putting on but this one you can definitely feel more thickness, however, if you are someone that have never used a japanese sunscreen before, this will still blown your mind, however I think for a spf50 sunscreen, this is already very good.</li>
            <li>And it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent, which is great for those of you who can&#x27;t really deal with smells very well.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Seller fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is not at all gel-like, but rather goes on like a thin lotion, perfect for arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on hot, sunny beach days</li>
            <li>considering the amount of activities i was doing and how long i was out in the sun(beach and in water), this did an outstanding job(but</li>
            <li>I think the description of &amp;#34;water gel&amp;#34; is a good one- its not a thick gel but a thin one- almost like an oil free face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Feels like literally applying a water gel that totally disappears with a light sheen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan and will be ordering again very soon.</li>
            <li>The last agent, octinoxate, is available here, but according to the EWG, has some endocrine and cell death concerns.  </li>
            <li>and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>But I would still purchase this considering the high spf, when i&#x27;m out vacaying in puerto rico, i have this on my face, i went climbing rain forests, and spend a whole week by the beach, scuba diving, snorkeling, just hanging out, face got just a tintsy bit tanned and that was it,</li>
            <li>Thanks for the little candy gift :)</li>
            <li>Recommendation is to buy 2 at a time because you will go through it quickly if you use 1/4 tsp on your face daily.</li>
            <li>But lucky us, we can get these newer sunscreens from importers for about the price of 20th century premium sunscreens here.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin like other US products.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it leaves you with a bit of a dewy finish, but I put powder foundation on after anyways, so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>I also really like that it has a such a high SPF!</li>
            <li>Good quality but takes to long to get it and super expensive for this size.</li>
            <li>I really love the fact that this doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on your face or have a heavy feel to it.</li>
            <li>This foot dragging has made it difficult for Americans to get good non-mineral UVA protection.  </li>
            <li>bit of social commentary:  The first two agents are not available in the US, thanks to inertia from the FDA, which has dragged its feet on approving sunscreens that passed muster a decade ago in Europe and Asia.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pale with oily skin, so this is a must have in the summer.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t broken me out which is a plus since I break out easily from a lot of sunscreens.</li>

            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken me out which is a plus since I break out easily from a lot of sunscreens.</li>
            <li> is a bit bigger than the average Asian sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small, but super watery and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Very thin and fresh!</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of mixed feeling about this, but i think it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m so used to using the spf30 sunscreen that the spf50 feels a little bit creamy on my face</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is for both face and body, however i only used it on my face, because the bottle is small,</li>
            <li> Also, not sticky like other suncreens</li>
            <li> It sinks into your skin really fast and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or weird.</li>
            <li> All I can say is all other sunscreens I have ever bought until now are in the trash!</li>
            <li> if you apply this on your body as well, you will go through this in a week(or less)</li>
            <li> Its different from typical beach thick lotions or sprays and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavily perfumed scent.</li>
            <li> After you put it on for a few minute it feels normal again like nothing is on my face, its just the beginning phase that makes me feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> 80gram is a little over 2oz, so</li>
            <li> the protection is not great if you use it for swim.</li>
            <li> so I can layer it under my makeup without an issue, and isn&#x27;t terrible for dabbing on later for touchups.</li>
            <li> Hmm.... 10$ for a mini lotion bottle seems rather expensive!</li>

            <li> This is the best sunblock I have ever used. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> All I can say is all other sunscreens I have ever bought until now are in the trash! I bought 1 of these - after trying it, I ordered 4 more!! Feels like literally applying a water gel that totally disappears with a light sheen. No white powdery residue like ALL the others. Totally sold! Excellent product. I don&#x27;t think I could ever use anything else!</li>
            <li> Perfect product for added protection that you can&#x27;t buy in American stores. A+</li>
            <li> Hmm.... 10$ for a mini lotion bottle seems rather expensive! Great on the skin, though!</li>
            <li> Ingredients in product</li>
            <li> Nice, lightweight sunscreen.  Hasn&#x27;t broken me out which is a plus since I break out easily from a lot of sunscreens.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is amazing. A friend came back from Japan and told me I had to get some. I&#x27;m super pale with oily skin, so this is a must have in the summer. It&#x27;s not greasy so I can layer it under my makeup without an issue, and isn&#x27;t terrible for dabbing on later for touchups. I&#x27;ve used it on hot, sunny beach days and it actually works. Took a while to arrive, so better order it before summer hits!</li>

This sunscreen is for both face and body, however i only used it on my face, because the bottle is small, 80gram is a little over 2oz, so if you apply this on your body as well, you will go through this in a week(or less) probably lol</li>
            <li> Very easy application.  Does not leave a film or white cast on my skin.  I&#x27;m a fan and will be ordering again very soon.</li>
            <li> Good quality but takes to long to get it and super expensive for this size.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Excellent product! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This product provides great protection against sunburn. Also, not sticky like other suncreens. I just think you need to put moisturizer underneath because it doesn&#x27;t give enough moisture if used alone.</li>
            <li> I really love the fact that this doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast on your face or have a heavy feel to it. It&#x27;s light and also moisturizing. No smell either!</li>
            <li> Lightweight. Non-greasy. Effective. Love it.</li>
            <li> great shipment speed from Japan to USA. and the shipment fee is free. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen. It&#x27;s not as ideal as others simply because the alcohol content causes my eyes to burn. There is a competitor brand that is the same consistency and protection that does not burn.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee it. Not sticky at all. No smell which I love. Gel like. My entire family rely on it. Would def buy it again.</li>
            <li> i love the water-based formula which goes on without any stickiness. i use this for non-swim outdoor protection because regular sunscreen just makes me too sticky. the protection is not great if you use it for swim.</li>
            <li> Very thin and fresh! Love it! Applying to face is a good choice! Thanks for the little candy gift :)</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen! Only complaint is that it leaves you with a bit of a dewy finish, but I put powder foundation on after anyways, so it&#x27;s all good. Also love the size of the bottle is a bit bigger than the average Asian sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Light weight and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin like other US products. Keep my skin from burning. It makes my skin look radiant and healthy. Seller is highly responsive and courteous! 2 thumps up!</li>
            <li> the best sun protection product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s very small, but super watery and a little goes a long way. I only use it for my body, because I prefer thicker sunscreen for my face. But honestly, I think this is great for long days out in the sun. And it really doesn&#x27;t have a scent, which is great for those of you who can&#x27;t really deal with smells very well.</li>
            <li> LOVE. Non-clogging and protects beautifully. Recommendation is to buy 2 at a time because you will go through it quickly if you use 1/4 tsp on your face daily. Seller fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Bought this in Tokyo because we were walking all day, every day in the sun. This sunscreen is not at all gel-like, but rather goes on like a thin lotion, perfect for arms and legs.  We were sweating, but it seemed to keep us from burning. The UVA part I just had to take on faith since you can&#x27;t judge your exposure based upon tanning or burning.  The ingredients, Uvinul t 150, Uvinul a plus and octinoxate provide good UVA and UVB protection, based upon available literature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of social commentary:  The first two agents are not available in the US, thanks to inertia from the FDA, which has dragged its feet on approving sunscreens that passed muster a decade ago in Europe and Asia.  This foot dragging has made it difficult for Americans to get good non-mineral UVA protection.  But lucky us, we can get these newer sunscreens from importers for about the price of 20th century premium sunscreens here.  The last agent, octinoxate, is available here, but according to the EWG, has some endocrine and cell death concerns.  What the heck, I&#x27;m more worried about melanoma risk. Cheers.</li>
            <li> I like to try all different kinds of sunblock and I really like this one.Its different from typical beach thick lotions or sprays and it doesn&#x27;t have a heavily perfumed scent. I think the description of &amp;#34;water gel&amp;#34; is a good one- its not a thick gel but a thin one- almost like an oil free face moisturizer. It feels refreshing! It sinks into your skin really fast and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or weird. There is a bit of color to it when you squeeze it out, but it almost instantly goes away as soon as you start rubbing it in. I attached some photos of the process. I also really like that it has a such a high SPF!</li>
            <li> The best product I ever used. Great shopping experienced!</li>
