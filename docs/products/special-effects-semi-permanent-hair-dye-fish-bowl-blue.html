    <ol>
            <li>Great colour!</li>
            <li>&lt;3</li>
            <li>Still the best alternative hair dye colour I have found.</li>
            <li>It faded beautifully.</li>
            <li>so it was great.</li>
            <li>and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>works great, great color</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Special Effects!!!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, and a great product!</li>
            <li>Either way, I am LOVING this color.</li>
            <li>and they had a really nice contrast.</li>
            <li>This is no reflection on the seller, very quick shipping!</li>
            <li>And everyone asked how did I get such a bright beautiful shade on my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong dye which would be most effectively applied to pre-bleached hair.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and often get asked what I use.</li>
            <li>More of a light turquoise.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more special fx.</li>
            <li>The Fishbowl color turned out a beautiful teal blue, and I wish I had used it exclusively.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a colour this light!</li>
            <li>I added a touch of iguana green to it to make it a more pronounced turquoise and it was perfect, special effects is my go to brand for dye</li>
            <li>Once you have a clean slate, put your Special Effects color on where you want it, we use a toothbrush, gloves, and hair clips.</li>
            <li>You can however use the Special Effects hair color on unbleached hair too, it will just have a darker shades.</li>
            <li>I find that special fx stays in longer and adds to health of my over processed hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter already has bright blonde hair.</li>
            <li>The colors are true to their color swatches.</li>
            <li>I put the dye on and kept it in much longer than the recommended 15-30 minutes, as per advice I found on the web, more like 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>It comes out really pretty for really light hair.</li>
            <li>They look bright and vibrant over bleached hair, but they look amazing, deep, and rich over darker, natural hair.</li>
            <li>(I have dyed my hair successfully using other brands and have never had this issue.)</li>
            <li>Overall, I loved the color and Special Effects brand, would definitely use again.</li>
            <li>This came exactly as advertised and just the way the reviews recommended it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love this blue!</li>
            <li>If you want the color described in the picture you will need to bleach your hair first.</li>
            <li>This color washes out really fast!</li>
            <li>This was my first time dying my hair something so colorful, and it worked better than expected.</li>
            <li>We always bleach the hair we want to color first to insure good color and long lasting results.</li>
            <li>A pretty good hair dye, but it doesnt last very long.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t stain surfaces very bad,as long as you have soap and warm water near by.</li>
            <li>It kept it&#x27;s color nice for 2 months, fading a little bit to a lighter teal.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re bright, vibrant, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>When I received my package this morning, the entire bag was filled with dye and had leaked through the package and onto my skin &amp; clothes (mind you, I had this delivered to my job)</li>
            <li>i really like this hair dye.</li>
            <li>Parts were nice and parts were chlorine green.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wanted blue hair since I was a child, I just hadn&#x27;t come across the right shade of blue for me, so I was very excited to find this one.</li>
            <li>After bleaching my hair, I used Blue Velvet and Fishbowl Special Effects hair colors.</li>
            <li>This is a good blue for a vibrant blue but not a neon blue, I used it with Manic Panic Electric Lizard and did halfsies on my head with them</li>
            <li>This vendor shipped to me quickly, I will likely use this vendor again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a deep, rich blue.</li>
            <li>We used this on lightly bleached hair and it didn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li>Special Effects is worth the price because a little goes a long way with these colors.</li>
            <li>Proof in the pudding as far as strength of the product was the fact that I got some on my bathroom sink, and it still hasn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>I have found thus far.</li>
            <li>Whenever I go out into the sun, even after freshly dying my hair, my hair just turns back to blonde.</li>
            <li>I have been dying my hair crazy colors for almost a decade, and I have never found a better hair color than Special Effects.</li>
            <li>Used exactly as according to package, dye washed out immediately, leaving absolutely no color.</li>
            <li>Maybe bleaching even a natural blonde would have worked better, but not worth the risk of having green hair.</li>
            <li>Lasted a little over two weeks on freshly bleached hair with regular shampooing.</li>
            <li>The color looks blue in the bottle, it looks blue when you first put it on, but within a week it turns seaweed green.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t believe there is enough left to actually dye my hair, but I hope so. :\</li>
            <li> I even mixed it 50/50 with electric blue and its still turned green.    </li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t last as long as other brands, but it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my pillows and clothes whether my hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Which, by the way, fades it to a bit of a pale greenish blue color, but I expected that with the yellow bleached hair undernieth.</li>
            <li> We usually sleep overnight in the hair color, leaving it on as long as possible.</li>
            <li> lasted longer than other brands we had tried</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t turn green like blue usually does on bleached hair</li>
            <li> Small bottle , if you have long hair or a lot of hair recommend getting 2 maybe even 3</li>
            <li> Wont work over dark hair, be warned.</li>
            <li> On non-bleached hair, its not a bright as it looks in the picture, but its still blue, on me, it&#x27;s almost grayish, but I like it.</li>
            <li> it made my hair really soft, but it turned green instead of blue due to bad bleaching.</li>
            <li> Having little or no patience, I just combed it into my mohawk, and my girlfriend assured me that it was showing up just like on the label.</li>
            <li> Worked well but was definitely green, faded withing a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I washed out in like a day and had residue of green for weeks.</li>
            <li> It stayed for a long time, with washing it every third day, using cold water.</li>
            <li> I have used both RAW, manic panic and punky hair dyes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember if I used this one in the past.</li>
            <li> Faded very unevenly.</li>
            <li> so I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Just used this stuff tonight, doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other dyes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> Used exactly as according to package, dye washed out immediately, leaving absolutely no color. (I have dyed my hair successfully using other brands and have never had this issue.)</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, and a great product! (:</li>
            <li> This came exactly as advertised and just the way the reviews recommended it. It&#x27;s a strong dye which would be most effectively applied to pre-bleached hair. Having little or no patience, I just combed it into my mohawk, and my girlfriend assured me that it was showing up just like on the label. Proof in the pudding as far as strength of the product was the fact that I got some on my bathroom sink, and it still hasn&#x27;t come out. This stuff works!!!</li>
            <li> Great colour! It&#x27;s not a deep, rich blue. More of a light turquoise. Lasted a little over two weeks on freshly bleached hair with regular shampooing. Not bad for a colour this light! I have a feeling repeated use in same spot would extend its lifetime. It didn&#x27;t stain my pillow covers or shower. Paired with Deep Purple in attached picture.</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t last as long as other brands, but it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my pillows and clothes whether my hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Really Vibrant and after it faded to a slightly greenish blue it matched my eyes.</li>
            <li> The color looks blue in the bottle, it looks blue when you first put it on, but within a week it turns seaweed green.  I even mixed it 50/50 with electric blue and its still turned green.    I gave it 3 stars only because it should really be labeled sea foam green, not blue.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair crazy colors for almost a decade, and I have never found a better hair color than Special Effects. The colors are true to their color swatches. They&#x27;re bright, vibrant, and long lasting. They look bright and vibrant over bleached hair, but they look amazing, deep, and rich over darker, natural hair. Special Effects is worth the price because a little goes a long way with these colors. I absolutely LOVE Special Effects!!!!! &lt;3</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT. And everyone asked how did I get such a bright beautiful shade on my hair. It faded beautifully. It didn&#x27;t turn green like blue usually does on bleached hair so it was great. I love this brand and often get asked what I use.</li>
            <li> Small bottle , if you have long hair or a lot of hair recommend getting 2 maybe even 3</li>
            <li> Worked well but was definitely green, faded withing a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Washed out after 4 shampoos. Faded very unevenly. Not enough pigment.</li>
            <li> We used this on lightly bleached hair and it didn&#x27;t last long at all.  So we bleached the hair almost white and it looks great.  This is no reflection on the seller, very quick shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this blue! I added a touch of iguana green to it to make it a more pronounced turquoise and it was perfect, special effects is my go to brand for dye</li>
            <li> We always bleach the hair we want to color first to insure good color and long lasting results. You can however use the Special Effects hair color on unbleached hair too, it will just have a darker shades. If you want the color described in the picture you will need to bleach your hair first. I have always used Born to be Blonde Maxi Blonde hair stripper, this is the one for blackest hair. There is also Ultra Blue Born to be Blonde this one is for brown and lighter shades of hair. Once you have a clean slate, put your Special Effects color on where you want it, we use a toothbrush, gloves, and hair clips. We usually sleep overnight in the hair color, leaving it on as long as possible. When washing your hair keep in mind you will need to touch up your color especially on the tips and roots every once in awhile. It is the longest lasting brand of hair color I have found thus far.</li>
            <li> Just used this stuff tonight, doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as other dyes I&#x27;ve tried. Also doesn&#x27;t stain surfaces very bad,as long as you have soap and warm water near by. On non-bleached hair, its not a bright as it looks in the picture, but its still blue, on me, it&#x27;s almost grayish, but I like it. I&#x27;ve wanted blue hair since I was a child, I just hadn&#x27;t come across the right shade of blue for me, so I was very excited to find this one. I bought from Fatal Impact, it shipped the next day and arrived about two days later. I would have used this product sooner, but I had to wait for the last temp color to wash out before putting in the blue. Either way, I am LOVING this color.</li>
            <li> A pretty good hair dye, but it doesnt last very long. I had white blonde hair and it only lasted 2 or 3 washes before it was nearly back to being blonde. Wont work over dark hair, be warned.</li>
            <li> This was my first time dying my hair something so colorful, and it worked better than expected. After bleaching my hair, I used Blue Velvet and Fishbowl Special Effects hair colors. I put the dye on and kept it in much longer than the recommended 15-30 minutes, as per advice I found on the web, more like 2-3 hours. The Fishbowl color turned out a beautiful teal blue, and I wish I had used it exclusively. It stayed for a long time, with washing it every third day, using cold water. It kept it&#x27;s color nice for 2 months, fading a little bit to a lighter teal.  It might have even gone longer, but I&#x27;m trying to wash it out now. Which, by the way, fades it to a bit of a pale greenish blue color, but I expected that with the yellow bleached hair undernieth. Overall, I loved the color and Special Effects brand, would definitely use again.</li>
            <li> works great, great color</li>
            <li> Whenever I go out into the sun, even after freshly dying my hair, my hair just turns back to blonde. I&#x27;ve done this three times now.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t remember if I used this one in the past. My daughter already has bright blonde hair. I sectioned her ends into 3 parts and applied generously. Parts were nice and parts were chlorine green. I washed out in like a day and had residue of green for weeks. I would not use this one again. Maybe bleaching even a natural blonde would have worked better, but not worth the risk of having green hair.</li>
            <li> I have had streaked blue/green hair for  about five months now. I have used both RAW, manic panic and punky hair dyes. I find that special fx stays in longer and adds to health of my over processed hair. I will be purchasing more special fx. This vendor shipped to me quickly, I will likely use this vendor again. The only reason I have given this four star instead of five was because it still washed out sooner than I had hoped for. Still the best alternative hair dye colour I have found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to dye my hair this color blue for some time and decided to go ahead and order it. When I received my package this morning, the entire bag was filled with dye and had leaked through the package and onto my skin &amp; clothes (mind you, I had this delivered to my job) so I am not happy at all. I don&#x27;t believe there is enough left to actually dye my hair, but I hope so. :\</li>
            <li> lasted longer than other brands we had tried</li>
            <li> This is a good blue for a vibrant blue but not a neon blue, I used it with Manic Panic Electric Lizard and did halfsies on my head with them and they had a really nice contrast.</li>
            <li> i really like this hair dye. it made my hair really soft, but it turned green instead of blue due to bad bleaching. It comes out really pretty for really light hair.</li>
            <li> This color washes out really fast!</li>
