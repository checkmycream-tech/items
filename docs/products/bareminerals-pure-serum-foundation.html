            <li>It goes on very smooth an lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It is the first time I bought a separate brush to apply it, and find it is very handy to apply.</li>

            <li>Love BareMinerals and</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>So light and doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the way the product feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>You will love it..</li>
            <li>I do like the brush and hope to be able to use that with my Clinique foundation that I&#x27;m returning to.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such perfect coverage as I have with these products!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many more color options than the powder foundations.</li>
            <li>I re-blended it with the brush and it looked better -</li>
            <li>I think it would do better if I didn&#x27;t have oily skin.</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; light.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.....</li>
            <li>You will love it!&lt;br /&gt;: )</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like this foundation better than most that I tried.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Seller, great product hope you have more on hand.</li>
            <li>I love the texture.</li>
            <li>I got some originally from Ulta and have really liked it.</li>
            <li>So I will be trying it with a light layer of minerals veil on top.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too pricey not to be happy with it completely</li>
            <li>He also said it doesn&#x27;t work great on everyone, he was honestly surprised at how well it worked on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and is not heavy.  </li>
            <li>Some days it would come out perfect - other days</li>
            <li>it is so easy to apply and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>You can adjust the amount of coverage easily.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin as good as the new tinted moisturizer that just came out.</li>
            <li>I typically use a foundation brush, but I think this is probably best applied with a sponge given its liquidity.  </li>
            <li>I also found the colors to appear differently than the image, so best check it out in the store first before ordering.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months now and am very pleased!  </li>
            <li>Delivery great product good but do not like hard plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>It does go on smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth Transaction -</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Foundation went on and blended in quickly, smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>Its light weight and has sunscreen also.</li>
            <li>It is light on your face , but the smell is  what didn&#x27;t sell me .</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Minerals for years and this new product is so wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned (neutral) and use the bare beige and light beige.</li>
            <li>As usual, this product is great too!</li>
            <li>Not so great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Washes off cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Comes out kind of fast when you first take the cap off.</li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to love this makeup - it does not wear well.  </li>
            <li>Love it thank you for fast shipping</li>
            <li>I suspect this foundation may work well for someone who also uses mineral powder on top of foundation, but I find that to be way too much caked on make-up</li>
            <li>so prefer liquid foundation only over a good primer.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and most foundations, even in the lightest color, are usually to dark for me and its obvious I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li>This result is a much more natural look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this new foundation just as much as I love all the Bare Minerals products.</li>
            <li>Love this product and bare essentials!</li>
            <li>I love all bare minerals products!</li>
            <li>Love all Bare Mineral products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great, especially when you want a little more coverage.  </li>
            <li>It was so nice to put on a liquid foundation with a brush rather than my hands or a cheap cotton pad that absorbs half the foundation anyway.  </li>
            <li>I like this much better than the bare minerals powder makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals powder foundation for years and wasn&#x27;t sure If I would like the liquid.  </li>
            <li>I love bare minerals serum.  </li>
            <li>May try again when I found my exact right shade.</li>
            <li>I GAVE 2 STARS BECAUSE IT ARRIVED SUPER FAST.</li>
            <li>it is smooth and silky and very natural looking on the skin.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first</li>
            <li>Feels light and not heavy like some foundations.</li>
            <li>The powder does such a better job</li>
            <li>I believe this bottle could last two years or more.  </li>
            <li>Even my similarly priced Clinique foundation does a better job with coverage than this stuff.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Blends very well with my skin color, a first for any makeup.  </li>
            <li>, IT MAY NOT BE REAL BARESKIN....</li>
            <li>I WAS VERY DISAPOONTED.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover.</li>
            <li>I also did not feel that it provided much coverage.  </li>
            <li>I am ready to purchase back-ups</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to wear it any longer due to this.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this at Sephora and was color matched by one of their specialists in August when I had a deep tan.</li>
            <li>I  didn&#x27;t see where this makeup covered any better than other makeup I&#x27;ve used .  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even take one full drop to cover my entire face.  </li>
            <li>I just had to try this new makeup!  </li>
            <li>the consistency of the foundation is very watery, light to your skin, but minimal coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly suggest going and trying this stuff out before buying it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this foundation but have to say that after shaking it up considerably before applying, it goes on VERY watery.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found a new NON MESSY makeup .</li>
            <li>I think perhaps as a summertime make-up, I can see how this might be a good choice as it doesn&#x27;t cake on and allows your skin to breathe &amp; perspire if need be, but the &amp;#34;bareskin&amp;#34; label I was hoping would LOOK and FEEL like bare skin but not actually be such a minimal amount of make-up that what you are basically showing IS your bare skin.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone looking to try something new.</li>
            <li>I just got this new foundation and the matching brush</li>
            <li>I love this liquid foundation especially when I use a moisturizer has an SPF that never really dries.</li>
            <li>Very natural you don&#x27;t feel like  you&#x27;r wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li>I use it every day, leaves my complexion looking soft and smoother.</li>
            <li>Wow; everybody should try it.  </li>
            <li>iTS COMPLETE OIL THAT COMES OUT WITH A BIT OF COLOR.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It was too drying for my mature skin.</li>
            <li>It is very watery which threw me at first, hard to squeeze out of the bottle also.  </li>
            <li>Bare minerals never disappoints.</li>
            <li>Those did not really help much.  </li>
            <li>This time I went onto the Bare Minerals website and tried to match the foundation closest to my skin tone and</li>
            <li>Nice coverage but weird lardy smell makes it unwearable.</li>
            <li>Back to Bare Minerals in the morning.</li>
            <li>I bought a different brush from the  Bare Minerals one they recommend.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really great, especially when you want a little more coverage.  </li>
            <li> It was so nice to put on a liquid foundation with a brush rather than my hands or a cheap cotton pad that absorbs half the foundation anyway.  </li>
            <li> I like this much better than the bare minerals powder makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals powder foundation for years and wasn&#x27;t sure If I would like the liquid.  </li>
            <li> I love bare minerals serum.  </li>
            <li> May try again when I found my exact right shade.</li>
            <li> I GAVE 2 STARS BECAUSE IT ARRIVED SUPER FAST.</li>
            <li> it is smooth and silky and very natural looking on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first</li>
            <li> Feels light and not heavy like some foundations.</li>
            <li> The powder does such a better job</li>
            <li> I believe this bottle could last two years or more.  </li>
            <li> Even my similarly priced Clinique foundation does a better job with coverage than this stuff.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Blends very well with my skin color, a first for any makeup.  </li>
            <li> , IT MAY NOT BE REAL BARESKIN....</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPOONTED.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover.</li>
            <li> I also did not feel that it provided much coverage.  </li>
            <li> I am ready to purchase back-ups</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be able to wear it any longer due to this.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this at Sephora and was color matched by one of their specialists in August when I had a deep tan.</li>
            <li> I  didn&#x27;t see where this makeup covered any better than other makeup I&#x27;ve used .  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even take one full drop to cover my entire face.  </li>
            <li> I just had to try this new makeup!  </li>
            <li> the consistency of the foundation is very watery, light to your skin, but minimal coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly suggest going and trying this stuff out before buying it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this foundation but have to say that after shaking it up considerably before applying, it goes on VERY watery.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found a new NON MESSY makeup .</li>
            <li> I think perhaps as a summertime make-up, I can see how this might be a good choice as it doesn&#x27;t cake on and allows your skin to breathe &amp; perspire if need be, but the &amp;#34;bareskin&amp;#34; label I was hoping would LOOK and FEEL like bare skin but not actually be such a minimal amount of make-up that what you are basically showing IS your bare skin.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> I just got this new foundation and the matching brush</li>
            <li> I love this liquid foundation especially when I use a moisturizer has an SPF that never really dries.</li>
            <li> Very natural you don&#x27;t feel like  you&#x27;r wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, leaves my complexion looking soft and smoother.</li>
            <li> Wow; everybody should try it.  </li>
            <li> iTS COMPLETE OIL THAT COMES OUT WITH A BIT OF COLOR.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It was too drying for my mature skin.</li>
            <li> It is very watery which threw me at first, hard to squeeze out of the bottle also.  </li>
            <li> Bare minerals never disappoints.</li>
            <li> Those did not really help much.  </li>
            <li> This time I went onto the Bare Minerals website and tried to match the foundation closest to my skin tone and</li>
            <li> Nice coverage but weird lardy smell makes it unwearable.</li>
            <li> Back to Bare Minerals in the morning.</li>
            <li> I bought a different brush from the  Bare Minerals one they recommend.  </li>
            <li> I usually add a little of the Bare Minerals powder foundation on top, but I have terribly uneven skin tone with lots of age spots.</li>
            <li> I like other bare Minerals foundations but not this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thin and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But it has an odd odor, that last all day.</li>
            <li> I bought another brush just in  case they discontinue or I loose mine!</li>
            <li> and there is a strong unpleasant smell to this makeup.</li>
            <li> Not impressed for the price and not impressed given that BareMinerals typically makes a good product.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and covers evenly.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no problems with my skin as I&#x27;ve had with other liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> iT WAS HARD TO FIND LOCALLY.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that in areas where I didn&#x27;t apply my blush, if I touch it, it comes off on my fingers, and feels a little wet and sticky.  </li>
            <li> This base really gives your skin a professional - looking finish.</li>
            <li> There is little mess with the liquid versus the powder.  </li>
            <li> For instance, if I build it to get coverage on a little brown spot (because it won&#x27;t cover them with one application)  </li>
            <li> It can also be messy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it for a few applications, but returned the product.</li>
            <li> and I have the coverage I need without the heavy makeup look.  </li>
            <li> Stays put all day and doesn&#x27;t leave me with shinny, oily skin after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little to cover your face -</li>
            <li> No more fingerpaint.</li>
            <li> Not sure why-</li>
            <li> NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is just the bottle I purchased or all of them.</li>
            <li> Just had to try it since the mineral powder is not good for me.</li>
            <li> the bottle is tough to squeeze-</li>
            <li> I mean you HAVE to try it!</li>
            <li> However if you&#x27;re looking for coverage, it&#x27;s extremely thin.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with the results like I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> At football game and it begain to peel off as if my skin was peeling.</li>
            <li> To thin wish I cld return it</li>
            <li> I think I picked the wrong color.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of allergies and was afraid to change my makeup, but I have no problems</li>
            <li> Was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am just too stupid to figure out how to use bottle.</li>
            <li> The smell is so nasty, I can smell it all day</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I do like this product. It is the first time I bought a separate brush to apply it, and find it is very handy to apply. No more fingerpaint.</li>
            <li> I have used Bare Minerals for years and this new product is so wonderful!  I use it every day, leaves my complexion looking soft and smoother.</li>
            <li> Love it. makes my face flawless.</li>
            <li> Love this product and bare essentials!</li>
            <li> There is little mess with the liquid versus the powder.  It does go on smooth.</li>
            <li> Love BareMinerals and this is a great Addison to their line.</li>
            <li> It was shipped on time and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Just had to try it since the mineral powder is not good for me.</li>
            <li> So light and doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing makeup! I use this with the powder. I&#x27;m fair skinned (neutral) and use the bare beige and light beige.</li>
            <li> Smooth Transaction - Just as described!!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product ever!.. I love this product!!!!..I am so glad I found them on Amazon. I love the way the product feels on my skin. Wow; everybody should try it.  You will love it..</li>
            <li> I love this make up! it is so easy to apply and lasts all day.  I would recommend this product to everyone looking to try something new.</li>
            <li> It is very watery which threw me at first, hard to squeeze out of the bottle also.  The smell is so nasty, I can smell it all day and it&#x27;s horrible.  I won&#x27;t be able to wear it any longer due to this.  I do like the brush and hope to be able to use that with my Clinique foundation that I&#x27;m returning to.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first cause I have lots of allergies and was afraid to change my makeup, but I have no problems and I just love it. I will buy it again. Glad I found a new NON MESSY makeup .</li>
            <li> LOVE! perfect color (for my skin) -- super smooth, goes on nice and silky- doesn&#x27;t leave you with &amp;#34;caked on face&amp;#34;  I have been using this for several months now and am very pleased!  Also love that it has SPF in it!  will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product. It&#x27;s lightweight and doesn&#x27;t cause acne. However if you&#x27;re looking for coverage, it&#x27;s extremely thin.</li>
            <li> Not as creamy as i would like and colors run darker</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected! Thank you. . .</li>
            <li> I love this new foundation just as much as I love all the Bare Minerals products.</li>
            <li> This goes on so smoothly and looks great. Feels light and not heavy like some foundations.</li>
            <li> Darker than my actual complexion and there is a strong unpleasant smell to this makeup.</li>
            <li> I just got this new foundation and the matching brush (I bought mine at Sephora, not Amazon though). I loved the amount of color choices.  I have very fair skin, and most foundations, even in the lightest color, are usually to dark for me and its obvious I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  But the lightest shade this comes in matches my skin tone perfectly!  This result is a much more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush that&#x27;s meant to be used with this foundation was great.  The bristles in the middle of the brush are shorter than the bristles on the outside, so it forms a sort of bowl shaspe where you put in drops of the foundation.  It was so nice to put on a liquid foundation with a brush rather than my hands or a cheap cotton pad that absorbs half the foundation anyway.  I did have to use my fingers around my eyes though, for fear of accidentally poking my eyes with the bristles, but that&#x27;s OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation went on and blended in quickly, smoothly and evenly.  My blush went on top nicely.  My only complaint is that in areas where I didn&#x27;t apply my blush, if I touch it, it comes off on my fingers, and feels a little wet and sticky.  So I will be trying it with a light layer of minerals veil on top.  I think that will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love it.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Great foundation. I love all bare minerals products!</li>
            <li> Nice coverage but weird lardy smell makes it unwearable. My husband couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. Back to Bare Minerals in the morning.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this foundation!  It covers well and hides all my imperfections nicely.  You can adjust the amount of coverage easily.  Another great product from bareMinerals.  And there is no powder all over my bathroom!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s super thin and a little goes a long way. I usually add a little of the Bare Minerals powder foundation on top, but I have terribly uneven skin tone with lots of age spots. I&#x27;ve never had such perfect coverage as I have with these products!&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it cover well, but it also  seems to have improved the overall look and feel of my skin, even after removing the make up. Not sure why- but I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals products and do really like the texture and feel of this, but can tell I should have found my ideal shade in a store before purchasing online. Many more color options than the powder foundations. May try again when I found my exact right shade.</li>
            <li> This base really gives your skin a professional - looking finish.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed. I like other bare Minerals foundations but not this one. Stick to the powders.</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this makeup. Bare minerals never disappoints.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with the results like I thought I would be. The powder does such a better job</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup at JC Penny Sephora counter.. (color 06). It looked great in the store and I loved the brush applicator! HOWEVER - after a few hours the makeup started looking very cake-y on my face.  I re-blended it with the brush and it looked better - but I had to keep fixing it! Still - I kept trying different things to make it last...powder over the top...mineral veil.  Those did not really help much.  And whatever you do - DONT SWEAT in it!  As much as I wanted to love this makeup - it does not wear well.  It can also be messy...the bottle is tough to squeeze- so it can be a challenge to get the makeup out of the bottle onto the brush.  Some days it would come out perfect - other days I would either get too much...or have to shake it out ...which as you can probably guess - the liquid went everywhere except on the brush.  I&#x27;m back to using Loreal&#x27;s PhotoReady.</li>
            <li> Love it thank you for fast shipping</li>
            <li> Cakes up in the heat. At football game and it begain to peel off as if my skin was peeling.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product on AMAZON. iT WAS HARD TO FIND LOCALLY. something HAPPENED AFTER 1 WEEK OF USING THE PRODUCT. iTS COMPLETE OIL THAT COMES OUT WITH A BIT OF COLOR. iT DOES NOT SPREAD ON FACE AT ALL AND I COULD NO LONGER USE PRODUCT. I WENT TO SEPHORA AND BOUGHT SAME PRODUCT AND HAVE HAD NO ISSUES. NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED, IT MAY NOT BE REAL BARESKIN.... I WAS VERY DISAPOONTED. I GAVE 2 STARS BECAUSE IT ARRIVED SUPER FAST.</li>
            <li> Not so great for dry skin. I am using BareMinerals cleansers and lotions (which I love)! I hoped using all the product together would give me the promised results with the foundation. For instance, if I build it to get coverage on a little brown spot (because it won&#x27;t cover them with one application)  it looks too cakey. I&#x27;ve tried it for a few applications, but returned the product. It&#x27;s too pricey not to be happy with it completely and I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> Really love this makeup, provides great cover without a greasy feel. Does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.  Comes out kind of fast when you first take the cap off.</li>
            <li> Very nice makeup - easy to apply, lasts most of day</li>
            <li> Makes my skin looks healthy and has great coverage.  It doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin as good as the new tinted moisturizer that just came out. That along with the brush is a must! I bought another brush just in  case they discontinue or I loose mine!</li>
            <li> live the product and transaction was flawless :)&lt;br /&gt;would buy again</li>
            <li> I think it would do better if I didn&#x27;t have oily skin. Like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover. Nice &amp; light.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this at Sephora and was color matched by one of their specialists in August when I had a deep tan. Here it is almost March and I&#x27;m in the same color - dude at Sephora said it works with your skins undertones. He also said it doesn&#x27;t work great on everyone, he was honestly surprised at how well it worked on my skin. I&#x27;d highly suggest going and trying this stuff out before buying it. I love it, this is my second bottle (I&#x27;m just now running low after 6 months)</li>
            <li> love it, great coverage and shade</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.....doesnt look or fee like you are wearing foundation!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Works great!</li>
            <li> the consistency of the foundation is very watery, light to your skin, but minimal coverage.</li>
            <li> Great make up.  Very natural you don&#x27;t feel like  you&#x27;r wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! You HAVE to try this foundation! I mean you HAVE to try it! Its just like your own skin! HOnest!  Don&#x27;t know till you try. Right?&lt;br /&gt;Try it! You will love it!&lt;br /&gt;: )</li>
            <li> The is a great product.  Just 2-3 drops and I have the coverage I need without the heavy makeup look.  Stays put all day and doesn&#x27;t leave me with shinny, oily skin after a few hours.  Washes off cleanly.  Doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne or sensitive skin.  Blends very well with my skin color, a first for any makeup.  I like this much better than the bare minerals powder makeup. With use this for years to come.</li>
            <li> Delivery great product good but do not like hard plastic bottle. Have to whack the bottle on Palm of hand to get product out. Perhaps I am just too stupid to figure out how to use bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this liquid foundation especially when I use a moisturizer has an SPF that never really dries.</li>
            <li> I purchased this foundation once before but wasn&#x27;t keen on it.  I think I picked the wrong color.  This time I went onto the Bare Minerals website and tried to match the foundation closest to my skin tone and the color is perfect.  Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even take one full drop to cover my entire face.  I believe this bottle could last two years or more.  I bought a different brush from the  Bare Minerals one they recommend.  It was cheaper and is perfect for liquid foundation.  My order came very quickly and I am very pleased with the service from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I like the way it looks and goes on. But it has an odd odor, that last all day. Not sure if it is just the bottle I purchased or all of them.</li>
            <li> It was too drying for my mature skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I got some originally from Ulta and have really liked it. Its light weight and has sunscreen also. I have the recommended application brush and it is a great companion tool.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this foundation but have to say that after shaking it up considerably before applying, it goes on VERY watery.  I typically use a foundation brush, but I think this is probably best applied with a sponge given its liquidity.  I also did not feel that it provided much coverage.  I think perhaps as a summertime make-up, I can see how this might be a good choice as it doesn&#x27;t cake on and allows your skin to breathe &amp; perspire if need be, but the &amp;#34;bareskin&amp;#34; label I was hoping would LOOK and FEEL like bare skin but not actually be such a minimal amount of make-up that what you are basically showing IS your bare skin.  Not impressed for the price and not impressed given that BareMinerals typically makes a good product.  I suspect this foundation may work well for someone who also uses mineral powder on top of foundation, but I find that to be way too much caked on make-up so prefer liquid foundation only over a good primer.  Even my best primer didn&#x27;t make this look or feel any better when applied.  I purchased 2 different shades too, so will probably give it to someone as I doubt I will ever use it again.  Even my similarly priced Clinique foundation does a better job with coverage than this stuff.  I also found the colors to appear differently than the image, so best check it out in the store first before ordering.</li>
            <li> To thin wish I cld return it</li>
            <li> I like this foundation better than most that I tried.  A little goes a long way and covers evenly.  I am ready to purchase back-ups</li>
            <li> it is smooth and silky and very natural looking on the skin.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bare Minerals powder foundation for years and wasn&#x27;t sure If I would like the liquid.  It&#x27;s really great, especially when you want a little more coverage.  It goes on nicely and I&#x27;ve had no problems with my skin as I&#x27;ve had with other liquid foundations.</li>
            <li> perfect  product I love it .. great shipping !!</li>
            <li> Yes I LOVE IT!!  Great coverage and is not heavy.  Thanks Seller, great product hope you have more on hand.</li>
            <li> Love all Bare Mineral products!</li>
            <li> I purchased this foundation at a different store after having my color matched. I love the texture. It takes very little to cover your face - I apply two drops of foundation using a foundation brush and it gives me good coverage. I especially love that the foundation is great for my very, very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I  didn&#x27;t see where this makeup covered any better than other makeup I&#x27;ve used .  It is light on your face , but the smell is  what didn&#x27;t sell me .</li>
            <li> I love bare minerals serum.  It goes on very smooth an lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I just had to try this new makeup!  I have been using BareMinerals/Bare Escentuals for over 5 years now!  As usual, this product is great too!</li>
