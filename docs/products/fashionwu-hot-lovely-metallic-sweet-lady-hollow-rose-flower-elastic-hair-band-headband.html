            <li>Ya gotta know something&#x27;s up when items are so cheaply priced.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but it gets snagged in my hair easily and doesn&#x27;t fit tightly enough around my head (and I have a big head) Lol</li>

            <li> Better than I expected</li>
            <li> Just like pictured! Going to be beautiful headpiece for my bridesmaids!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase!  There are no missing stones or loose chains.  It is a perfect size for my head, not too tight and not too loose and I don&#x27;t get headaches using this headband.  I have gotten many compliments from friends, family, and even strangers.</li>
            <li> I love this item but when I received it it was broken. Thank God for the handy man he was able to correct it.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this piece. It broke the second I took it out of the packaging and just continued to break when I tried putting it on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I didn&#x27;t want to even give it one star but in order to write the review I had to.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I got it. I tried fixing it but didn&#x27;t work. Do I get my money back?</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted! Love it. I want more!</li>
            <li> Oh! My this bad I received this product jan 12, 2014 and it broke jan 13,2014 in two places very cheap material the band is too tight. All ladies do not have the same size head fore head you know.</li>
            <li> Very stylish &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li> It was pretty - that&#x27;s the only reason I can give it 2 stars.  Very cheap quality - fell apart almost right away.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and falls apart when putting it on. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty and look great in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Looked very expensive. Accented her outfit  and everyone commented on it</li>
            <li> Ya gotta know something&#x27;s up when items are so cheaply priced. Sure enough, this broke off in not one, but two separate places while I was taking it out of the little bag it was delivered in. Did not even get to try it on. Don&#x27;t waste your time on this.</li>
            <li> Delivery was a little long since its shipped from far, it looks nice but really cheap, its kind of tight, doesnt stretch much, i wore it for like 2 hours and then it broke and some of the flowers fell of as well so i would say dont waste ur money on this. I was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the picture. Beautiful! But them metal loops on the bottom are quite painful. I bought this for my daughter and she loves it but can&#x27;t wear it very long because it hurts her head. She also has a small head so she&#x27;s not stretching it or forcing it on at all. If you have a larger head, don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> It looks very pretty in the pictures, when I actually got it, the quality just was not up to par.</li>
            <li> Like they say, you get what you pay for. Broke after one use, but looked pretty while it lasted for 3 hours :(&lt;br /&gt;Cheap quality.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it gets snagged in my hair easily and doesn&#x27;t fit tightly enough around my head (and I have a big head) Lol</li>
