            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with Panoxyl because it dries up my skin and clears it up faster than using nothing or a weaker product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Greatly reduces the frequency of my outbreaks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I also use it as a body wash with my Clarisonic and it does great for a full-body wash.</li>
            <li>I bought this because read dermatologist with great clinic used Benzoyl Peroxide for her patients.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended I use this product and my scalp feels great.</li>
            <li>It does take time to see the difference, but I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li>but it works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working great for him, and was recommended by his pediatrician.</li>
            <li>GREAT deal.</li>
            <li>Note that this 10% solution is very effective, whereas I tried the 5% and got no results at all.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>PanOxyl is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Good product,not that great a price since I bought a 3pack.</li>
            <li>This is the best BP product I&#x27;ve ever used - and I have used many.</li>
            <li>Awesome product...truly in love with the results</li>
            <li>PanOxyl is good stufff.  </li>
            <li>The price was good</li>
            <li>so I recommend a good moisturizer (check out Kiehl&#x27;s lineup for guys) and keep it away from your eyelids.</li>
            <li>but this product gave me a good hope from day 1.</li>
            <li>so I know it must be good</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone who has any kind of acne.</li>
            <li>Good for drying skin (and pimples, of course) but doesn&#x27;t cure acne or prevent outbreaks.</li>
            <li>aha really good for hyper pigmentation .</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and good shape love the product for my son face!</li>
            <li>works great on controlling acne better that rx</li>
            <li>And the price is better too!</li>
            <li>first, I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>This product works amazingly.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s the nature of the beast with this kind of stuff.  </li>
            <li>So far best foaming wash I&#x27;ve used, the size is good which lasts about 3 months.</li>
            <li>Well I found out it was over the counter and was thrilled.</li>
            <li>It is extremely effective and I have had no problems with dryness.</li>
            <li>It is highly effective for both of us.</li>
            <li>(It could also be that I built up a tolerance to it, I honestly don&#x27;t know - either way, it</li>
            <li>the record, now that my skin&#x27;s better, I&#x27;ve moved on to the PanOxyl 4% wash, which isn&#x27;t nearly as good as an exfoliator</li>
            <li>The product is fairly strong but works fairly well for my complexion situation.  </li>
            <li>This deal of 3 tubes for $25 is by far the best value for this product.</li>
            <li>I use this every day and it has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve literally tried so many products that I gave up, then I found Panoxyl and I&#x27;m so thankful that a product like this exist.</li>
            <li>This is actually better than the bars, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I am in love and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Dries out my skin a lot, so I have to be sure to moisturize.</li>
            <li>He warned that I should make sure I rinse well because it could bleach clothes or pillow cases.</li>
            <li>bought this based on reviews and glad i did.</li>
            <li>We love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the reliability of availability from Amazon.</li>
            <li>After trying many things to get rid of the rash, which was worsening, she went for the experts opinion.</li>
            <li>My wife fell in love with the product, regardless and has become a devout user.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s options for buying this is the best value we&#x27;ve found -- especially the dual pack.</li>
            <li>my skin looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 5 years now &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it has 10% Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li>but I love the cream for my face and shoulder.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this wash!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You will not find it in any store for a better price- trust me, we&#x27;ve searched.</li>
            <li>Will for sure order more :)</li>
            <li>it mostly just drys out your skin.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I love).  </li>
            <li>This stuff is ok, but the bar is much better and seems like it does a better job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Might have magic inside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My child&#x27;s dermatologist recommended PanOxyl bar soap, but this foaming face wash is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product</li>
            <li>but i feel its more of a creamy paste.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and works very well.</li>
            <li>Very good for back acne</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible and the only thing that keeps the blemishes off of my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear and foams up very nice.</li>
            <li>Take it from someone who has tried every other &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; and mail-order product out there, this is the best.</li>
            <li>This is the best for body acne hands down, and for the scarring try dans</li>
            <li>This first couple of days this product worked great very drying though</li>
            <li>Quick and prompt delivery!</li>
            <li>Rub it on in the shower, wash it off quick, and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li>This product really seems to work - love it!  </li>
            <li>Works great, good price, doesn&#x27;t seem to be hard on the skin either.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>Buy some cheap towels and washcloths and you&#x27;re goof to go.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>It was a fantastic choice.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a cheap alternative to Proactiv.</li>
            <li>Once you use this, I believe that you will not return to the &#x27;cheap stuff&#x27; that you find on supermarket and drug store shelves.</li>
            <li>This is mitigated by applying A light moisturizer every night before bedtime, I use the &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li>teenage daughter also uses this and for her, it greatly helps, but she still gets some blemishes.</li>
            <li>Dries out your skin, but good so far for acne prevention.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to everyone that is looking for a healthy lifestyle and to better take of themselves to the fullest</li>
            <li>10% is super strong</li>
            <li>However, about a dimes worth or less is the perfect amount needed to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I brought this product excited to see what it could do for me.</li>
            <li>It is much better now that I am older but PanOxyl has been the absolute best to take care of the acne I still occasionally get.  </li>
            <li>I use it at every shower with clean cloth.</li>
            <li>I have tried Clean and Clears Peroxide wash which also has 10% peroxide</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a full week of using it during my night shower to see a difference</li>
            <li>So, if its good enough for flesh eating disease, well, it is good enough for me -- and my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; That isn&#x27;t always true, but it is true in this case.</li>
            <li>It really helped control his breakouts and made his skin look sooo much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cleaner but the expiration date after 6 months is a short time</li>
            <li>and they are not cystic and not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Like most BP products, it will easily leave bleached out stains on your towels, and on your clothes and rugs/carpets (from feet, if you use in the shower) if you don&#x27;t really towel off first.  </li>
            <li>my complexion is on its way back to a more healthy appearance.</li>
            <li>Breakouts respond quickly to the wash.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Obviously, the longer you leave it on the more work it&#x27;ll do on your skin, but it&#x27;ll also hurt more.</li>
            <li>I received it in the mail quickly also and without any issues.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad to see it back and so readily available in many online marketplaces as well as in large chain stores.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always looking for new and better products.</li>
            <li>So i really needed something strong but overly drying that i could use all over.</li>
            <li>and I actually have gotten better results!</li>
            <li>Works very well!!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to make sure it is dry before putting on a shirt on going to bed because it will stain!</li>
            <li>.son has been using this for a few years now with great results.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Sooo worth it.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li>This is the only product of its kind I will use for for stubborn acne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth spending the money on it.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap works on a 43 year old.</li>
            <li>I was suffering with  shoulder acne from my age of 17 year old , now i&#x27;m 32 and till now I did many treatments but never worked.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is sensitive to the perfumes added to most shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>worth a shot but would suggest getting just one of these</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne for over 27 years - this stuff is the only scrub that&#x27;s been effective at keeping it at bay.  </li>
            <li>I have used this PanOxyl skin cleanser for many years, but it tends to go out-of-stock frequently.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit rough, which is good because it exfoliates super super super well, and you don&#x27;t need to use that much to get a lot out of it.</li>
            <li>I love panoxyl soap , because it works for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I however like to buy the 3 pack from here &amp; it gets delivered pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>You have to find the right balance for your skin.</li>
            <li>Price is right here in Amazon.</li>
            <li>Do not use it 2-3 times a day right off the bat.</li>
            <li>whenever I can, I have three tubes right now.  </li>
            <li>; That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The price is right (about $10 each).</li>
            <li>barely get any pimples any more since using this stuff.</li>
            <li>Very strong face wash, will dry your skin if you use it everyday, but works great.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ve been an avid user for some time now, and it&#x27;s great to be able to purchase it in a three-pack to save a few bucks when it&#x27;s the only cleanser I</li>
            <li>Great price on this - much more expensive at my pharmacy - is recommended for me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>10% is pretty strong, beware if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Wife uses this to keep her cystic acne down, we had proactive before, this does just as good and price is a lot cheaper, still on our first thing of it and 2 more left after that.</li>
            <li>Since using this product, I&#x27;m adult acne free.</li>
            <li>Use it a couple times a week at first and work your way up.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had a reaction to the benzole peroxide</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend enough - 10x better than proactiv.</li>
            <li>My skin started clearing after 1 day of this regimen and now 6 days later, it looks better than it did before the breakout.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different ones and have now stuck with this one for over three years.</li>
            <li>I could still wash my back and face 3x a day or more.</li>
            <li>Most OTC acne washes have only 3-5%.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this now for 4 months and noticed a difference after the first week of use.</li>
            <li>I have tried several acne face washes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s back in rotation.</li>
            <li>But know this: Different isn&#x27;t necessarily better, but better is always different.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied!  </li>
            <li>I started using this after going through so many big named brand 2% garbage products.</li>
            <li>or so I have been completely acne free.</li>
            <li>Consistently works&lt;br</li>
            <li>For a product I can purchase myself and use daily at home I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I went to a dermatologist for the first time in years and he suggested using this</li>
            <li>It is much easier on my skin then salicylic acid and for me definitely it feels better for my skin than the salicylic acid which irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>Liking it so far, face looking more clear</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use it that much but am totally acne free now!</li>
            <li>let me tell you - if you have severe acne, this wash is the best thing that will ever happen to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got rid of pretty much all my acne by using this 10% wash every night, applying both Differin and Clindamycin before I went to bed, rinsing with a gentle cleanser every morning, spot treating with a random salicylic acid thing, and taking antibiotics.</li>
            <li>After I wash, I like to use aveeno positively radiant tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Working well with positive results.</li>
            <li>I have hormonal acne and have tried pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li>I can say that it is far superior to the other BP products out there, and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Many acne products dry out the skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is simple and strong.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better my face works, and I&#x27;ve tried everything down to the proactive which only made me break out more.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin which is prone to break-outs.  </li>
            <li>When you wash it off, you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and a product like this</li>
            <li>I used this for a couple months and it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>It really helped.</li>
            <li>Not drying and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Again why give it 3 sstars I tend to break out between my thighs so again a very drying acne cleanser in a damp, oil magnet place</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and find it to work really well for me.</li>
            <li>I do not use the 10% on my face except my forehead, because I have a very oily</li>
            <li>Not as creamy or gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and I am tickled pink that they released a Foaming wash.</li>
            <li>Sometimes once a day and sometimes twice because it really dries it up.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really helps.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed it really did help when I had breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even have to use it much.</li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>and it really helps with their acne.</li>
            <li>but the drying was too much .</li>
            <li>Also, I am able to use a smaller amount now that I am maintaining clear skin and no longer &amp;#34;treating&amp;#34; breakouts.</li>
            <li>With daily use, this is quite effective at managing my teen son&#x27;s moderate/severe acne.</li>
            <li>I use this once a day, when i shower, pretty much everywhere like i would with a normally shower gel.</li>
            <li>This really is the ONLY product I have used that has been able to give me such consistent results.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to know that I found something that actually works.</li>
            <li>This is better than all other benzoyl peroxide washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;*It lathers 10x better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, allowing me to use less&lt;br</li>
            <li>PanOxyl with 10% peroxide works better at getting rid of my acne and keeping it away than any other acne wash I&#x27;ve used including both OTC and prescription.</li>
            <li>Most  other washes don&#x27;t do as well as this and stop working after awhile.</li>
            <li>Your pores are tighter, and your faces actually looks and feels clean.</li>
            <li>The cream is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and your pores tighten up as they should.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped fade some old acne marks I had!!  </li>
            <li>I found something strong enough that&#x27;ll help even out my tone and old scars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that after nearly 10 years of wasted money, appointments, and harming my skins with peels, this is the only thing that has worked.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>(I recommend you cut down on use at this time), and it&#x27;s going to be MAGICAL afterwards.</li>
            <li>Got these for my son, he goes through a single bottle pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It does dry my skin a tad, but paired with an oil free moisturizer</li>
            <li>Finally, older I decided to.</li>
            <li>Ok so i have moderate to severe back acne and arm acne after coming off of depoprovera.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t promise that PanOxyl will help your particular acne situation.</li>
            <li>He could have sold me one of the high priced acne treatments in his office</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that you go by directions on the bottle.</li>
            <li>If prices get too high online, just go to a drug store or check the pharmacy section of your department store.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you give this face wash a chance.</li>
            <li>word of caution: this wash is super super harsh.</li>
            <li>my daughter had tried all kinds of acne medicine but says this foaming wash really helped clear her skin.</li>
            <li>Does anything really work for adult onset acne?</li>
            <li>I had some dried acne marks more than 5-6 years, and I can see they starter to peal the skin on that area.</li>
            <li>I had huge nodules on my back and smaller ones showing up on my face.</li>
            <li>Panoxyl prices online fluctuate wildly and sometimes get laughably high.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended me to use panoxyl because it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin as many other products in market does, it really prevents breakouts, keeps acne at bay</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen my face this clear since I was 15!</li>
            <li>I got this for my son who is dealing with teenage acne and it has really helped!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;*It works consistently well to reduce breakouts and doesn&#x27;t seem to lose effectiveness over multiple uses</li>
            <li>I saw most of the small acne disappeared.</li>
            <li>It seemed to grant me a temporary reprieve, but maybe my body overcompensated for the extreme dryness and started producing more facial oil.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean, works extremely well.</li>
            <li>It can be harsh on your skin at first, but if you keep consistent with it, your skin will adjust!</li>
            <li>, basically, this is going to feel fine for the first few days, it&#x27;s going to hurt a lot for the next week or so</li>
            <li>using on your face, only use this once every two days at first (perhaps the first 2 weeks) as this WILL dry out your face and make you peel.</li>
            <li>This stuff&#x27;s a little expensive, but it&#x27;s so worth it because it&#x27;s a great cleanser</li>
            <li>I have used Clinique Acne foam, bar, gel, Proactin regular and new extra strength, stidex wipes,simple alcohol to layer on top of the other products.</li>
            <li>It has kept my face as clear as Oxy ever did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- 2 months until clear skin</li>
            <li>It has helped to clear acne without over drying the skin.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why it developed at age 42</li>
            <li>light green towel is now yellow…</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as PanOxyl.</li>
            <li>I was using the Walmart generic version of this product since they were no longer carrying the real thing.</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>I used this 3 weeks so far .</li>
            <li>this works well for my twenty year old who has acne.  </li>
            <li>i still use it because i have 2 extra ones i don&#x27;t know what to do with, but for some reason it really irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li>Really, I see a difference in my skin, especially on my back.  </li>
            <li>If my skin is feeling particularly sensitive that day, I&#x27;ll apply the cream and immediately take it off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a delicate balance, a relationship I&#x27;ve formed with my PanOxyl 10% Foaming Wash that I&#x27;ve come to love and care for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only real downside is that this does bleach your towels so either have a dedicated towel or use white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this completely solves my acne problem.</li>
            <li>woman with adult acne</li>
            <li>since my skin blemishes easily, they spots usually stay for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have mild outbreaks and slightly oily skin.</li>
            <li>I use it for my back, which is kept clear and this product also does not cause it to be dry like many other soaps.</li>
            <li>However, I go to school in California, where the weather isn&#x27;t nearly as harsh, and I could use this wash only ONCE a day, applying moisturizer directly after, and my skin would feel perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>The expert thought it was a bacterial infection and instead of prescribing a wild new prescription, he simply said get PanOxyl.</li>
            <li>Panoxyl 10% is the only wash that has any positive effect on my son&#x27;s acne on his chest and back.</li>
            <li>However, it is worth it to keep the acne down without going to prescriptions.</li>
            <li>My oil on my face and back was so much reduced by the second day.</li>
            <li>but they only last a day or so tops and dissipate much quicker.</li>
            <li>I had severe back acne on my whole back</li>
            <li>My back is clear!</li>
            <li>Major improvement for my skin.</li>
            <li>On my second serving of PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash; not sure if it  helps break-outs, may not be enough % Benzoyl Peroxide, but more would require a Rx.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will also admit that no other over-the-counter acne scrub/wash/etc works like this does.</li>
            <li>After this product my skin is clear, and it prevents breakouts totally.</li>
            <li>The PanOxyl soap bars are the first thing I used a few years ago that seemlessly got rid of pimples and kept my face clear.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t help prevent and clear away my moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I can see a total change of my skin, its become clear than before.</li>
            <li>but it did clear up my facial acne</li>
            <li>I used a prescription early on and this wash daily and got it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m smarter now and instead of using this twice daily, I&#x27;m removing my makeup at night with a face wipe and then washing with PanOxyl followed by Neutrogena Oil-free Sensitive Skin moisturizer and using Cetaphil wash and Boots Expert Anti-Blemish Serum in the morning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*It comes in far larger volume for the price</li>
            <li>The arm acne has completely stopped and so has the back acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had back acne since I hit 13 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 22 years old and through all the years nothing else has worked for my back except for this.</li>
            <li>Then my mom took me to the dermatologist, who prescribed me antibiotics, and bought me this cream that was apparently doing wonders for my brother.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my dermatologist to treat my adult acne (I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne since I was a teen, and now I&#x27;m in my 40s</li>
            <li>For me, an adult male in my 40s</li>
            <li>My friend has been using it for years apparently and loves it.</li>
            <li>I used to use Neutrogena sensitive skin bar, but would get occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>only thing that remains of my back acne are the spots that have tremendously lightened (that were previously dark &#x27;blood&#x27; colored.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems it would dry skin on face too much and possibly irritate.  </li>
            <li>the 10% and 4% products are actually pretty similar, other than the concentration of benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li>No dry patches or rashes or anything!</li>
            <li>The only product my wife and I have found to actually control adult acne.</li>
            <li>you have acne on your back or some other large area of your body, this is the only solution that works well.</li>
            <li>May make some people skin dry if it is sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and has completely rid my back of the cystic acne.</li>
            <li>Yes, it can dry out skin, but this is easily fixed with a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve tried several other products, but am back to using this particular PanOxyl product.</li>

            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with Panoxyl because it dries up my skin and clears it up faster than using nothing or a weaker product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Greatly reduces the frequency of my outbreaks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I also use it as a body wash with my Clarisonic and it does great for a full-body wash.</li>
            <li> I bought this because read dermatologist with great clinic used Benzoyl Peroxide for her patients.  </li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended I use this product and my scalp feels great.</li>
            <li> It does take time to see the difference, but I&#x27;m really happy</li>
            <li> but it works great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great for him, and was recommended by his pediatrician.</li>
            <li> GREAT deal.</li>
            <li> Note that this 10% solution is very effective, whereas I tried the 5% and got no results at all.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless this is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> PanOxyl is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Good product,not that great a price since I bought a 3pack.</li>
            <li> This is the best BP product I&#x27;ve ever used - and I have used many.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...truly in love with the results</li>
            <li> PanOxyl is good stufff.  </li>
            <li> The price was good</li>
            <li> so I recommend a good moisturizer (check out Kiehl&#x27;s lineup for guys) and keep it away from your eyelids.</li>
            <li> but this product gave me a good hope from day 1.</li>
            <li> so I know it must be good</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone who has any kind of acne.</li>
            <li> Good for drying skin (and pimples, of course) but doesn&#x27;t cure acne or prevent outbreaks.</li>
            <li> aha really good for hyper pigmentation .</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and good shape love the product for my son face!</li>
            <li> works great on controlling acne better that rx</li>
            <li> And the price is better too!</li>
            <li> first, I was impressed.  </li>
            <li> This product works amazingly.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s the nature of the beast with this kind of stuff.  </li>
            <li> So far best foaming wash I&#x27;ve used, the size is good which lasts about 3 months.</li>
            <li> Well I found out it was over the counter and was thrilled.</li>
            <li> It is extremely effective and I have had no problems with dryness.</li>
            <li> It is highly effective for both of us.</li>
            <li> (It could also be that I built up a tolerance to it, I honestly don&#x27;t know - either way, it</li>
            <li> the record, now that my skin&#x27;s better, I&#x27;ve moved on to the PanOxyl 4% wash, which isn&#x27;t nearly as good as an exfoliator</li>
            <li> The product is fairly strong but works fairly well for my complexion situation.  </li>
            <li> This deal of 3 tubes for $25 is by far the best value for this product.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it has made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally tried so many products that I gave up, then I found Panoxyl and I&#x27;m so thankful that a product like this exist.</li>
            <li> This is actually better than the bars, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am in love and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Dries out my skin a lot, so I have to be sure to moisturize.</li>
            <li> He warned that I should make sure I rinse well because it could bleach clothes or pillow cases.</li>
            <li> bought this based on reviews and glad i did.</li>
            <li> We love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love the reliability of availability from Amazon.</li>
            <li> After trying many things to get rid of the rash, which was worsening, she went for the experts opinion.</li>
            <li> My wife fell in love with the product, regardless and has become a devout user.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s options for buying this is the best value we&#x27;ve found -- especially the dual pack.</li>
            <li> my skin looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 5 years now &amp; I love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it has 10% Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> but I love the cream for my face and shoulder.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this wash!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You will not find it in any store for a better price- trust me, we&#x27;ve searched.</li>
            <li> Will for sure order more :)</li>
            <li> it mostly just drys out your skin.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I love).  </li>
            <li> This stuff is ok, but the bar is much better and seems like it does a better job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Might have magic inside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My child&#x27;s dermatologist recommended PanOxyl bar soap, but this foaming face wash is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product</li>
            <li> but i feel its more of a creamy paste.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and works very well.</li>
            <li> Very good for back acne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible and the only thing that keeps the blemishes off of my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear and foams up very nice.</li>
            <li> Take it from someone who has tried every other &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; and mail-order product out there, this is the best.</li>
            <li> This is the best for body acne hands down, and for the scarring try dans</li>
            <li> This first couple of days this product worked great very drying though</li>
            <li> Quick and prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> Rub it on in the shower, wash it off quick, and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> This product really seems to work - love it!  </li>
            <li> Works great, good price, doesn&#x27;t seem to be hard on the skin either.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> Buy some cheap towels and washcloths and you&#x27;re goof to go.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> It was a fantastic choice.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a cheap alternative to Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Once you use this, I believe that you will not return to the &#x27;cheap stuff&#x27; that you find on supermarket and drug store shelves.</li>
            <li> This is mitigated by applying A light moisturizer every night before bedtime, I use the &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li> teenage daughter also uses this and for her, it greatly helps, but she still gets some blemishes.</li>
            <li> Dries out your skin, but good so far for acne prevention.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to everyone that is looking for a healthy lifestyle and to better take of themselves to the fullest</li>
            <li> 10% is super strong</li>
            <li> However, about a dimes worth or less is the perfect amount needed to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I brought this product excited to see what it could do for me.</li>
            <li> It is much better now that I am older but PanOxyl has been the absolute best to take care of the acne I still occasionally get.  </li>
            <li> I use it at every shower with clean cloth.</li>
            <li> I have tried Clean and Clears Peroxide wash which also has 10% peroxide</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a full week of using it during my night shower to see a difference</li>
            <li> So, if its good enough for flesh eating disease, well, it is good enough for me -- and my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; That isn&#x27;t always true, but it is true in this case.</li>
            <li> It really helped control his breakouts and made his skin look sooo much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cleaner but the expiration date after 6 months is a short time</li>
            <li> and they are not cystic and not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Like most BP products, it will easily leave bleached out stains on your towels, and on your clothes and rugs/carpets (from feet, if you use in the shower) if you don&#x27;t really towel off first.  </li>
            <li> my complexion is on its way back to a more healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> Breakouts respond quickly to the wash.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Obviously, the longer you leave it on the more work it&#x27;ll do on your skin, but it&#x27;ll also hurt more.</li>
            <li> I received it in the mail quickly also and without any issues.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m glad to see it back and so readily available in many online marketplaces as well as in large chain stores.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always looking for new and better products.</li>
            <li> So i really needed something strong but overly drying that i could use all over.</li>
            <li> and I actually have gotten better results!</li>
            <li> Works very well!!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to make sure it is dry before putting on a shirt on going to bed because it will stain!</li>
            <li> .son has been using this for a few years now with great results.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite face wash.</li>
            <li> This is the only product of its kind I will use for for stubborn acne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth spending the money on it.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap works on a 43 year old.</li>
            <li> I was suffering with  shoulder acne from my age of 17 year old , now i&#x27;m 32 and till now I did many treatments but never worked.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is sensitive to the perfumes added to most shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> worth a shot but would suggest getting just one of these</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for over 27 years - this stuff is the only scrub that&#x27;s been effective at keeping it at bay.  </li>
            <li> I have used this PanOxyl skin cleanser for many years, but it tends to go out-of-stock frequently.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit rough, which is good because it exfoliates super super super well, and you don&#x27;t need to use that much to get a lot out of it.</li>
            <li> I love panoxyl soap , because it works for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I however like to buy the 3 pack from here &amp; it gets delivered pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> You have to find the right balance for your skin.</li>
            <li> Price is right here in Amazon.</li>
            <li> Do not use it 2-3 times a day right off the bat.</li>
            <li> whenever I can, I have three tubes right now.  </li>
            <li> ; That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> The price is right (about $10 each).</li>
            <li> barely get any pimples any more since using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very strong face wash, will dry your skin if you use it everyday, but works great.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve been an avid user for some time now, and it&#x27;s great to be able to purchase it in a three-pack to save a few bucks when it&#x27;s the only cleanser I</li>
            <li> Great price on this - much more expensive at my pharmacy - is recommended for me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> 10% is pretty strong, beware if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Wife uses this to keep her cystic acne down, we had proactive before, this does just as good and price is a lot cheaper, still on our first thing of it and 2 more left after that.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I&#x27;m adult acne free.</li>
            <li> Use it a couple times a week at first and work your way up.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had a reaction to the benzole peroxide</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend enough - 10x better than proactiv.</li>
            <li> My skin started clearing after 1 day of this regimen and now 6 days later, it looks better than it did before the breakout.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different ones and have now stuck with this one for over three years.</li>
            <li> I could still wash my back and face 3x a day or more.</li>
            <li> Most OTC acne washes have only 3-5%.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for 4 months and noticed a difference after the first week of use.</li>
            <li> I have tried several acne face washes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Glad it&#x27;s back in rotation.</li>
            <li> But know this: Different isn&#x27;t necessarily better, but better is always different.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied!  </li>
            <li> I started using this after going through so many big named brand 2% garbage products.</li>
            <li> or so I have been completely acne free.</li>
            <li> Consistently works&lt;br</li>
            <li> For a product I can purchase myself and use daily at home I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist for the first time in years and he suggested using this</li>
            <li> It is much easier on my skin then salicylic acid and for me definitely it feels better for my skin than the salicylic acid which irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Liking it so far, face looking more clear</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it that much but am totally acne free now!</li>
            <li> let me tell you - if you have severe acne, this wash is the best thing that will ever happen to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got rid of pretty much all my acne by using this 10% wash every night, applying both Differin and Clindamycin before I went to bed, rinsing with a gentle cleanser every morning, spot treating with a random salicylic acid thing, and taking antibiotics.</li>
            <li> After I wash, I like to use aveeno positively radiant tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Working well with positive results.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne and have tried pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li> I can say that it is far superior to the other BP products out there, and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Many acne products dry out the skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is simple and strong.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better my face works, and I&#x27;ve tried everything down to the proactive which only made me break out more.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin which is prone to break-outs.  </li>
            <li> When you wash it off, you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and a product like this</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple months and it didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> It really helped.</li>
            <li> Not drying and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Again why give it 3 sstars I tend to break out between my thighs so again a very drying acne cleanser in a damp, oil magnet place</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and find it to work really well for me.</li>
            <li> I do not use the 10% on my face except my forehead, because I have a very oily</li>
            <li> Not as creamy or gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and I am tickled pink that they released a Foaming wash.</li>
            <li> Sometimes once a day and sometimes twice because it really dries it up.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really helps.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed it really did help when I had breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even have to use it much.</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> and it really helps with their acne.</li>
            <li> but the drying was too much .</li>
            <li> Also, I am able to use a smaller amount now that I am maintaining clear skin and no longer &amp;#34;treating&amp;#34; breakouts.</li>
            <li> With daily use, this is quite effective at managing my teen son&#x27;s moderate/severe acne.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day, when i shower, pretty much everywhere like i would with a normally shower gel.</li>
            <li> This really is the ONLY product I have used that has been able to give me such consistent results.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to know that I found something that actually works.</li>
            <li> This is better than all other benzoyl peroxide washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*It lathers 10x better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, allowing me to use less&lt;br</li>
            <li> PanOxyl with 10% peroxide works better at getting rid of my acne and keeping it away than any other acne wash I&#x27;ve used including both OTC and prescription.</li>
            <li> Most  other washes don&#x27;t do as well as this and stop working after awhile.</li>
            <li> Your pores are tighter, and your faces actually looks and feels clean.</li>
            <li> The cream is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and your pores tighten up as they should.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped fade some old acne marks I had!!  </li>
            <li> I found something strong enough that&#x27;ll help even out my tone and old scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that after nearly 10 years of wasted money, appointments, and harming my skins with peels, this is the only thing that has worked.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> (I recommend you cut down on use at this time), and it&#x27;s going to be MAGICAL afterwards.</li>
            <li> Got these for my son, he goes through a single bottle pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It does dry my skin a tad, but paired with an oil free moisturizer</li>
            <li> Finally, older I decided to.</li>
            <li> Ok so i have moderate to severe back acne and arm acne after coming off of depoprovera.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t promise that PanOxyl will help your particular acne situation.</li>
            <li> He could have sold me one of the high priced acne treatments in his office</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that you go by directions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> If prices get too high online, just go to a drug store or check the pharmacy section of your department store.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you give this face wash a chance.</li>
            <li> word of caution: this wash is super super harsh.</li>
            <li> my daughter had tried all kinds of acne medicine but says this foaming wash really helped clear her skin.</li>
            <li> Does anything really work for adult onset acne?</li>
            <li> I had some dried acne marks more than 5-6 years, and I can see they starter to peal the skin on that area.</li>
            <li> I had huge nodules on my back and smaller ones showing up on my face.</li>
            <li> Panoxyl prices online fluctuate wildly and sometimes get laughably high.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended me to use panoxyl because it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin as many other products in market does, it really prevents breakouts, keeps acne at bay</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen my face this clear since I was 15!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who is dealing with teenage acne and it has really helped!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*It works consistently well to reduce breakouts and doesn&#x27;t seem to lose effectiveness over multiple uses</li>
            <li> I saw most of the small acne disappeared.</li>
            <li> It seemed to grant me a temporary reprieve, but maybe my body overcompensated for the extreme dryness and started producing more facial oil.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean, works extremely well.</li>
            <li> It can be harsh on your skin at first, but if you keep consistent with it, your skin will adjust!</li>
            <li> , basically, this is going to feel fine for the first few days, it&#x27;s going to hurt a lot for the next week or so</li>
            <li> using on your face, only use this once every two days at first (perhaps the first 2 weeks) as this WILL dry out your face and make you peel.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s a little expensive, but it&#x27;s so worth it because it&#x27;s a great cleanser</li>
            <li> I have used Clinique Acne foam, bar, gel, Proactin regular and new extra strength, stidex wipes,simple alcohol to layer on top of the other products.</li>
            <li> It has kept my face as clear as Oxy ever did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- 2 months until clear skin</li>
            <li> It has helped to clear acne without over drying the skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why it developed at age 42</li>
            <li> light green towel is now yellow…</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as PanOxyl.</li>
            <li> I was using the Walmart generic version of this product since they were no longer carrying the real thing.</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> I used this 3 weeks so far .</li>
            <li> this works well for my twenty year old who has acne.  </li>
            <li> i still use it because i have 2 extra ones i don&#x27;t know what to do with, but for some reason it really irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really, I see a difference in my skin, especially on my back.  </li>
            <li> If my skin is feeling particularly sensitive that day, I&#x27;ll apply the cream and immediately take it off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a delicate balance, a relationship I&#x27;ve formed with my PanOxyl 10% Foaming Wash that I&#x27;ve come to love and care for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only real downside is that this does bleach your towels so either have a dedicated towel or use white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this completely solves my acne problem.</li>
            <li> woman with adult acne</li>
            <li> since my skin blemishes easily, they spots usually stay for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have mild outbreaks and slightly oily skin.</li>
            <li> I use it for my back, which is kept clear and this product also does not cause it to be dry like many other soaps.</li>
            <li> However, I go to school in California, where the weather isn&#x27;t nearly as harsh, and I could use this wash only ONCE a day, applying moisturizer directly after, and my skin would feel perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> The expert thought it was a bacterial infection and instead of prescribing a wild new prescription, he simply said get PanOxyl.</li>
            <li> Panoxyl 10% is the only wash that has any positive effect on my son&#x27;s acne on his chest and back.</li>
            <li> However, it is worth it to keep the acne down without going to prescriptions.</li>
            <li> My oil on my face and back was so much reduced by the second day.</li>
            <li> but they only last a day or so tops and dissipate much quicker.</li>
            <li> I had severe back acne on my whole back</li>
            <li> My back is clear!</li>
            <li> Major improvement for my skin.</li>
            <li> On my second serving of PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash; not sure if it  helps break-outs, may not be enough % Benzoyl Peroxide, but more would require a Rx.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will also admit that no other over-the-counter acne scrub/wash/etc works like this does.</li>
            <li> After this product my skin is clear, and it prevents breakouts totally.</li>
            <li> The PanOxyl soap bars are the first thing I used a few years ago that seemlessly got rid of pimples and kept my face clear.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t help prevent and clear away my moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I can see a total change of my skin, its become clear than before.</li>
            <li> but it did clear up my facial acne</li>
            <li> I used a prescription early on and this wash daily and got it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m smarter now and instead of using this twice daily, I&#x27;m removing my makeup at night with a face wipe and then washing with PanOxyl followed by Neutrogena Oil-free Sensitive Skin moisturizer and using Cetaphil wash and Boots Expert Anti-Blemish Serum in the morning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*It comes in far larger volume for the price</li>
            <li> The arm acne has completely stopped and so has the back acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had back acne since I hit 13 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 22 years old and through all the years nothing else has worked for my back except for this.</li>
            <li> Then my mom took me to the dermatologist, who prescribed me antibiotics, and bought me this cream that was apparently doing wonders for my brother.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist to treat my adult acne (I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne since I was a teen, and now I&#x27;m in my 40s</li>
            <li> For me, an adult male in my 40s</li>
            <li> My friend has been using it for years apparently and loves it.</li>
            <li> I used to use Neutrogena sensitive skin bar, but would get occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> only thing that remains of my back acne are the spots that have tremendously lightened (that were previously dark &#x27;blood&#x27; colored.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems it would dry skin on face too much and possibly irritate.  </li>
            <li> the 10% and 4% products are actually pretty similar, other than the concentration of benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li> No dry patches or rashes or anything!</li>
            <li> The only product my wife and I have found to actually control adult acne.</li>
            <li> you have acne on your back or some other large area of your body, this is the only solution that works well.</li>
            <li> May make some people skin dry if it is sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and has completely rid my back of the cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Yes, it can dry out skin, but this is easily fixed with a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve tried several other products, but am back to using this particular PanOxyl product.</li>
            <li> I then decided to buy this and it has decreased my acne significantly.</li>
            <li> I noticed it significantly shortened the time that my skin was broken out though.</li>
            <li> use this with one of those long stretchy back scrubbers in the shower once a day.</li>
            <li> Just bear in mind that benzoyl peroxide can stain cloth, so rinse well and dry with a white towel!</li>
            <li> Why did I still give this product 3 stars you ask because without it I wouldn&#x27;t have realized I have dry skin initially</li>
            <li> I was in the Midwest during the winter, AND I have eczema, so after using this cream twice a day (not recommended), my skin grew extremely red and sting-y and extremely dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Will bleach your towels so just dry off with white towels (waaa)</li>
            <li> Granted, my skin was dry and scaly perpetually but it was preferable to having a bunch of gross acne</li>
            <li> I use a little Cetaphil sensitive skin lotion to help out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have 3 active pimples on my back</li>
            <li> Now I only use this product 3 times a week to get my acne under control if it ever tries to come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Acne has not completely cleared up</li>
            <li> One tube lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> remember they discontinued it for a long time</li>
            <li> so first few weeks, it dried me out alot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products and have been on Accutane and had Glycolic  peels in my dermatologists office.  </li>
            <li> does dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t excessively dry my skin compared to others</li>
            <li> It will dry your skin which is why my dermatologist recommended we use CeraVe lotion along with PanOxyl.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry me out</li>
            <li> It will dry out your skin</li>
            <li> still I had some pimple size of acne and it took 1 week of continue use to dry all of them.</li>
            <li> can dry out skin so he uses it once or twice a day.</li>
            <li> I usually dry my face with a towel while in the shower,</li>
            <li> Same active ingredient</li>
            <li> I use this face wash every single night.  </li>
            <li> My dark spots started getting darker I broke out on places on my face that I hadn&#x27;t for years.and I totally ignored the warning and washed my eyes with it every night.</li>
            <li> I am not totally cleared after a month, but I am down to about 10% of what I had which is saying a lot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with acne for what seems like my entire life - used ProActiv but was never clear of acne.</li>
            <li> it is a very dry climate, yet this cleanser has not once had me running for the coconut oil to soothe my skin.</li>
            <li> Personally, I use it everyday for my face but only every other day on my neck due to shaving irritation and severe dryness.  </li>
            <li> I would get cystic acne on my cheeks and jawline, spots all over my face, and my skin would always feel rough but very dry.</li>
            <li> You really only need a little bit, and I like the creaminess about it.</li>
            <li> Just caution to use every other day or once every 3 days if skin gets to dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> remember the first week I ever got acne, I was 15 and in a camping trip with my fellow classmates from High school and from then on acne persisted and became worse, and worse to deal with.</li>
            <li> I have used Pan-Oxyl for a few years now, and it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> Be careful because it bleaches towels and pillow cases</li>
            <li> I found Panoxyl 10% and it has the same results for a lot less!</li>
            <li> The end results was swelled, dark, dry to the touch eyes and acne everywhere.</li>
            <li> I wash my face 2 times a day almost everyday and a bottle will last me anywhere between 2-3 months as a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little dab of the product goes a long way when washing my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your skin will become extremely dry and get a tight feeling.</li>
            <li> My acne varied from moderate to severe acne for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> started using 10% BP wash per directions from my dermatologist in combination with other acne medication.</li>
            <li> He can feel this product working unlike some other 2% washes he has tried.  </li>
            <li> It is creamy and you only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I do not use any other brand except PanOxyl.</li>
            <li> If this should occur use it every other day or try the 5%,</li>
            <li> Not exactly foaming as described.</li>
            <li> I tried using some other benzoyl peroxide creams and washes, but I didn&#x27;t notice any of them helping.</li>
            <li> He uses it in conjunction with other acne medication</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that works well, unfortunately it is usually very expensive.</li>
            <li> Skin is completely clear, was unable to wear backless stuff prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> This is getting hard to find the local chain store is always out of it.</li>
            <li> Always use this and at times is hard to find in the local stores.</li>
            <li> only thing is , we have to use a body cream to avoid the hard dryness</li>
            <li> I ended up having dark blotches all over my face.</li>
            <li> It keeps the bumps and skin bumps down which occur after you shave.</li>
            <li> It will not let you down.</li>
            <li> I was on the verge of breaking down and getting on actutane before trying this product.  </li>
            <li> but nothing like before it went from 100 percent down to maybe 10 percent</li>
            <li> It will cause your eyelids to dry excessively.  </li>
            <li> This foaming face wash was recommended by my wife&#x27;s dermatologist when she had an odd rash that persisted.</li>
            <li> Typically, she goes through a tube in about 3 weeks and immediately replaces it with another.</li>
            <li> We typically buy it from the pharmacy where it is $10 a tube, but in a bind  we sometimes have to buy it from our grocery store where it is $12.</li>
            <li> It does get foamy but not right off the bat, you have to rub it around a few times in order to get foamy.</li>
            <li> I did not like the bar, because of the mess.</li>
            <li> At first it dried my skin out like crazy, but your face gets used to it after about a week.</li>
            <li> and I use this wash a little less, a few times a week..</li>
            <li> My blackheads between my thighs are dissapearing and every time I break out I don&#x27;t have to wait weeks for it to leave its gone in as little as two days so for my face 1 star for my thighs</li>
            <li> A girl with dry skin, using panoxyl, who loves matte makeup is one big fail in itself.</li>
            <li> I can tell that this has helped clear up my troubled areas.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the results I was getting when I started applying this to my face, I was using it everyday, two times a day for a couple of months</li>
            <li> That paste turns into a robust foam after you lather it over your face a few times.</li>
            <li> After a few years, insurance started to charge me A LOT to get a prescription version.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad acne</li>
            <li> I usually use a quarter size amount for my face and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Its not magic though</li>
            <li> Buying it over-the-counter at the only drug store that stocks it is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount (a blob about the width of your thumb).</li>
            <li> I recently bought some new makeup &amp; it caused the worst breakout of my life, which is saying a lot since I&#x27;ve been on Accutane in the past.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the bars, but they were hard to find for a while.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find at the store.  </li>
            <li> or it was just hard to find.  </li>
            <li> but it is hard to find in the three pack as it is offered here.</li>
            <li> You probably know the common saying: &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I will caution that you may experience drying and flaking around your eye, nose and lip areas ( at least in my case).</li>
            <li> I put on tazaorac 1 percent at night and Dan&#x27;s Aha in the morning for the scarring which is slowly getting lighter.</li>
            <li> It was made for acne bacteria, but it works so well, the doctor gives it to patients with skin infections as potentially serious as staph infections.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and recently started developing painful and aggressive acne.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it in your eyes or lips, or you&#x27;ll be unhappy...</li>
            <li> The two can dangerous and expensive respectively.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it seemed like they were worse than before.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting dramatic results.</li>
            <li> but this is because I have a hormonal issue but it does clear that awful body acne.</li>
            <li> I lost my confidence, I&#x27;ve become extremely insecure and became secluded.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the Drug stores don&#x27;t always carry it so that is why I buy it online.  </li>
            <li> I still get the random zit every now and again</li>
            <li> Very unappealing.</li>
            <li> I was desperate and remembered a dermatologist recommending this wash years ago, but</li>
            <li> Before I took control of my life and figured out that my diet/stress/cleansing habits were directly contributing to my acne, I had awful, awful skin.</li>
            <li> it was so bad</li>
            <li> I still have bad scarring and some acne</li>
            <li> I look forward to knowing that the painful cysts will hopefully disappear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking acne with pus in it , and painful when you try to squeeze .</li>
            <li> It was nasty....</li>
            <li> but after a week it was terrible.</li>
            <li> It has been horrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People always say &amp;#34;Wow 10%, that&#x27;s insane.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product for your skin without having to go to the dermatologist to get a prescription</li>
            <li> Since using this product, I&#x27;m adult acne free. Living in Denver, CO it is a very dry climate, yet this cleanser has not once had me running for the coconut oil to soothe my skin. Great for pimpily teens. This price for a 3 pack is off the hook.</li>
            <li> I was so grateful to find this multi pack. Sooo worth it. If you need to stock up you should just buy a couple.</li>
            <li> Best face wash ever!!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever brought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember the first week I ever got acne, I was 15 and in a camping trip with my fellow classmates from High school and from then on acne persisted and became worse, and worse to deal with. My acne varied from moderate to severe acne for the past 7 years. I lost my confidence, I&#x27;ve become extremely insecure and became secluded. I&#x27;ve literally tried so many products that I gave up, then I found Panoxyl and I&#x27;m so thankful that a product like this exist. I couldn&#x27;t believe the results I was getting when I started applying this to my face, I was using it everyday, two times a day for a couple of months (This regimen is not for everyone, different skins will vary). 7 months later my acne is GONE!!! I haven&#x27;t seen my face this clear since I was 15! Now I only use this product 3 times a week to get my acne under control if it ever tries to come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product every time I run out of this product, you should too.</li>
            <li> Works as intended... Thank you ^_^</li>
            <li> By far my favorite face wash. Keeps my skin clear and foams up very nice. A little goes a long way. Great face wash.</li>
            <li> This product really seems to work - love it!  I got this for my son who is dealing with teenage acne and it has really helped!</li>
            <li> Best 10% Benzoyl Peroxide wash that I&#x27;ve found. A little dab of the product goes a long way when washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using 10% BP wash per directions from my dermatologist in combination with other acne medication. Many acne products dry out the skin so I always use a moisturizer. I suggest Cetaphil daily facial moisturizer with SPF15.</li>
            <li> I use this face wash every single night.  I have very oily skin which is prone to break-outs.  PanOxyl is good stufff.  I used to use the bars, but they were hard to find for a while.  This is actually better than the bars, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Very strong face wash, will dry your skin if you use it everyday, but works great.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly. You really only need a little bit, and I like the creaminess about it. When you wash it off, you can really see the difference. Your pores are tighter, and your faces actually looks and feels clean. I have really oily skin and a product like this does dry my skin out. (I use daily, but just once a day in the morning) After I wash, I like to use aveeno positively radiant tinted moisturizer. After this product my skin is clear, and it prevents breakouts totally. I am in love and would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple months and it didn&#x27;t work very well. It didn&#x27;t reduce any pimples or the frequency of them. Maybe it will work for your skin type. I have mild outbreaks and slightly oily skin.</li>
            <li> The PanOxyl soap bars are the first thing I used a few years ago that seemlessly got rid of pimples and kept my face clear. Since then, I&#x27;ve tried several other products, but am back to using this particular PanOxyl product. My face has cleared again within a week of use. Just bear in mind that benzoyl peroxide can stain cloth, so rinse well and dry with a white towel!</li>
            <li> Controls my oil and acne. Dries out my skin a lot, so I have to be sure to moisturize. Use it a couple times a week at first and work your way up.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended PanOxyl. He could have sold me one of the high priced acne treatments in his office but he didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt; His instructions were to apply in the break out areas while I&#x27;m in the shower.&lt;br /&gt; Let it still for a minute or two then rinse. He warned that I should make sure I rinse well because it could bleach clothes or pillow cases. I haven&#x27;t noticed bleaching of any fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;It took a full week of using it during my night shower to see a difference but it did work. I no longer have break outs on my arms or thighs. Also, I am able to use a smaller amount now that I am maintaining clear skin and no longer &amp;#34;treating&amp;#34; breakouts.</li>
            <li> The only thing that saved my skin. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this to keep her cystic acne down, we had proactive before, this does just as good and price is a lot cheaper, still on our first thing of it and 2 more left after that.</li>
            <li> Best product ever. My face would not stop breaking out. The first time I used it I had a reaction to the benzole peroxide and I got a rash on my face. I stopped using it for a week, then when I washed my face, I diluted it on a wash cloth and then scrubbed my face. It really helped. I can&#x27;t believe how much better my face works, and I&#x27;ve tried everything down to the proactive which only made me break out more.</li>
            <li> bought this based on reviews and glad i did. my daughter had tried all kinds of acne medicine but says this foaming wash really helped clear her skin.</li>
            <li> Son uses morning and night and it is clearing up his skin.  He can feel this product working unlike some other 2% washes he has tried.  Acne has not completely cleared up but this does keep it under control.</li>
            <li> We love this product.  Works great and it&#x27;s hard to find at the store.  Sometimes they have it, sometimes not.  Love the reliability of availability from Amazon. And the price is better too!</li>
            <li> I bought this on recommendation for my teen son from our dermatologist.  Works great, good price, doesn&#x27;t seem to be hard on the skin either.  I ordered the three pack, but one last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Great product. Not drying and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I started suffering from cystic acne.. don&#x27;t know why it developed at age 42 but all of sudden I had huge nodules on my back and smaller ones showing up on my face. I have used Pan-Oxyl for a few years now, and it definitely helps. When my problems started it went on for a a year before I sought help. It was nasty.... I used a prescription early on and this wash daily and got it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now its under control and I use this wash a little less, a few times a week.. I will always have it to combat those occasional outbreaks</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended me to use panoxyl because it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin as many other products in market does, it really prevents breakouts, keeps acne at bay and it&#x27;s affordable. I even use it to shave my bikini area and prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This foaming face wash was recommended by my wife&#x27;s dermatologist when she had an odd rash that persisted. After trying many things to get rid of the rash, which was worsening, she went for the experts opinion. The expert thought it was a bacterial infection and instead of prescribing a wild new prescription, he simply said get PanOxyl. It was made for acne bacteria, but it works so well, the doctor gives it to patients with skin infections as potentially serious as staph infections. This is the infection that can turn into the flesh eating bacteria that you hear about in the news. So, if its good enough for flesh eating disease, well, it is good enough for me -- and my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it turned out to be eczema and not a bacterial infection. My wife fell in love with the product, regardless and has become a devout user. Amazon&#x27;s options for buying this is the best value we&#x27;ve found -- especially the dual pack. Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it was one of the ones that has the strongest concentration for OTC medicine, but I see no benefits from that.  The price was good</li>
            <li> With daily use, this is quite effective at managing my teen son&#x27;s moderate/severe acne.</li>
            <li> been using morning and night for one month now.  Skin is completely clear, was unable to wear backless stuff prior to using this product.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough - 10x better than proactiv.</li>
            <li> The product is fairly strong but works fairly well for my complexion situation.  Be careful not to get it in your eyes or lips, or you&#x27;ll be unhappy...</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and recently started developing painful and aggressive acne. I tried a lot of products, but this one works the best. It does dry my skin a tad, but paired with an oil free moisturizer my complexion is on its way back to a more healthy appearance.</li>
            <li> This works great to help manage my sons acne. This brand was recommended for use by our dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using this for my bacne (which I&#x27;ve been struggling with for years) and I&#x27;m getting dramatic results. I apply this in the shower - it&#x27;s the last thing I use before I get out. For days I don&#x27;t shower, I spray on some Glytone. Life saver!</li>
            <li> This is the only product of its kind I will use for for stubborn acne.  It works!  Like most BP products, it will easily leave bleached out stains on your towels, and on your clothes and rugs/carpets (from feet, if you use in the shower) if you don&#x27;t really towel off first.  But that&#x27;s the nature of the beast with this kind of stuff.  Buy some cheap towels and washcloths and you&#x27;re goof to go.  Note that this 10% solution is very effective, whereas I tried the 5% and got no results at all.</li>
            <li> I brought this product excited to see what it could do for me. I have struggled with acne literally since I turned 10 and my mom always said use benzoid paraxiod to eliminate it but I never did. Finally, older I decided to. This first couple of days this product worked great very drying though but after a week it was terrible. My dark spots started getting darker I broke out on places on my face that I hadn&#x27;t for years.and I totally ignored the warning and washed my eyes with it every night. The end results was swelled, dark, dry to the touch eyes and acne everywhere. Why did I still give this product 3 stars you ask because without it I wouldn&#x27;t have realized I have dry skin initially and that was the problem all along. A girl with dry skin, using panoxyl, who loves matte makeup is one big fail in itself. So I went and got me a cleanser that hydrated no bumps and my skin looks better than ever.Again why give it 3 sstars I tend to break out between my thighs so again a very drying acne cleanser in a damp, oil magnet place does great. My blackheads between my thighs are dissapearing and every time I break out I don&#x27;t have to wait weeks for it to leave its gone in as little as two days so for my face 1 star for my thighs 3 meet in the middle.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad acne so I&#x27;m always looking for new and better products. I use this every day and it has made a huge difference! Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product and will continue buying it.  I had been using another product that has gone way up in price.</li>
            <li> I recently bought some new makeup &amp; it caused the worst breakout of my life, which is saying a lot since I&#x27;ve been on Accutane in the past.  I was desperate and remembered a dermatologist recommending this wash years ago, but back then I found it too drying.  I&#x27;m smarter now and instead of using this twice daily, I&#x27;m removing my makeup at night with a face wipe and then washing with PanOxyl followed by Neutrogena Oil-free Sensitive Skin moisturizer and using Cetaphil wash and Boots Expert Anti-Blemish Serum in the morning.  My skin started clearing after 1 day of this regimen and now 6 days later, it looks better than it did before the breakout.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my back! My dermatologist suggested I use this.  I found the bar of soap at CVS pharmacy but the discontinued carrying it or it was just hard to find.  So I found this on amazon and have ordered it here.  My back is clear! so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quick shipment too. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I use this on those days after I shave. It keeps the bumps and skin bumps down which occur after you shave.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to everyone that is looking for a healthy lifestyle and to better take of themselves to the fullest</li>
            <li> Dries out your skin, but good so far for acne prevention. You have to find the right balance for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and find it to work really well for me. I use it for my back, which is kept clear and this product also does not cause it to be dry like many other soaps. Only draw back is that there is a tendency for it to discolor your towels….my light green towel is now yellow….just fyi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also seller was great….fast efficient shipping!</li>
            <li> This is truly the best acne face wash out there. I have tried many different ones and have now stuck with this one for over three years.</li>
            <li> I never had acne on my back until 45 yrs. I have been spending mucho bucks on product that did not seem to control the oil. I have used Clinique Acne foam, bar, gel, Proactin regular and new extra strength, stidex wipes,simple alcohol to layer on top of the other products. I could still wash my back and face 3x a day or more. This stuff worked on the 1st application. My oil on my face and back was so much reduced by the second day. I am so excited to know that I found something that actually works. I look forward to knowing that the painful cysts will hopefully disappear. My makeup does not melt off from the oil</li>
            <li> Use it with Ziana and it works great. So far best foaming wash I&#x27;ve used, the size is good which lasts about 3 months. I use it at every shower with clean cloth. Price is right here in Amazon. I have bought this at Wal-Greens and it is the same price.</li>
            <li> This is better than all other benzoyl peroxide washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It comes in far larger volume for the price&lt;br /&gt;*It lathers 10x better than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used, allowing me to use less&lt;br /&gt;*It doesn&#x27;t excessively dry my skin compared to others&lt;br /&gt;*It works consistently well to reduce breakouts and doesn&#x27;t seem to lose effectiveness over multiple uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne on your back or some other large area of your body, this is the only solution that works well.</li>
            <li> Ok so i have moderate to severe back acne and arm acne after coming off of depoprovera. It has been horrible. I was prescibed tazorac which was working but not that well. I then decided to buy this and it has decreased my acne significantly. The arm acne has completely stopped and so has the back acne. I only have 3 active pimples on my back and they are not cystic and not bad at all. I use this twice a day leave it on for 1 or 2 minutes. I put on tazaorac 1 percent at night and Dan&#x27;s Aha in the morning for the scarring which is slowly getting lighter. I would recommend to anyone with back acne , and for the scars try Dan&#x27;s AHA to help fade the scars. It took about two weeks to decrease the back acne. It works great on my face but i still have two tiny pimples that just will not go away and maybe its because my skin is use to everything i do not experience any dryness</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that you go by directions on the bottle. Do not use it 2-3 times a day right off the bat. Your skin will become extremely dry and get a tight feeling. I would use it once a day for a week or two and then start using it 2-3 times a day. I have used this product for over 5 years now &amp; I love it. I came across this product as my grandmother said my father used to use it for his severe acne as it was precribed. Well I found out it was over the counter and was thrilled. I love how it has 10% Benzoyl Peroxide. Most OTC acne washes have only 3-5%. They didn&#x27;t help prevent and clear away my moderate acne. I have tried the bar soap version and believe that is best for my body but I love the cream for my face and shoulder. It does get foamy but not right off the bat, you have to rub it around a few times in order to get foamy. I wash my face 2 times a day almost everyday and a bottle will last me anywhere between 2-3 months as a little does go a long way. I usually use a quarter size amount for my face and shoulders. It&#x27;s definitely worth spending the money on it.  Alot of times you can find it in stores. I have seen it at Walmart, Target, and Publix (my local grocery store). I however like to buy the 3 pack from here &amp; it gets delivered pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my back (moderate acne). I noticed a difference within 1 week. Recommended by a dermatologist 2 years ago, but I&#x27;ve been flaring up since moving to a different climate.  Panoxyl helps break the cycle of picking because you have acne, but you have acne because you pick.  I do not use the 10% on my face except my forehead, because I have a very oily forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, the price you should pay is around $8-10 for the 10%, and $10-12 for the 4%.  Panoxyl prices online fluctuate wildly and sometimes get laughably high.  If prices get too high online, just go to a drug store or check the pharmacy section of your department store.</li>
            <li> This is a life saver. This was recommended to me by my dermatologist and it has changed my life. I&#x27;ve had back acne since I hit 13 years old. I&#x27;m now 22 years old and through all the years nothing else has worked for my back except for this. I&#x27;ve even had peels done and been on antibiotics before and that didn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;I use this with one of those long stretchy back scrubbers in the shower once a day. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and has completely rid my back of the cystic acne. I&#x27;ve been using this now for 4 months and noticed a difference after the first week of use. I&#x27;m happy to say that after nearly 10 years of wasted money, appointments, and harming my skins with peels, this is the only thing that has worked.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that remains of my back acne are the spots that have tremendously lightened (that were previously dark &#x27;blood&#x27; colored.)&lt;br /&gt;If using on your face, only use this once every two days at first (perhaps the first 2 weeks) as this WILL dry out your face and make you peel.</li>
            <li> The only product my wife and I have found to actually control adult acne. Take it from someone who has tried every other &amp;#34;over-the-counter&amp;#34; and mail-order product out there, this is the best. It will dry your skin which is why my dermatologist recommended we use CeraVe lotion along with PanOxyl. The combination has proven to work great! I highly recommend you give this face wash a chance. I will warn you to avoid getting it on clothing though as it will stain (Peroxide)!</li>
            <li> PanOxyl with 10% peroxide works better at getting rid of my acne and keeping it away than any other acne wash I&#x27;ve used including both OTC and prescription. Unfortunately the Drug stores don&#x27;t always carry it so that is why I buy it online.  It is creamy and you only need a small amount.  Breakouts respond quickly to the wash.  I have tried Clean and Clears Peroxide wash which also has 10% peroxide but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as PanOxyl. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who struggles with breakouts.  It is much easier on my skin then salicylic acid and for me definitely it feels better for my skin than the salicylic acid which irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> This is getting hard to find the local chain store is always out of it. This is also a very good price.</li>
            <li> Got these for my son, he goes through a single bottle pretty quickly. However, it is worth it to keep the acne down without going to prescriptions.</li>
            <li> Purchased at the advisement of the Dermatologist. Working well with positive results. Just caution to use every other day or once every 3 days if skin gets to dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> Always use this and at times is hard to find in the local stores.</li>
            <li> Liking it so far, face looking more clear</li>
            <li> My daughters dctr. Recommended this product...much better pricng here than at stores!!!</li>
            <li> Good product,not that great a price since I bought a 3pack.</li>
            <li> I was using the Walmart generic version of this product since they were no longer carrying the real thing. It just wasn&#x27;t the same. Not as creamy or gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I do not use any other brand except PanOxyl. I have used this product for many years and I am tickled pink that they released a Foaming wash. I did not like the bar, because of the mess. Nevertheless this is an amazing product! It will not let you down. It lathers up well, rinses with ease, you immediately feel a difference. Two to three days and you will notice big difference. I use it twice daily. PanOxyl also makes a 5% in this as well. My skin is so oily I have to use the 10%. It is extremely effective and I have had no problems with dryness. If this should occur use it every other day or try the 5%,</li>
            <li> I have always had acne.  It is much better now that I am older but PanOxyl has been the absolute best to take care of the acne I still occasionally get.  The 10% Benzoyl is key.  It doesn&#x27;t dry me out and I use it daily.  I have tried several acne face washes and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price!</li>
            <li> Only thing that has helped! It can be harsh on your skin at first, but if you keep consistent with it, your skin will adjust!</li>
            <li> Great product.  My teen and I use it for different skin issues. He keeps his acne at bay, and I use it for tightening my skin.  It is highly effective for both of us.</li>
            <li> Buy this as I wish I had found it 20 years ago. I love this soap works on a 43 year old. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great price on this - much more expensive at my pharmacy - is recommended for me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I can tell that this has helped clear up my troubled areas. I would recommend this over proactive any day of the week.</li>
            <li> I purchased PanOxyl after Oxy Max went on a price hike tear.  It was a fantastic choice. It has kept my face as clear as Oxy ever did. It will dry out your skin so I recommend a good moisturizer (check out Kiehl&#x27;s lineup for guys) and keep it away from your eyelids. It will cause your eyelids to dry excessively.  Everything has a trade-off...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before.  I love it. Glad it&#x27;s back in rotation.</li>
            <li> I was suffering with  shoulder acne from my age of 17 year old , now i&#x27;m 32 and till now I did many treatments but never worked.  but this product gave me a good hope from day 1. I washed my shoulder with this and next day I saw most of the small acne disappeared. wow.  still I had some pimple size of acne and it took 1 week of continue use to dry all of them. I used this 3 weeks so far . I can see a total change of my skin, its become clear than before. I had some dried acne marks more than 5-6 years, and I can see they starter to peal the skin on that area. only thing is , we have to use a body cream to avoid the hard dryness</li>
            <li> PanOxyl:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product instead of soap and works well. The price for this product is also in the affordable range.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal acne and have tried pretty much everything.  I&#x27;m quite happy with Panoxyl because it dries up my skin and clears it up faster than using nothing or a weaker product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this daily for over three months.  Sometimes once a day and sometimes twice because it really dries it up.  I like this three pack because I keep one in the shower for my shoulders and back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id say it works as well as Proactive for me (and it&#x27;s only one wash instead of three products).</li>
            <li> Major improvement for my skin. Yes, it can dry out skin, but this is easily fixed with a daily moisturizer. This stuff is simple and strong. Greatly reduces the frequency of my outbreaks.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s a little expensive, but it&#x27;s so worth it because it&#x27;s a great cleanser; I&#x27;ve been an avid user for some time now, and it&#x27;s great to be able to purchase it in a three-pack to save a few bucks when it&#x27;s the only cleanser I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I also use it as a body wash with my Clarisonic and it does great for a full-body wash.</li>
            <li> On my second serving of PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash; not sure if it  helps break-outs, may not be enough % Benzoyl Peroxide, but more would require a Rx.  One tube lasts a long time.  I like it for face wash but do not use it every day.  Seems it would dry skin on face too much and possibly irritate.  I bought this because read dermatologist with great clinic used Benzoyl Peroxide for her patients.  Does anything really work for adult onset acne?</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice.  Great price.</li>
            <li> Not exactly foaming as described.</li>
            <li> I love this wash!!&lt;br /&gt;I started using this per a dermatologist recommendation, and every time I try something else I regret it!&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the mornings, and Clinique 3-step at night.&lt;br /&gt;This arrived just as advertised, all three bottles in the boxes. No problems!</li>
            <li> Excellent way cheaper the in stores</li>
            <li> Be careful because it bleaches towels and pillow cases</li>
            <li> Bought this as a cheap alternative to Proactiv. Same active ingredient and I actually have gotten better results! Just be sure to make sure it is dry before putting on a shirt on going to bed because it will stain!</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps.  My dermatologist suggested it and I noticed it really did help when I had breakouts.  Its not magic though, it won&#x27;t make your breakouts just disappear.  I noticed it significantly shortened the time that my skin was broken out though.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap my girlfriend will use on her face, and she uses it every morning and night. Typically, she goes through a tube in about 3 weeks and immediately replaces it with another. We typically buy it from the pharmacy where it is $10 a tube, but in a bind  we sometimes have to buy it from our grocery store where it is $12. This deal of 3 tubes for $25 is by far the best value for this product. You will not find it in any store for a better price- trust me, we&#x27;ve searched. For anyone like my girlfriend who knows they like PanOxyl and would replace it eventually anyway, this is a must buy. I don&#x27;t use the product but my girlfriend has thousands of skin products she&#x27;s tried, and yet has  been religiously using this for 4 years... so I know it must be good</li>
            <li> this works well for my twenty year old who has acne.  Most  other washes don&#x27;t do as well as this and stop working after awhile. .son has been using this for a few years now with great results.&lt;br /&gt;This can dry out skin so he uses it once or twice a day.</li>
            <li> Works very well!! Got rid of all my existing acne. Still get a pimple every now and then but definately not like before. It is a bit drying, but moisturizer will do the trick. Ive only finished one tube and it made a big difference. Will for sure order more :)</li>
            <li> My scalp is sensitive to the perfumes added to most shampoo&#x27;s. My dermatologist recommended I use this product and my scalp feels great.</li>
            <li> I tend to break out quite a bit on my back and shoulders, especially when i am working out regularly. So i really needed something strong but overly drying that i could use all over. I use this once a day, when i shower, pretty much everywhere like i would with a normally shower gel. It has definitely minimized my breakouts, but is a bit too drying for my face. So i tend to use it up to my neck and no further north.</li>
            <li> I have sever acne on my back.  I was on the verge of breaking down and getting on actutane before trying this product.  I am not totally cleared after a month, but I am down to about 10% of what I had which is saying a lot.  I&#x27;ll stick with this.</li>
            <li> ehh it was okayy.. i still use it because i have 2 extra ones i don&#x27;t know what to do with, but for some reason it really irritates my eyes. it mostly just drys out your skin. but overall the product was alright. i did notice some of acne was drying out. worth a shot but would suggest getting just one of these</li>
            <li> This is the best BP product I&#x27;ve ever used - and I have used many. Once you use this, I believe that you will not return to the &#x27;cheap stuff&#x27; that you find on supermarket and drug store shelves. You probably know the common saying: &amp;#34;You get what you pay for.&amp;#34; That isn&#x27;t always true, but it is true in this case. You will notice a difference in the texture of this product compared to others: the PanOxyl has a paste-like consistency whereas all of its competitors have a pudding-like consistency. That paste turns into a robust foam after you lather it over your face a few times. Is that what makes the difference? Who knows. But know this: Different isn&#x27;t necessarily better, but better is always different. I can&#x27;t promise that PanOxyl will help your particular acne situation. I can say that it is far superior to the other BP products out there, and it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Works well must use twice a day to see results. May make some people skin dry if it is sensitive skin. I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied!  I ended up having dark blotches all over my face. Very unappealing. Should have gotten Proactive!</li>
            <li> 10% is pretty strong, beware if you have sensitive skin.  I use this only when I&#x27;m having a big breakout, otherwise I used the 4% creamy wash from the same brand(which I love).  the 10% and 4% products are actually pretty similar, other than the concentration of benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li> Great product !This product works great on my acne drys it out like nothing I&#x27;ve used before it a great value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble with acne for what seems like my entire life - used ProActiv but was never clear of acne. PanOxyl is AMAZING! I don&#x27;t even use it that much but am totally acne free now!</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok, but the bar is much better and seems like it does a better job. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item before at Walgreen&#x27;s but it is hard to find in the three pack as it is offered here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for over 27 years - this stuff is the only scrub that&#x27;s been effective at keeping it at bay.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> works great on controlling acne better that rx</li>
            <li> I have used this PanOxyl skin cleanser for many years, but it tends to go out-of-stock frequently.  I stock up on it whenever I can, I have three tubes right now.  Personally, I use it everyday for my face but only every other day on my neck due to shaving irritation and severe dryness.  This is mitigated by applying A light moisturizer every night before bedtime, I use the &amp;#34;Simple&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li> Panoxyl 10% is the only wash that has any positive effect on my son&#x27;s acne on his chest and back.Because of this, he uses it every day. Buying it over-the-counter at the only drug store that stocks it is quite expensive. This option at Amazon was so inexpensive, I thought it had  to be a hoax, but believe me; it is not. This multi-package bulk order is the real-deal. It is the same size I WAS buying in a store for $12 a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone who has any kind of acne. This si the best price I have seen anywhere. Quick and prompt delivery! I would recommend this product 100%!</li>
            <li> I started using this after going through so many big named brand 2% garbage products. My girlfriend had been using this as well for years before me. 10% is super strong so first few weeks, it dried me out alot. However, about a dimes worth or less is the perfect amount needed to get the job done. Last&#x27;s forever and improved my skin&#x27;s appearance tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People always say &amp;#34;Wow 10%, that&#x27;s insane. Why do you even use it? You don&#x27;t have acne...&amp;#34; That&#x27;s right I don&#x27;t, cause of this wash right here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember they discontinued it for a long time, I&#x27;m glad to see it back and so readily available in many online marketplaces as well as in large chain stores.</li>
            <li> I used to use 9% Benzoyl Peroxide as a prescription. After a few years, insurance started to charge me A LOT to get a prescription version. I found Panoxyl 10% and it has the same results for a lot less!</li>
            <li> Really, I see a difference in my skin, especially on my back.  It&#x27;s really helped fade some old acne marks I had!!  It does take time to see the difference, but I&#x27;m really happy I found something strong enough that&#x27;ll help even out my tone and old scars.</li>
            <li> Good for drying skin (and pimples, of course) but doesn&#x27;t cure acne or prevent outbreaks.</li>
            <li> Before I took control of my life and figured out that my diet/stress/cleansing habits were directly contributing to my acne, I had awful, awful skin. I would get cystic acne on my cheeks and jawline, spots all over my face, and my skin would always feel rough but very dry. I tried using some other benzoyl peroxide creams and washes, but I didn&#x27;t notice any of them helping. Then my mom took me to the dermatologist, who prescribed me antibiotics, and bought me this cream that was apparently doing wonders for my brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let me tell you - if you have severe acne, this wash is the best thing that will ever happen to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got rid of pretty much all my acne by using this 10% wash every night, applying both Differin and Clindamycin before I went to bed, rinsing with a gentle cleanser every morning, spot treating with a random salicylic acid thing, and taking antibiotics. Also eating well, decreasing stress, sleeping regularly, etc. etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution: this wash is super super harsh. I was in the Midwest during the winter, AND I have eczema, so after using this cream twice a day (not recommended), my skin grew extremely red and sting-y and extremely dry. However, I go to school in California, where the weather isn&#x27;t nearly as harsh, and I could use this wash only ONCE a day, applying moisturizer directly after, and my skin would feel perfectly fine. No dry patches or rashes or anything! (It could also be that I built up a tolerance to it, I honestly don&#x27;t know - either way, it works!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself is white and comes in a sqeezable tube. It&#x27;s a bit rough, which is good because it exfoliates super super super well, and you don&#x27;t need to use that much to get a lot out of it. If my skin is feeling particularly sensitive that day, I&#x27;ll apply the cream and immediately take it off. If I can handle it, I&#x27;ll apply the cream, let it sit while I brush my teeth, then wash it off. Obviously, the longer you leave it on the more work it&#x27;ll do on your skin, but it&#x27;ll also hurt more. It&#x27;s a delicate balance, a relationship I&#x27;ve formed with my PanOxyl 10% Foaming Wash that I&#x27;ve come to love and care for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, basically, this is going to feel fine for the first few days, it&#x27;s going to hurt a lot for the next week or so (I recommend you cut down on use at this time), and it&#x27;s going to be MAGICAL afterwards. The feeling of your face being visibly and tangibly smoother after just one application is SO AWESOME. Just buy this freakin&#x27; thing already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, now that my skin&#x27;s better, I&#x27;ve moved on to the PanOxyl 4% wash, which isn&#x27;t nearly as good as an exfoliator but it still does the job for me.</li>
            <li> Received it on Feb 2015 and the Expiration date is June 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Ordered again &amp; still the same date of Expiration.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean, works extremely well. Don&#x27;t even have to use it much.</li>
            <li> After trying lots of products, we found this one and my son has used it ever since. It really helped control his breakouts and made his skin look sooo much better.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and I have always had intermittent bouts of acne on my neck chest or back and since my skin blemishes easily, they spots usually stay for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product almost daily for the last 6 months and for the last 3 or so I have been completely acne free. This really is the ONLY product I have used that has been able to give me such consistent results. I still get the random zit every now and again but they only last a day or so tops and dissipate much quicker. The only real downside is that this does bleach your towels so either have a dedicated towel or use white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;- 2 months until clear skin&lt;br /&gt;- Consistently works&lt;br /&gt;- Might have magic inside&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Will bleach your towels so just dry off with white towels (waaa)</li>
            <li> Awesome product...truly in love with the results</li>
            <li> My child&#x27;s dermatologist recommended PanOxyl bar soap, but this foaming face wash is so much better.  It has helped to clear acne without over drying the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It was recommended by my dermatologist to treat my adult acne (I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne since I was a teen, and now I&#x27;m in my 40s and it&#x27;s still there, but not quite that bad!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I had to have a prescription to get it, which was a hassle. Then I found it on the shelf of CVS one day and started buying it there. Now they don&#x27;t sell it anymore, so I turned to Amazon. The price is right (about $10 each). There&#x27;s also the bar soap version which CVS also used to sell inexpensively (and worked just as well), however the Amazon price on that is out of control, so stick with this foaming wash version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use PanOxyl foaming wash once a day in the shower after cleaning my face with Ivory soap. I usually dry my face with a towel while in the shower, before I use the PanOxyl, then leave it on the entire time I&#x27;m washing the rest of my body. Washing it off is the last thing I do before I get out of the shower. Doing it this way (just once a day), I never see a blemish. Also, you don&#x27;t need much. Just a small amount (a blob about the width of your thumb). It&#x27;s incredible and the only thing that keeps the blemishes off of my oily skin. If I stop using it, the blemishes come back within a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter also uses this and for her, it greatly helps, but she still gets some blemishes. So, results will vary of course. For me, an adult male in my 40s, this completely solves my acne problem. I won&#x27;t shower without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also admit that no other over-the-counter acne scrub/wash/etc works like this does. This stuff is the bomb diggity zit buster 2000. Get it. There are no side-effects, either. The cream is easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and your pores tighten up as they should.</li>
            <li> As a 50 yr. woman with adult acne this a the OTC face wash I have found to date.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous other products and have been on Accutane and had Glycolic  peels in my dermatologists office.  The two can dangerous and expensive respectively.  For a product I can purchase myself and use daily at home I am pleased with the results. I will caution that you may experience drying and flaking around your eye, nose and lip areas ( at least in my case).</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and good shape love the product for my son face!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product but I couldn&#x27;t.  My friend swears by this product and he recommended it to me for acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was impressed.  It worked great!  Granted, my skin was dry and scaly perpetually but it was preferable to having a bunch of gross acne pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, after just about 2-3 weeks I found that my pimples were returning.  In fact, it seemed like they were worse than before.  It seemed to grant me a temporary reprieve, but maybe my body overcompensated for the extreme dryness and started producing more facial oil.  I would have used moisturizer, but I found that all moisturizers (even the supposedly non-comedogenic ones) caused breakouts for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars anyway because it did work for a while, but your mileage may vary.  My friend has been using it for years apparently and loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cleaner but the expiration date after 6 months is a short time</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my son&#x27;s dermatologist.  He uses it in conjunction with other acne medication but it works great.  We see the difference when we use a different brand</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my back acne.  Works great! It states its foamy but i feel its more of a creamy paste.  Rub it on in the shower, wash it off quick, and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> Both of my boys use this and it really helps with their acne.</li>
            <li> My 14 yo uses these stuff once a day, and he&#x27;s not an oily kid. It&#x27;s working great for him, and was recommended by his pediatrician.</li>
            <li> I love panoxyl soap , because it works for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> best for acne on the legs/buttocks</li>
            <li> Very good for back acne I had severe back acne on my whole back I&#x27;m taking acne with pus in it , and painful when you try to squeeze . My entire back was covered it was so bad I still have bad scarring and some acne but nothing like before it went from 100 percent down to maybe 10 percent it erased my chest acne and neck acne . I use to use it on my face but it was too drying for the face but it did clear up my facial acne but the drying was too much . This is the best for body acne hands down, and for the scarring try dans aha really good for hyper pigmentation . I still have some residual acne and I&#x27;m 22 . My only issue is if I stop panoxyl for a while my acne comes back but this is because I have a hormonal issue but it does clear that awful body acne.</li>
            <li> If used one to two times daily, will control heat rash</li>
            <li> I used to use Neutrogena sensitive skin bar, but would get occasional breakouts. I went to a dermatologist for the first time in years and he suggested using this so I tried it. It&#x27;s awesome! At first it dried my skin out like crazy, but your face gets used to it after about a week. I use a little Cetaphil sensitive skin lotion to help out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I barely get any pimples any more since using this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and works very well. I received it in the mail quickly also and without any issues.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that works well, unfortunately it is usually very expensive. This 3 pack deal is the best price I have found. GREAT deal.</li>
