            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, that&#x27;s the best endorsement there is.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, it realy detangles hair without breaking the hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I just need more time with it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it separates the hair without pulling it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this brush to anyone :)</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but these work great for short hair too, so I bought my own.</li>
            <li>best money I spent on a hairbrush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush my hair loves this brush intangibles easy to clean...</li>
            <li>Also, the quality of the bristles doesn&#x27;t compare to the original brush and not as strong.  </li>
            <li>Must clean with soap and hot water to keep it nice and clean.</li>
            <li>This brush has nothing to do with the original Mirta De Perales brush.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found the brush on amazon and placed my order.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>I heard that using a brush with bristles instead of the other style brushes is great for combo hair.  </li>
            <li>I finally brought a replacement brush after 24 years of the same brush, it started to wear lol.</li>
            <li>From what I can tell my mother, sister and all my female relatives love this brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles began to fall off of the brush on my first comb.</li>
            <li>I had my first Mirta brush from the age of 10-34.</li>
            <li>The first thing i noticed was the scratches on the handle of the brush .</li>
            <li>thanks it arrived just in time for me to give it to her.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Product as advertised and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Problem is this brush doesn&#x27;t really get to my scalp well</li>
            <li>I really get my scalp and hair well pampered.  </li>
            <li>I misplaced my mirtha de perales brush that I&#x27;ve own for years.</li>
            <li>We had used it and only it since more than 20 years and every time we travel from Costa Rica to New Jersey we buy 1 or 2 directly at the Store.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>It is but a cheap imitation.</li>
            <li>The translucent white molded plastic looks cheap with a diamond pattern on the brush back that looks like something from the 1940 ties.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, this is exactly the same quality product that it was then.</li>
            <li>and I was told if I brush with a brush like this it would help comb the natural oils through my hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing unusual is that the plastic bristles are stiffer and a bit longer than others I have used, so it is suited to those with dense hair a weaker brush</li>
            <li>My mom used to use this comb when since i was 4yrs old.</li>
            <li>Old brush.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised with this brush.  </li>
            <li>20yrs later and that brush is still alive.</li>
            <li>I he to replace my old brush same one it lasted 12 years!!!!</li>

            <li> Will be purchasing more soon!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  I find the brush does it work without breaking the hair.  I have curly, thick hair, which is hard to manage.  With this brush is very easy and my hair looks great.</li>

            <li> This brush will last you forever. I have on e that I brought ten years ago and it still brushes the same. I had to buy my mom one. She loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it realy detangles hair without breaking the hair.  I have been using this brush since I was a kid.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> There is a metal piece sticking out of mine that cuts me each time. My four sisters and my cousin swear by this brush though...</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair. It is difficult to find a brush that will &#x27;go through&#x27; my hair to my scalp. When I received this brush, and it did what I needed, I ordered another one. I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Being Dominican, I grew up with these in the house. From what I can tell my mother, sister and all my female relatives love this brush. Yea I&#x27;m a man.... but these work great for short hair too, so I bought my own.</li>
            <li> I am very, very happy with my purchase! Product as advertised and fast shipping. I already recommended you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for over 20 yrs. I have curly hair and this brush detangles without any hair or brittle breakage. It massages my scalp, spreads the shine from scalp to the ends. It&#x27;s durable and lasts for decades. Must clean with soap and hot water to keep it nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m satisfy.</li>
            <li> The bristles began to fall off of the brush on my first comb.</li>

            <li> My wife had lost hers and I was determined to replace it, eventhough that she had it for 15 years.  Believe it or not, this is exactly the same quality product that it was then.</li>
            <li> I had a brush years ago, and I ordered it cause I missed how it left my hair. best money I spent on a hairbrush.</li>
            <li> This brush has nothing to do with the original Mirta De Perales brush.  It is but a cheap imitation.</li>
            <li> We had used it and only it since more than 20 years and every time we travel from Costa Rica to New Jersey we buy 1 or 2 directly at the Store.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it. It didn&#x27;t seem to different from the rest.  Maybe I just need more time with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it is one of the now very few traditionally shaped brushes I could find. The only thing unusual is that the plastic bristles are stiffer and a bit longer than others I have used, so it is suited to those with dense hair a weaker brush would struggle to penetrate. On the down side, the handle is unfriendly to the hand with with fairly sharp edges, both on its chopped off end and on the sides. The translucent white molded plastic looks cheap with a diamond pattern on the brush back that looks like something from the 1940 ties.</li>

            <li> My mother started  using this brush on my hair since i was a kid.  I absolutely love how it separates the hair without pulling it.  Now my daughter loves this brush, and my sister and her daughters.  My youngest daughter and my  nieces all have very long hair.</li>
            <li> My mom used to use this comb when since i was 4yrs old. The only brush that nerve broke my curly hair. I decided to purchase 2 one for my mom and myself since the one the she still has is worn out. 20yrs later and that brush is still alive.</li>
            <li> I love this brush my hair loves this brush intangibles easy to clean... I he to replace my old brush same one it lasted 12 years!!!!</li>
            <li> Back in the 90&#x27;s I had this brush. Last year it was taken by someone and I missed it A LOT. I got soooo happy when I found it here in Amazon. It truly is a great brush. It leaves my hair silky looking. I recommend this brush to anyone :)</li>
            <li> The best hair brush ever. I have been using it for years. I really get my scalp and hair well pampered.  No build ups or split ends. Is amazing I always buy 3 one for each of my girls and myself.  No sharing brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought three hair brush and one brush was  missing a comb fiber.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> It replaced by 25 yr. Old brush.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;I use the other one for scrubbing.  It lasts forevrr.</li>
            <li> I misplaced my mirtha de perales brush that I&#x27;ve own for years. I was so excited when I found the brush on amazon and placed my order.

            <li> Pleasantly surprised with this brush.  The wife wanted it as she had heard it was good so I appeased her.  The best use I&#x27;ve gotten out of it is on my Mexican/African granddaughter.  Her hypercurly hair is normally hard to comb and painful for her.  This brush combs out those girls without even a peep of annoyance.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, that&#x27;s the best endorsement there is.</li>
