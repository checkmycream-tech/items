            <li>I&#x27;ve used many deodorants before</li>
            <li>When I use this product I am confident that I will not be self-conscious throughout the day....</li>

            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and so does my husband.  </li>
            <li>My husband love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>Pretty good deal on the price as well.</li>
            <li>and it does an excellent job of keeping me dry.</li>
            <li>Great shipping, super fast.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, it prevents wetness, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Works as designed, is not to strongly scented and does not build up on the armpit hair or tee shirts.</li>
            <li>AXE dark temptations is the best stick I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about this great deodorant other than I get a lot of compliments on the smell being GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>I received the 6 pack in the mail on time, it smells great, but not a single one of them works.  </li>
            <li>I smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic, chocolate scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, keeps you smelling good even after a long workout.</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine, just as good as the last one (Degree).</li>
            <li>does keep my husband dry and smelling attractive.  </li>
            <li>Some deodorants would give me a rash, while others just didn&#x27;t keep me clean smelling at all.  </li>
            <li>First, really like the performance of this product, very pleased.</li>
            <li>but I get the most positive feedback with this one.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get the matching spray which is useful for a refresh on hot summer days.</li>
            <li>fragrance elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Price is more than reasonable and I would recommend and have recommended purchasing any of the Axe products to my friends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kinda spicy, but not that sweet perfume stuff.</li>
            <li>I did, the dark temptation has a great scent and does the intended job.</li>
            <li>The Axe Dry deodorants do not irritate my skin and also keep me smelling good.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and smelling good.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t need to be ducking into a bathroom to fresh&#x27;n up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and overwhelming like the body spray.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend you purchase this, especially if you can get a good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Keeps me smelling nice all day long.</li>
            <li>Much better price than anywhere locally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since it first hit the shelves.</li>
            <li>Second, the scent is more than acceptable.</li>
            <li>I liked the multi-pack price and the other reviews were positive</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle, yet noticeable and great smelling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years, and still love the smell, so does my long term girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Very good product unlike the new 3 oz formula which is purple/brown in color, extremely irritating to the skin, and much less effective.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend even said as much.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>and it gets really sticky.</li>
            <li>WHO WANTS TO TALK ABOUT BODY ODER ?</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s just as good if not better!</li>
            <li>obviously since it&#x27;s dark XD, good value and ships fast</li>
            <li>This is the original white-colored solid antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what I like smell and feel clean for a low price</li>
            <li>I can be pretty busy in and out of the office.</li>
            <li>Not bad, just a bit different.</li>
            <li>It works well even with very heavy exercise, doesn&#x27;t get all chalky, and in a multi pack is cost effective.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that Amazon offers a 6-pack, as both me and my husband use this product.  </li>
            <li>its not as bad as others i have had its a good one to get id suggest it the smell isnt strong at all</li>
            <li>But why not just sit back and relax, watch some football, save a little bit of money, and get them shipped to your front door in no time from this nice vendor?</li>
            <li>I usually buy the \\&quot;Essence\\&quot; scent, but \\&quot;Dark Temptation\\&quot; was a better deal as a six pack with a coupon available at the time I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>My pits don&#x27;t smell and when they were on sale with a coupon were FAR cheaper than the store!</li>
            <li>The Dark Temptation line is very creative and not your typical men&#x27;s locker room smell.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product for my husband and I use subscribe and save to get a new shipment every few months.  </li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m 17 years old.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>People are surprised when I tell them \\&quot;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It smells just a tad different from my older stuff.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a reasonably priced dry antiperspirant/deodorant, but I never had used the Axe brand.  </li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive armpits, especially with the gel type deodorants.  </li>
            <li>This is the 2.7 oz old formula that is white and doesn&#x27;t irritate my boyfriend&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li>It has the typical &amp;#34;axe&amp;#34; scent when you first put it on</li>
            <li>The Dark Temptation scent doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent to it - it&#x27;s a nice, subtle, almost chocolate/cinnamon scent.</li>
            <li>It was what I expected and I highly recommend</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and seriously works all day long.  </li>
            <li>Too bad AXE had to mess up a good product!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> strange..</li>
            <li> It works quite well at keeping me dry, and as a bonus, I get to smell</li>
            <li> Axe dry</li>
            <li> I had to contact them a few times to get the product a month later...</li>
            <li> May be that my previous order has aged as I buy it in the six pack.</li>
            <li> That way the bacteria you&#x27;re trying to eliminate won&#x27;t adapt to the active ingredient mix of one brand.</li>
            <li> Keeps the Stink down and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> and I got a 2.7-ounce pack for half price.</li>
            <li> I have used every deodorant out there marketed for woman and although I wasn&#x27;t sweating an obscene amount I always felt a little stinky by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I try to switch brands at least every other time.</li>
            <li> Even after going to the gym or going a little longer than usual between showers, my armpits never stink when I&#x27;m using this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure where else to purchase.</li>
            <li> Axe changes their scent selection regularly so this one is almost impossible to find in stores now.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell anything like chocolate, i was a little disappointed by it.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it leaves A LOT of residues on your underarm hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Spary is a disappointment compared to stick.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Stops stink. No sweating. Legit</li>
            <li> Much to my wife&#x27;s disapproval, I&#x27;ve been smearing this chemical de-stinker under my arms for a few years now.  It works quite well at keeping me dry, and as a bonus, I get to smell like I&#x27;m 17 years old.  Ah, makes me miss the 90s...</li>
            <li> This has a great scent; it&#x27;s kinda chocolaty. I don&#x27;t use the spray under the arms so I got the sticks to match the spray. Pretty good deal on the price as well. No complaints so far. Be sure to get the matching spray which is useful for a refresh on hot summer days.</li>
            <li> I love the deal i got for the axe deoderant can not beat it and it smells real good.</li>
            <li> Great seller and great item.</li>
            <li> Axe dry does keep my husband dry and smelling attractive.  The chocolate is our favorite scent.</li>
            <li> This is TOTALLY not a guy&#x27;s scent, neither is the Phoenix one. I&#x27;ve been using them more like perfume, and I always get compliments. People are surprised when I tell them \\&quot;It&#x27;s my Deodorant\\&quot;  I will probably never go back to girls&#x27; deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for quite some time, and it has provided me with great protection.  The scent is subtle, yet noticeable and great smelling. I would highly recommend you purchase this, especially if you can get a good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Keeps the Stink down and lasts all day. I can be pretty busy in and out of the office. So I don&#x27;t need to be ducking into a bathroom to fresh&#x27;n up</li>
            <li> Great deodorant, I&#x27;ve been ordering it for months, good chocolaty scent, goth girlfriend likes it- obviously since it&#x27;s dark XD, good value and ships fast</li>
            <li> My armpits smell delicious.  My girlfriend even said as much.  She feels the Temptation...</li>
            <li> This was part of a package deal with the body spray.  It smells sooooo good. Bought the body spray because it smelled so good o someone I worked with.  Much better price than anywhere locally.</li>
            <li> I received the 6 pack in the mail on time, it smells great, but not a single one of them works.  None of the deodorant will advance upon twisting the bottom on ANY of them.</li>
            <li> What&#x27; not to like. Good scents too!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell anything like chocolate, i was a little disappointed by it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Axe Brand of deodorant.  I usually buy the \\&quot;Essence\\&quot; scent, but \\&quot;Dark Temptation\\&quot; was a better deal as a six pack with a coupon available at the time I purchased it.  The deodorant seems to do the job--lasts all day and even smells nice.</li>
            <li> I smell fantastic. But it doesn&#x27;t get me all the ladies like their ads and the product says. Bought many times and will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is the original white-colored solid antiperspirant. Very good product unlike the new 3 oz formula which is purple/brown in color, extremely irritating to the skin, and much less effective. Too bad AXE had to mess up a good product!</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, it prevents wetness, and the price is right. With Prime, I can get it delivered here and still save a couple bucks from the grocery store price.</li>
            <li> The screw on 5 of the 6 containers does not elevate the anti-perspirant.  Complete waste of money.  Not sure where else to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the way my husband smells when he wears this. He loves that it doesn&#x27;t aggravate his psoriasis and cause him to break out. Win win.</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive armpits, especially with the gel type deodorants.  Some deodorants would give me a rash, while others just didn&#x27;t keep me clean smelling at all.  The Axe Dry deodorants do not irritate my skin and also keep me smelling good.  Even after going to the gym or going a little longer than usual between showers, my armpits never stink when I&#x27;m using this product.</li>
            <li> The Dark Temptation scent doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent to it - it&#x27;s a nice, subtle, almost chocolate/cinnamon scent. I thought this one wouldn&#x27;t be as good as the now discontinued Clix scent but it&#x27;s just as good if not better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it first hit the shelves. I&#x27;m stocking up now because it doesn&#x27;t seem to be in stores anymore. I hope it&#x27;s not being discontinued! It&#x27;s a fantastic, chocolate scent. Everyone tells me how good I smell. It&#x27;s not heavy and overwhelming like the body spray.</li>
            <li> Probably one of my favorite deodorants. I&#x27;ve used many deodorants before but I get the most positive feedback with this one. I normally stay away from AXE products but Dark Temptation is something that I always go back to.</li>
            <li> Would buy clix instead.&lt;br /&gt;Not a great fragrence.&lt;br /&gt;Spary is a disappointment compared to stick. They both have different fragrence.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  My husband wears it daily with sleeveless shirts.  No clumping under the arm.  Performs great and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> its not as bad as others i have had its a good one to get id suggest it the smell isnt strong at all and it smells good</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product for my husband and I use subscribe and save to get a new shipment every few months.  I really appreciate that Amazon offers a 6-pack, as both me and my husband use this product.  It didn&#x27;t start out that way... I have used every deodorant out there marketed for woman and although I wasn&#x27;t sweating an obscene amount I always felt a little stinky by the end of the day.  While on vacation where I forgot my deodorant I decided to use his.  Holy hell batman, this stuff is amazing!  It goes on so smooth and seriously works all day long.  It has the typical &amp;#34;axe&amp;#34; scent when you first put it on but it&#x27;s nothing that sticks with you all day.  When I use this product I am confident that I will not be self-conscious throughout the day.... so good for guys &#x3D; good for girls!</li>
            <li> It smells just a tad different from my older stuff. Not bad, just a bit different. May be that my previous order has aged as I buy it in the six pack.</li>
            <li> AXE dark temptations is the best stick I have ever used. Keeps me smelling nice all day long. This is the only one that I have used in 50 years that last all day.</li>
            <li> My pits don&#x27;t smell and when they were on sale with a coupon were FAR cheaper than the store!</li>
            <li> My wife loves chocolate.  She eats the stuff up like an addict.  This stuff smells like chocolate.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Works as designed, is not to strongly scented and does not build up on the armpit hair or tee shirts.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected and I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is the only antiperspirant that my hubby will use. Axe changes their scent selection regularly so this one is almost impossible to find in stores now.</li>
            <li> This was a very good buy and the product itself has a great smell and last all day and then some.</li>
            <li> Great deal that&#x27;s what I like smell and feel clean for a low price</li>
            <li> This is the same solid antiperspirant stick you can buy anywhere for about the same price. It&#x27;s a great product. But why not just sit back and relax, watch some football, save a little bit of money, and get them shipped to your front door in no time from this nice vendor?</li>
            <li> HOOORAY! This is the 2.7 oz old formula that is white and doesn&#x27;t irritate my boyfriend&#x27;s skin! I have been looking all over for it. So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I like the scent and works well (I&#x27;m a big guy, and this can keep up with me)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. Lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Great shipping, super fast. Can&#x27;t say enough about this great deodorant other than I get a lot of compliments on the smell being GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a reasonably priced dry antiperspirant/deodorant, but I never had used the Axe brand.  I liked the multi-pack price and the other reviews were positive so I gave it a try.  I&#x27;m very happy I did, the dark temptation has a great scent and does the intended job.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  I buy from Amazon because I cannot find the &amp;#34;Dark Temptation&amp;#34; fragrance elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Price is more than reasonable and I would recommend and have recommended purchasing any of the Axe products to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to antiperspirant. I really like the scent and it does an excellent job of keeping me dry.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it leaves A LOT of residues on your underarm hair. and it gets really sticky. it&#x27;s definitely NOT invisible. I would never buy it again</li>
            <li> Upset it took over a month to receive product. But the lady was helpful in fixing the issue..  I guess UPS lost my package. It never showed it leaving the facility on my tracking report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very strange.. I had to contact them a few times to get the product a month later... but hey that&#x27;s what happens when you only want to pay 50% of the CVS price....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years, and still love the smell, so does my long term girlfriend. It works well even with very heavy exercise, doesn&#x27;t get all chalky, and in a multi pack is cost effective.</li>
            <li> The only anti-perspirant I will buy. Keeps me dry and smelling good.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and so does my husband.  It works for hours and keeps the odor away.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Rated five stars because there are no faults with this. It arrived in plastic packaging with six inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product works great and just as described, no issues.</li>
            <li> Well, I was low on anti-perspirant/deodorant so onto the shopping list it went. I try to switch brands at least every other time. That way the bacteria you&#x27;re trying to eliminate won&#x27;t adapt to the active ingredient mix of one brand. No kidding. It keeps them guessing. Anyway there&#x27;s a lot of good deodorant/anti-perspirant products around and I&#x27;d never heard of this one before, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Actually, the store had a sale on it and I got a 2.7-ounce pack for half price. Let&#x27;s see how the bacteria take to this. It seems to work fine, just as good as the last one (Degree). Neat fragrance. Kinda spicy, but not that sweet perfume stuff. I&#x27;d say it was a good aroma for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> First, really like the performance of this product, very pleased. Not all antiperspirants do their job, this one does. Second, the scent is more than acceptable.</li>
            <li> My husband love&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s the only brand he will use.</li>
            <li> Great for the price of a pack of 6. This will be the cheapest you will find at the store if divide the price by 6.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to trust the Axe brand. Solid performance throughout the day and no matter the the conditions. The Dark Temptation line is very creative and not your typical men&#x27;s locker room smell.</li>
            <li> WHO WANTS TO TALK ABOUT BODY ODER ? WELL THIS OFFER MADE ME DO SO ... THIS IS THE BEST DEAL YOU WILL GET ON THIS QUALITY MEN&#x27;S DEODORANT  ITS A YEAR SUPPL !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, keeps you smelling good even after a long workout. I only use it in the morning when I wake up, and it lasts all day.</li>
