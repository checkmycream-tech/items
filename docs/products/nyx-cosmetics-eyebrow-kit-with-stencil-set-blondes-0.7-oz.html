            <li>Would be nice if they included a wax with this.</li>
            <li>This is a great kit with 3 different colors to blend for a perfect match.</li>
            <li>I used the stencil to originally shape my brows once and they looked great.</li>
            <li>That is the best cosmetics eyebrow kit i have ever owned, it works great, it does not leave any residue, or look fake, it matches my eyebrows well, fill them out and shapes them perfectly.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging, colors are ok.</li>
            <li>Having four colors is great for getting just the right color I need.</li>
            <li>But mostly because I prefer my eyebrows more squared off.. but the product itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>this was my first eyebrow kit.....and its great....</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t very accurate.</li>
            <li>Love the way it goes on.</li>
            <li>I still love this eyebrow kit.  </li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>Try it out :)</li>
            <li>I love the stencils but wished the had a lighter palette.</li>
            <li>I hoped I would love this</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many options for stencils, but I found one that worked for me, most of the time.</li>
            <li>i&#x27; am going to be ordering more NYX cosmetic items, they have a variety to choose from.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Practice makes you better and better at it.</li>
            <li>:) I am not blond</li>
            <li>I love the brand NYX</li>
            <li>so i can still use it &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I love the shadows and they stay in place all day, even if I sweat.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the stencil that comes with the product because it&#x27;s sort of challenging.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is just ok.</li>
            <li>hi i received  NYX Cosmetics Eyebrow Kit With Stencil Set, Blondes 0.7 Oz its very very nice thanks a lot . . .</li>
            <li>Perfect for someone who has very light eye brows and dark hair.  </li>
            <li>but i just use it free hand :)</li>
            <li>I honestly do think this is well worth the 13 dollars I had paid for.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It fits easily in my purse if I don&#x27;t have time in the mornings, or if I&#x27;m going somewhere overnight.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair and it is easy to match to my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I also love the fact that the brow powder can be mixed to match your preference,the concistence is great for sutle brows or you can build the product</li>
            <li>This product was shipped quickly and it performs well pretty good payout</li>
            <li>The brush is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>These kit has the tools, shadow, and stencils necessary for a great eyebrow.</li>
            <li>I now use a water proof light brown mascara to color the hair on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>the eye brow guides are very useful.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was excited about it because I&#x27;ve needed to have a brow kit for awhile.</li>
            <li>I originally thought this was to be used with the stencil</li>
            <li>so I use the darkest brown in the kit and the powder goes on super smooth.  </li>
            <li>So before you buy please keep in mind to choose the right shades for you!</li>
            <li>The product was in great condition, and everything was the way I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li>I have medium olive toned skin like Tyra Banks, I don&#x27;t look like her at all, so this kit works great for me and my blonde hair and fair skin clients to clients a little darker than me.  </li>
            <li>Stencils are huge, so unless you have really bushy eyebrows, this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li>I normally use my matte MAC eyeshadows as my brow filler, but the texture of these powders were intended for the brows and stick beautifully without looking like I filled them in too harsh.  </li>
            <li>The powders can be useful if you want to put 10 layers of it on.</li>
            <li>Not one of the stencils is right for me.</li>
            <li>The entire kit was very cheap.</li>
            <li>My blonde eyebrows have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>This kit was okay especially if you are a beginner.  </li>
            <li>This is my second NYX product and I love it.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the highlighter should be wax, and that would make it perfect!</li>
            <li>Easy to use stencils and will last forever !</li>
            <li>I just decided to dye my hair dark brown (from blonde) and another color works great to make my eyebrows darker.</li>
            <li>I suggest applying, and playing with it before you need to really use the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that I can make my eyebrows look neat but not clownish!!</li>
            <li>That being said, they really aren&#x27;t needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this kit &amp; would recommend  it.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t really have to hold them there since they&#x27;re plastic and real flexible.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I actually use the light color as my highlight and it looks so pretty and natural.  </li>
            <li>I definitely have to do it in two parts and then clean up.</li>
            <li>I am fair with medium blond hair with a little red in it.  </li>
            <li>The colors are darker than I expected, but that was ok, as I am a natural brunette.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and if you apply oit properly it will last all day.</li>
            <li>so i new</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally a dishwater blonde, but my hair is dyed a light to mid brown.</li>
            <li>I used them the first couple times, but they don&#x27;t fit my face shape at all - they are very long and wide.</li>
            <li>Looks very natural with no stiff stencil.</li>
            <li>This is like the coolest eyebrow kit ever the stencils are easy to use after holding them to your eyebrow for a few minutes</li>
            <li>I wish it had a clear setting to mix with the shadows.</li>
            <li>It looks natural as it uses a brush and</li>
            <li>If you can get the stencil to stay in place and get the eyebrow on it doesn&#x27;t look natural.  </li>
            <li>and I took it back because i was very upset.  </li>
            <li>so the blonde only has one color that&#x27;s the right shade.</li>
            <li>Cute brushes are small but do nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Stencils are small, medium, and large.</li>
            <li>I was surprised as to how well the product stayed on all day, and never smudged the entire day.</li>
            <li>I swatched it on my hand and barely any product showed up.</li>

            <li> I was surprised as to how well the product stayed on all day, and never smudged the entire day.</li>
            <li> I swatched it on my hand and barely any product showed up.</li>
            <li> The color selections are a bit strange for a blonde kit.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other more expensive eyebrow kits (the Anastasia brand) and nothing beats this.</li>
            <li> The picture model on the package is a little... too natural and misleading?</li>
            <li> It looks like a huge fake eyebrow.</li>
            <li> But the problem is that the tools are cheap (my angled brush tool was glued wrong and is slanted to one side) and</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for, can help with a dramatic look or something simple, either way, you can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
            <li> use it every day, and it has lasted for so long!</li>
            <li> It is to dry to work with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you apply too much, your eyebrows will look fake, and applied-looking, and too little, and you wont notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> The tan is the only one that comes remotely close to my hair color and even then is a bit too dark at times.</li>
            <li> Not much fall out</li>
            <li> The stencils are pretty useless.</li>
            <li> First, my fault, I ordered the wrong palette.</li>
            <li> The sheer magnitude of their size is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very careful with the amount I put on my face.</li>
            <li> The colors in the the picture are a little inaccurate but that is expected because the colors vary due to electronic variances.</li>
            <li> The color is too dark.</li>
            <li> There are 4: off-white, reddish brown, dark brown, and tan.</li>
            <li> The dark brown is comically dark for eyebrows and the reddish brown belongs in a redhead kit.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product, the eye brows was way to large, it should have been different sizes, I needed because I don&#x27;t have long enough eye brows.</li>
            <li> I have black hair</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a powder brush and a typical eyebrow brush/comb.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> A little disappointing because the stencils are the whole reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised when it came because it was shades for blondes, but i wasn&#x27;t to sad because the colors worked for me.</li>
            <li> Includes templates narrow applicator and eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> I looked at a few and even bought myself a $30 eyebrow kit</li>
            <li> The stencil is stiff and doesn&#x27;t contour to your eyebrow.</li>
            <li> That being said, I use the off-white and dark brown as contour and highlight powder sometimes, so at least it serves a purpose!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this not sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I lined it up with my eye brow and the end was almost to my hairline past my temple.</li>
            <li> but still what&#x27;s the point if there&#x27;s hardly any pigmentation?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to use the stencil, however.</li>
            <li> The stencils are hard to use though.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong.</li>
            <li> I like the powder and the brushes, I&#x27;m just confused about whose face those ginormous stencils are made for.</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate are the stencils.. who even uses them?!</li>
            <li> I have terrible brows and decided I definitely needed a kit.</li>
            <li> The stencils are difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be a sad day when this is all gone.</li>
            <li> I know... sounds crazy that I haven&#x27;t used it all</li>
            <li> The stencils are worthless so if you are looking at this for the stencils, keep looking.</li>

            <li> Perfect for someone who has very light eye brows and dark hair.  It looks natural as it uses a brush and the eye brow guides are very useful.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Love the way it goes on. The brush is fantastic.  Having four colors is great for getting just the right color I need. I don&#x27;t use the stencils all that often because the shape is off for me. I definitely have to do it in two parts and then clean up. But no biggie. I still love this eyebrow kit.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know anything about this product except what was in the description and the comments, so decided to try it.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Great color selection.  I have black hair so I use the darkest brown in the kit and the powder goes on super smooth.  I normally use my matte MAC eyeshadows as my brow filler, but the texture of these powders were intended for the brows and stick beautifully without looking like I filled them in too harsh.  I love this kit.  I actually use the light color as my highlight and it looks so pretty and natural.  I have medium olive toned skin like Tyra Banks, I don&#x27;t look like her at all, so this kit works great for me and my blonde hair and fair skin clients to clients a little darker than me.  The only thing I hate are the stencils.. who even uses them?!</li>
            <li> The product was in great condition, and everything was the way I had expected it to be. The picture model on the package is a little... too natural and misleading? It you apply too much, your eyebrows will look fake, and applied-looking, and too little, and you wont notice much of a difference. I suggest applying, and playing with it before you need to really use the product. It comes with 4 different shades, and 3 stencils, eventually, I figured the best route for me. I was surprised as to how well the product stayed on all day, and never smudged the entire day. I honestly do think this is well worth the 13 dollars I had paid for. Try it out :)</li>
            <li> Love this product! Plan to repurchase soon! It&#x27;s great for beginner&#x27;s. I love the stencils but wished the had a lighter palette.</li>
            <li> Stencils are huge, so unless you have really bushy eyebrows, this isn&#x27;t for you.  The shadows work well, but the quality of the brushes are sub-par.</li>
            <li> Wish they included a pencil as well to fill in those spaces in my brows. Powder is great to blend&lt;br /&gt;over the pencil and seal it in to last until you take it off. Cute brushes are small but do nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Stencils are small, medium, and large. Easy to use stencils and will last forever !</li>
            <li> I hoped I would love this but I don&#x27;t. Nice packaging, colors are ok. Not one of the stencils is right for me. Would be nice if they included a wax with this.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of eye brow kits until I had a friend do my make up one day. I have terrible brows and decided I definitely needed a kit. This is a great starter. There aren&#x27;t many options for stencils, but I found one that worked for me, most of the time. The colors are darker than I expected, but that was ok, as I am a natural brunette.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product, the eye brows was way to large, it should have been different sizes, I needed because I don&#x27;t have long enough eye brows.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a clear setting to mix with the shadows. It is to dry to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Colors aren&#x27;t great too</li>
            <li> That is the best cosmetics eyebrow kit i have ever owned, it works great, it does not leave any residue, or look fake, it matches my eyebrows well, fill them out and shapes them perfectly. i&#x27; am going to be ordering more NYX cosmetic items, they have a variety to choose from. would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the powder and the brushes, I&#x27;m just confused about whose face those ginormous stencils are made for. The stencils are absolutely massive. They almost reach my temple. A little disappointing because the stencils are the whole reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit with 3 different colors to blend for a perfect match. Includes templates narrow applicator and eyebrow brush.</li>
            <li> hi i received  NYX Cosmetics Eyebrow Kit With Stencil Set, Blondes 0.7 Oz its very very nice thanks a lot . . .</li>
            <li> Amazing product for a great price.  Easy to use.  Stays on all day.  My blonde eyebrows have never looked better.  I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I ordered this not sure what to expect. One color matches my eyebrows perfectly. I just decided to dye my hair dark brown (from blonde) and another color works great to make my eyebrows darker. I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
            <li> this was my first eyebrow kit.....and its great....it&#x27;s easy to use and if you apply oit properly it will last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a dishwater blonde, but my hair is dyed a light to mid brown. The color on the bottom right is PERFECT for my eyebrows. I love this kit. I put Model in a Bottle eyebrow sealer overtop. It works great.</li>
            <li> This kit was okay especially if you are a beginner.  I prefer to pencil my eyebrows but I wanted to give this a try.</li>
            <li> The stencils are difficult to use. The color is too dark. The entire kit was very cheap. I would not reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stencils are good but i just use it free hand :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Practice makes you better and better at it.</li>
            <li> This product was shipped quickly and it performs well pretty good payout</li>
            <li> I love this kit! It&#x27;s light enough that I can make my eyebrows look neat but not clownish!! Great price for what you get too!</li>
            <li> This kit is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The brushes are excellent. There&#x27;s a powder brush and a typical eyebrow brush/comb.&lt;br /&gt;* It is compact! It fits easily in my purse if I don&#x27;t have time in the mornings, or if I&#x27;m going somewhere overnight.&lt;br /&gt;* The powder is great quality too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The color selections are a bit strange for a blonde kit. There are 4: off-white, reddish brown, dark brown, and tan. The tan is the only one that comes remotely close to my hair color and even then is a bit too dark at times. The dark brown is comically dark for eyebrows and the reddish brown belongs in a redhead kit. That being said, I use the off-white and dark brown as contour and highlight powder sometimes, so at least it serves a purpose!&lt;br /&gt;* The stencils are pretty useless. I used them the first couple times, but they don&#x27;t fit my face shape at all - they are very long and wide. That being said, they really aren&#x27;t needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Pay attention to whether it is for blondes or brunettes.</li>
            <li> This has made my life easier. The colors work well. I am fair with medium blond hair with a little red in it.  I can use 2 of the stencils. I really like this kit &amp; would recommend  it.</li>
            <li> First, my fault, I ordered the wrong palette. I&#x27;m a brunette so the blonde only has one color that&#x27;s the right shade. But on to the product review. The colors in the the picture are a little inaccurate but that is expected because the colors vary due to electronic variances. Anyway, I was excited about it because I&#x27;ve needed to have a brow kit for awhile. I&#x27;ve been using eyeshadow for awhile but it&#x27;s been really difficult because most of them have shimmer to them. I used a pencil for awhile but it wasn&#x27;t very accurate. These kit has the tools, shadow, and stencils necessary for a great eyebrow. But the problem is that the tools are cheap (my angled brush tool was glued wrong and is slanted to one side) and the colors are that pigmented. I swatched it on my hand and barely any product showed up. Not much fall out but still what&#x27;s the point if there&#x27;s hardly any pigmentation?  Oh, and the stencils? The sheer magnitude of their size is unbelievable. I lined it up with my eye brow and the end was almost to my hairline past my temple. It&#x27;s ridiculous. I tried all of the stencils too. It&#x27;s not just one. NYX is a good brand so I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong. I&#x27;ll still use this and that&#x27;s the only reason it&#x27;s getting three stars. Plus, I used a gift card to buy it so I&#x27;m not losing any money. The stencils are worthless so if you are looking at this for the stencils, keep looking. Same with the tools. The powders can be useful if you want to put 10 layers of it on. I will only use this as a back up.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was looking for, can help with a dramatic look or something simple, either way, you can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! so easy to use and works great. This is my second NYX product and I love it. My only complaint is the highlighter should be wax, and that would make it perfect!</li>
            <li> use it every day, and it has lasted for so long!</li>
            <li> Love it! Great colors.</li>
            <li> very nice set of colors for the blondes :) I am not blond but I still use the darker shade to fill in gaps on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love the brand NYX so i new this would be a great product! I was a little surprised when it came because it was shades for blondes, but i wasn&#x27;t to sad because the colors worked for me. So before you buy please keep in mind to choose the right shades for you!</li>
            <li> made the mistake and got the kit for blondes and I&#x27;m a brunette but one shade almost matches my eye brows so i can still use it &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over a year now. I know... sounds crazy that I haven&#x27;t used it all but I&#x27;m very careful with the amount I put on my face. I love the shadows and they stay in place all day, even if I sweat. I have purchased other more expensive eyebrow kits (the Anastasia brand) and nothing beats this. For the price it&#x27;s a steal. I used the stencil to originally shape my brows once and they looked great. It&#x27;s hard to use the stencil, however. But maybe I just don&#x27;t know how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit also comes with a shimmery, translucent white powder. I originally thought this was to be used with the stencil but it definitely isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve been using it as a brow highlighter and even in the inside corner of my eyes. It stays on all day! It&#x27;s going to be a sad day when this is all gone.</li>
            <li> The stencil is stiff and doesn&#x27;t contour to your eyebrow. If you can get the stencil to stay in place and get the eyebrow on it doesn&#x27;t look natural.  It looks like a huge fake eyebrow. I now use a water proof light brown mascara to color the hair on my eyebrows.  Looks very natural with no stiff stencil.</li>
            <li> This is like the coolest eyebrow kit ever the stencils are easy to use after holding them to your eyebrow for a few minutes they end up sticking so you don&#x27;t really have to hold them there since they&#x27;re plastic and real flexible. I really like this product and I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the stencil that comes with the product because it&#x27;s sort of challenging. But mostly because I prefer my eyebrows more squared off.. but the product itself is amazing. I looked at a few and even bought myself a $30 eyebrow kit and I took it back because i was very upset.  This is everything I could have ever asked for.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette.  I have medium brown hair and it is easy to match to my eyebrows.  The only thing is that I wish that it had come with wax</li>
            <li> Love this product. The colors in the palette are perfect.</li>
            <li> This was just what I was looking for.  The stencils are hard to use though.  I have difficulty holding them in place.  The cosmetics themselves however are good quality.</li>
            <li> This is just ok. It does have templates but I dont know who would actually use these.</li>
            <li> I choose to give this product 4/5 stars only because it doe&#x27;s not come with a brow wax. The stencils, spoolie and brush however are perfect for getting perfectly shaped brows. I would recommend this product to everyone. I also love the fact that the brow powder can be mixed to match your preference,the concistence is great for sutle brows or you can build the product fora stronger look</li>
