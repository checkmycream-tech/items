            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I used CND super shiny as the top coat for the perfect shine.</li>
            <li>With two coats its an amazing color.</li>
            <li>All you have to do though is add a good top coat.</li>
            <li>color looked nice then</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for years</li>
            <li>I really liked the color on here</li>
            <li>I tried Bahama Mama from Essie and quite liked it, but I think I like the China Glaze better.</li>
            <li>still a great color (after many coats for full coverage)</li>
            <li>Then you would need a top coat.</li>
            <li>I used seche vite and I love the finished look.</li>
            <li>got it done at a salon added two more layers and unless you dont shower or wash your hand or do anything</li>
            <li>This is okay</li>
            <li>so you must use a top coat.</li>
            <li>love this color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll look better on</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Tis color is so cute for summer.</li>
            <li>I love China Glaze brand</li>
            <li>but i wish they&#x27;d change the brush, too little.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - pleased but wish for some improvements.</li>
            <li>You have to apply a top coat, which never works too well for me.</li>
            <li>Add a top coat for perfection and a salon finish at home</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be better.</li>
            <li>this color is hot and will be a great color for my 3d hello kitty nail art SUPER FAST AND GREAT SHOP</li>
            <li>Many colors look bright in the bottle, but not so much when it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect neon pink without being obnoxious.</li>
            <li>As much as I tried to make this look good</li>
            <li>I had my nails done at a salon and loved this color so much that I had to get it.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty and the polish goes on nice.</li>
            <li>I found this in my nail bag recently, put it on wondering why I never wear it because it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li>All China glaze polish is a great color, however you do have to give it a good two coats and a clear coat on top to give the polish back it&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not doing any hand-modeling anytime soon, so it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I would expect this from a cheap wal-mart brand of polish, not this.  </li>
            <li>The polish feels so smooth on my nails.</li>
            <li>Looks great on nails and toes or just as a French color.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and I achieved my preferred brightness in three coats.</li>
            <li>Just like the description, the polish is bright neon pink, exactly what I wanted since I can&#x27;t seem to find good neon colors in any stores or salons.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m not sorry I bought it because the price was right and the color was perfect.</li>
            <li>, totally worth the $4!</li>
            <li>This pink is neon, but it&#x27;s beautiful and not too corally or orange.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope that it&#x27;s not fake as I&#x27;m always concerned about the quality of cosmetic products that I use.</li>
            <li>Adding a clear top coat for a bit more shine.  </li>
            <li>I love the color it goes on smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li>One thing to note is that when the polish first went on it had kind of a matte finish, so you should apply two coats and then add a clear top coat</li>
            <li>my toes are always painted pink and this was a great color to add to my collection</li>
            <li>Even then it looks best at a distance of at least 1.5 feet away, rather than close-up.  </li>
            <li>frome good needs several layers to even look halfway descent.</li>
            <li>Essie stayed on for several days with minor chipping, and I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>I wanted really bright, neon pink.  </li>
            <li>This color is perfectly name &amp;#34;Shocking Pink.&amp;#34;  The coverage is not great.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite color.</li>
            <li>It looks good from far but far</li>
            <li>It does dry completely matte so if you don&#x27;t like a matte finish you need a good high gloss top coat.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery to Europe.</li>
            <li>This color is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty matte too, which I thought would be the case.  </li>
            <li>Really pops a tan!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a pretty color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty color, a little lighter than i expected but very bright.  </li>
            <li>For really good coverage in the future, I&#x27;ll probably go with a different brand.</li>
            <li>If you want a vibrant pink, there are other better brands that wear longer and don&#x27;t need 4 coats to look good.</li>
            <li>I ended up doing pretty much three coats.</li>
            <li>I tried applying this color to a whole nail but the brush strokes come out streaky and when it dries it&#x27;s chalky looking.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I just painted them, so I can&#x27;t say much about staying power.</li>
            <li>The color is very matte</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>The polish goes on smooth and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Bright pink without being fluro pink.</li>
            <li>If you like to wear neon colors on your toes, your going to love this pink color!!!</li>
            <li>they have the exact same numbers which is very mis leading.</li>
            <li>Normally, I have chipping after one day, and almost all the polish is gone after a week.</li>
            <li>It was a bit translucent, so I had to do a few more coats than the Essie polish, but it dried more smoothly and it dried much quicker than Essie.</li>
            <li>I get a new bottle of this polish every summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used China Glaze nail polish before, but I&#x27;ve decided to start trying the more expensive brands to see how they compare to say Sally Hanson or the cheap $1-$2 polishes.</li>
            <li>The color was pretty but it doesn&#x27;t apply all that evenly and it takes a few coats to get the full nail covered</li>
            <li>so many bald patches.i usually end up dressing it up with glitter.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pretty dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Also upon further comparison some major ingredients turned out to be different from the other China Glaze nail polishes that I own.</li>
            <li>Again I used a clear gloss over it, lasted 22 weeks before chipping.</li>
            <li>it did not work on this polish n and with a clear coat.</li>
            <li>It has zero shine and takes at least 3 coats to look OK.</li>
            <li>The polish is a beautiful color, but it dries matte and is very thin!</li>
            <li>i usually have to put 5 coats for full coverage!</li>
            <li>I love the highlighter pink color of this polish, but it&#x27;s a little runny, almost watery.</li>
            <li>The photo shows the color as being a little darker, more pink than what the color actually is.  </li>
            <li>One thing that I was slightly puzzled about is that the label at the bottom of the bottle was very different from my other China Glaze nail polishes (authentic ones purchased from the official retailers).</li>
            <li>The color is amazing, but the polish is very thin.  </li>
            <li>It last a couple days without chipping I really like China products they last a long time</li>

            <li> The nail polish is OK, I thought it was going to be more shocking pink neon, but not, it is a normal pink.</li>
            <li> I have to put a few coats on my big toe nails, not the normal 2.</li>
            <li> Awesome shocking pink neon color.  </li>
            <li> The color is great (shocking pink), but it takes at least 3 coats to look decent, and even then it&#x27;s really streaky.</li>
            <li> dont stay on  too long</li>
            <li> but it definitely is watered down.  </li>
            <li> its a very streaky and thin.</li>
            <li> It makes your nails look like you painted them with pink chalk.</li>
            <li> I have other China Glaze polishes</li>
            <li> All that time and work to get less than a day of chip-free wear.</li>
            <li> I received my two bottles of polish but the numbers were the same as my old polish but my old polish was a neon shocking pink...</li>
            <li> The name of it matches well (a little lighter than what the bottle shows).</li>
            <li> dont waste you time with harderners</li>
            <li> Then as soon it dried, bam, chipped all the place.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had some bottles for a few months/years and</li>
            <li> Streaks and uneven paint.</li>
            <li> Shocking pink is a very bold neon.</li>
            <li> It chipped pretty bad</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get an even coat due to</li>
            <li> Dries dull</li>
            <li> You need at least 3-4 coats for it to look non-streaky.</li>
            <li> This is no good at all.</li>
            <li> like a crayola very thick and chalk like finish.</li>

            <li> Perfect color for the tips I was looking for. I tried applying this color to a whole nail but the brush strokes come out streaky and when it dries it&#x27;s chalky looking. All you have to do though is add a good top coat.</li>
            <li> I love it! Just like the description, the polish is bright neon pink, exactly what I wanted since I can&#x27;t seem to find good neon colors in any stores or salons.  One thing to note is that when the polish first went on it had kind of a matte finish, so you should apply two coats and then add a clear top coat and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> its a very streaky and thin. i usually have to put 5 coats for full coverage! i get so many bald patches.i usually end up dressing it up with glitter. still a great color (after many coats for full coverage)</li>
            <li> I love the highlighter pink color of this polish, but it&#x27;s a little runny, almost watery. I have to put a few coats on my big toe nails, not the normal 2.</li>
            <li> If you like to wear neon colors on your toes, your going to love this pink color!!! The polish goes on smooth and lasts a long time.  I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This color is exactly what I wanted.  I wanted really bright, neon pink.  Many colors look bright in the bottle, but not so much when it&#x27;s on.  This color is perfectly name &amp;#34;Shocking Pink.&amp;#34;  The coverage is not great.  I ended up doing pretty much three coats. Even then it looks best at a distance of at least 1.5 feet away, rather than close-up.  I&#x27;m not doing any hand-modeling anytime soon, so it&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s pretty matte too, which I thought would be the case.  Adding a clear top coat for a bit more shine.  Overall, I&#x27;m not sorry I bought it because the price was right and the color was perfect. My daughter and I will continue to use it.  For really good coverage in the future, I&#x27;ll probably go with a different brand.</li>
            <li> It has zero shine and takes at least 3 coats to look OK. Then you would need a top coat. I threw mine away.</li>
            <li> The color is amazing, but the polish is very thin.  Every brushstroke leaves visible imperfections.  It&#x27;s very hard to get an even coat due to it&#x27;s watery-consistency.  I would expect this from a cheap wal-mart brand of polish, not this.  Overall, I was pretty dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> All China glaze polish is a great color, however you do have to give it a good two coats and a clear coat on top to give the polish back it&#x27;s shine.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is OK, I thought it was going to be more shocking pink neon, but not, it is a normal pink.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty and the polish goes on nice. It is a good product. Thank you and I will order again.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite color. Again I used a clear gloss over it, lasted 22 weeks before chipping.</li>
            <li> This is a great polish. It is the perfect neon pink without being obnoxious. It does dry completely matte so if you don&#x27;t like a matte finish you need a good high gloss top coat. I used seche vite and I love the finished look.</li>
            <li> got it done at a salon added two more layers and unless you dont shower or wash your hand or do anything then maybe it will last. n dont waste you time with harderners it did not work on this polish n and with a clear coat. color looked nice then 3hours later into doing things around the house like cook and wash hands lol it all cracked off in pieces</li>
            <li> The color would get 5 stars, it&#x27;s a great summer color.. However, this is the worst chipping polish I have ever owned. It was literally chipping the day of on my TOES... I tried it several times and still had the same results. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Awesome shocking pink neon color.  Def an eye catcher for the summer.  Really pops a tan! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is okay but it definitely is watered down.  It takes about 4 coats of the polish to get a good coat on your nails.  I am a bit disappointed but that&#x27;s the chance you take!</li>
            <li> I get a new bottle of this polish every summer. I always get compliments on it because it&#x27; so bright! Dries dull so you must use a top coat.</li>
            <li> I received my two bottles of polish but the numbers were the same as my old polish but my old polish was a neon shocking pink...they have the exact same numbers which is very mis leading. Thanks. Judy</li>
            <li> love this color. a perfect fun spring/summer color. my toes are always painted pink and this was a great color to add to my collection</li>
            <li> dont stay on  too long</li>
            <li> this color is hot and will be a great color for my 3d hello kitty nail art SUPER FAST AND GREAT SHOP</li>
            <li> like a crayola very thick and chalk like finish. It looks good from far but far frome good needs several layers to even look halfway descent. maby it&#x27;ll look better on you buy and try it but dont say I didn&#x27;t tell you so.(:</li>
            <li> My fave nail polish ever!!! Can&#x27;t get it anywhere else, totally worth the $4!</li>
            <li> This is for Shocking Pink (neon). This is hands down the WORST nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used. It streaks like nobody&#x27;s business. You need at least 3-4 coats for it to look non-streaky. Then once you apply all four coats, plus a base and topcoat, it CHIPS! I mean, like chips immediately after it dries! One day after wearing this polish looks like I&#x27;ve gone a week wearing it. All that time and work to get less than a day of chip-free wear. I found this in my nail bag recently, put it on wondering why I never wear it because it&#x27;s beautiful. Then as soon it dried, bam, chipped all the place. I have other China Glaze polishes so I think it&#x27;s just the nature of the formula. If you want a vibrant pink, there are other better brands that wear longer and don&#x27;t need 4 coats to look good. STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used China Glaze nail polish before, but I&#x27;ve decided to start trying the more expensive brands to see how they compare to say Sally Hanson or the cheap $1-$2 polishes. I tried Bahama Mama from Essie and quite liked it, but I think I like the China Glaze better. This pink is neon, but it&#x27;s beautiful and not too corally or orange. It was a bit translucent, so I had to do a few more coats than the Essie polish, but it dried more smoothly and it dried much quicker than Essie. The polish feels so smooth on my nails. I love it. I just painted them, so I can&#x27;t say much about staying power. Essie stayed on for several days with minor chipping, and I was very impressed. Normally, I have chipping after one day, and almost all the polish is gone after a week. I&#x27;m hoping that China Glaze will surprise me and have the same lasting power as Essie. I&#x27;ll update with results.</li>
            <li> Tis color is so cute for summer. It&#x27;s bright but it&#x27;s a pretty color. Looks great on nails and toes or just as a French color. I will use it next summer too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very pretty color, a little lighter than i expected but very bright.  The photo shows the color as being a little darker, more pink than what the color actually is.  It takes about 3 coats, possibly 4 to get an even look.  I love China Glaze brand but i wish they&#x27;d change the brush, too little.&lt;br /&gt;Overall - pleased but wish for some improvements.</li>
            <li> The color is great (shocking pink), but it takes at least 3 coats to look decent, and even then it&#x27;s really streaky. The color is very matte so a shiny topcoat is required. Ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that! My manicure with this polish only lasted a day or so. It chipped pretty bad (that could just be user error, though?). I wouldn&#x27;t buy CG again. I&#x27;ll leave CG application to the professionals at the salon... they always make it look great!</li>
            <li> Love the color, unfortunately the polish has no shine. You have to apply a top coat, which never works too well for me.</li>
            <li> Bright pink without being fluro pink. With two coats its an amazing color. Add a top coat for perfection and a salon finish at home</li>
            <li> I love the color it goes on smooth and dries fast. It last a couple days without chipping I really like China products they last a long time and I&#x27;ve had some bottles for a few months/years and they’re still going</li>
            <li> This is no good at all. Streaks and uneven paint. As much as I tried to make this look good it would just not do it. I have been doing my own nails for years so I know a good product. It&#x27;s is cheap, poorly made nail polish. It makes your nails look like you painted them with pink chalk. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> I had my nails done at a salon and loved this color so much that I had to get it. The name of it matches well (a little lighter than what the bottle shows). Great summer color!</li>
            <li> FUN, NEON like color..  PERFECT for Summer toes... Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> The polish is a beautiful color, but it dries matte and is very thin! I was expecting it to be better.</li>
            <li> Shocking pink is a very bold neon. It goes on smooth and I achieved my preferred brightness in three coats. I used CND super shiny as the top coat for the perfect shine.</li>
            <li> Bright summer &#x27;barbie&#x27; neon color. Very fast delivery to Europe. One thing that I was slightly puzzled about is that the label at the bottom of the bottle was very different from my other China Glaze nail polishes (authentic ones purchased from the official retailers). Also upon further comparison some major ingredients turned out to be different from the other China Glaze nail polishes that I own. I sincerely hope that it&#x27;s not fake as I&#x27;m always concerned about the quality of cosmetic products that I use.</li>
            <li> Great product, price, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
            <li> I really liked the color on here but once I got the actual polish at home it was kind of disappointing. The color was pretty but it doesn&#x27;t apply all that evenly and it takes a few coats to get the full nail covered</li>
            <li> The product lives up to my expectations. I&#x27;ve used this product before &amp; have never been disapointed in the performance.</li>
