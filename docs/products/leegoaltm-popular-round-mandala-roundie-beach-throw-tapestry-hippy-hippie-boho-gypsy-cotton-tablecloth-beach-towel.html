            <li>I love itüëç</li>
            <li>Love the design and the colors are as represented, but thought scarf would be fuller based on the pictures.</li>
            <li>I think the model and the bust are wearing 2 or more of these.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the scarfs on Amazon, the pictures are arranged to look like it is ruffled or pleated or has something going on.</li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered more.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this</li>

            <li>I Love to wear scarves.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as full looking, but it makes a nice spring scarf.  </li>
            <li>It was a long wait , but the scarf is beautiful!</li>
            <li>The colors all work together beautifully and it is a soft well made scarf.  </li>
            <li>Also I thought the scarves was made out of  cotton, it feels more like polyester and the material snags easily.  </li>
            <li>Great colors and feels soft on skin!</li>
            <li>I enjoy that more.  </li>
            <li>Although the price was too good to believe, the quality was very substandard.</li>
            <li>One thing good is that the Seller is very responsive, and can&#x27;t blame them for orders not being received.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m easy on my clothes</li>
            <li>However the material could easily snag, it seems, although it never happened to me.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful, lightweight, and plenty big.  </li>
            <li>THESE SCARFS ARE VERY BIG AND BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS ON THEM.</li>
            <li>Very pretty very good price and service was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The size is as stated, the drape is lovely, the price is low,  the shipping fast and free so you cannot afford to pass up this great addition to your Fall and Winter wardrobe!!!  </li>
            <li>As I ponder over the many outfits and colors that it can be paired with I cant wait to boldly wear my scarf for all to see.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really warm and quite large.</li>
            <li>large scarf, nice colors</li>
            <li>Picture conveys accurate depiction.  </li>
            <li>It has a light feel to it and is not silky</li>
            <li>I really enjoy my product</li>
            <li>It looks so cheap that I would not wear it myself nor would I give it to (offend) anyone.  </li>
            <li>Colors fit with anything you wear.</li>
            <li>Very well liked.</li>
            <li>The fabric seems a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>good and soft.</li>
            <li>Will keep my eye open for more good looking styles.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s just something nice and simple.  </li>
            <li>I only wear scarfs for the looks, not to keep warm.  </li>
            <li>This scarf is well worth what I paid.</li>
            <li>Colors are muted,yet colorful.  </li>
            <li>Worth the wait.</li>
            <li>but overall I liked the color</li>
            <li>It has nice warm tones of tan,  light and dark brown with contrasting stripes of medium olive green, light to medium rust/orange and a cream stripe for punch.</li>
            <li>I have different kinds of scarf because I simply want to keep my neck warm while being stylish.</li>
            <li>these scarfs are long and will wrap around nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice and long.  </li>
            <li>A nice classic design on a large, soft scarf.</li>

            <li>I definitely plan on buying more scarves from them again.</li>
            <li>item looks exactly like it is in the picture</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>However I was most interested in the colors and length, and the price was definitely in my range.</li>
            <li>This is soooooo pretty.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Length and width very good.&lt;br /&gt;Great addition!</li>
            <li>Things sure looks differently on pictures.  </li>
            <li>I figured the second time around might be better.</li>
            <li>If I return it, all the way from N. America to China, according to the policy, I have to bear the return shipping, and that was exactly what the seller told me by this single-line email:</li>
            <li>Scarf looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>As someone else said earlier, it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li>Snaged on my daughter&#x27;s nail the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>and I can see  wearing this with many different colors and patterns.  </li>
            <li>The pictures don&#x27;t do it justice - it is much brighter and prettier!  </li>
            <li>So soft!!!!</li>
            <li>it is wide which is great for tying scarves in different styles</li>
            <li>that is how I like them because I am warm-blooded &amp; get hot fast.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that the fabric is silky and very fine/thin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>Looks good but is not the correct size, too small.</li>
            <li>would certainly recommend the seller!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>With the fall season soon to arrive it will certainly be a standout when accessorized with neutral colors.</li>
            <li>Yes, I would certainly recommend this seller to family, friends, and others.&lt;br /&gt;Diva</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and quite large.</li>
            <li>It is large as indicated and the colors are very close to the picture.</li>
            <li>So soft and pretty and feminine!</li>
            <li>The quality of the material is more than I expected and the colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li>It is a very large and long scarf, really unique.</li>
            <li>Complimented much.  </li>
            <li>Price was exceptionally reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Despite the fact that its thin, I would but again as the price means great.  </li>
            <li>This will really dress up any outfit.  </li>
            <li>I really like the length.  </li>
            <li>I just enjoy my recent purchase.  </li>
            <li>kudos for fast delivery</li>
            <li>(the price was so cheap, even if I didn&#x27;t like it made no sense to return it) and when I finally did open the packaging, I realized it was actually quite nice.</li>
            <li>not as much fabric shown in photo</li>
            <li>there is simply so much scarf, it&#x27;s got a life of</li>
            <li>All in all, a very pleasing combination</li>
            <li>the cozy feel  is a nice transition into cooler weather.  </li>
            <li>The colors and pattern give this scarf a look of having more substance than it actually does and has a classy, yet hip, feel to it.</li>
            <li>Has very large patten of stripes and old looking colors.  </li>
            <li>The material is also decent, actually better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>The scarf is long and light</li>
            <li>not thrilled about it, fabric is too heavy for this kind of scarf, it would be nice if it could be a bit wider.  </li>
            <li>Colors are rich and size is wide enough to use as a light Fall or Spring/Summer wrap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for autumn colors...especially greens and browns, so I love it!</li>
            <li>For the price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>you go to the store and by the time you pay it with tax they normally would run about $15-$20.</li>
            <li>gorgeous thin scarf.</li>
            <li>and it is very pretty and as long as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>Two long to lay over neck like an open tie and too short to wrap around your neck in today&#x27;s popular styles without the ends sticking out.</li>
            <li>It will double as a head scarf or shawl in winter, but it is light enough to wear in spring.  </li>
            <li>looks like the out fit was purchased together, but, they were all purchased at different places, at different times.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Upon inspection, the first scarf had two 1 inch rips above the border.  </li>
            <li>Colors are vivid and well made.</li>
            <li>The colors &amp; pattern are different &amp; the material shown in the photo seems voluminous  when it is at most half that size.</li>
            <li>On the website it says \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; which was a total misrepresentation and a classic example of what you see (on the picture) is not what you get at</li>
            <li>is the very first time I am giving only one star, and I would have given no star if there was such choice at all.  </li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t accept because it came direct from China</li>
            <li>It is sheer but not so much that it catches on everything and the weight and</li>
            <li>The stiches are not straight, size is the right, you get what you paid for.  </li>
            <li>So, pretty much year round usage.  </li>
            <li>Was not sure about this scarf but with brown in it I felt that it was a definite option since I love browns.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and gives my same old outfits a new look.  </li>
            <li>Last picture is the only one that is realistic -</li>
            <li>The price was unbelievable (low) and the transaction was smooth.</li>
            <li>no where near as big or luscious as depicted.</li>
            <li>Love the color but not what I was expecting really thin, and stiching</li>
            <li>I am a reasonable buyer, if I pay a few bucks, I expect something only for the amount but not ten times more as it is not fair.  </li>
            <li>so soft  and long .great company</li>
            <li>Beautiful but thin and small than expected.</li>
            <li>It is classy looking and it is very long</li>
            <li>It was hard to be patient, but it was definitely worth the wait.</li>

            <li> This is just like pictured but better in person.</li>

            <li> I love the print.</li>
            <li> It looks better in the picture...</li>
            <li> I will be sure that I know where the items are coming from.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay with the price.</li>
            <li> I love this scarf.  </li>
            <li> It has so many colors you can wear it alot.  </li>
            <li> so you can tie it in so many styles.  </li>
            <li> The fabric has standibility which makes it more versatile.</li>
            <li> This is a scarf I expect to get more wear out of in during the cooler months....</li>
            <li> I love itüëç</li>
            <li> Love the design and the colors are as represented, but thought scarf would be fuller based on the pictures.</li>
            <li> I think the model and the bust are wearing 2 or more of these.  </li>
            <li> Like many of the scarfs on Amazon, the pictures are arranged to look like it is ruffled or pleated or has something going on.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered more.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> trying to find something cute to accessorize it with.</li>

            <li> I have gotten many compliment on this product.</li>

            <li> and I love it...</li>
            <li> I Love to wear scarves.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as full looking, but it makes a nice spring scarf.  </li>
            <li> It was a long wait , but the scarf is beautiful!</li>
            <li> The colors all work together beautifully and it is a soft well made scarf.  </li>
            <li> Also I thought the scarves was made out of  cotton, it feels more like polyester and the material snags easily.  </li>
            <li> Great colors and feels soft on skin!</li>
            <li> I enjoy that more.  </li>
            <li> Although the price was too good to believe, the quality was very substandard.</li>
            <li> One thing good is that the Seller is very responsive, and can&#x27;t blame them for orders not being received.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m easy on my clothes</li>
            <li> However the material could easily snag, it seems, although it never happened to me.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful, lightweight, and plenty big.  </li>
            <li> THESE SCARFS ARE VERY BIG AND BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS ON THEM.</li>
            <li> Very pretty very good price and service was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The size is as stated, the drape is lovely, the price is low,  the shipping fast and free so you cannot afford to pass up this great addition to your Fall and Winter wardrobe!!!  </li>
            <li> As I ponder over the many outfits and colors that it can be paired with I cant wait to boldly wear my scarf for all to see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really warm and quite large.</li>
            <li> large scarf, nice colors</li>
            <li> Picture conveys accurate depiction.  </li>
            <li> It has a light feel to it and is not silky</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my product</li>
            <li> It looks so cheap that I would not wear it myself nor would I give it to (offend) anyone.  </li>
            <li> Colors fit with anything you wear.</li>
            <li> Very well liked.</li>
            <li> The fabric seems a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> good and soft.</li>
            <li> Will keep my eye open for more good looking styles.</li>
            <li> It arrived early and is gorgeous.  </li>

            <li> I only wear scarfs for the looks, not to keep warm.  </li>
            <li> This scarf is well worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> Colors are muted,yet colorful.  </li>
            <li> Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> but overall I liked the color</li>
            <li> It has nice warm tones of tan,  light and dark brown with contrasting stripes of medium olive green, light to medium rust/orange and a cream stripe for punch.</li>
            <li> I have different kinds of scarf because I simply want to keep my neck warm while being stylish.</li>
            <li> these scarfs are long and will wrap around nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice and long.  </li>
            <li> A nice classic design on a large, soft scarf.</li>

            <li> Very well made, very soft to the touch, very attractive with a variety of outfits whether casual or more dressy</li>
            <li> The scarf is not an expensive scarf, so I was not expecting top brand quality but its a very nice scarf for its price.</li>
            <li> Very fast.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on buying more scarves from them again.</li>
            <li> item looks exactly like it is in the picture</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> However I was most interested in the colors and length, and the price was definitely in my range.</li>
            <li> This is soooooo pretty.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Length and width very good.&lt;br /&gt;Great addition!</li>
            <li> Things sure looks differently on pictures.  </li>
            <li> I figured the second time around might be better.</li>
            <li> If I return it, all the way from N. America to China, according to the policy, I have to bear the return shipping, and that was exactly what the seller told me by this single-line email:</li>
            <li> Scarf looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> As someone else said earlier, it&#x27;s just OK.</li>
            <li> Snaged on my daughter&#x27;s nail the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> and I can see  wearing this with many different colors and patterns.  </li>
            <li> The pictures don&#x27;t do it justice - it is much brighter and prettier!  </li>
            <li> So soft!!!!</li>
            <li> it is wide which is great for tying scarves in different styles</li>
            <li> that is how I like them because I am warm-blooded &amp; get hot fast.  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that the fabric is silky and very fine/thin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Looks good but is not the correct size, too small.</li>
            <li> would certainly recommend the seller!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> With the fall season soon to arrive it will certainly be a standout when accessorized with neutral colors.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would certainly recommend this seller to family, friends, and others.&lt;br /&gt;Diva</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and quite large.</li>
            <li> It is large as indicated and the colors are very close to the picture.</li>
            <li> So soft and pretty and feminine!</li>
            <li> The quality of the material is more than I expected and the colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li> It is a very large and long scarf, really unique.</li>
            <li> Complimented much.  </li>
            <li> Price was exceptionally reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact that its thin, I would but again as the price means great.  </li>
            <li> This will really dress up any outfit.  </li>
            <li> I really like the length.  </li>
            <li> I just enjoy my recent purchase.  </li>
            <li> kudos for fast delivery</li>
            <li> (the price was so cheap, even if I didn&#x27;t like it made no sense to return it) and when I finally did open the packaging, I realized it was actually quite nice.</li>
            <li> not as much fabric shown in photo</li>
            <li> there is simply so much scarf, it&#x27;s got a life of</li>
            <li> All in all, a very pleasing combination</li>
            <li> the cozy feel  is a nice transition into cooler weather.  </li>
            <li> The colors and pattern give this scarf a look of having more substance than it actually does and has a classy, yet hip, feel to it.</li>
            <li> Has very large patten of stripes and old looking colors.  </li>
            <li> The material is also decent, actually better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> The scarf is long and light</li>
            <li> not thrilled about it, fabric is too heavy for this kind of scarf, it would be nice if it could be a bit wider.  </li>
            <li> Colors are rich and size is wide enough to use as a light Fall or Spring/Summer wrap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for autumn colors...especially greens and browns, so I love it!</li>
            <li> For the price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> you go to the store and by the time you pay it with tax they normally would run about $15-$20.</li>
            <li> gorgeous thin scarf.</li>
            <li> and it is very pretty and as long as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Two long to lay over neck like an open tie and too short to wrap around your neck in today&#x27;s popular styles without the ends sticking out.</li>
            <li> It will double as a head scarf or shawl in winter, but it is light enough to wear in spring.  </li>
            <li> looks like the out fit was purchased together, but, they were all purchased at different places, at different times.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Upon inspection, the first scarf had two 1 inch rips above the border.  </li>
            <li> Colors are vivid and well made.</li>
            <li> The colors &amp; pattern are different &amp; the material shown in the photo seems voluminous  when it is at most half that size.</li>
            <li> On the website it says \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; which was a total misrepresentation and a classic example of what you see (on the picture) is not what you get at</li>
            <li> is the very first time I am giving only one star, and I would have given no star if there was such choice at all.  </li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t accept because it came direct from China</li>
            <li> It is sheer but not so much that it catches on everything and the weight and</li>
            <li> The stiches are not straight, size is the right, you get what you paid for.  </li>
            <li> So, pretty much year round usage.  </li>
            <li> Was not sure about this scarf but with brown in it I felt that it was a definite option since I love browns.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and gives my same old outfits a new look.  </li>
            <li> Last picture is the only one that is realistic -</li>
            <li> The price was unbelievable (low) and the transaction was smooth.</li>
            <li> no where near as big or luscious as depicted.</li>
            <li> Love the color but not what I was expecting really thin, and stiching</li>
            <li> I am a reasonable buyer, if I pay a few bucks, I expect something only for the amount but not ten times more as it is not fair.  </li>
            <li> so soft  and long .great company</li>
            <li> Beautiful but thin and small than expected.</li>
            <li> It is classy looking and it is very long</li>
            <li> It was hard to be patient, but it was definitely worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Long enough to wrap around my head at bed time or for styling sake.</li>
            <li> What you get is a flat oblong scarf, folded and flat, and in the case of the one I received with a snag.</li>
            <li> The reason for the four stars is that the fabric is so loosely woven, it probably will not hold up to heavy usage or frequent washing, especially a washing machine...</li>
            <li> Long length.</li>
            <li> it is long and</li>
            <li> Knowing that this is shipped from overseas, I anticipated a long wait.</li>
            <li> I received my scarf earlier then I expected.</li>
            <li> It is really long</li>
            <li> Is not as long as indicated.</li>
            <li> The fabric is soft and lightweight but not so thin that it seems flimsy or super delicate.</li>
            <li> I only noticed quite a few other buyers had similar experience after all that happened.  </li>
            <li> I usually read the reviews before making a decision to buy when shopping on line, especially when third parties/sellers are involved.</li>
            <li> The reviews on these scarfs are true - they are very very thin however,</li>
            <li> just wish it was a little bigger....</li>
            <li> I love the colors and that the scarf was long, however, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be quite as delicate as it is, this scarf is very thin so be careful not to snag this on anything!</li>
            <li> A lot thinner/lightweight than expected.</li>
            <li> is expected and recommend the product</li>
            <li> Prettier than I had expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery took 17 days, which is expected, coming from China.</li>
            <li> i expected it to be longer</li>
            <li> an  like always it came sooner then expected....</li>
            <li> quality not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I expected the scarf to be like the picture.</li>
            <li> Defiantly not very durable.</li>
            <li> Did not really like.  </li>
            <li> fabric isnt rough nor scratchy.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a nice scarf, but Agin, I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> The item is thing but very wide which means it can be doubled for thickness.  </li>
            <li> it is very wide and lays just like  </li>
            <li> Very big scarf and every thin and sheer..</li>
            <li> just like I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that it&#x27;s very thin material, but for what I wanted it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but hey, it&#x27;s not worth</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s all not worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of the same scarves  Pretty disappointed with the quality.  </li>
            <li> In the event that the buyer has to bear the return shipping cost\\&quot; which obviously is not worth it for an item of just a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> The second scarf did not have any rip,but it had fraying, due to the poor stitching.  </li>
            <li> Not as long as it was pictured, was pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> So not worth it!</li>
            <li> so if it catches on something gets a little Pull</li>
            <li> I added another star because with a little airing out and fabreeze</li>
            <li> If you are looking for heavier scarf, this will not fit you.  </li>
            <li> But it did shred at the ends after a few wears</li>
            <li> It is very long, and thin.</li>
            <li> It is very thin, barely comes to my waist after  draping around my neck.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly if not better than the image presented.</li>
            <li> Not representative of the usual products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just planning the tan sweater and the scarf...and no more</li>
            <li> the only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s a very thin fabric</li>
            <li> I wrote back to clarify that the item was not damaged during shipping but just of very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> This is false advertisement, the scarf if not as long &amp; full as it is in pictures, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> , I usually wear it around late summer/ fall.</li>
            <li> Such a hard choice!!!</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait for cooler weather</li>
            <li> Since purchasing it, I have worn it at least 3-4 times a week.  </li>
            <li> At least, the colors are what it is in the pictures, and the weight is there.</li>
            <li> Material doesn&#x27;t fall apart even though it seems delicate.</li>
            <li> not as pictured and not as thick as it looks.</li>
            <li> This time around I was not very happy with my purchases.&lt;br /&gt;please note, I decided to have the seller replace the two defected scarves.</li>
            <li> The scarf arrived later than promised arrival (3-4 weeks), which was not a major issue but when I opened the envelope, I was totally disappointed!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really bad not wide enought</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I only received one and it looks nothing at all as displayed.</li>
            <li> this is the first time I&#x27;ve been this disappointed in an item that I&#x27;ve purchased from amazon !!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way thin and shorter then pictured.</li>
            <li> Thin fabric can be used year around.</li>
            <li> It is decidedly casual and I can see wearing this to school, the office, Saturday farmer&#x27;s market, shopping, the movies, a late supper or even hiking.  </li>
            <li> Quality is poor, not recommend to others.</li>
            <li> contacted the seller, and the canned feedback was that, \\&quot;I am sorry to hear that you received a broken item.</li>
            <li> Just looking at it, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I am sorry.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Can use as dressy or casual.</li>
            <li> The scraf was of very poor quality, the fabric was very thin,</li>
            <li> The fabric quality of this scarf is very poor; also was the stitching.</li>
            <li> because it smells, it really stinks.</li>
            <li> Ugly.  </li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed in this scarf.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed,</li>
            <li> Both scarves also has an  awful  smell to it, like  it was exposed to a fog machine.  </li>
            <li> the dyeing, weaving and stitching are all terrible!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed !!!!!!</li>

            <li> This scarf came with a nice big hole and a run in it! It&#x27;s way thin and shorter then pictured. save your $4 for something better. So not worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. The scarf is not an expensive scarf, so I was not expecting top brand quality but its a very nice scarf for its price. It&#x27;s just something nice and simple.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t call it a winter scarf, I usually wear it around late summer/ fall. The color of the scarf is very similar to the leaves in the fall. It&#x27;s a good length (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5),when I drape it over my neck, it touches my knees, so I can wear the scarf in many styles, its very comfortable. I definitely plan on buying more scarves from them again.</li>
            <li> I loved it! So soft!!!! Havnt worn it yet but i will!!</li>
            <li> not thrilled about it, fabric is too heavy for this kind of scarf, it would be nice if it could be a bit wider.  Just an ok product.</li>
            <li> light and thin. item looks exactly like it is in the picture</li>
            <li> I love this scarf!! Great colors and feels soft on skin!</li>
            <li> Very nice scarf.  I got one for my daughter and one for myself.  The colors are perfect.</li>
            <li> I love theses scarves ordered 2 different ones they are perfect. packed well not a wrinkle I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Took a while to get but this is by far my favorite scarf! It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> not as pictured and not as thick as it looks. I think they used two scarfs for the picture</li>
            <li> This is probably one of my favorite scarve. I wear it as a hijab and it is wonderful. Material is good for all weathers. It has a light feel to it and is not silky which was good for me. The product looks just like what you see online and it is a good length as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice scarf, just wish it was wider.</li>
            <li> good and soft. only problem is it was snagged on one side</li>
            <li> Pretty colors. Long length. Thin fabric can be used year around. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The reviews on these scarfs are true - they are very very thin however, that is how I like them because I am warm-blooded &amp; get hot fast.  I only wear scarfs for the looks, not to keep warm.  If you are looking for heavier scarf, this will not fit you.  I like them for my use &amp; ordered more.  Nice colors</li>
            <li> For the price the scarf is really nice the only thing I don&#x27;t like is it&#x27;s a very thin fabric so if it catches on something gets a little Pull but it still looks very nice and I am very happy with it it is long and it is wide which is great for tying scarves in different styles</li>
            <li> loved it no one has one like it.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Goes with everything</li>
            <li> A lot thinner/lightweight than expected. But still great, I love it!</li>
            <li> This review is from my wife: Knowing that this is shipped from overseas, I anticipated a long wait. It was hard to be patient, but it was definitely worth the wait. The scarf is well-made with nicely-turned hems. The fabric is soft and lightweight but not so thin that it seems flimsy or super delicate. The colors are just like you see in the picture...Beautiful! I&#x27;m a sucker for autumn colors...especially greens and browns, so I love it! For the price, I highly recommend it. Just be willing to wait. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Nice light stylish coloring. The material is also decent, actually better than what I expected. Will buy again. And it came within 4 days. Very fast.</li>
            <li> Loved the item. quick delivery</li>
            <li> Looks good but is not the correct size, too small.</li>
            <li> Love the look, love the price, love the quality.  May order more</li>
            <li> I love the colors of this scarf.  Since purchasing it, I have worn it at least 3-4 times a week.  A great deal for a very good product.</li>
            <li> great with brown and green.  thank you</li>
            <li> Picture conveys accurate depiction.  Colors are rich and size is wide enough to use as a light Fall or Spring/Summer wrap.  Just be aware that the fabric is silky and very fine/thin.  Can be tied in a variety of ways making it quite versatile.</li>
            <li> Liked style and workmanship. Complimented much.  Price was exceptionally reasonable.  Will keep my eye open for more good looking styles.</li>
            <li> This scarf is well worth what I paid. It is beautiful, lightweight, and plenty big.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it smells, it really stinks. I am trying to get the smell out, anyone have any ideas?  I added another star because with a little airing out and fabreeze the stink is gone! Yippee! It really is a lovely scarf.</li>
            <li> It looks ok and goes well with my dress and coat. A good size for the money.</li>
            <li> I love scarves. This is beautiful with the  colors it has. Fall. It reminds me of fall.  Beautiful sage green, beige and rust.  This is a must have for any scarf lover&#x27;s closet.</li>
            <li> Although the price was too good to believe, the quality was very substandard. I would not recommend this product for purchase, as the fabric is course and the design unflatterring</li>
            <li> This Scarf I originally bought as a gift but I am thinking about keeping it because it is so beautiful! I am very happy with the purchase now just to decide weather or not I want to keep it or gift it!! Such a hard choice!!!</li>
            <li> these scarfs are long and will wrap around nicely.  the price is what i like.  you go to the store and by the time you pay it with tax they normally would run about $15-$20.</li>
            <li> Nice and long.  Colors are muted,yet colorful.  The item is thing but very wide which means it can be doubled for thickness.  Despite the fact that its thin, I would but again as the price means great.  This will really dress up any outfit.  The perfect is exact.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this scarf, nice design and color, good quality, pretty good size.I definitely I recommend this scarf.</li>
            <li> I really like this! It is a great scarf! I can&#x27;t wait to wear it every day! I love this scarf!</li>
            <li> Loved it beautiful matches my outfits texture is so comfortable love it I would recommend to friends and family beautiful</li>
            <li> I received my scarf earlier then I expected. It is a really beautiful scarf!! It is very long, and thin. If you do not like thinner scarfs, then I would not recommend this scarf for you. I love it and cannot wait to wear it! I would definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Love this! But it did shred at the ends after a few wears</li>
            <li> received scarf in good condition, was packaged well and I am very satisfied with design, will wear as an accessory with headwrap scarves.</li>
            <li> I wore it the day it arrived!  I happened to have on an outfit that coordinated when it arrived and wore it to dinner.  I really like the length.  It will double as a head scarf or shawl in winter, but it is light enough to wear in spring.  It would work tied around your waist over clothing, it&#x27;s very sheer.  So, pretty much year round usage.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the looks of it.  It will go with a lot of my outfits.  It even looks good on the hat rack by the door...that said, it could be used as a room decor accent, like an accent table cover (not for food service, too flimsy for a lot of washing).  The reason for the four stars is that the fabric is so loosely woven, it probably will not hold up to heavy usage or frequent washing, especially a washing machine...but I&#x27;m easy on my clothes and I never wash scarves in the washing machine at all.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, even if it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> This Scarf in not as long as it is pictured - It is pretty and a nice weight - but if you are looking to use it as a shawl too - it will not work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received so many compliments when wearing this scarf.  It is large as indicated and the colors are very close to the picture.</li>
            <li> is expected and recommend the product</li>
            <li> Love the color but not what I was expecting really thin, and stiching it&#x27;s really bad not wide enought nothing compare to the picture</li>
            <li> Beautiful.  Prettier than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I bought the brown one after reading the reviews. Am not a scarf wearer except to bed to protect my hair. I only wanted to buy one as a sample and it is very pretty and as long as I hoped it would be. Long enough to wrap around my head at bed time or for styling sake. Only $3.50, can&#x27;r believe it. Will buy more from ZPS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery took 17 days, which is expected, coming from China. Worth the wait.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be cheated by the pictures.  Not as big as in the pictures.  I almost wanted to return this but hey, it&#x27;s not worth it cause it was only $3 somthing. The stiches are not straight, size is the right, you get what you paid for.  At least, the colors are what it is in the pictures, and the weight is there.</li>
            <li> The scarf was a beautiful material.  I bought it for my daughter-in-law and she loved it.  She teaches and wears scarves a lot</li>
            <li> So soft and pretty and feminine! Just perfect</li>
            <li> Nice, light weight and loved the price.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT AS A GIFT........I TRUELY LOVE THE SIZE AND MAY KEEP FOR MYSELF AFTERALL.......</li>
            <li> so soft  and long .great company</li>
            <li> What a beautiful scarf! I wore it to a restaurant recently and received several compliments. The price was unbelievable (low) and the transaction was smooth. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Beautiful scarf!!! I really like it!!!</li>
            <li> The scarf is long and light just like I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that it&#x27;s very thin material, but for what I wanted it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend the seller!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> WOW! What an enjoyable surprise. I usually read the reviews before making a decision to buy when shopping on line, especially when third parties/sellers are involved. The comments were mixed on the quality of the material and was a bit of  concern. However I was most interested in the colors and length, and the price was definitely in my range. I am so glad that I followed my heart and placed the order. As I ponder over the many outfits and colors that it can be paired with I cant wait to boldly wear my scarf for all to see. So many ways for the scarf to be worn. The quality of the material is more than I expected and the colors are very vibrant. With the fall season soon to arrive it will certainly be a standout when accessorized with neutral colors. It looks exactly if not better than the image presented. I&#x27;m contemplating ordering another one as a gift for a close friend. Today when the scarf arrived I was feeling a blue BUT this scarf brought a smile to my lips!!!!! Would I? Yes, I would certainly recommend this seller to family, friends, and others.&lt;br /&gt;Diva -n-GA  08-14-2014</li>
            <li> Very pretty very good price and service was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> gorgeous thin scarf. i expected it to be longer but it was still an okay length scarf. dont hesitate. recommended</li>
            <li> look forward to wearing it</li>
            <li> Not quite as full looking, but it makes a nice spring scarf.  Can use as dressy or casual. I recommend this for the dressy look.</li>
            <li> This scarf is nice and lightweight for the warm weather. You can wear just this scarf and a tank top for the cool evenings will be great. This is just like pictured but better in person.</li>
            <li> Great price and a snazzy way to dress up a &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; outfit without too much glitz. Good quality and ethereally light.</li>
            <li> Perfect fall/ winter scarf and the price was right! I love getting great deals on stylish accessories. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> beautiful, great price</li>
            <li> This is soooooo pretty. Love the soft colors and the material is just elegant. I cannot believe the price. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I just enjoy my recent purchase.  I would recommend this to all my scarf wearing friends and co workers as well.</li>
            <li> This scarf is lovely. It was delivered two weeks ahead of the actual delivery estimate. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it. Should&#x27;ve bought extra for gifts.</li>
            <li> nice scarf. used for a headwrap and a neck wrap!</li>
            <li> Size is off. Two long to lay over neck like an open tie and too short to wrap around your neck in today&#x27;s popular styles without the ends sticking out. Ugh!</li>
            <li> I really love this scarf, I get a lot of compliments and goes with so much!</li>
            <li> Love it.  It is really long</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait for cooler weather so I can wear this scarf.  It&#x27;s well made and quite large.</li>
            <li> I like the scarfs. they are not over priced and I will continue to look for great deals that pop up on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my product</li>
            <li> Beautiful lightweight colorful scarf!</li>
            <li> A nice classic design on a large, soft scarf. I really like it! I might order several of these scarves for Christmas or birthday presents. There is a design for every lady I know.</li>
            <li> It was a long wait , but the scarf is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Beautiful scarf for a great value.</li>
            <li> The scarf is absolutely beautiful, and, it is of the highest quality.  I got it at a discounted price, which makes it even better.&lt;br /&gt;It works absolutely perfectly with a sheath dress and a pair of shoes that I already own.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like the out fit was purchased together, but, they were all purchased at different places, at different times.</li>
            <li> The scarf is so pretty and nice! It&#x27;s really warm and quite large. However the material could easily snag, it seems, although it never happened to me.</li>
            <li> This scarf looks just like the picture.....it is very wide and lays just like  the pic the ends at a angle...it is a beautiful scarf.....with all the colors I can match it with a lot in my wardrobe this scarf looks  liked it cost more then I paid for it....an  like always it came sooner then expected....kudos for fast delivery</li>
            <li> the fabric is low quality, it is smaller than showed in the picture. overall disappinted</li>
            <li> Only giving 4 start because of shipment time, but very nice scarf.</li>
            <li> Very nice and for the price! Nothing can beat it!</li>
            <li> I have to say when I received the scarf, I initially didn&#x27;t even open it. Just looking at it, I was not impressed. However I decided not to return it (the price was so cheap, even if I didn&#x27;t like it made no sense to return it) and when I finally did open the packaging, I realized it was actually quite nice. I love the print. I plan to buy more!</li>
            <li> colors are great......quality not what I expected.  It looks better in the picture...I do like the length though.  My only concern is that I sent the seller an email asking if their scarfs were made in those sweat houses where they hire children.  If so this will be my last purchase from them.  Have not heard back.</li>
            <li> This is false advertisement, the scarf if not as long &amp; full as it is in pictures, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice. The design is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love my scarfs as my daughter does ;)</li>
            <li> Very pretty - true to picture - colors and all.  Length and width very good.&lt;br /&gt;Great addition!</li>
            <li> Smaller than pictures</li>
            <li> Beautiful but thin and small than expected.</li>
            <li> Ugly.  Has very large patten of stripes and old looking colors.  Not representative of the usual products.</li>
            <li> Very cheap material its already unraveling pretty colors not as much fabric shown in photo</li>
            <li> great stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> large scarf, nice colors</li>
            <li> Very big scarf and every thin and sheer..nice look tho</li>
            <li> I have not recieve my scarf at all so i give 1 star</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t accept because it came direct from China I will be sure that I know where the items are coming from.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay with the price.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as big as it appeared.</li>
            <li> Love it! Matches a lot of outfits.</li>
            <li> Beautiful I wo buy it again</li>
            <li> Very nice but not for me.  Things sure looks differently on pictures.  I gave it to friend at work and she liked it</li>
            <li> I ordered two of the same scarves  Pretty disappointed with the quality.  Upon inspection, the first scarf had two 1 inch rips above the border.  The second scarf did not have any rip,but it had fraying, due to the poor stitching.  Also I thought the scarves was made out of  cotton, it feels more like polyester and the material snags easily.  Both scarves also has an  awful  smell to it, like  it was exposed to a fog machine.  This time around I was not very happy with my purchases.&lt;br /&gt;please note, I decided to have the seller replace the two defected scarves. I figured the second time around might be better. Second scarves, were sent March 11 and still no scarves as of April 24, 2014. I asked the seller for a refund since I did not want to chance a third try. One thing good is that the Seller is very responsive, and can&#x27;t blame them for orders not being received. Refund took one business day. Thanks for the quick response.</li>
            <li> The scarf arrived later than promised arrival (3-4 weeks), which was not a major issue but when I opened the envelope, I was totally disappointed!  The scraf was of very poor quality, the fabric was very thin, the dyeing, weaving and stitching are all terrible!  It looks so cheap that I would not wear it myself nor would I give it to (offend) anyone.  On the website it says \\&quot;high quality\\&quot; which was a total misrepresentation and a classic example of what you see (on the picture) is not what you get at all!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller, and the canned feedback was that, \\&quot;I am sorry to hear that you received a broken item. We checked every item before the shippment, and it was good then, maybe the damage is caused during the shipping, shall we send you a replacement...\\&quot;  I wrote back to clarify that the item was not damaged during shipping but just of very poor quality.  If I return it, all the way from N. America to China, according to the policy, I have to bear the return shipping, and that was exactly what the seller told me by this single-line email: \\&quot;I am sorry.In the event that the buyer has to bear the return shipping cost\\&quot; which obviously is not worth it for an item of just a few bucks.  I am a reasonable buyer, if I pay a few bucks, I expect something only for the amount but not ten times more as it is not fair.  I am pretty sure one can easily find something of much better quality for the same money in many local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the very first time I am giving only one star, and I would have given no star if there was such choice at all.  I only noticed quite a few other buyers had similar experience after all that happened.  Lesson learned anyway.  I will donate the item to charity.</li>
            <li> I expected the scarf to be like the picture. However, the picture is about 3 or 4 scarves, which gives it the fullness. I was disappointed because I only received one and it looks nothing at all as displayed. Overall, it is a nice scarf, but Agin, I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this scarf.  It&#x27;s lightweight and gives my same old outfits a new look.  I highly recommend purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> The scarf received looks nothing like this photo. The colors &amp; pattern are different &amp; the material shown in the photo seems voluminous  when it is at most half that size. Very disappointed,</li>
            <li> I loved this scarf. It has so many colors you can wear it alot.  It is classy looking and it is very long so you can tie it in so many styles.  I think because it is cotton I enjoy that more.  The fabric has standibility which makes it more versatile.</li>
            <li> This is a scarf I expect to get more wear out of in during the cooler months....there is simply so much scarf, it&#x27;s got a life of it&#x27;s own.  I&#x27;m just planning the tan sweater and the scarf...and no more</li>
            <li> The scarf in the picture is not the scarf that I received. It is very thin, barely comes to my waist after  draping around my neck. And there is a flaw in it also. Very disappointed !!!!!! A total misrepresentation. It is a scarf and it is that print but that&#x27;s all not worth what I paid. I would like to return it. this is the first time I&#x27;ve been this disappointed in an item that I&#x27;ve purchased from amazon !!!!</li>
            <li> Simply beautiful !!! I love itüëç</li>
            <li> Amazing scarf. i bought this for my cousin and she loved it!</li>
            <li> The fabric quality of this scarf is very poor; also was the stitching. I was quite disappointed in this scarf.</li>
            <li> Very well made, very soft to the touch, very attractive with a variety of outfits whether casual or more dressy</li>
            <li> MONEY WELL SPEND. IT&#x27;S A BARGIN FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR IT. GO AHEAD AND GET IT IF YOU WANT</li>
            <li> Scarf looked exactly like the picture. Colors are true to picture also. Material doesn&#x27;t fall apart even though it seems delicate.</li>
            <li> As someone else said earlier, it&#x27;s just OK. Love the design and the colors are as represented, but thought scarf would be fuller based on the pictures. Last picture is the only one that is realistic - I think the model and the bust are wearing 2 or more of these.  For the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Nice lightweight scarf.  For the price it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Great scarf....very fashionable</li>
            <li> Like many of the scarfs on Amazon, the pictures are arranged to look like it is ruffled or pleated or has something going on. What you get is a flat oblong scarf, folded and flat, and in the case of the one I received with a snag. I threw it over my drapes as a valance.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered more.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this and I recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> It is a very large and long scarf, really unique. Colors fit with anything you wear. Sure it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> My wife really liked it.</li>
            <li> This scarf was very pretty and I like the size.  I haven&#x27;t wore it yet ... trying to find something cute to accessorize it with.</li>
            <li> I gave as gifts. Very well liked.</li>
            <li> just okay....no where near as big or luscious as depicted.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t drape as pictured unless you have a 3 inch neck. It took forever to get here. The fabric seems a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice,substantial scarf will go well with beigh and neutral colors I like it.</li>
            <li> Was not sure about this scarf but with brown in it I felt that it was a definite option since I love browns.  It arrived early and is gorgeous.  The colors all work together beautifully and it is a soft well made scarf.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  It will compliment a lot of different wardrobes.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliment on this product. Now my friend want to buy some scarfs.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and that the scarf was long, however, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be quite as delicate as it is, this scarf is very thin so be careful not to snag this on anything! Snaged on my daughter&#x27;s nail the first time I wore it. Defiantly not very durable. I like it but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful....easy to wrap in different ways...bold beautiful colors....</li>
            <li> Did not really like.  Not what was shown on the website.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> THESE SCARFS ARE VERY BIG AND BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS ON THEM. fabric isnt rough nor scratchy. love them thats why i bought 2</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. The texture and weight is perfect for wearing as a scarf or shawl. Great look!&lt;br /&gt;R. Henderson</li>
            <li> Not as long as it was pictured, was pretty disappointed but overall I liked the color &amp; I&#x27;ve gotten good complements!</li>
            <li> Is not as long as indicated.</li>
            <li> Finally got my scarf and I love it... just wish it was a little bigger.... but overall its good.</li>
            <li> The material is cotton. Good size scarve. Haven&#x27;t use it yet, should be good.</li>
            <li> Great Fall colors in this scarf!  I purchased the item  generically called &amp;#34;Stripes&amp;#34;. It has nice warm tones of tan,  light and dark brown with contrasting stripes of medium olive green, light to medium rust/orange and a cream stripe for punch. All in all, a very pleasing combination and I can see  wearing this with many different colors and patterns.  The pictures don&#x27;t do it justice - it is much brighter and prettier!  Also, sort of a &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; feeling to it.  It is sheer but not so much that it catches on everything and the weight and the cozy feel  is a nice transition into cooler weather.  The colors and pattern give this scarf a look of having more substance than it actually does and has a classy, yet hip, feel to it. It is decidedly casual and I can see wearing this to school, the office, Saturday farmer&#x27;s market, shopping, the movies, a late supper or even hiking.  The size is as stated, the drape is lovely, the price is low,  the shipping fast and free so you cannot afford to pass up this great addition to your Fall and Winter wardrobe!!!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great length, great width, very modern &amp; chic! A great buy!</li>
            <li> I have different kinds of scarf because I simply want to keep my neck warm while being stylish. This silk scarf is one of the best! It will also be a nice gift for your loved ones.</li>
            <li> nice and lightweight - goes with a lot of outfits!</li>
            <li> Scarf is great.  Colors are vivid and well made. I Love to wear scarves.  I use some for the winter and even some to the beach.</li>
            <li> scarf was just as shown and very nice.</li>
            <li> It appeared as it was advertised.  It has become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Catches on everything</li>
            <li> Hello, all the products have been like in the picture, that is why i keep buying in amazon. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Quality is poor, not recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scarf, well made and looks like a million bucks when you put it own!  Will definitely be ordering more products from this company!</li>
