    <ol>
            <li>I feel happy that I can still get Grecian, but I fear it is a product that is being discontinued and</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work.    </li>
            <li>BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon stocks this product.</li>
            <li>Grecian 5 5-minute Hair color,Medium Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the prodoct and I will keep on buying it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I was just hoping to be able to save some for the side burns that need coloring every two wks and not every six wks as the rest of my head.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>They both work just fine.</li>
            <li>AND FOR A GREAT LOW PRICE!  </li>
            <li>I called Combe Inc., the make of Grecian 5, and they confirmed what I feared was going to happen with this product.</li>
            <li>I have used it in the past and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Why wouldn&#x27;t I give the product the full five stars ?  </li>
            <li>love the product it works very well.</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!!</li>
            <li>Great product, not available in the stores anymore, does not itches the sculp</li>
            <li>so I went on the internet to see if Grecian was available and sure enough I found it.  </li>
            <li>I am 82 years old, but feel better with color in my hair - maybe I am vain???</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many, many years now and it has been increasingly harder to find anymore.</li>
            <li>Just For Men long ago watered down and effectively ruined what had been a good product, but they are muscling Grecian out of the store aisles.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product but it&#x27;s gotten too expensive, it&#x27;s more than double the price I paid 6 months ago, if this keeps up, I will have to find an alternative product.</li>
            <li>and it will not be long before you can&#x27;t find it on line any more either.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, hard to find because their nemesis, Just For Men, has come out with a new line that has wound up elbowing Grecian out of the store shelves.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, not messy, hair look natural</li>
            <li>Each time the shipments were prompt and the price is still reasonable.  </li>
            <li>As the host of Mad House TV,  [...] I find that this is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The seller had a great price on this item at my time of purchase and I am sorry to say that it will never be at this price again.</li>
            <li>Besides that the product cost a bit less, it also leaves your hair looking a bit more natural.  </li>
            <li>I have used other brands but this is my personal favorite.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Just for men\\&quot; changed all my hair to one color while \\&quot;grecian formula\\&quot; only colored the white and gray hairs and thus left me with a much more natural looking head of hair.  </li>
            <li>I figured Grecian Formula (now called &#x27;Grecian 5&#x27;) was the original hair color for men, at least that&#x27;s the first product I remember being advertised on TV</li>
            <li>I tried Just For Men and it Is a product that does not last - you have to use it twice as much as Grecian.and</li>
            <li>Using it for 20 years so far just had problems  finding it.</li>
            <li>its easy to use doesn&#x27;t stain and lasts as long as other products, I prefer it because it doesn&#x27;t stain the scalp</li>
            <li>I have used all major brands, and Grecian Formula 5 is the easiest to apply and has a natural color.  </li>
            <li>Grecian 5 is easy to use and it lasts for at least 8 weeks.</li>
            <li>Not all of my hair is the exact same color as even though I have dark brown hair, I do have some lighter brown, blond and even some red hairs.  </li>

            <li> Ordered this to use on my beard and mustache as I had trouble finding the Grecian formula in stores, and the website description specifically says \\&quot;Comes with mixing tray and brush so it can be used both on the head and facial hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Meaning that one can not save any of the liquid for use in a few weeks to use on the tough side burns.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Just for men\\&quot; also has this negative.  </li>
            <li> It does not look artificial and even my barber told me it&#x27;s impossible for him to tell if someone used the product.</li>

            <li> Easy to use, not messy, hair look natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time Just For Men user (I use both the hair and the mustache/beard products).  They both work just fine. I figured Grecian Formula (now called &#x27;Grecian 5&#x27;) was the original hair color for men, at least that&#x27;s the first product I remember being advertised on TV, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Truth is, I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this Grecian 5 and the Just For Men product; they both go on about the same; they both color about the same (I use Medium Brown); and they both last about the same before having to be re-applied (2-3 weeks for me).  I didn&#x27;t find a Grecian 5 for mustache/beard product, so these comments only apply to the hair product.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands but this is my personal favorite.  The product lasts me for weeks and leaves my hair the same as it was before using it..  It does not look artificial and even my barber told me it&#x27;s impossible for him to tell if someone used the product.</li>
            <li> As the host of Mad House TV,  [...] I find that this is the best I have ever used. Keep up the good work.    Tom Mele</li>
            <li> Ordered this to use on my beard and mustache as I had trouble finding the Grecian formula in stores, and the website description specifically says \\&quot;Comes with mixing tray and brush so it can be used both on the head and facial hair\\&quot;.  This was not true, the boxes had nothing on them about being used on facial hair, there was no mixing tray, no brush, and no instructions for using less than the whole bottle/tube combination at once, or on facial hair.</li>
            <li> This product is disappearing from store shelfs. I have used all major brands, and Grecian Formula 5 is the easiest to apply and has a natural color.  I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon stocks this product.</li>
            <li> Grecian 5 5-minute Hair color,Medium Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the prodoct and I will keep on buying it. Please .keep it in stock.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  Suddenly, here in Michigan, it disappeared off the shelves at the stores.  Just For Men products took over.  I tried Just For Men and it Is a product that does not last - you have to use it twice as much as Grecian.and sometimes it just don&#x27;t cover the grey hair.  I was very disappointed with Just For Men so I went on the internet to see if Grecian was available and sure enough I found it.  I have made three purchases over the internet.  Each time the shipments were prompt and the price is still reasonable.  I feel happy that I can still get Grecian, but I fear it is a product that is being discontinued and if so, I will just let my hair go grey.  I am 82 years old, but feel better with color in my hair - maybe I am vain???</li>
            <li> Thought that this would be similar to \\&quot;just for men\\&quot;, but to my surprise there was an added plus.  Besides that the product cost a bit less, it also leaves your hair looking a bit more natural.  How so?  \\&quot;Just for men\\&quot; changes all of ones hair to the same color, while grecian formula just touches ones gray and white hairs.  You might ask well is there a difference.  The answer for some people is no, but for others like myself, the answer is yes.  How so ?  Not all of my hair is the exact same color as even though I have dark brown hair, I do have some lighter brown, blond and even some red hairs.  \\&quot;Just for men\\&quot; changed all my hair to one color while \\&quot;grecian formula\\&quot; only colored the white and gray hairs and thus left me with a much more natural looking head of hair.  Why wouldn&#x27;t I give the product the full five stars ?  Because the entire bottle must be used or thrown away.  Meaning that one can not save any of the liquid for use in a few weeks to use on the tough side burns.  I don&#x27;t know why once the product has been mixed, the product will only work for another half hour.  \\&quot;Just for men\\&quot; also has this negative.  I was just hoping to be able to save some for the side burns that need coloring every two wks and not every six wks as the rest of my head.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, hard to find because their nemesis, Just For Men, has come out with a new line that has wound up elbowing Grecian out of the store shelves. Just For Men long ago watered down and effectively ruined what had been a good product, but they are muscling Grecian out of the store aisles. Amazon was the only place I could find it.</li>
            <li> Great product, not available in the stores anymore, does not itches the sculp&lt;br /&gt;it meets my expectations, i would like to find an equivalent product as this one will be discontinued (i believe)</li>
            <li> its easy to use doesn&#x27;t stain and lasts as long as other products, I prefer it because it doesn&#x27;t stain the scalp</li>
            <li> GOT THEM ALL! JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR! AND FOR A GREAT LOW PRICE!  BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!</li>
            <li> Grecian 5 is easy to use and it lasts for at least 8 weeks. I get 2 applications per package because I have short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gene</li>
            <li> The seller had a great price on this item at my time of purchase and I am sorry to say that it will never be at this price again. I have used this product for many, many years now and it has been increasingly harder to find anymore. The stores stopped selling it a while back and it will not be long before you can&#x27;t find it on line any more either. I called Combe Inc., the make of Grecian 5, and they confirmed what I feared was going to happen with this product. They have stopped making Grecian 5. They also make &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; and that has become their big seller and it has pushed Grecian 5 out of the market. This is indeed a sad day for us men that have been loyal to Grecian 5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years.  It does not look like you have died your hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> love the product it works very well. will buy it again. I have used it in the past and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Using it for 20 years so far just had problems  finding it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product but it&#x27;s gotten too expensive, it&#x27;s more than double the price I paid 6 months ago, if this keeps up, I will have to find an alternative product.</li>
            <li> Could not find this product locally anymore, online price is close to what I paid for it at local stores</li>
