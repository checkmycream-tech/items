            <li> I have thin, fine hair and this product</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT KEEPS MY HAIR FROM BEING FLAT ON MY HEAD..</li>
            <li> It does give me long lasting lift and does not darken my hair like some products do.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE SO MANY HAIR PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTING</li>
            <li> I have super thick, heavy coarse hair and when it gets heavy it needs a little bit of volume and this products helps hold volume even in my thick heavy hair until I wash it the next day.  </li>
            <li> CAUSE IT DOESN&#x27;T WEIGH IT DOWN..</li>
            <li> This product works ok, however the smell is so awful it makes me want to get back in the shower and remove it.</li>
            <li> Just a little spray at the root of your hair after sectioning off dry as usual.</li>
            <li> I WASTED A LOT OF TIME</li>
            <li> It looked like it would perform miracles with limp hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I would do without product I am so used to counting on it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on it!</li>
            <li> Somewhat irritating to the scalp though.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t finish the bottle, it&#x27;s THAT bad</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!  </li>
            <li> PROMISE YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISAPPOINTED!!</li>
            <li> Besides not working the smell is AWFUL!!!  </li>

            <li> Works great for fine hair!</li>

            <li> I prefer Nicks other Root Lifting Spray much better.  I guess he doesn&#x27;t make that on anymore.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works great. Just a little spray at the root of your hair after sectioning off dry as usual. It will give you the lift you need and it will last.  Has a nice smell that is not overwhelming, does not leave your hair sticky. Use it all the time</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and this product really poofs it up and makes it fuller.  I tried it at a friend&#x27;s house and had to have it. Worth the price.</li>

            <li> I bought this after seeing it either on QVC or HSN.  It looked like it would perform miracles with limp hair.  WRONG!!!  I have seen it several time on the show and it does not do any of the things it says it would.  Besides not working the smell is AWFUL!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on it!</li>
            <li> I love this root booster. I have fine blonde hair. It does give me long lasting lift and does not darken my hair like some products do. You do not need a lot of it so it is a great value.I would suggest this for any hair type.</li>
            <li> I like the amount of volume that I get when using this product. I wish is was a bit less expensive but overall very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I liked this because the product does have a natural look and the little box it comes in is great for your purse for a touch up.</li>
            <li> This product works ok, however the smell is so awful it makes me want to get back in the shower and remove it. It smells like a mix of infant vomit and nail polish remover. I can&#x27;t finish the bottle, it&#x27;s THAT bad</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. I have thin hair and it really helps!  I really like this product!  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
