            <li>I received this at no cost in order to provide honest feedback.</li>
            <li>It is a souffle which is apt to call this as its texture is just like it.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome souffle which I mainly used on my legs.</li>
            <li>of the best features of these OZ products are that they are scent-free and each tube is a different bright color.</li>
            <li>, when I&#x27;m not wearing my glasses.the best features of these OZ products are that they are scent-free and each tube is a different bright color.</li>
            <li>This body moisturizer has a light pleasant lotion-y smell in the tube that isn’t an overpowering fragrance that once rubbed into the skin</li>
            <li>Goes on great and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong olive oil smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean, seemingly fragrance-free option, and I great appreciate that this is mostly vegan product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of the OZ Naturals products and I&#x27;ve liked them all.</li>
            <li>This moisturizing product labeled as a &#x27;body souffle&#x27; is a nice and effective long term daily/nightly body cream that effectively seals in moisture (best used immediately after a shower/bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This whipped moisturizer is perfect for those winter months, it keeps my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Love love love this!</li>
            <li>so a nice big flip top tube is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I like very light moisturizers for my face since I tend to breakout in acne.</li>
            <li>The lotion is very light and absorbs into your skin quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>They are very smooth.  </li>
            <li>The cream is not greasy and absorbs into my skin quickly and does a good job at making my skin feel softer.  </li>

            <li>I also love that there is no scent.</li>
            <li>If  I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t totally LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s made with oil &amp; jojoba oils</li>

            <li>I love</li>
            <li>love this Vitamin E cream,</li>
            <li>I - like I&#x27;m sure all of us OZ Naturals lovers - couldn&#x27;t wait for them to come out with a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it on I was in Love</li>

            <li>This lotion is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love using it on my feet</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>I love the smell, I love the feel, I love the benefit of this body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>But if you do have, then it&#x27;s even more of a plus.</li>
            <li>smooth nicely scented not perfumey at all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>It feels so good on my skin, is non-greasy and it lasts the whole day!</li>
            <li>Again, winter time I have dry skin, so this worked great!</li>
            <li>I have to say this lotion is the best on dry summer skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to help plump out your skin and leave it soft and healthy looking again.  </li>
            <li>blend of oils and other mostly botanical ingredients provides excellent protection against loss of moisture</li>
            <li>I have been using &amp;#34;beauty salon&#x27; products and so far I have been happy with OZ Naturals at a lower price than what I have been spending.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying the smooth consistency of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>They make quality products that are safe to use on all skin types, CRUELTY FREE and affordable.  </li>
            <li>I use both this and the Body Butter together for great, soft skin.</li>
            <li>Oz Naturals has always made great products - I love that they&#x27;re made in the USA, strive to use as many organic ingredients as possible, and they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li>I did receive a complimentary tube of this product in order to write my honest opinion about it.</li>

            <li>I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this moisturizer to test and its wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Why eat a clean healthy diet and then slather yourself in chemicals and toxins?</li>
            <li>That makes them easy to distinguish at the pool shower</li>
            <li>That makes them easy to distinguish at the pool shower, when I&#x27;m not wearing my glasses.</li>
            <li>but it disappeared very quick after applying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>my skin still feels soft and smooth great product  </li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural and that makes me feel good when using it.  </li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals, organic ingredients and vegan friendly, which is highly important to me.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it had no scent threw me at first as I am used to scented lotions; but the richness and quick absorbency - and no harsh perfumes - make it the perfect blend.</li>
            <li>rest of the ingredients seem fine to me.</li>
            <li>It reduces fine lines and makes the skin glow.</li>
            <li>and I love how it soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>This product has a very light to no scent at all, which is nice for people that are sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is a huge tube.</li>
            <li>It comes in a huge tube, 8 fl oz.</li>
            <li>It leaves the body so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a body moisturizer that will not compete with a scent you are already wearing and enjoy a light application</li>
            <li>then I think you will enjoy this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Used this product after my shower, and felt the smooth texture penetrate and hold the moisture in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made in the USA, 70% organic and animal cruelty free.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Phenoxyethanol is a preservative that is primarily used in cosmetics and medications.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s make my skin smooth</li>
            <li>got this free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>Despite the ingredients the souffl&amp;eacute; is fragrance free -</li>
            <li>item was made available for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>This review is given after receiving the product free.</li>
            <li>I use it as a facial moisturizer (as well as body moisturizer) and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>Skin absorption is quick and effective and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue which is very much appreciated if applying to your hands and fingers.</li>
            <li>thing I would like to point out is that the Sweet Almond &amp; Macadamia Nut lotion has a symbol for Vegan and one for Cruelty Free -</li>
            <li>*received for purposes of review*&lt;br /&gt;The OZ line is one of my go to&#x27;s in my home, everything that I have tried is top of the line and is just as perfect as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>The palm oil is rich in medium chain triglycerides and protects the skin without making it sticky.  </li>
            <li>A great moisturizer for dry skin....nourishing.</li>
            <li>I love that is 70% organic, natural and cruelty free! .Plus</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer to use all year around and safe for everyday</li>
            <li>It smells great and it feels like it is actually being absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li>My favorite So far love the feel once again</li>
            <li>I am allergic to everything I searched and searched and found OZ Naturals and decided I would try their facial products with great success.  </li>
            <li>I love the Oz naturals products, natural and paraben free!</li>
            <li>I love that this moisturizing &amp;#34;souffle&amp;#34; comes in a nice big tube instead of a tub like some souffle type products do.  </li>
            <li>Speaking of oils, one major things here is that there is really no discernible scent to this lotion which is wonderful - meaning that you can still wear your favorite perfumes and not have it overwhelmed by the lotion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made right here in the USA!  </li>
            <li>When I apply it, my skin soaks it right up!</li>
            <li>I always review products objectively and fairly.</li>
            <li>i love this products so much</li>
            <li>really like this moisturizer, much better that Cetaphil (too medicine-smelling), Aveeno (</li>
            <li>Seriously one of the BEST organic butters I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The next morning my skin still felt nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and can be used on the face as well.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling supple and hydrated without any greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Despite being thicker, it absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer does absorbs quickly and does not leave that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It goes into your skin quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a white lotion has a nice smooth and creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>So, the OZ product is more appropriate for daily,</li>
            <li>I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply to large areas and almost melts into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has the same refreshing quality as the Amino Herbal Hydration mask (which I absolutely love) when it is applied and melts right into my skin.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, gives skin a healthy glow and can be used pretty much anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li>I recently tested and reviewed the OZ Naturals Sweet Almond &amp; Macadamia Body Butter and to be honest with you</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent and didn&#x27;t really notice it too much.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is smooth and very hydrating.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals has become my go to brand for body and facial products and their products are not only amazing, they are amazing for you.  </li>
            <li>If you are on the fence about buying this product do not be it is well worth the price and does wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li>I loved that it had Aloe vera, green tea, jojoba, and shea butter, which are all fantastic ingredients</li>
            <li>More or less true: no perfume smell for sure but a &amp;#34;no smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li>moisturizer goes on easily, with no scent (my strong preference, and a big plus for the OZ products).</li>
            <li>If you look at OZ NTURALS line of products you will find just the right product for your needs.</li>
            <li>Another positive is that it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, just moisturizing!</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly, while leaving my skin so silky soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super luxurious but at an affordable price so that you can slather your whole body with this and not worry about breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>Very mild and soft to touch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application to the skin goes in nice and easy and definitely leaves a slinky, silky finish that holds up for a couple of hours provided you are indoors and not engaged in physical exertion.</li>
            <li>Also  it really makes my tattoos pop!</li>
            <li>My entire family fell in love with this souffl&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li>It can also be used for a facial moisturizer which I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>soo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This body butter absorb into my skin smoothly, leaving my skin soft and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This product is a non-greasy formula and leaves your skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Nice moisture, not much of fragrance,</li>
            <li>As with all of the Oz Natural products I use this body cream because it is free of toxins and the majority of the ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more to keep the compliments coming...</li>
            <li>but I felt the difference after the first time using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer I put it on after my shower and the next day</li>
            <li>Overall, if it weren&#x27;t for the smell, Id probably use it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li>WAY TOO DRYING FOR MATURE SKIN!!!!</li>
            <li>I wish it was warm enough to wear sandals because my feet are so soft!</li>
            <li>with all the Oz Naturals, I appreciate that it is 70% organic, contains healthy ingredients, and that a little goes a long way, making it a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just received this amazing moisturizer the other day...</li>
            <li>I have been moving away from beauty products that are chemical laden with parbens and other nasties and am happy that this works so well and is natural and has a high amount of organic ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>entire line thus far has been amazing in products,customer service, and shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also love using this as a whole body moisturizer (yep, even my face); cotton pj&#x27;s and the same thing -</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that I could use it on my entire body and even be used as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is by far one of the better moisturizers I have used thus far.  </li>
            <li>Between the sun and the chlorine (not to mention aging skin with too much sun exposure decades ago), my skin is pretty thirsty when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s thick enough to provide a good amount of moisture without a greasy feeling after.</li>
            <li>After I use up my other facial moisturizer I will continue to buy this for my face and body, one mositurizer for the entire body, how great is that!  </li>
            <li>The tube is quite large so you get a good quantity of product to last a long time.</li>
            <li>probably because it&#x27;s natural ingredients but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I use this formula on both my children and I, great for those really rough and dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>I have always been a huge fan of Oz Naturals product for several reasons.</li>
            <li>This Body moisturizer is a whipped souffle is a milk while color and has such a buttery smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>You will not need much to moisturize since it is a whipped consistency.</li>
            <li>No matter how much you use, you will never have a sticky feeling on your hands.</li>
            <li>I expected better for the price.  </li>
            <li>but it actually applies so smoothly -</li>
            <li>- they work very well together.</li>
            <li>That said, I highly recommend this lotion to everyone!</li>
            <li>This is a gentle moisturizer that works.</li>
            <li>This product is very moisturizing and nourishing</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>If you are putting it on your skin it is absorbing into your body.</li>
            <li>really isn’t noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have smell to it at all</li>
            <li>Moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>I really like it has Shea Butter, olive oils to soften my skin.  </li>
            <li>You can use it on your whole body.</li>
            <li>cuz I go barefoot so much during the summer and tend to have scruffy feet.  </li>
            <li>And it can be used on my face which I really like if I am in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time for the whole routine.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, so it absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>It really enhances the skin and refreshes it.</li>
            <li>I only use all natural products and cruelty free!  </li>
            <li>I think that once you try a natural organic product you will not be able to stand the feel of any of the commercial creams.</li>
            <li>Goes on thick but can be applied very easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>only have to use it once per day which is surprising as with my other body lotions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how FDA regulations allow this kind of nebulous description, especially in the primary ingredient.</li>
            <li>I love it just like all my other OZ Naturals products.</li>
            <li>love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, is thick and nourishing and that it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>This is the third OZ Natural product I have tried and so far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am sure in a few weeks use, my skin will really take notice.  </li>
            <li>This absorbs so quick but definitely hydrates.</li>
            <li>If I were pregnant or even of child-bearing age, I might further investigate, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The list of ingredients differs, but the two are so similar that I believe it is more of a marketing angle than it is really different</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to help maintain moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>This is a body lotion that has no smell like so more other moisturizer and dries with no greasy feeling, leaving your skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It is not irritating, even in sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this tube I won&#x27;t have to replace it as soon as normal.</li>
            <li>but I will be heading on over to the seller to purchase a few more bottles so that I do not run out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can watch it soften rough spots (like actinic keratoses), smooth out the skin on and above the feet where moisture is a challenge, and using it on a routine basis it erase fine lines and wrinkles because it plumps the moisture back into your skin.</li>
            <li>If you have ever tried to open a door, answer your touch screen cell phone, or put on your clothes right away after applying other brands of body cream, you will really appreciate that this leaves no greasy residue on the top of your skin - my skin is left soft and dewy without being oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This light moisturizer has a relatively neutral fragrance that smells fresh and slightly herbal.  </li>
            <li>see that, while the ingredient comes with a warning, it is a mild warning, with a caveat of there being limited data.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and none of the OZ Naturals products</li>
            <li>It smooths the skin, leaves it very very soft.</li>
            <li>It made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft and alluring.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a true body butter or lotion that does it job very well and is long lasting, received this as a sample for review.</li>
            <li>I am willingly to purchase this product again in the future.</li>
            <li>look, texture, thickness, smell, and absorption in the two lotions are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t watered down like some cheap lotion.  </li>
            <li>The Olive and Jojoba oil lotion felt silky smooth and it was soothing to my red burning and cracked dry skin.</li>
            <li>Better than Bliss which is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>Boy was I surprised, after about a week of using this</li>
            <li>I bought the lotion for the natural content aspect</li>
            <li>It blends into the skin so softly.</li>
            <li>My skin was baby soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>but it is a vital part of self care no matter what your age.</li>
            <li>I personally like Oz Naturals products because of quality and reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s near the bottom.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and don&#x27;t snag the sheets when I&#x27;m getting into or out of bed</li>
            <li>an makes me skin feel SO soft.</li>
            <li>but I personally think it&#x27;s too much for my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for natural products that work.</li>
            <li>Works on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>too greasy).&lt;br /&gt;So far, this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This didn’t both my sensitive skin as well.  </li>
            <li>I like how soft your skin feels after application.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt smoother and is so soft, my husband cannot stop rubbing my legs.  </li>
            <li>I definitely used too much.  </li>
            <li>Like all OZ Naturals products; this is organic and all natural.</li>
            <li>you wake up so soft.</li>
            <li>I apply this directly after a shower as well carry it with me in my diaper bag while out and about.</li>
            <li>It kept my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This body moisturizer is a fabulous, cruelty- free product that goes on without a greasy, thick feeling, unlike other soufflé-type skin creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Hours later, my skin still feels smooth but a tiny bit dry.</li>
            <li>This particular moisturizer they call a &#x60;whipped souffl&amp;eacute;&#x27; and when you actually try it you&#x27;ll understand why.</li>
            <li>It soaks into your skin like no other, and leaves it so soft and silky, Not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>When applied it melts right into my skin unlike other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Which is a major plus!</li>
            <li>dries quickly, non-greasy, with no significant scent,</li>
            <li>This is a very large tube and will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so dry and flaky my husband always comments that I really need lotion.  </li>
            <li>, this is VERY moisturizing, it is so creamy, and rich, and thick!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed this product line and now one other listing the first ingredient as \\&quot;Organic Herbal Infusion.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing to do is to slather my feet with this (after a pedi soak); put on a pair of thick comfy cotton socks; and go to bed!</li>
            <li>Many creams are too thick or heavy for the summer months, this one isn&#x27;t at all, it feels very moisturizing and soft.</li>
            <li>Any extra moisturizer I can get right now due to the winter months is bonus.</li>
            <li>Another solid product from OZ natural.</li>
            <li>I tend to have sensitive skin and found Oz Naturals products and have never left after discovering their brand.</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals sent this to me for review, and after using it for the past few months, I&#x27;m LOVING it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, even if you don&#x27;t have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a mild combination of organic aloe vera, green tea, shea butter and B5 in an olive and jojoba oil substrate that smoothes on like silk, penetrates deeply and refreshes the epidermis immediately and the dermis (below it) gradually.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not overwhelming at all!</li>
            <li>After using this product daily for a week, my husband actually complimented me on how soft my skin felt!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much and I recommend you start with very small dollops and seeing how far they go on your particular skin.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this product and all I can say is that it left my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>so you are not left with a greasy feeling only that of hydrated and soft skin.</li>
            <li>I knocked down this product to four stars because not only was the box pretty damaged</li>
            <li>It says for dry skin types but my facial skin is normal, I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The first few times using it</li>
            <li>It really suits me and calms down my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin from drying out and lasts much longer than other lotions I have used!</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like super thick creams on a daily basis, so</li>
            <li>While this moisturizer is to thick for me to use as a daily everyday moisturizer, it is handy to have when I need a deep moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as well as all their other products.</li>
            <li>This cream is nice an thick and a little goes a long way on me.  </li>
            <li>, I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful what I use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and smooth</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;The smell is also amazing.</li>
            <li> This light fragrance free moisturizer is wonderful!</li>

            <li> did receive a discount to give my honest thoughts on the product.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> What kind of water (distilled?</li>
            <li> I am loving them all.  </li>
            <li> I have liked all the products I have tried from OZ Naturals and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I received this at no cost in order to provide honest feedback.</li>
            <li> It is a souffle which is apt to call this as its texture is just like it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome souffle which I mainly used on my legs.</li>
            <li> of the best features of these OZ products are that they are scent-free and each tube is a different bright color.</li>
            <li> , when I&#x27;m not wearing my glasses.the best features of these OZ products are that they are scent-free and each tube is a different bright color.</li>
            <li> This body moisturizer has a light pleasant lotion-y smell in the tube that isn’t an overpowering fragrance that once rubbed into the skin</li>
            <li> Goes on great and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong olive oil smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean, seemingly fragrance-free option, and I great appreciate that this is mostly vegan product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the OZ Naturals products and I&#x27;ve liked them all.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing product labeled as a &#x27;body souffle&#x27; is a nice and effective long term daily/nightly body cream that effectively seals in moisture (best used immediately after a shower/bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This whipped moisturizer is perfect for those winter months, it keeps my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!</li>
            <li> so a nice big flip top tube is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I like very light moisturizers for my face since I tend to breakout in acne.</li>

            <li> I also love that there is no scent.</li>
            <li> If  I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.</li>

            <li> love this Vitamin E cream,</li>
            <li> I - like I&#x27;m sure all of us OZ Naturals lovers - couldn&#x27;t wait for them to come out with a body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on I was in Love</li>
            <li> I love using the moisturizer on my hands.  </li>

            <li> This lotion is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love using it on my feet</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I love the feel, I love the benefit of this body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> But if you do have, then it&#x27;s even more of a plus.</li>
            <li> smooth nicely scented not perfumey at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> It feels so good on my skin, is non-greasy and it lasts the whole day!</li>
            <li> Again, winter time I have dry skin, so this worked great!</li>
            <li> I have to say this lotion is the best on dry summer skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to help plump out your skin and leave it soft and healthy looking again.  </li>
            <li> blend of oils and other mostly botanical ingredients provides excellent protection against loss of moisture</li>
            <li> I have been using &amp;#34;beauty salon&#x27; products and so far I have been happy with OZ Naturals at a lower price than what I have been spending.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying the smooth consistency of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> They make quality products that are safe to use on all skin types, CRUELTY FREE and affordable.  </li>
            <li> I use both this and the Body Butter together for great, soft skin.</li>
            <li> Oz Naturals has always made great products - I love that they&#x27;re made in the USA, strive to use as many organic ingredients as possible, and they don&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li> I did receive a complimentary tube of this product in order to write my honest opinion about it.</li>

            <li> I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this moisturizer to test and its wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Why eat a clean healthy diet and then slather yourself in chemicals and toxins?</li>
            <li> That makes them easy to distinguish at the pool shower</li>
            <li> That makes them easy to distinguish at the pool shower, when I&#x27;m not wearing my glasses.</li>
            <li> but it disappeared very quick after applying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> my skin still feels soft and smooth great product  </li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural and that makes me feel good when using it.  </li>
            <li> No nasty chemicals, organic ingredients and vegan friendly, which is highly important to me.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it had no scent threw me at first as I am used to scented lotions; but the richness and quick absorbency - and no harsh perfumes - make it the perfect blend.</li>
            <li> rest of the ingredients seem fine to me.</li>
            <li> It reduces fine lines and makes the skin glow.</li>
            <li> and I love how it soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> This product has a very light to no scent at all, which is nice for people that are sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a huge tube.</li>
            <li> It comes in a huge tube, 8 fl oz.</li>
            <li> It leaves the body so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a body moisturizer that will not compete with a scent you are already wearing and enjoy a light application</li>
            <li> then I think you will enjoy this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Used this product after my shower, and felt the smooth texture penetrate and hold the moisture in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made in the USA, 70% organic and animal cruelty free.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Phenoxyethanol is a preservative that is primarily used in cosmetics and medications.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s make my skin smooth</li>
            <li> got this free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Despite the ingredients the souffl&amp;eacute; is fragrance free -</li>
            <li> item was made available for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This review is given after receiving the product free.</li>
            <li> I use it as a facial moisturizer (as well as body moisturizer) and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Skin absorption is quick and effective and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue which is very much appreciated if applying to your hands and fingers.</li>
            <li> thing I would like to point out is that the Sweet Almond &amp; Macadamia Nut lotion has a symbol for Vegan and one for Cruelty Free -</li>
            <li> *received for purposes of review*&lt;br /&gt;The OZ line is one of my go to&#x27;s in my home, everything that I have tried is top of the line and is just as perfect as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The palm oil is rich in medium chain triglycerides and protects the skin without making it sticky.  </li>
            <li> A great moisturizer for dry skin....nourishing.</li>
            <li> I love that is 70% organic, natural and cruelty free! .Plus</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer to use all year around and safe for everyday</li>
            <li> It smells great and it feels like it is actually being absorbed into my skin.  </li>
            <li> My favorite So far love the feel once again</li>
            <li> I am allergic to everything I searched and searched and found OZ Naturals and decided I would try their facial products with great success.  </li>
            <li> I love the Oz naturals products, natural and paraben free!</li>
            <li> I love that this moisturizing &amp;#34;souffle&amp;#34; comes in a nice big tube instead of a tub like some souffle type products do.  </li>
            <li> Speaking of oils, one major things here is that there is really no discernible scent to this lotion which is wonderful - meaning that you can still wear your favorite perfumes and not have it overwhelmed by the lotion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made right here in the USA!  </li>
            <li> When I apply it, my skin soaks it right up!</li>
            <li> I always review products objectively and fairly.</li>
            <li> i love this products so much</li>
            <li> really like this moisturizer, much better that Cetaphil (too medicine-smelling), Aveeno (</li>
            <li> Seriously one of the BEST organic butters I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The next morning my skin still felt nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and can be used on the face as well.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling supple and hydrated without any greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Despite being thicker, it absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer does absorbs quickly and does not leave that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It goes into your skin quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a white lotion has a nice smooth and creamy texture.  </li>
            <li> So, the OZ product is more appropriate for daily,</li>
            <li> I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply to large areas and almost melts into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has the same refreshing quality as the Amino Herbal Hydration mask (which I absolutely love) when it is applied and melts right into my skin.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes, gives skin a healthy glow and can be used pretty much anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li> I recently tested and reviewed the OZ Naturals Sweet Almond &amp; Macadamia Body Butter and to be honest with you</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent and didn&#x27;t really notice it too much.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer is smooth and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals has become my go to brand for body and facial products and their products are not only amazing, they are amazing for you.  </li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about buying this product do not be it is well worth the price and does wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> I loved that it had Aloe vera, green tea, jojoba, and shea butter, which are all fantastic ingredients</li>
            <li> More or less true: no perfume smell for sure but a &amp;#34;no smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly too.</li>
            <li> moisturizer goes on easily, with no scent (my strong preference, and a big plus for the OZ products).</li>
            <li> If you look at OZ NTURALS line of products you will find just the right product for your needs.</li>
            <li> Another positive is that it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, just moisturizing!</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly, while leaving my skin so silky soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super luxurious but at an affordable price so that you can slather your whole body with this and not worry about breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Very mild and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application to the skin goes in nice and easy and definitely leaves a slinky, silky finish that holds up for a couple of hours provided you are indoors and not engaged in physical exertion.</li>
            <li> Also  it really makes my tattoos pop!</li>
            <li> My entire family fell in love with this souffl&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li> It can also be used for a facial moisturizer which I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> soo soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This body butter absorb into my skin smoothly, leaving my skin soft and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This product is a non-greasy formula and leaves your skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Nice moisture, not much of fragrance,</li>
            <li> As with all of the Oz Natural products I use this body cream because it is free of toxins and the majority of the ingredients are organic.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more to keep the compliments coming...</li>
            <li> but I felt the difference after the first time using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer I put it on after my shower and the next day</li>
            <li> Overall, if it weren&#x27;t for the smell, Id probably use it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> WAY TOO DRYING FOR MATURE SKIN!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish it was warm enough to wear sandals because my feet are so soft!</li>
            <li> with all the Oz Naturals, I appreciate that it is 70% organic, contains healthy ingredients, and that a little goes a long way, making it a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just received this amazing moisturizer the other day...</li>
            <li> I have been moving away from beauty products that are chemical laden with parbens and other nasties and am happy that this works so well and is natural and has a high amount of organic ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> entire line thus far has been amazing in products,customer service, and shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also love using this as a whole body moisturizer (yep, even my face); cotton pj&#x27;s and the same thing -</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that I could use it on my entire body and even be used as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is by far one of the better moisturizers I have used thus far.  </li>
            <li> Between the sun and the chlorine (not to mention aging skin with too much sun exposure decades ago), my skin is pretty thirsty when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s thick enough to provide a good amount of moisture without a greasy feeling after.</li>
            <li> After I use up my other facial moisturizer I will continue to buy this for my face and body, one mositurizer for the entire body, how great is that!  </li>
            <li> The tube is quite large so you get a good quantity of product to last a long time.</li>
            <li> probably because it&#x27;s natural ingredients but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I use this formula on both my children and I, great for those really rough and dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> I have always been a huge fan of Oz Naturals product for several reasons.</li>
            <li> This Body moisturizer is a whipped souffle is a milk while color and has such a buttery smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> You will not need much to moisturize since it is a whipped consistency.</li>
            <li> No matter how much you use, you will never have a sticky feeling on your hands.</li>
            <li> I expected better for the price.  </li>
            <li> but it actually applies so smoothly -</li>
            <li> - they work very well together.</li>
            <li> That said, I highly recommend this lotion to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is a gentle moisturizer that works.</li>
            <li> This product is very moisturizing and nourishing</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> If you are putting it on your skin it is absorbing into your body.</li>
            <li> really isn’t noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have smell to it at all</li>
            <li> Moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> I really like it has Shea Butter, olive oils to soften my skin.  </li>
            <li> You can use it on your whole body.</li>
            <li> cuz I go barefoot so much during the summer and tend to have scruffy feet.  </li>
            <li> And it can be used on my face which I really like if I am in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time for the whole routine.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy, so it absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> It really enhances the skin and refreshes it.</li>
            <li> I only use all natural products and cruelty free!  </li>
            <li> I think that once you try a natural organic product you will not be able to stand the feel of any of the commercial creams.</li>
            <li> Goes on thick but can be applied very easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> only have to use it once per day which is surprising as with my other body lotions</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how FDA regulations allow this kind of nebulous description, especially in the primary ingredient.</li>
            <li> I love it just like all my other OZ Naturals products.</li>
            <li> love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, is thick and nourishing and that it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> This is the third OZ Natural product I have tried and so far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I am sure in a few weeks use, my skin will really take notice.  </li>
            <li> This absorbs so quick but definitely hydrates.</li>
            <li> If I were pregnant or even of child-bearing age, I might further investigate, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients differs, but the two are so similar that I believe it is more of a marketing angle than it is really different</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to help maintain moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a body lotion that has no smell like so more other moisturizer and dries with no greasy feeling, leaving your skin soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It is not irritating, even in sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this tube I won&#x27;t have to replace it as soon as normal.</li>
            <li> but I will be heading on over to the seller to purchase a few more bottles so that I do not run out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can watch it soften rough spots (like actinic keratoses), smooth out the skin on and above the feet where moisture is a challenge, and using it on a routine basis it erase fine lines and wrinkles because it plumps the moisture back into your skin.</li>
            <li> If you have ever tried to open a door, answer your touch screen cell phone, or put on your clothes right away after applying other brands of body cream, you will really appreciate that this leaves no greasy residue on the top of your skin - my skin is left soft and dewy without being oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This light moisturizer has a relatively neutral fragrance that smells fresh and slightly herbal.  </li>
            <li> see that, while the ingredient comes with a warning, it is a mild warning, with a caveat of there being limited data.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and none of the OZ Naturals products</li>
            <li> It smooths the skin, leaves it very very soft.</li>
            <li> It made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft and alluring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a true body butter or lotion that does it job very well and is long lasting, received this as a sample for review.</li>
            <li> I am willingly to purchase this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> look, texture, thickness, smell, and absorption in the two lotions are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t watered down like some cheap lotion.  </li>
            <li> The Olive and Jojoba oil lotion felt silky smooth and it was soothing to my red burning and cracked dry skin.</li>
            <li> Better than Bliss which is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Boy was I surprised, after about a week of using this</li>
            <li> I bought the lotion for the natural content aspect</li>
            <li> It blends into the skin so softly.</li>
            <li> My skin was baby soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> but it is a vital part of self care no matter what your age.</li>
            <li> I personally like Oz Naturals products because of quality and reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s near the bottom.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and don&#x27;t snag the sheets when I&#x27;m getting into or out of bed</li>
            <li> an makes me skin feel SO soft.</li>
            <li> but I personally think it&#x27;s too much for my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for natural products that work.</li>
            <li> Works on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> too greasy).&lt;br /&gt;So far, this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This didn’t both my sensitive skin as well.  </li>
            <li> I like how soft your skin feels after application.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt smoother and is so soft, my husband cannot stop rubbing my legs.  </li>
            <li> I definitely used too much.  </li>
            <li> Like all OZ Naturals products; this is organic and all natural.</li>
            <li> you wake up so soft.</li>
            <li> I apply this directly after a shower as well carry it with me in my diaper bag while out and about.</li>
            <li> It kept my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This body moisturizer is a fabulous, cruelty- free product that goes on without a greasy, thick feeling, unlike other soufflé-type skin creams I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Hours later, my skin still feels smooth but a tiny bit dry.</li>
            <li> This particular moisturizer they call a &#x60;whipped souffl&amp;eacute;&#x27; and when you actually try it you&#x27;ll understand why.</li>
            <li> It soaks into your skin like no other, and leaves it so soft and silky, Not sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> When applied it melts right into my skin unlike other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Which is a major plus!</li>
            <li> dries quickly, non-greasy, with no significant scent,</li>
            <li> This is a very large tube and will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so dry and flaky my husband always comments that I really need lotion.  </li>
            <li> , this is VERY moisturizing, it is so creamy, and rich, and thick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed this product line and now one other listing the first ingredient as \\&quot;Organic Herbal Infusion.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing to do is to slather my feet with this (after a pedi soak); put on a pair of thick comfy cotton socks; and go to bed!</li>
            <li> Many creams are too thick or heavy for the summer months, this one isn&#x27;t at all, it feels very moisturizing and soft.</li>
            <li> Any extra moisturizer I can get right now due to the winter months is bonus.</li>
            <li> Another solid product from OZ natural.</li>
            <li> I tend to have sensitive skin and found Oz Naturals products and have never left after discovering their brand.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals sent this to me for review, and after using it for the past few months, I&#x27;m LOVING it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, even if you don&#x27;t have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a mild combination of organic aloe vera, green tea, shea butter and B5 in an olive and jojoba oil substrate that smoothes on like silk, penetrates deeply and refreshes the epidermis immediately and the dermis (below it) gradually.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not overwhelming at all!</li>
            <li> After using this product daily for a week, my husband actually complimented me on how soft my skin felt!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much and I recommend you start with very small dollops and seeing how far they go on your particular skin.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product and all I can say is that it left my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> so you are not left with a greasy feeling only that of hydrated and soft skin.</li>
            <li> I knocked down this product to four stars because not only was the box pretty damaged</li>
            <li> It says for dry skin types but my facial skin is normal, I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The first few times using it</li>
            <li> It really suits me and calms down my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin from drying out and lasts much longer than other lotions I have used!</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like super thick creams on a daily basis, so</li>
            <li> While this moisturizer is to thick for me to use as a daily everyday moisturizer, it is handy to have when I need a deep moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as well as all their other products.</li>
            <li> This cream is nice an thick and a little goes a long way on me.  </li>
            <li> , I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful what I use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and smooth</li>
            <li> I love the faint scent and it feels so silky smooth rather than some other thick and greasy lotions.</li>
            <li> The other day i went to the pool and could not seem to get my skin soft again.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks now on mainly on my feet.</li>
            <li> I spend A LOT of time outside in the sun leaving my skin dry and damage.</li>
            <li> It also can depress the central nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea.\\</li>
            <li> My skin is a little sensitive</li>
            <li> this stuff goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I would use them morning and at night and a little&lt;br /&gt;bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It went on thick and dried quickly.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about scratching my husband with my dry feet at night when cuddling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Must be working because i have not had any itchy or dry skin at all since using.  </li>
            <li> I use lotions and cream on my hands all day to help with dry hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It soothes and improves the texture and appearance of dry, flaky skin immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and usually get irritation from moisturizers.</li>
            <li> For example, a lot of people have dry, cracked feet (I do!)</li>
            <li> i noticed my skin tone/texture has evened out, and my skin is a lot less oilier overall.</li>
            <li> (237 ml) tube should last a long time if used mostly on trouble spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> (I have very dry skin, though.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> 40 with a very dry skin</li>
            <li> this is my go to moisturizer when I go through those times where my skin gets very dry, gets patches of dryness, or it has taken a beating from the sun</li>
            <li> It also left me a little greasy.</li>
            <li> skin gets very dry and itchy in winter and it took only a few applications to start to see the difference</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about trying a body moisturizer, my skin is oily-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t jump out one way or another in comparison to all the other competition  out there.  </li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s extremely</li>
            <li> it on my arms as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown out all my other body lotions and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> (I received this and other OZ Naturals products in order to provide a review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 70% organic, well, what about the 30% other ingredients?</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I think it is hard getting a lotion online without smelling it especially</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that I feel it&#x27;s rather pricey.  </li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Average.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just something icky about dipping your fingers repeatedly into a beauty product (personal pet peeve) --</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as a body butter but thicker than your regular lotions.</li>
            <li> It also provides a wide range of fatty acids.  </li>
            <li> I have used other shea butter lotions before but this one takes the cake!</li>
            <li> so I can apply other lotions over it!</li>
            <li> I also typically check the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s \\&quot;Skin Deep\\&quot; database.</li>
            <li> Granted, there are probably some products that receive a less potentially-hazardous rating (and you can check the database), but I&#x27;m not too worried about this.  </li>
            <li> However, this time I opened one that was considered &amp;#34;open box&amp;#34; and got a slight discount.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been really dry lately</li>
            <li> I cannot say a single negative thing about this brand or their products.</li>
            <li> I live in a very cold dry climate and suffer from severely dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itsself is organic olive, jojoba oils, aloe vera, green tea and shea butter.</li>
            <li> The product is made with organic Aloe Vera, organic green tea, as well as Shea butter and vitamin b5.</li>
            <li> I use this body butter when I get out of the shower and on my hands after I wash them and my skin is moisturized, it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume and it is not greasy or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> you only feel the softness it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> oil, PAcrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, (2s)-2-amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid, Butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), Olea europaea (olive) oil, organic Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) oil, panthenol (vitamin B5), phenoxyethanol, ethylhexyl glycerin, xanthan gum, allantoin, organic Camellia sinensis (green tea),</li>
            <li> I am used to getting small tubes.</li>
            <li> Skin care with quality products is essential, not just to satisfy our youth obsessed culture</li>
            <li> I do think this is a bit expensive at its current price of 26.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin had a really bad reaction to this</li>
            <li> at least none</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to be a thick cream</li>
            <li> I recently tried hormone replacement cream from a compounding pharmacy and the base that they put the hormones in was some kind of nasty chemically cream that made me feel like I had a layer of grease on me all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> admit I have tried some very expensive products of a similar intent and none could exceed this much less expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;One caveat I would offer is</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m seriously blown away at how well it works.</li>
            <li> but I hated the smell so much</li>
            <li> and I was shocked that they were all in the same product.</li>
            <li> Which very hard to find in body/skincare</li>
            <li> I have tried countless lotions and creams and the majority have failed in helping at all and the rest just give me a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> It leaves no slippery or oily residue behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is lighter in texture than the Oz Naturals Body Butter, which I am relying on heavily during these cold winter months, but I know that this will be my go to body moisturizer in warmer months.</li>
            <li> The scent is definitely weird...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Moisturizing Souffle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely addicted!</li>
            <li> The OZ naturals Body Moisturizer helps to heal and soothe my sad summer skin!</li>
            <li> When I looked at the Amazon description, I didn&#x27;t see the bad ingredient listed, but this chemical \\&quot;Phenoxyethanol\\&quot; is listed on plastic tube and box.  </li>
            <li> All of that adds up and you end up sick.</li>
            <li> I hate leaving greasy prints on my phone screen.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about trying a body moisturizer, my skin is oily- why would I need this product after all? Boy was I surprised, after about a week of using this i noticed my skin tone/texture has evened out, and my skin is a lot less oilier overall. I recommend this product to anyone who has combination dry-oily skin as it has worked wonders for me. Also  it really makes my tattoos pop!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Body Moisturizer! It leaves the body so smooth and silky. My entire family fell in love with this souffl&amp;eacute;. This is my signature go to body moisturizer. I suggest that you add this to your staple products!</li>
            <li> This Body moisturizer is a whipped souffle is a milk while color and has such a buttery smooth consistency. It absorbs very quickly, while leaving my skin so silky soft. You will not need much to moisturize since it is a whipped consistency. I use about a nickle sized amount per leg. I also love that there is no scent. No matter how much you use, you will never have a sticky feeling on your hands. If you are looking for a body moisturizer that will not compete with a scent you are already wearing and enjoy a light application then I think you will enjoy this moisturizer. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts, opinions or experience.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a huge tube. I am used to getting small tubes. They always seem to run out faster. With this tube I won&#x27;t have to replace it as soon as normal. The moisturizer is smooth and very hydrating. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! I have been using it on my neck and face. Then when I am done applying it I rub it the rest of the way on my hands. Any extra moisturizer I can get right now due to the winter months is bonus. It is not greasy at all. It is a thicker consistency so it doesn&#x27;t just sit there or just evaporate into the skin. You still feel it after it being on a while.</li>
            <li> Used this product after my shower, and felt the smooth texture penetrate and hold the moisture in.  The next morning my skin still felt nice and smooth.  I am sure in a few weeks use, my skin will really take notice.  I have been using &amp;#34;beauty salon&#x27; products and so far I have been happy with OZ Naturals at a lower price than what I have been spending.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer for dry skin....nourishing. It soaks in quickly and can be used on the face as well. If  I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> Another great product from OZ naturals that I was able to review. Again, winter time I have dry skin, so this worked great! You can never have enough moisturizers during the winter time! Please, go buy this from the Wizard!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have psoriasis and it works so well to moisturize.  Only complaint I have is that I feel it&#x27;s rather pricey.  I have very sensitive skin and none of the OZ Naturals products have caused any reactions.</li>
            <li> This light fragrance free moisturizer is wonderful! It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling supple and hydrated without any greasy residue. I love that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume.</li>
            <li> Wonderful body and FACE moisturizer.  This is the third OZ Natural product I have tried and so far my favorite.  This is a body lotion that has no smell like so more other moisturizer and dries with no greasy feeling, leaving your skin soft and hydrated.  It can also be used for a facial moisturizer which I absolutely love.  It says for dry skin types but my facial skin is normal, I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s.  I use it once a day on body and morning and evening on face.  After I use up my other facial moisturizer I will continue to buy this for my face and body, one mositurizer for the entire body, how great is that!  It&#x27;s made in the USA, 70% organic and animal cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I expected better for the price.  The scent is definitely weird...almost like a food smell.  It also left me a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought the lotion for the natural content aspect but I don&#x27;t totally LOVE it.  It&#x27;s OK.  It doesn&#x27;t jump out one way or another in comparison to all the other competition  out there.  Not really worth the money.  Just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!! I&#x27;ve used many of the OZ Naturals products and I&#x27;ve liked them all. But this one, this one is the best one yet! It comes out of the tube looking like a it&#x27;s going to be a thick cream but it actually applies so smoothly - it&#x27;s not to heavy/thick or too runny/thin. Many creams are too thick or heavy for the summer months, this one isn&#x27;t at all, it feels very moisturizing and soft. It blends into the skin so softly. I love that it&#x27;s made with oil &amp; jojoba oils - they work very well together. Speaking of oils, one major things here is that there is really no discernible scent to this lotion which is wonderful - meaning that you can still wear your favorite perfumes and not have it overwhelmed by the lotion. If anything it may help as a nice mix to keep the scent hang on longer, I feel that it has for me, anyway. Another positive is that it doesn&#x27;t feel oily, just moisturizing! This is a very large tube and will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*As a blogger/reviewer, I sometimes get the opportunity to buy products at a reduced cost to try &amp; to share my opinions. I am in no way indebted to give a top review. If I don&#x27;t think that the product is up to the claims made by the seller, I will say so. I always review products objectively and fairly. That said, I highly recommend this lotion to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have to say this lotion is the best on dry summer skin. The other day i went to the pool and could not seem to get my skin soft again. I have lots of lotions and oils and they didn&#x27;t seem to be doing a  good job. I put this on and instantly felt it work. My skin was baby soft and glowy. The lotion itsself is organic olive, jojoba oils, aloe vera, green tea and shea butter. They do not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates, and is safe for all skin types. I love putting a great product made in the USA product on my skin. I got this product to review and its one of my favorite lotions.</li>
            <li> Skin care with quality products is essential, not just to satisfy our youth obsessed culture (your reviewer is 65) but it is a vital part of self care no matter what your age. I found this product to be exactly as advertised. It moisturizes, gives skin a healthy glow and can be used pretty much anywhere on the body. I personally like Oz Naturals products because of quality and reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I admit I have tried some very expensive products of a similar intent and none could exceed this much less expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;One caveat I would offer is this stuff goes a LONG way. You don&#x27;t need much and I recommend you start with very small dollops and seeing how far they go on your particular skin. This product is a great bargain, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> There is an unsafe ingredient listed on the plastic tube and box: \\&quot;Phenoxyethanol\\&quot;. The FDA has posted on their website \\&quot;Phenoxyethanol is a preservative that is primarily used in cosmetics and medications.  It also can depress the central nervous system and may cause vomiting and diarrhea.\\&quot;  SOURCES: Ruth Winter, M.S. - A Consumer Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients, 6th Ed. and Environmental Working Group&#x27;s SKIN DEEP Cosmetic Database: [...]    I am returning this item.  Ladies, before you buy, please look at the ingredients on the plastic tube and box. When I looked at the Amazon description, I didn&#x27;t see the bad ingredient listed, but this chemical \\&quot;Phenoxyethanol\\&quot; is listed on plastic tube and box.  It&#x27;s near the bottom.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It keeps my skin from drying out and lasts much longer than other lotions I have used!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer along with the body butter for about a week.  I am really enjoying the smooth consistency of this lotion.  It goes on smooth and is non-greasy.  I like that there is no fragrance so I can use my perfumes.  My skin is feeling more hydrated and smoother.  This is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is a great everyday moisturizer. I have been using it in the mornings and it leaves my skin noticeably softer and moisturized. I have sensitive skin and usually get irritation from moisturizers. This is a gentle moisturizer that works. Despite being thicker, it absorbs into the skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This product does absorb into the skin. It smooths the skin, leaves it very very soft. For example, a lot of people have dry, cracked feet (I do!) and my husband will rub this on my feet and let me tell you, it smooths my feet. They are so soft and don&#x27;t snag the sheets when I&#x27;m getting into or out of bed and I don&#x27;t have to worry about scratching my husband with my dry feet at night when cuddling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a true body butter or lotion that does it job very well and is long lasting, received this as a sample for review.</li>
            <li> WAY TOO DRYING FOR MATURE SKIN!!!!</li>
            <li> soo soft and smooth. I love the smell and texture. My skin felt wonderful. Glad I tried :)</li>
            <li> My skin has been really dry lately and I thought I would check this moisturizer out to see if it would help out.  After using this product for a couple of days, the dryness has gone away.  I was amazed at how well it worked and would definitely  recommend it as a moisturizer.  I caught my family members using it as well.  It has a very light scent and didn&#x27;t really notice it too much.  I love that it is all natural and that makes me feel good when using it.  I did receive a complimentary tube of this product in order to write my honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product and all I can say is that it left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I am willingly to purchase this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer from OZ Naturals is a godsend! I spend A LOT of time outside in the sun leaving my skin dry and damage. The OZ naturals Body Moisturizer helps to heal and soothe my sad summer skin! When applied it melts right into my skin unlike other moisturizers.It leaves no slippery or oily residue behind. Which is a major plus! I love that is 70% organic, natural and cruelty free! .Plus it&#x27;s made right here in the USA!  Seriously one of the BEST organic butters I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a whipped texture an makes me skin feel SO soft. Also I have to mention the nice pleasant scent!! It&#x27;s light and not overwhelming at all! I recommend this product and can&#x27;t wait to try more from OZ Naturals!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. It has a great smell and a wonderful feel on the skin. I used tonight to give the honey a pedicure and used it on my face as a moister product. I absolutely love it. I did get this discounted for a review but I will be heading on over to the seller to purchase a few more bottles so that I do not run out. This is a amazing product...I usually am funny about things that I put on my skin but the olive and jojoba oils are perfect for my skin type and allow it to penetrate my skin. If you are on the fence about buying this product do not be it is well worth the price and does wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s thick enough to provide a good amount of moisture without a greasy feeling after. I did try on my face but I personally think it&#x27;s too much for my face.. I like very light moisturizers for my face since I tend to breakout in acne. I love the ingredients.. the smell is ok.. probably because it&#x27;s natural ingredients but not unpleasant. I&#x27;d like to try something else in there line.. I&#x27;m always looking for natural products that work. I&#x27;d probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is very moisturizing and nourishing but I hated the smell so much I couldn&#x27;t keep it on. It has a very strong olive oil smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a reduced price in order to review it. I do not endorse or promote products I wouldn&#x27;t personally recommend to my friends or family.</li>
            <li> I have used other shea butter lotions before but this one takes the cake! Better than Bliss which is hard to beat. I also love that it is almost all organic, cruelty-free, and vegan! Love all of my Oz Naturals products and I feel good about using them too.</li>
            <li> Good quality moisturizer.  Goes on thick but can be applied very easily and absorbs quickly.  Must be working because i have not had any itchy or dry skin at all since using.  Another solid product from OZ natural.</li>
            <li> This body butter absorb into my skin smoothly, leaving my skin soft and moisturizing. I used this for a few weeks now on mainly on my feet. Its not greasy or oily.  its unscented which in nice.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works wonderfully. When I apply it, my skin soaks it right up! OZ Naturals sent this to me for review, and after using it for the past few months, I&#x27;m LOVING it. I especially love to use it on my elbows and hands, where I get the driest. Good quality product!</li>
            <li> okay - not the best I have had.  Average.</li>
            <li> This is a great body moisturizer. It&#x27;s 70% organic and has great ingredients that help hydrate your skin. It&#x27;s very creamy and great for massages. I use lotions and cream on my hands all day to help with dry hands and cuticles. Most creams leave a greasy feeling. This moisturizer does absorbs quickly and does not leave that greasy feeling. So you will not have any problems doing things like opening doors and leaving grease prints. I hate leaving greasy prints on my phone screen. This absorbs so quick but definitely hydrates. It comes in a huge tube, 8 fl oz. I would love to get a trial size of this to put in my purse. This is an excellent moisturizer. It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and soft. I would highly recommend this to help maintain moisture in your skin. I love that it&#x27;s vegan and cruelty free. It&#x27;s also made in the USA. It does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is great for all skin types. I love this moisturizer and guarantee that you will to! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Moisturizing Souffle. I received this product to test in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I loved the way this creamy soufflé went on my skin. I love the smell and it hugs my skin. My husband also uses it and he is very happy with the results. I love there products. I love these products.</li>
            <li> I have always been a huge fan of Oz Naturals product for several reasons. They make quality products that are safe to use on all skin types, CRUELTY FREE and affordable.  I tend to have sensitive skin and found Oz Naturals products and have never left after discovering their brand. This is a great moisturizer to use all year around and safe for everyday uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits/ Facts about this Body Moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;CRUELTY FREE&lt;br /&gt;Safe for all skin types&lt;br /&gt;Quickly absorbs into the skin without leaving visible particles behind&lt;br /&gt;No alcohol, parabens, or sulfates&lt;br /&gt;Quickly absorbs and does not leave your skin sticky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I did receive a complimentary tube of this product in order to write my honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li> I love OZ Naturals Olive &amp; Jojoba oil nourishing souffl&amp;eacute; lotion. The product is made with organic Aloe Vera, organic green tea, as well as Shea butter and vitamin b5. Their products are made in the USA and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;• This product is a non-greasy formula and leaves your skin soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;• The lotion is very light and absorbs into your skin quickly&lt;br /&gt;• Works on sensitive skin, I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful what I use but this product was great.&lt;br /&gt;• This product has a very light to no scent at all, which is nice for people that are sensitive to smells.&lt;br /&gt;• I use this formula on both my children and I, great for those really rough and dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;• This product is 70% organic and doesn’t contain any alcohol, parabens, or sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing product labeled as a &#x27;body souffle&#x27; is a nice and effective long term daily/nightly body cream that effectively seals in moisture (best used immediately after a shower/bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application to the skin goes in nice and easy and definitely leaves a slinky, silky finish that holds up for a couple of hours provided you are indoors and not engaged in physical exertion. Skin absorption is quick and effective and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue which is very much appreciated if applying to your hands and fingers. The product doesn&#x27;t carry much of an odor and if applied to dried out portions of your skin the beneficial results are noticeable within minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice moisturizing product through and through (product sample was provided for review).</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer several times now and I can attest that it is a quality product. It smells great and it feels like it is actually being absorbed into my skin.  I have very dry skin and this product feels great on my hands, arms, and legs.  It isn&#x27;t greasy but it isn&#x27;t watered down like some cheap lotion.  I will continue to use this moisturizer and love what they have come up with.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is so hydrating! Nongreasy and unisex. It&#x27;s not as thick as a body butter but thicker than your regular lotions. It goes into your skin quickly. All skin types can use this and no ingredients that will cause breakouts.  I only use all natural products and cruelty free!  Which very hard to find in body/skincare or it&#x27;s extremely expensive!&lt;br /&gt;This entire line thus far has been amazing in products,customer service, and shipping!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a discount to give my honest thoughts on the product.</li>
            <li> My favorite So far love the feel once again the softness is wonderful Oz naturals is on point with there products</li>
            <li> i love this products so much it&#x27;s make my skin smooth i feel great</li>
            <li> I love this Souffle! It smells amazing and I love how it soaks in quickly. No greasy feeling and I don&#x27;t have to constantly reapply it! I will purchase this in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Nice moisture, not much of fragrance, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this body moisturizer with a discount, and am writing my review.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this moisturizer, much better that Cetaphil (too medicine-smelling), Aveeno (too greasy).&lt;br /&gt;So far, this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly, non-greasy, with no significant scent, at least none that&#x27;s overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;I can put on perfume easily.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great!</li>
            <li> I have the driest skin ever!  I look looks so dry and flaky my husband always comments that I really need lotion.  I am allergic to everything I searched and searched and found OZ Naturals and decided I would try their facial products with great success.  I decided I would try one more product, and glad I did.  I can feel the difference, I love it.  I am using it and since it does not make me itch.  My husband noticed and that was he big test.  I am very pleased. I was given this product to use for a fair review</li>
            <li> As with all of the Oz Natural products I use this body cream because it is free of toxins and the majority of the ingredients are organic. If you are putting it on your skin it is absorbing into your body. Why eat a clean healthy diet and then slather yourself in chemicals and toxins? All of that adds up and you end up sick. I use this body butter when I get out of the shower and on my hands after I wash them and my skin is moisturized, it doesn&#x27;t smell like perfume and it is not greasy or heavy feeling. I recently tried hormone replacement cream from a compounding pharmacy and the base that they put the hormones in was some kind of nasty chemically cream that made me feel like I had a layer of grease on me all day. I think that once you try a natural organic product you will not be able to stand the feel of any of the commercial creams. Plus you will have softer healthier skin!</li>
            <li> This body moisturizer has a light pleasant lotion-y smell in the tube that isn’t an overpowering fragrance that once rubbed into the skin really isn’t noticeable.  This is a white lotion has a nice smooth and creamy texture.  The cream is not greasy and absorbs into my skin quickly and does a good job at making my skin feel softer.  This didn’t both my sensitive skin as well.  I do think this is a bit expensive at its current price of 26.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome souffle which I mainly used on my legs. It went on thick and dried quickly. I like how soft your skin feels after application. I love that it is organic!</li>
            <li> Oz naturals products are AMAZING and this is one of my favorites.  I was lucky enough to receive this moisturizer to test and its wonderful.  My skin has never felt smoother and is so soft, my husband cannot stop rubbing my legs.  OZ Naturals has become my go to brand for body and facial products and their products are not only amazing, they are amazing for you.  No nasty chemicals, organic ingredients and vegan friendly, which is highly important to me.  I cannot say a single negative thing about this brand or their products.</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a lotion lover, I put moisturizers on every morning and night! I think it is hard getting a lotion online without smelling it especially but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this moisturizer. I love the faint scent and it feels so silky smooth rather than some other thick and greasy lotions. This is my go to moisturizer and I will be getting more. I love the Oz naturals products, natural and paraben free! Oh and I never had any lotions with jojoba and I&#x27;m completely addicted!</li>
            <li> This Body Moisturizer is another winner from Oz Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lighter in texture than the Oz Naturals Body Butter, which I am relying on heavily during these cold winter months, but I know that this will be my go to body moisturizer in warmer months. It has the same refreshing quality as the Amino Herbal Hydration mask (which I absolutely love) when it is applied and melts right into my skin. If you have ever tried to open a door, answer your touch screen cell phone, or put on your clothes right away after applying other brands of body cream, you will really appreciate that this leaves no greasy residue on the top of your skin - my skin is left soft and dewy without being oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that it can be used on your body and face - if I am in a big hurry, I step out of the shower and use this head to toe or if I&#x27;m doing an occasional short over night stay somewhere, I just carry this instead of all my difference moisturizers and serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all the Oz Naturals, I appreciate that it is 70% organic, contains healthy ingredients, and that a little goes a long way, making it a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a complimentary tube of this product in order to write my honest opinion about it.</li>
            <li> This body moisturizer is a fabulous, cruelty- free product that goes on without a greasy, thick feeling, unlike other soufflé-type skin creams I&#x27;ve tried.  After using this product daily for a week, my husband actually complimented me on how soft my skin felt! I will definitely be buying more to keep the compliments coming...</li>
            <li> Oz Naturals body moisturizer is awesome and everything you want and wish for in a body moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;My skin gets very dry and itchy in winter and it took only a few applications to start to see the difference but I felt the difference after the first time using it.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, is thick and nourishing and that it absorbs quickly so you are not left with a greasy feeling only that of hydrated and soft skin. I have been moving away from beauty products that are chemical laden with parbens and other nasties and am happy that this works so well and is natural and has a high amount of organic ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;I only have to use it once per day which is surprising as with my other body lotions I would use them morning and at night and a little&lt;br /&gt;bit goes a long way.  The first few times using it I definitely used too much.  What I thought I would use just on my hands ended up with me&lt;br /&gt;using it on my arms as well.&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown out all my other body lotions and will be buying again. I am a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Totally in love this stuff! I love the silky feel it gives my skin and my husband loves the way my legs feel after I put this on!!!</li>
            <li> (I received this and other OZ Naturals products in order to provide a review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product provides a much-needed addition to my post-swim moisturizing. Between the sun and the chlorine (not to mention aging skin with too much sun exposure decades ago), my skin is pretty thirsty when I&#x27;m done. The pool provides lotion, but the ingredients read like a shopping list for a chemistry lab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer goes on easily, with no scent (my strong preference, and a big plus for the OZ products). It is not greasy. I can get dressed without getting the cream smeared all over my clothes. Hours later, my skin still feels smooth but a tiny bit dry. (I have very dry skin, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does seem a bit pricy, at $24.99, but I haven&#x27;t done a thorough job of comparison-shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Vitamin E cream, [[ASIN:B0018ODYOQ Now Foods - Vitamin E Cream 28,000 IU 4 oz.]]but I don&#x27;t want to overdo it on the Vitamin E. So, the OZ product is more appropriate for daily, all-over use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One concern: I&#x27;ve noticed this product line and now one other listing the first ingredient as \\&quot;Organic Herbal Infusion.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m not sure how FDA regulations allow this kind of nebulous description, especially in the primary ingredient. I suspect it&#x27;s water that&#x27;s been steeped in herbs. Which herbs? What kind of water (distilled? tap?). We don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the ingredients seem fine to me. Another reviewer raised a concern about Phenoxyethanol, the last ingredient. I also typically check the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s \\&quot;Skin Deep\\&quot; database. http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ingredient/704811/PHENOXYETHANOL/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that, while the ingredient comes with a warning, it is a mild warning, with a caveat of there being limited data. Granted, there are probably some products that receive a less potentially-hazardous rating (and you can check the database), but I&#x27;m not too worried about this.  If I were pregnant or even of child-bearing age, I might further investigate, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two of the best features of these OZ products are that they are scent-free and each tube is a different bright color. That makes them easy to distinguish at the pool shower, when I&#x27;m not wearing my glasses.the best features of these OZ products are that they are scent-free and each tube is a different bright color.

            <li> I - like I&#x27;m sure all of us OZ Naturals lovers - couldn&#x27;t wait for them to come out with a body moisturizer. Like all OZ Naturals products; this is organic and all natural. The consistency is like whipped butter; and it literally gets &amp;#34;sucked&amp;#34; into your skin. It&#x27;s super luxurious but at an affordable price so that you can slather your whole body with this and not worry about breaking the bank. The fact that it had no scent threw me at first as I am used to scented lotions; but the richness and quick absorbency - and no harsh perfumes - make it the perfect blend. My favorite thing to do is to slather my feet with this (after a pedi soak); put on a pair of thick comfy cotton socks; and go to bed! I wish it was warm enough to wear sandals because my feet are so soft! Also love using this as a whole body moisturizer (yep, even my face); cotton pj&#x27;s and the same thing - you wake up so soft. As a side note; this also works great on split ends and fly-aways ... which makes me think OZ Naturals should segue into hair care ..... hint hint</li>
            <li> I recently tested and reviewed the OZ Naturals Sweet Almond &amp; Macadamia Body Butter and to be honest with you I could just copy/paste that review here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;https://www.amazon.com/review/R5DDUS904UAYP/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look, texture, thickness, smell, and absorption in the two lotions are exactly the same. The list of ingredients differs, but the two are so similar that I believe it is more of a marketing angle than it is really different products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would like to point out is that the Sweet Almond &amp; Macadamia Nut lotion has a symbol for Vegan and one for Cruelty Free - this lotion does not have those indicators on the tube. (see photos)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZ Naturals provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> I received this at a great discount to review. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about a week. It doesn&#x27;t really have smell to it at all which is why I gave it 4 stars. It&#x27;s very thick and smooth I think it would work great in the winter. It made my skin very soft. Overall I like this lotion.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin had a really bad reaction to this so I stopped using within days of purchase. Definitely spot-test on your skin if you&#x27;re prone to contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product it&#x27;s very very good to moisturize the whole body and absorved easily</li>
            <li> I just received this amazing moisturizer the other day...As soon as I put it on I was in Love</li>
            <li> Very nice consistency. Smells great. Moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> I agree that this is the best boy moisturizer.  I use it on my legs after I get out of the shower or the tub and then I can wear my work out pants and not be totally embarrassed that my legs are flaky and white.  My legs actually look human after using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated April 10, 2015:  I just ordered another one of these moisturizers.  However, this time I opened one that was considered &amp;#34;open box&amp;#34; and got a slight discount.  I knocked down this product to four stars because not only was the box pretty damaged but the tube was too.  I&#x27;ve taken pictures to show you.  I will order this again but will likely NOT get the &amp;#34;open box&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> This is my 6th Oz product.  I am loving them all.  I really like it has Shea Butter, olive oils to soften my skin.  I love using the moisturizer on my hands.  They felt so silky like satin afterwards.  I use it after shaving  my legs.  They are very smooth.  It&#x27;s also good on your knees and elbows.  You can use it on your whole body. I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> *received for purposes of review*&lt;br /&gt;The OZ line is one of my go to&#x27;s in my home, everything that I have tried is top of the line and is just as perfect as the more expensive brands. This whipped moisturizer is perfect for those winter months, it keeps my skin soft and moisturized. I apply this directly after a shower as well carry it with me in my diaper bag while out and about. I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> 5 star rating because I really love the OZ NATURALS face washes and toner.....I hope one day to try this body moisturizer</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  Clean, seemingly fragrance-free option, and I great appreciate that this is mostly vegan product.  I use both this and the Body Butter together for great, soft skin.</li>
            <li> If you look at OZ NTURALS line of products you will find just the right product for your needs. They make a number of moisturizers - body, eye, face, neck, etc - and they are all excellent. This particular moisturizer they call a &#x60;whipped souffl&amp;eacute;&#x27; and when you actually try it you&#x27;ll understand why. This is a mild combination of organic aloe vera, green tea, shea butter and B5 in an olive and jojoba oil substrate that smoothes on like silk, penetrates deeply and refreshes the epidermis immediately and the dermis (below it) gradually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can watch it soften rough spots (like actinic keratoses), smooth out the skin on and above the feet where moisture is a challenge, and using it on a routine basis it erase fine lines and wrinkles because it plumps the moisture back into your skin. Despite the ingredients the souffl&amp;eacute; is fragrance free - it just makes you feel like you should be airbourne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those concerned with added products that could be carcinogenic, relax. OZ NATURALS are made in the USA in a state of the art FDA registered facility. No worries, no side effects, just luxury. Grady Harp, December 14</li>
            <li> This lotion is fantastic! I love it just like all my other OZ Naturals products. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product in the mail. I live in a very cold dry climate and suffer from severely dry skin and eczema.  I have tried countless lotions and creams and the majority have failed in helping at all and the rest just give me a bad reaction. The Olive and Jojoba oil lotion felt silky smooth and it was soothing to my red burning and cracked dry skin. I had no reaction, it was just great to my skin. I loved that it had Aloe vera, green tea, jojoba, and shea butter, which are all fantastic ingredients and I was shocked that they were all in the same product. I loved the fact that I could use it on my entire body and even be used as a facial moisturizer. It was non-greasy and lightweight. After you apply it you can’t feel it on your skin you only feel the softness it leaves behind. This is a great product from a great company. I have liked all the products I have tried from OZ Naturals and will continue to use them. I would definitely recommend them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was made available for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> 70% organic, well, what about the 30% other ingredients? There is no distinction on the ingredients list between what is organic and what is not.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the cream is supposed no have no smell. More or less true: no perfume smell for sure but a &amp;#34;no smell&amp;#34; smell I&#x27;m not found of but it disappeared very quick after applying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 40 with a very dry skin and this cream isn&#x27;t sufficient for me at all. I&#x27;ll not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love that this moisturizing &amp;#34;souffle&amp;#34; comes in a nice big tube instead of a tub like some souffle type products do.  There&#x27;s just something icky about dipping your fingers repeatedly into a beauty product (personal pet peeve) -- so a nice big flip top tube is perfect.  This cream is nice an thick and a little goes a long way on me.  I generally don&#x27;t like super thick creams on a daily basis, so this is my go to moisturizer when I go through those times where my skin gets very dry, gets patches of dryness, or it has taken a beating from the sun and I&#x27;m feeling a bit like a piece of jerky.  This is a great product to help plump out your skin and leave it soft and healthy looking again.  There&#x27;s no fragrance, so if you have any sort of sensitivities to perfumes, etc., you should be happy with this! Oz Naturals has always made great products - I love that they&#x27;re made in the USA, strive to use as many organic ingredients as possible, and they don&#x27;t test on animals! While this moisturizer is to thick for me to use as a daily everyday moisturizer, it is handy to have when I need a deep moisturizer.  I received this at no cost in order to provide honest feedback.</li>
            <li> As with all O.Z. products, this one is a winner!  I love using it on my feet cuz I go barefoot so much during the summer and tend to have scruffy feet.  No more!  And a little goes a long way.  And it can be used on my face which I really like if I am in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time for the whole routine.  I will purchase again!  This review is given after receiving the product free.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing!! Goes on great and absorbs quickly. I use it as a facial moisturizer (as well as body moisturizer) and my skin feels great. I highly recommend this as well as all their other products. They are all fabulous!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this body moisturizer!! It feels so good on my skin, is non-greasy and it lasts the whole day! I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent so I can apply other lotions over it! Will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this! Wonderful that I can also use it on my face! I will keep buying this for sure! An all in one product that makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer I put it on after my shower and the next day my skin still feels soft and smooth great product  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like an unscented lotion but this stuff rocks</li>
            <li> I love this body butter!  It isn&#x27;t greasy, so it absorbs very well.  It kept my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I love the feel, I love the benefit of this body moisturizer.  It is by far one of the better moisturizers I have used thus far.  I highly recommend it, even if you don&#x27;t have dry skin.  But if you do have, then it&#x27;s even more of a plus.</li>
            <li> What a great moisturizer once again from Oz I had the body butter prior to get this through a promotional offer my review .. It&#x27;s a bit thick so I don&#x27;t use this on my face at all but wonderful for my elbows and silky smooth nicely scented not perfumey at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many moisturizers. My skin was getting to a point where none of them worked. I ordered this and i&#x27;m seriously blown away at how well it works. My skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> This is another great product by OZ naturals. It is a souffle which is apt to call this as its texture is just like it. Very mild and soft to touch. It really enhances the skin and refreshes it. My skin is a little sensitive so i do not prefer many brands but OZ naturals is great for my skin. It really suits me and calms down my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also amazing. Very soft and alluring.&lt;br /&gt;Its got anti aging properties hence making the skin radiant and youthful. It reduces fine lines and makes the skin glow. It also reduces dryness and making skin texture good. I really liked this product a lot. The tube is quite large so you get a good quantity of product to last a long time. I was lucky to receive this under promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change</li>
            <li> This light moisturizer has a relatively neutral fragrance that smells fresh and slightly herbal.  It is white and moderately viscous.  It is easy to apply to large areas and almost melts into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soothes and improves the texture and appearance of dry, flaky skin immediately.  It is not irritating, even in sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blend of oils and other mostly botanical ingredients provides excellent protection against loss of moisture It also provides a wide range of fatty acids.  The palm oil is rich in medium chain triglycerides and protects the skin without making it sticky.  Glycerin is another of my favorites for the skin as it attracts and holds moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The generous 8 oz. (237 ml) tube should last a long time if used mostly on trouble spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Organic herbal infusion, organic Aloe barbadensis (aloe vera), isopropyl palmitate (palm oil), kosher vegetable glycerin, cetyl alcohol, stearic acid, glyceryl stearate, organic Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) oil, PAcrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, (2s)-2-amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid, Butyrospermum parkii (shea butter), Olea europaea (olive) oil, organic Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) oil, panthenol (vitamin B5), phenoxyethanol, ethylhexyl glycerin, xanthan gum, allantoin, organic Camellia sinensis (green tea), citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals provided a tube for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite. I like scented items, and this is not supposed to have a scent, yet to me it does. Kinda reminds me of a nursing home.  Other than that, this is VERY moisturizing, it is so creamy, and rich, and thick! Not runny, or watery like some lotions. It soaks into your skin like no other, and leaves it so soft and silky, Not sticky or greasy. It dries pretty quickly too. So, your not left with oily feeling skin, or your pants sticking to your legs, from it still not being soaked up. Overall, if it weren&#x27;t for the smell, Id probably use it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
