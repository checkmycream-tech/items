            <li>I love using it on sunburns.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m not even sure why this is on sale</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t have much success with making my own (without preservatives they get moldy quickly-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of cupuaçu fruit and cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great for the dry winters here in Arizona.  </li>
            <li>Great for my husband&#x27;s dry farmer&#x27;s hands.  </li>
            <li>Wow, it sure works!</li>
            <li>smells great and it works for my dry skin!</li>
            <li>I have tried many all natural remedies, lotions (hemp lotion, shea lotion, etc), coconut oil, vitamin E oil, etc.</li>
            <li>I apply this lotion right after my shower, and have yet to see any  sign of the redness/dryness on my face return.</li>
            <li>It has a mild scent but is very creamy.</li>
            <li>I have only used it 3 times so far, but can already see how good it is.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had such issue before and have ordered so many items on amazon.</li>
            <li>my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as listed.</li>
            <li>the ingredients are pretty wholesome.</li>
            <li>As for my hands....it&#x27;s still a HUGE relief when I apply this lotion, though I believe skin issues on my hands will probably be a continued source of issues, as my work environment forces me to constantly wash my my hands and use gloves.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>My whole family uses it....</li>
            <li>The whole family started to use his lotion.  </li>
            <li>Like, really picky.  </li>
            <li>I expected better from Burts bees.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s generally much cheaper here than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moderately thick, and moisturizes and feels really good.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick creamy feel.  </li>
            <li>This is not an itchy cream, just a really nice thick creamy lotion.</li>
            <li>This Replenishing formula is better than the other Burts Bees body creams that are out there...and there are a couple of different types too.</li>
            <li>The smell is a soft cocoa &amp; cupuacu butter.  </li>
            <li>old daughter brought it to me after one of her &amp;#34;investigative trips&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days, the dryness was just about completely gone and the redness had vanished.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard about them for years, and thought they were all natural.</li>
            <li>Smell is lovely not strong, and the cream is long lasting.</li>
            <li>The merchant did not pay much attention to my order and it is absolutely not worthed my time to return or exchange this.</li>
            <li>I had a red streak going down the right side of my cheek.</li>
            <li>It does feel a little oily at first but dissipates within 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>perhaps the hot air dried my skin and even burned it a bit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do wish the ingredients list were much shorter, and the fragrance is probably still fake, but it&#x27;s really mild</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a really nice, moisturizing, lotion with a very pleasant scent. I really love Burt&#x27;s Bees as a company and find they alway have great products. I&#x27;ve noticed with the Burt&#x27;s Bees lotions I&#x27;ve tried, that they seem a little watery when you&#x27;re rubbing them in. It does absorb well and isn&#x27;t greasy, so it doesn&#x27;t affect performance at all.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lotion. It has a mild scent but is very creamy. The price was also much better than in many stores as I checked around quite a bit before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even comment on how well this product moisturizes because the smell is so disgusting, bitter and downright funky that I haven&#x27;t been able to keep it on for more than 15 minutes. No perfume will cover it up either.</li>
            <li> Seems to help my razor burn on my bikini area, but I don&#x27;t like it for a all over lotion, sticky.  Smell is nice</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this lotion made my skin feel, but had to discontinue using it as the smell was so overpowering it made me want to gag!</li>
            <li> wonderful body lotion!  It really works.  I have only used it 3 times so far, but can already see how good it is.  Someone online recommended it, and am glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> This is always my go-to body lotion.  It makes your skin SO smooth and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of cupuaçu fruit and cocoa butter. This is a perfect mix!</li>
            <li> Really helps my &amp;#34;summer skin&amp;#34; and smells good too!</li>
            <li> I loved hearing my 5 year old son say that I smelled awesome.</li>
            <li> Smells great and moisturizes well. It does feel a little oily at first but dissipates within 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff!  My whole family uses it....works on regular skin, dry skin, oily skin.  One of my favorite products from Burts!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin. Little goes a long way.  And lasts! I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> smells great and it works for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the picture is deceptive.  You are only buying one item not two.  I&#x27;ll look for a defferent merchant in the future.</li>
            <li> Love it. I do feel like the moisture does last 24 hours, as written on the label. Nice smell too, it&#x27;s mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> My son has eczema so I wanted to try Burt&#x27;s Bee.  It has a nice thick creamy feel.  The smell is a soft cocoa &amp; cupuacu butter.  The whole family started to use his lotion.  Great for the dry winters here in Arizona.  This is not an itchy cream, just a really nice thick creamy lotion.</li>
            <li> I think mine was either fake or expired. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky with lotion.  Like, really picky.  I try to make my own because I don&#x27;t like all the nasty preservatives, chemicals, and disgusting fragrances in most all, even &#x27;natural&#x27; lotions.  But I don&#x27;t have much success with making my own (without preservatives they get moldy quickly- or you&#x27;ve got to keep it in the fridge).  I do wish the ingredients list were much shorter, and the fragrance is probably still fake, but it&#x27;s really mild and I love this lotion.  It&#x27;s moderately thick, and moisturizes and feels really good.  I love using it on sunburns.</li>
            <li> It is disappointing when you receive the wrong product.  I got the Milk and Honey body lotion instead and I did not want this one. The merchant did not pay much attention to my order and it is absolutely not worthed my time to return or exchange this. My advise is to buy this from an actual store instead of online! I haven&#x27;t had such issue before and have ordered so many items on amazon.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin hydrated and doesn&#x27;t irritate psoriasis. I use this every day both morning and night on my arms and legs. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Great for my husband&#x27;s dry farmer&#x27;s hands.  Has a nice scent without being too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> LOVE this cream!  Smell is lovely not strong, and the cream is long lasting.</li>
            <li> For the past several months, I have dealt with extreme itching/dryness/redness on my hands. I work in a jail, and am constantly washing my hands, wearing vinyl gloves, etc.  I have tried many all natural remedies, lotions (hemp lotion, shea lotion, etc), coconut oil, vitamin E oil, etc. with no satisfactory results. I forgot I had a tube of this in my cabinet until my 2 yr. old daughter brought it to me after one of her &amp;#34;investigative trips&amp;#34;. She wanted me to put some on her arms, and I obliged. It was at that moment that I realized my own hands were benefiting as well! So, I decided I would try it on my face too. I had a red streak going down the right side of my cheek. (I could only assume the dryness on my face was in connection with my car heater. I always turned the vents facing my hands and face....perhaps the hot air dried my skin and even burned it a bit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway, I had tried everything to rid myself of this glowing red streak on my cheek, and to no avail. It wasn&#x27;t responding to anything and just when it appeared to fade...it would come back with a vengeance. I felt immediate relief when I applied this to my face. It has a very silky and thick consistency. I did not suffer any breakouts either. Within a couple of  hours, the redness on my face was hardly noticeable. Within 3 days, the dryness was just about completely gone and the redness had vanished. I did make a minor adjustment as well. The vents in the car no longer blow on my face, rather, are positioned towards the legs now. I apply this lotion right after my shower, and have yet to see any  sign of the redness/dryness on my face return. As for my hands....it&#x27;s still a HUGE relief when I apply this lotion, though I believe skin issues on my hands will probably be a continued source of issues, as my work environment forces me to constantly wash my my hands and use gloves. But I can at least say that there is marked improvement. I HIGHLY recommend this lotion. It has brought great relief. I am not a huge fan of the scent, but it is not overpowering and is completely tolerable considering how well it works on dry skin.elief.

            <li> great price, great quality, arrived on time and undamaged!</li>
            <li> it smells good and works well, very nice product</li>
