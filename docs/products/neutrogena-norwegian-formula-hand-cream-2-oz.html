            <li>This hand cream Norwegian formula is the best hand cream I have used.  </li>
            <li>and I have had no reactions and neither has the babe (and his skin reacts to most things).</li>

            <li>This one is the best for dry hands.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry hands in the winter.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion for really dry cuticles!</li>
            <li>Best hand cream available for dry, cracked, winter hands.</li>
            <li>It came very quickly</li>
            <li>I have eczema and need something strong to cope with it.</li>
            <li>With daily use hands stay in great</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and soaks into your skin, even after washing your hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for the perfect hand cream.</li>
            <li>Great for really dry hands.</li>
            <li>A great product and worth every penny if needed for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best hand cream available and for me, the only one which really gives me soft hands.</li>
            <li>Very nice product, small amount goes a long way and the winning nurse loved it.</li>
            <li>and it penetrates the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s new favorite cream to treat her eczema.</li>
            <li>This item was pricey, but well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>The creme is sticky and poorly absorbed which led to its labeling as hand creme.</li>
            <li>Finally I got my order, arrived a day earlier this time,  and as always great product , love it,  thanks guys.</li>
            <li>and I have bought many, many other kinds.  </li>
            <li>She is very sensitive to fragrance and many creams cause her skin to sting, but this one works very well for her.</li>
            <li>Thanks for being there!</li>
            <li>Same outstanding product I&#x27;ve used for 30 years.</li>
            <li>my hands get pretty beat up, and this is my remedy of choice.</li>
            <li>I use this hand cream at bedtime and in the morning my hands are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>A friend who had the same problem confidently recommended the Neutragena hand creme.</li>
            <li>It soaks in so completely you can&#x27;t tell you put lotion on, but your skin feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>Soft, smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>At first we were purchasing this item at a local pharmacy for a dollar or two  more per tube than this.</li>
            <li>My right thumb was always dry and cracked on top.  </li>
            <li>Tried others, however, they do not keep my skin as soft and smooth as this particular cream.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works better on my dry hands than just about anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I immediately start using and hands are back to normal , actually better.  </li>
            <li>After a day gardening without glove, my hands are a mess, but putting this on overnight makes an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>Very moist yet not sticky.</li>
            <li>Mind you, you can always rub it in until it&#x27;s absorbed completely, but that is not a 30 seconds deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Dries relatively fast.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this hand cream, and i had trouble finding it, so once i did, she was thrilled to receive it as part of a home-made basket of holiday gifts this year;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague.</li>
            <li>My hands dry out so easy.</li>
            <li>The tube is only two ounces but its true when it says &amp;#34;only a dab&amp;#34; is needed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Neutrogena Hand Cream.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves</li>
            <li>This goes on a bit thick, kind of has a waxy texture.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I have to get my scissors out when I want to start using a new tube.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned it could be made out of caterpillar brains and platypus poop</li>
            <li>Granted it&#x27;s not a miracle worker but my hands have improved so much since using this on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic hand lotion for trouble hands.</li>
            <li>helps my hand stay soft</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest putting it on at night before going to bed as it does take some time to absorb and in the meantime leaves your hands a bit slick (don&#x27;t try to grasp anything smooth).</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t try to open s new pickle jar, but I don&#x27;t worry about my hands drying out.</li>
            <li>you try this stuff, no other hand cream will ever cut it for you again.  </li>
            <li>This lotion works very well for dry hands!</li>
            <li>At first i was not a fan of  the consistency because it is very different from other lotions and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other hand creams that are very watery and don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a long time and it really helps dry hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it&#x27;s naturally soft condition.</li>
            <li>Soft and moisturized, and yet dry.  </li>
            <li>The cream is very concentrated so a little dab is all you need.  </li>

            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this hand cream, and i had trouble finding it, so once i did, she was thrilled to receive it as part of a home-made basket of holiday gifts this year;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague.</li>
            <li> My hands dry out so easy.</li>
            <li> The tube is only two ounces but its true when it says &amp;#34;only a dab&amp;#34; is needed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Neutrogena Hand Cream.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves</li>
            <li> This goes on a bit thick, kind of has a waxy texture.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have to get my scissors out when I want to start using a new tube.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned it could be made out of caterpillar brains and platypus poop</li>
            <li> Granted it&#x27;s not a miracle worker but my hands have improved so much since using this on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic hand lotion for trouble hands.</li>
            <li> helps my hand stay soft</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin as well</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest putting it on at night before going to bed as it does take some time to absorb and in the meantime leaves your hands a bit slick (don&#x27;t try to grasp anything smooth).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try to open s new pickle jar, but I don&#x27;t worry about my hands drying out.</li>
            <li> you try this stuff, no other hand cream will ever cut it for you again.  </li>
            <li> This lotion works very well for dry hands!</li>
            <li> At first i was not a fan of  the consistency because it is very different from other lotions and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hand creams that are very watery and don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a long time and it really helps dry hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it&#x27;s naturally soft condition.</li>
            <li> Soft and moisturized, and yet dry.  </li>
            <li> The cream is very concentrated so a little dab is all you need.  </li>
            <li> Would it be asking too much to ask the Neutrogena people to add a tiny extra curved cutting blade to their assembly machine so as to smooth off those rough edges at the two corners where the parts of the tube are.  </li>
            <li> I have aging, dry hands and just a tiny amount on them</li>
            <li> but for \\&quot;anywhere your dry skin needs extra help\\&quot; including \\&quot;elbows, knees, face and lips\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Not dry like a corn-husk dry, but dry like baby powder, velvety and polished, almost.  </li>
            <li> I work outside summer and winter and my hands would get very dry and crack in the winter .</li>
            <li> Even my rough, old-lady, crawfish hands feel like a baby&#x27;s back side again!  </li>
            <li> You can slice your skin open if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> I put it on before bed when my hands feel dry</li>
            <li> Dry skin and skin cracks at corner of nails</li>
            <li> Washing your hands makes them dry and the winter is dry too.  </li>
            <li> This is the bestest of the hand creams--and my dry skin has tried a bunch of them.</li>
            <li> The doctor said to soak my hands (or feet) in water, carefully dry and then put the cream on.</li>
            <li> My skin was so dry it was bleeding and flaking.</li>
            <li> and I have not had 1 single crack.  </li>
            <li> First of all, this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very, very long</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands and feet and use it every night and as needed.</li>
            <li> Only need to use a small amount to heal cracks and rough skin.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this cream.</li>
            <li> My wife will not use any other hand cream.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries.</li>
            <li> I had gotten samples of this creme before but my initial response had been to accept its characterization since it came in a small tube and was quite sticky.</li>
            <li> have used other products but nothing works like this does.</li>
            <li> The shirt will remove some of the creme that is not absorbed</li>
            <li> The question is where can I find this in bulk to bring the cost down.</li>
            <li> Using it, she never gets the winter skin splits that had previously always plagued her finger tips.</li>
            <li> So, those with less of a skin problem may want to use a faster, drying lotion.</li>
            <li> I live in a cold dry place</li>
            <li> Drys quickly, little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling and heals my hands well.  </li>
            <li> I have to put on lotion every time my hands get wet, otherwise I run the risk of them breaking out into angry little red, burning spots.</li>
            <li> I am 69 and exercise everyday.</li>
            <li> I have to be the one to round off those slicing edges.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just mean rough.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to keep my fingertips from painfully cracking open in Colorado winters until I found the Norwegian Formula.</li>
            <li> When your hands are greasy with the product, it makes it difficult to screw the cap back on.</li>
            <li> and then they would get infected and were hard to heal, I no longer have that problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe how it feels once it&#x27;s rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> All that hard scaly skin gone after a couple of rubs.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a very thick heavy grease like cream .</li>
            <li> The consistency is like thick Vaseline</li>
            <li> Thick and non greasy.</li>
            <li> A caveat: You&#x27;ll be frustrated trying to get all the cream you&#x27;ve paid several dollars for.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s VERY thick and stays on.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what Neutrogena&#x27;s secret recipe is for this hand cream....</li>
            <li> Once the colder weather sets in my poor hands suffer.  </li>
            <li> With this hand cream I do not have to use the expensive prescription from my doctor.</li>
            <li> So, encouraged and desperate</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema on my hands and since I have started using the Neutrogena cream, it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, and it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works. I have eczema and need something strong to cope with it. This product does the job. Also, my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> Best product for hands on the market.  I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years.  This is truly the best.</li>
            <li> best hand lotion there is.</li>
            <li> This has always been the best hand cream of all. Very moist yet not sticky.</li>
            <li> This  is the best and I thought I could no longer find it! Thanks for being there!</li>
            <li> My wife will not use any other hand cream.  Using it, she never gets the winter skin splits that had previously always plagued her finger tips.</li>
            <li> This item was pricey, but well worth every penny. First of all, this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very, very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it&#x27;s naturally soft condition. I found that it is best used at nighttime. I&#x27;ve tried using it with nighttime gloves, and that works well too. I just prefer to rub it on my hands and go to bed. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves so you don&#x27;t chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries. I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this takes longer to absorb, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this as a daily lotion you might leave by the soap dish by the bathroom next to the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily, and because it&#x27;s so concentrated, that&#x27;s all I need to maintain smoother skin. It&#x27;s no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague. For every diaper change, sneeze, runny nose and shared food, I am washing my hands A LOT! This product works as advertised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works wonders on cracked elbows, heels and is soothing for skin conditions like Eczema.</li>
            <li> A good deal for 5. This stuff works better on my dry hands than just about anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Same outstanding product I&#x27;ve used for 30 years.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream available and for me, the only one which really gives me soft hands. I have relied on it for many years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many years and it is by far my favorite hand cream- very effective without making your hands too slippery or greasy. Happy to find it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> works well to keep hands from getting chapped in winter</li>
            <li> Drys quickly, little &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling and heals my hands well.  The question is where can I find this in bulk to bring the cost down.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a long time and it really helps dry hands and feet.  I also like that this hand cream it not greasy and it penetrates the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> This is has always been and still remains the best hand cream ever.  This is a non-fragrance version, so it is good for my husband too.  I have aging, dry hands and just a tiny amount on them makes them look smooth, fresh and feel great.  I have bought literally hundreds of creams and lotions over the years.  This one is the best for dry hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a number of years, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest putting it on at night before going to bed as it does take some time to absorb and in the meantime leaves your hands a bit slick (don&#x27;t try to grasp anything smooth). Mind you, you can always rub it in until it&#x27;s absorbed completely, but that is not a 30 seconds deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I do a project around the house my hands get pretty beat up, and this is my remedy of choice.</li>
            <li> Excellent results, long-lasting</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used. But I&#x27;ve bought this before with a flip cap, and that was much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena hand cream for about 10 years now . I work outside summer and winter and my hands would get very dry and crack in the winter . I&#x27;ve tried other hand creams that are very watery and don&#x27;t work for me. Neutrogena is a very thick heavy grease like cream . I put it on before bed when my hands feel dry and it works very well. I use to suffer through the winters with constant pain from cracks and split fingers and then they would get infected and were hard to heal, I no longer have that problem. I use it on the backs of my ankles also and it stops them from getting chapped .</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream.  I am constantly washing my hands because I have three dogs.  In the winter my hands get chapped.  I use this hand cream at bedtime and in the morning my hands are smooth and soft.  The consistency is like thick Vaseline but it is much better than that.</li>
            <li> I am 69 and exercise everyday. Living in Souther California, the air dries out during the winter months. And, after exercise and a shower, my back and legs itched intolerably. I tried several lotions, including Neutragena lotions but they did not work. A friend who had the same problem confidently recommended the Neutragena hand creme. I had gotten samples of this creme before but my initial response had been to accept its characterization since it came in a small tube and was quite sticky. However, encouraged by my friend&#x27;s experience, I reread the instructions and found that it is \\&quot;not just for hands\\&quot; .... but for \\&quot;anywhere your dry skin needs extra help\\&quot; including \\&quot;elbows, knees, face and lips\\&quot;. So, encouraged and desperate, I applied it all over and it worked beautifully! Finally, relief!! And as my friend also mentioned, it only needs application about twice a week. The creme is sticky and poorly absorbed which led to its labeling as hand creme. Thus, when I put on my shirt 20-30 minutes after the application of the creme to my back, the shirt would stick. So, those with less of a skin problem may want to use a faster, drying lotion. But if these don&#x27;t work, be sure to try this \\&quot;hand creme\\&quot;! Just peel off the shirt and throw it in the laundry hamper. The shirt will remove some of the creme that is not absorbed but it still works. As a suggestion to J&amp;J, I would relabel this creme since the \\&quot;hand creme\\&quot; label initially put me off.</li>
            <li> After a day gardening without glove, my hands are a mess, but putting this on overnight makes an amazing difference.</li>
            <li> Thehand cream is great but be warned you will not get 5 tubes - J&amp;J needs to update thier presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly did not expect to get 5 tubes for the price.</li>
            <li> This lotion works very well for dry hands!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better hand creams. I live in a cold dry place so I wanted some nice non greasy hand cream. This goes on a bit thick, kind of has a waxy texture. I don&#x27;t like how it makes my hands feel. It&#x27;s alright, does provide moisture but it is not that great. Plus, the screw on cap is not the best, would&#x27;ve been better as a flip cap. When your hands are greasy with the product, it makes it difficult to screw the cap back on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what Neutrogena&#x27;s secret recipe is for this hand cream....but man did they ever nail it!  As far as I&#x27;m concerned it could be made out of caterpillar brains and platypus poop and I would still smear this stuff all over my hands and face.  (Thank God it&#x27;s not, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you try this stuff, no other hand cream will ever cut it for you again.  It&#x27;s hard to describe how it feels once it&#x27;s rubbed in.  Soft and moisturized, and yet dry.  It soaks in so completely you can&#x27;t tell you put lotion on, but your skin feels so smooth.  Even my rough, old-lady, crawfish hands feel like a baby&#x27;s back side again!  For me, the remarkable thing is that your skin feels &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;.  Not dry like a corn-husk dry, but dry like baby powder, velvety and polished, almost.  You can rub this in on your feet and then walk around barefoot and it doesn&#x27;t feel like every crumb and dog hair is sticking to the bottom.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and the best I have found.</li>
            <li> I have used for years and definitely sold on it.  Once the colder weather sets in my poor hands suffer.  Dry skin and skin cracks at corner of nails (ouch!).  I immediately start using and hands are back to normal , actually better.  Soft, smooth and hydrated.  With daily use hands stay in great shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products but nothing works like this does.</li>
            <li> Not greasy.  Hallelujah.</li>
            <li> This cream is excellent! It works. Leaves the foots softy. I recommend it one hundred percent. It is not a lost of money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for the perfect hand cream. I have to put on lotion every time my hands get wet, otherwise I run the risk of them breaking out into angry little red, burning spots. A little bit goes a long way with this cream. It works so well that I bought multiple boxes so I can have one wherever I go. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s not greasy, and it leaves hands feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve one of these in every room, bathroom, car and  bag. Feels great and keeps the ash in check.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion for really dry cuticles!</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema on my hands and since I have started using the Neutrogena cream, it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  I use this instead of the prescription hand cream that I have, because it works!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a give away prize offering for our Take the Stairs program. Very nice product, small amount goes a long way and the winning nurse loved it.</li>
            <li> This product has my hands feeling like a new-born baby&#x27;s bottom.  Great product, I will be buying lots more. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Granted it&#x27;s not a miracle worker but my hands have improved so much since using this on a regular basis.  Before using my hands cracked all the time.I keep one at every sink, in my purse, my car.  This has been one of the coldest, harshest winters and I have not had 1 single crack.  Best of all I no longer have to use my thinning skin topical steroid creams. Best to use after dishes or bath when hands are very moist.  Great for chapped lips and hair tamer too :)</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream for eczema. I used this night and day to ease the dryness. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best! Perfect for dry hands in the winter. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Best product in this catgagory available</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price in general and compared to purchasing in a store, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> With this hand cream I do not have to use the expensive prescription from my doctor.</li>
            <li> Finally I got my order, arrived a day earlier this time,  and as always great product , love it,  thanks guys.</li>
            <li> This product was prescribed by a dermatologist for one of my family member&#x27;s skin condition. At first we were purchasing this item at a local pharmacy for a dollar or two  more per tube than this. At first i was not a fan of  the consistency because it is very different from other lotions and moisturizers. However, it was working miracles on my family member&#x27;s condition and we needed to spend the money anyways.  The tube is only two ounces but its true when it says &amp;#34;only a dab&amp;#34; is needed. This is a very good moisturizing cream and will not leave an oily residue. A great product and worth every penny if needed for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  Slather it on my hands as often as needed (about two or three times per day for me) and use the medication he prescribed for me 2x per day on weekends [in addition to the Neutrogena if necessary].  It seems to be helping.  Also my hands seemed to be drying out enough that the screen on my tablet and phone were not always responsive to my touch.  It seems to be getting better.</li>
            <li> Best hand cream available for dry, cracked, winter hands. I buy it in bulk and can&#x27;t find a better cream.</li>
            <li> Nice handcream.  Dries relatively fast.  Wish it came in larger tubes.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I have ever used.  My right thumb was always dry and cracked on top.  This cream is the only cream that actually eliminated the cracking.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic hand lotion for trouble hands. Thick and non greasy. Only need to use a small amount to heal cracks and rough skin. Very soothing. A must have!</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this at the start of winter. It goes on smooth and soaks into your skin, even after washing your hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before so I knew what I was purchasing Grat product It came very quickly</li>
            <li> Great deal... stuff works great on chapped hands and elbows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Keep one in my desk drawer and by the sink.  Washing your hands makes them dry and the winter is dry too.  Not too greasy and very effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream on the market. It&#x27;s the only one I use. I&#x27;ve been using it for 25 years. I have very dry hands and feet and use it every night and as needed. I carry a bottle with me everywhere I go. After you use it, your skin feels hydrated and without any greasy feeling at all. The cream is very concentrated so a little dab is all you need.  I highly recommend Neutrogena Hand Cream.</li>
            <li> Enough said. Can&#x27;t get any better than this. My hands dry out so easy. Two to three times a day, I rub a dab into my hands and immediately, they feel much better. I even use this stuff on my feet twice a week. All that hard scaly skin gone after a couple of rubs. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Best hands cream on the market - and I have bought many, many other kinds.  I guy this as gifts for family and coworkers and they too are &#x27;hooked&#x27; on the product.</li>
            <li> See review for Vaseline Petroleum Jelly Deep Moisture</li>
            <li> I have used this hand cream for years.  What else can I say.</li>
            <li> Great for really dry hands.</li>
            <li> Keeps her hands in good shape in the winter. She&#x27;s tried almost everything at one time or another and this seems to be the best.</li>
            <li> Really good handcream.  I don&#x27;t think you want to use this during the day unless you&#x27;re bedridden and/or you have nothing to do all day.  I use this stuff at night only and it&#x27;s VERY thick and stays on.  The next day, the dryness is gone.  Prolonged use of this stuff is a good thing because the pain from the dryness goes away and stays away.  Also, it washes out of the bedsheets quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of keeping your hands moisturized.</li>
            <li> This hand cream does the job!  It moisturizes even the driest, cracked&lt;br /&gt;hands.  You&#x27;ll be pleased with this Neutrogena product.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s new favorite cream to treat her eczema. She is very sensitive to fragrance and many creams cause her skin to sting, but this one works very well for her.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff, it is the best -- both my husband &amp; I use it</li>
            <li> This is the bestest of the hand creams--and my dry skin has tried a bunch of them. A caveat: You&#x27;ll be frustrated trying to get all the cream you&#x27;ve paid several dollars for. The tubes just can&#x27;t  be squeezed enough to get them drained.  Another warning.  Would it be asking too much to ask the Neutrogena people to add a tiny extra curved cutting blade to their assembly machine so as to smooth off those rough edges at the two corners where the parts of the tube are.  I don&#x27;t just mean rough.  You can slice your skin open if you aren&#x27;t careful.  I have to get my scissors out when I want to start using a new tube.  I have to be the one to round off those slicing edges.  I haven&#x27;t gotten around to calling Norway, or where ever they are, to tell the company about this yet. (And, assuredly, the tooth paste tube people are just as uncaring about the pointy edges on their tubes, but that&#x27;s another problem for another day. And a tooth paste tube isn&#x27;t shoved in a pocket of one&#x27;s clothing and carried about.)&lt;br /&gt;And there&#x27;s nothing better for your lips and mine than their Lip Moisturizer. But that would be best addressed in another review, right?</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by my dermatologist. It works wonders on my hands, feet and lips. The doctor said to soak my hands (or feet) in water, carefully dry and then put the cream on. That way, the cream seals in the moisture.If you skip the water, the cream won&#x27;t work as well. I use it every night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I was never able to keep my fingertips from painfully cracking open in Colorado winters until I found the Norwegian Formula.</li>
            <li> This hand cream Norwegian formula is the best hand cream I have used.  Tried others, however, they do not keep my skin as soft and smooth as this particular cream.  Have used it for several years, and even though I try different brands, I still return to this formula.  Especially nice during winter when my skin gets so dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> helps my hand stay soft</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this hand cream, and i had trouble finding it, so once i did, she was thrilled to receive it as part of a home-made basket of holiday gifts this year; subsequently i am very pleased with Amazon and the providers they offer.</li>
            <li> great product  and timely receipt, thank you.</li>
            <li> Although I still have two fingertips that haven&#x27;t fully recovered, this stuff works great. My skin was so dry it was bleeding and flaking. Gross when you are handling a newborn all day. When I put this on, it stays on, and yet my hands do t feel at all greasy. I wouldn&#x27;t try to open s new pickle jar, but I don&#x27;t worry about my hands drying out. It can even survive a hand washing or two. That is impressive in my book. I have sensitive skin as well and I have had no reactions and neither has the babe (and his skin reacts to most things). A+</li>
