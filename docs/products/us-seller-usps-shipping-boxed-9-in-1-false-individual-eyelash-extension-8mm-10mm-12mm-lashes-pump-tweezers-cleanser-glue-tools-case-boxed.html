            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>The tweezers included are one of my best pairs of tweezers.</li>
            <li>Best quality for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything in the kit works as promised, eyelashes themselves are great quality.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>These worked GREAT.</li>
            <li>Goes great with magnifying glasses.</li>
            <li>but these turned out very nice.</li>
            <li>Good to practice with.</li>
            <li>This kit turned out to be really good.</li>
            <li>This set is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice for a starter kit, which I am a starter.</li>
            <li>These are some of the best for quick fills and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>So packaging is great and quick delivery, but for me glue did not work and gave me severe eye watering and redness.</li>
            <li>but it was very easy to do.</li>
            <li>So I gave it a shot ... HUGE mistake!</li>
            <li>I have been applying the lashes on myself and love the tweezers that came with the product too!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>(The lashes are not legit either but ok for diy) buy the blink glue... Or a better glue.</li>
            <li>I want to buy it again :)</li>
            <li>It was more than I exprcted.</li>
            <li>My clients love the look the achieve.</li>
            <li>Love the tweezers in kit, just wish it came with two.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with eyelash extensions but these were easy to apply (I went to you tube for instructions since I don&#x27;t have a device that can play the cd).</li>
            <li>For such a great price there&#x27;s nothing cheap about this box.</li>
            <li>kit is amazing shipped really fast  </li>
            <li>Cheap product.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re going to go with the cheap stuff ...</li>
            <li>The lashes were nice and looked real when applied.</li>
            <li>Honestly sometimes it&#x27;s best to pay the $ and not risk going blind.</li>
            <li>The set was great but the remover burned my eyes even when they are closed.  </li>
            <li>I have used many glues and dyes over the years, but this really itched and hurt.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good kit and useful.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, and for how cheap these are they work pretty well.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for first timers!</li>
            <li>it did exactly what nail glue does ...</li>
            <li>only the glue was so strong my eyes watered and swelled up</li>
            <li>The tape that comes with it kinda sucks but ultimately it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>And looked so real.</li>
            <li>You can also buy all of the contents of this box separate off amazon, tweezers are decent....</li>
            <li>The glue bonds really well and all the other items that came in the kit were fine.</li>
            <li>The glue holds the eyelashes for about 3 weeks, by this time you need to replace these old lashes with new one anyway because they have grown with real eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Hairs feel really hard and the glue has a very strong fume.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I didn&#x27;t shake it well enough ....</li>
            <li>The fumes from glue are very strong so just a very small amount on lashes.</li>
            <li>Very natural and soft.</li>
            <li>must have sensitive eyes  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t even put this near your eye with out the fumes burning your eyes to tears ....</li>
            <li>But you&#x27;ll need another pair to separate the natural lashes</li>
            <li>When the lashes feel out so did my natural lashes</li>
            <li>I have gotten my extensions done professionally before</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at first because there was little reviews to true up the quality of the product to expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>forget to brush your real eyelashes regularly, otherwise they will start trying to grow around the synthetic eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;The box reads in Chinese, or Japanese</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any in my eye and barely put a few lashes on.  </li>
            <li> It spreads and tries to flatten out ...</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t glue my sisters eyeballs closed or anything.</li>
            <li> Everything in kit worked as expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased individually from other vendors tape that does not stick and glue that was already half dried out.</li>
            <li> and it seemed a little thicker ....</li>
            <li> I tested a little dot ...</li>
            <li> On my eye lash that meant down to the water line !</li>
            <li> The glue smells like Krazy glue and is so harsh that before I even apply it my eyes are watery.</li>
            <li> Missing parts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time picking up the lashes.</li>
            <li> Not What I expected .Glue smelled and seemed to be crazy glue</li>
            <li> Lashes were a bit too thin and glue was wasting out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Glue makes eyes water and impossible to use.</li>
            <li> The box is impossible to read</li>
            <li> Needless to say the burning was horrible!</li>
            <li> Glue is horrible for the eyes.</li>

            <li> kit is amazing shipped really fast  only the glue was so strong my eyes watered and swelled up must have sensitive eyes  but definitly would recommend seller</li>
            <li> Cheap product. Glue is horrible for the eyes.</li>
            <li> Had product for about 4 months now. I was a little hesitant at first because there was little reviews to true up the quality of the product to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Everything in the kit works as promised, eyelashes themselves are great quality. The glue holds the eyelashes for about 3 weeks, by this time you need to replace these old lashes with new one anyway because they have grown with real eyelashes. I have been applying the lashes on myself and love the tweezers that came with the product too!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to brush your real eyelashes regularly, otherwise they will start trying to grow around the synthetic eyelashes!&lt;br /&gt;The box reads in Chinese, or Japanese only so I could not tell what the heck it was all saying so I had to seek information elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Not What I expected .Glue smelled and seemed to be crazy glue , I wouldn&#x27;t put that on my eyes !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try any product ... I&#x27;m not the type that expects a knock off to be &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; - I would have gave this product 4 stars if the glue hadn&#x27;t been TINTED NAIL GLUE!!! I&#x27;m livid. At first I thought I didn&#x27;t shake it well enough .... So I shook it and squirted a dot out and it seemed a little thicker .... So I gave it a shot ... HUGE mistake! 😣 you can&#x27;t even put this near your eye with out the fumes burning your eyes to tears .... Let alone on! The second the glue came in contact with my eyelash it did exactly what nail glue does ... It spreads and tries to flatten out ... On my eye lash that meant down to the water line ! Needless to say the burning was horrible! It took everything in me to not squeeze my eyes close ... That would have been a disaster. I&#x27;m definitely contacting the company- that is NOT AT ALL what extension glue is like! It even dries like nail glue on your skin ... I tested a little dot ... My credibility: cosmetologist and have had eyelash extensions put on 4-5 times - wanted to save some money and try myself, *** my advice- if you&#x27;re going to go with the cheap stuff ... (The lashes are not legit either but ok for diy) buy the blink glue... Or a better glue. You can also buy all of the contents of this box separate off amazon, tweezers are decent.... But you&#x27;ll need another pair to separate the natural lashes</li>
            <li> So packaging is great and quick delivery, but for me glue did not work and gave me severe eye watering and redness. I have used many glues and dyes over the years, but this really itched and hurt.</li>
            <li> Good to practice with. Hairs feel really hard and the glue has a very strong fume. I&#x27;d never put on a human. Mannequins only!</li>
            <li> The tape that comes with it kinda sucks but ultimately it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I want to buy it again :)</li>
            <li> Got a chemical burn on my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t get any in my eye and barely put a few lashes on.  Whatever is in the glue smells like paint thinner.  This glue is much different than anything I have used or has been used on me in a shop.  Cost me and office visit copay and prescription.</li>
            <li> Got the kit and I&#x27;m happy with it.  I&#x27;m having a hard time picking up the lashes. I will order the individuals that come on a strip next time. Other than me having a hard time picking up the lashes everything else was fine.  The glue bonds really well and all the other items that came in the kit were fine.</li>
            <li> The set was great but the remover burned my eyes even when they are closed.  When the lashes feel out so did my natural lashes so now i only have short baby lashes left.</li>
            <li> These worked GREAT. And looked so real.</li>
            <li> It took 9 days to ship to Hawaii from California (or so the package says) . The glue smells like Krazy glue and is so harsh that before I even apply it my eyes are watery. I have gotten my extensions done professionally before, I figure I&#x27;d save a couple $100 by learning to do it myself, but gosh! Honestly sometimes it&#x27;s best to pay the $ and not risk going blind. I&#x27;m sorry but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for first timers!</li>
            <li> This set is amazing. For beginners or novice. Goes great with magnifying glasses. The tweezers included are one of my best pairs of tweezers. For such a great price there&#x27;s nothing cheap about this box. I&#x27;ve purchased individually from other vendors tape that does not stick and glue that was already half dried out. But not this box. It was more than I exprcted.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Glue makes eyes water and impossible to use. Missing parts</li>
            <li> This kit turned out to be really good. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with eyelash extensions but these were easy to apply (I went to you tube for instructions since I don&#x27;t have a device that can play the cd). The lashes were nice and looked real when applied. And I didn&#x27;t glue my sisters eyeballs closed or anything. I was intimidated by horror stories about eye injury and what not but it was very easy to do. Get a second set of the curved tweezers.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and for how cheap these are they work pretty well. The box is impossible to read but if you know how to do eyelash extensions they will turn out well.</li>
            <li> Nice for a starter kit, which I am a starter. Lashes were a bit too thin and glue was wasting out. Overall, it&#x27;s a good kit and useful.</li>
            <li> Best quality for the price. Very natural and soft. These are some of the best for quick fills and so easy to use. My clients love the look the achieve.</li>
            <li> Everything in kit worked as expected. Love the tweezers in kit, just wish it came with two. I had never done lash extensions on myself but these turned out very nice. The fumes from glue are very strong so just a very small amount on lashes. A little goes a long way. There are plenty if lashes in kit and I would buy again.</li>
