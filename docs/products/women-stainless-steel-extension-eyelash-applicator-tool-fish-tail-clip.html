            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Liked the idea of these</li>
            <li>Nice price....nicely made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality and could sell for much more..</li>
            <li>I could never apply falsies on my own.</li>
            <li>SO IT CAME IN HANDY.</li>
            <li>but there was no way to apply any kind of tension to hold the lash.</li>
            <li>comes in handy and</li>
            <li>then and this comes in handy for application.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular about these.  </li>
            <li>The eyelasher tool makes it easier to apply eyelashes on my own.</li>
            <li>Nice tweezer for removing chin hair that you can&#x27;t see and</li>
            <li>The price was nice as well.</li>
            <li>Nice Tool.</li>
            <li>This is a handy tool to have for applying eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Good grip, much better than the plastic ones.</li>
            <li>Honestly, these didn&#x27;t help me but maybe that&#x27;s just my fault.</li>
            <li>I liked using it.  </li>
            <li>my own word...</li>
            <li>THIS IS A NICE CONCEPT, AND I THOUGHT WHILE LEARNING HOW TO APPLY EYELASHES, THIS WOULD HELP,</li>
            <li>and he likes to keep an emergency kit handy-</li>
            <li>I love it, they&#x27;re really good quality.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly on my eyelid and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not the best but decent.</li>
            <li>I think it a great design and a great concept, but I really don&#x27;t think it helps to get your lashes on better.</li>
            <li>Makes applying lashes nice and easy for us rookies!</li>
            <li>I do it perfect and more fast with this</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and seems well-made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product, it came in handy learning to apply the lashes.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best $1 or $2</li>
            <li>no mess perfect application</li>
            <li>This makes it so easy to apply them!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this apparatus!</li>
            <li>It does seem very sturdy and good quality for the price though!</li>
            <li>Using this method I get a perfect lash application almost every time, they look so much more natural now than when I used a tweezer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>i know it sounds too good to be true</li>
            <li>I would tell my girlfriends to order this very crafty tool.</li>
            <li>works perfectly, came quickly, and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>the reach is great, the ergonomic(sp)design makes it easy to apply.. overall a great product...</li>

            <li>But I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the money.</li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more to ensure that I would always have it when I needed 1.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll order more &amp; give them to people who would use them as well.</li>
            <li>I really love this tool for the lashes.</li>
            <li>I need this for my lashed of course, :)</li>
            <li>overall Great Buy!!!</li>
            <li>love the price...</li>
            <li>There -- 9 more words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been able to apply falsies until this baby came to my door.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much better off using my fingers.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased them and recommended them to friends</li>
            <li>Yes, I love this eyelash applicator tweezers.</li>
            <li>Love, love , love it.</li>
            <li>Great product, really works..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use this item as I am still waiting for the eye lashes I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Most of mine fell out, so I wear the falsies every day I put makeup on.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Once again a product without a clue as to how to make the most of it.</li>
            <li>okay product, i seldom use it.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I love this tool.</li>
            <li>and I thought my tweezers worked 10xs better.</li>
            <li>I watched many youtube videos and lots use this applicator tool.  </li>
            <li>but they are a lot more money.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>Would be an awesome tool if it were bigger!</li>
            <li>Okay, here is my problem with this.  </li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t even be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>yeaahh :)</li>
            <li>They were so inexpensive that it would cost more to return them.</li>
            <li>I was able to place on the eyelid.</li>
            <li>But a tweezer worked better at grabbing the sides to place in corner.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>would be better plastic.</li>
            <li>but need to practice a bit more.  </li>
            <li>Product seems ok, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li>I love this tool...</li>
            <li>I love beauty gadgets</li>
            <li>so I wanted to love this</li>
            <li>my hand better than this thing</li>
            <li>I would not purchase it again, it tends to be more of a pain to use than anything.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t do it before and this makes it better.</li>
            <li>Needle nose tweezers would be better</li>
            <li>I purchased more for my clients</li>
            <li>This is an ok tool for the price</li>
            <li>but i think this would have been a better broduct if  it had rubber grips on the ends but</li>
            <li>thought it would have been a bit more sturdy</li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>i soooooooo love it</li>
            <li>I love this tool, it speeds up my application by about 50%.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love this item and ended up purchasing more of them.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more just in case I lose mine.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>This lets you apply the lashes without your hand getting in the way, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>and I love it  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Helps with applying lashes and is okay quality.</li>
            <li>There r better for the price</li>
            <li>It is much more comfy to use that the hair-clip looking applicator offered by KISS/IENVY.</li>
            <li>Im better off with my fingers.</li>
            <li>This is much better than the plastic applicators that you see out there.</li>
            <li>Seemed like a great product and I was really hoping that it would help me when applying my lashes.  </li>
            <li>I like it but need to practice more with it..</li>
            <li>YOUR BETTER OF JUST BUYING CUTICLE STICKS AND WORKING WITH THAT.</li>
            <li>I just need to be a bit more coordinated, I guess</li>
            <li>i came with nothing it would be better with  help</li>
            <li>Like I said at the top of this comment, I&#x27;d still rather use tweezers,</li>
            <li>Better than the plastic one I got at walmart.</li>
            <li>but then I realized is better to use my fingers and tweezer</li>
            <li>Cheap, but functional!</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love these for putting on eyelashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for the price.....</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Just go to Walmart and buy one that looks better and is not used.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to use this - looked like a great concept, but it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t really endorse this.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>This was really helpful for me when i put on lashes....</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t go out of my way to do business with them again because it took so much longer than said, and lost product just for this item when it was so really a fill in to save on shipping.</li>
            <li>And they make applying lashes so much easier.</li>
            <li>I apply my eyelashes really fast w this.</li>
            <li>It puts it really close to the real lashes</li>
            <li>Item worked very well, lash fitted well when using this tool.</li>
            <li>Really helps with application</li>
            <li>its not cheap feeling it has a nice weight to</li>
            <li>I would always give up in our arguments and he would get my tweezers since &#x27;being prepared for an emergency outweighs the need for a makeup tool&#x27; and my suggestions of him getting his own damn tweezers would always be ignored or he would just come back later and take them when I wasn&#x27;t around.</li>
            <li>Works great for holding false lashes..</li>
            <li>Took FOREVER to arrive, but is a very useful tool for applying lashes, especially for a beginner.</li>
            <li>it applies my eyelashes very easily and evenly without a mess</li>
            <li>but it is an effective tool used primarily for  the steady and meticulous application of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing to put fake eyelashes on with!</li>
            <li>I really tried loving this product but It is bulky and the space between the tongs isn&#x27;t wide enough.</li>
            <li>honestly all you need is a pair of tweezers or the end of a small makeup brush to put ur lashes into place</li>
            <li>This helps me apply (full strip only ) lashes close to lash line</li>
            <li>Still havent got the hang of these yet, But I am new to eyelashes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wearing lashes and this made them 10x easier to put on!</li>
            <li>Slight learning curve but much MUCH better than applying eyelashes with fingers alone.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it was super obvious that they were falsies, because they were so bent from this applicator tool!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in search of a decent eyelash applicator, this it the one for you.</li>
            <li>it was ok, i ended up just using my fingertips, it was more difficult to apply lashes with them then without.</li>
            <li>decent.</li>
            <li>I received them early, they were more than I expected.</li>
            <li>You will have a few seconds to re-adjust if you are too far from your own lashes.  </li>
            <li>cause i always feel ill poke my eye out, but this makes it easy, and its little curve is perfect when pushing the lash down to secure it</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>Makes applying false lashes super easy!</li>
            <li>and now I just use my fingers and my favorite pair of tweezers to attach them into place a little bit.</li>
            <li>i wish the handle was a little more thicker or maybe came with a grip.</li>
            <li>i love this little thing</li>
            <li>I am giving it 4 stars as it could have been a little more flexible.</li>
            <li>it lost a star because with the design it is easy to apply in the right eye(in my opinion) but harder on the left..</li>
            <li>Only reason why it didnt get the whole five stars because its really took really long to get here but other than that it was really good.</li>
            <li>I expected this to be flimsy and a cheap material</li>
            <li>Once the glue&#x27;s ready, you can apply the lash directly to your lid.</li>
            <li>You could use the end of this eyelash gadget in order for you to make sure that your lashes are firmly placed on your eyelids.</li>
            <li>These are great to apply false lashes with!</li>
            <li>I s more easy for me to put the fake eyelash using this clip</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t open right</li>
            <li>I immediately went right back to tweezers.</li>
            <li>I carefully use these to squeeze the false lashes to my own lashes, to help them settle closely and look more natural.</li>
            <li>Nice, sturdy little tool that definitely helps me to apply my lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at applying lashes but this tools has seemed to make it simpler for me</li>
            <li>love,love,love,love it and can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>applicator feels strange at first and you may drop your eyelash but after some practice it makes the process much easier.</li>
            <li>It is suppose to help put on false lashes, however I find them more cumbersome than useful.</li>
            <li>The fish tool on the other end is very useful for poking the eyelashes for correct placement.</li>
            <li>The shape makes it easy to apply them and they seem like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Pointless tweezers are better</li>
            <li>This tool make you feel like a professional!</li>
            <li>But now my lashes look professionally done!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m finally able to apply eyelashes to my lids and not halfway on my eyebrows like as I usually do, I&#x27;ll deal.</li>
            <li>but so far.. I have found I have a knack for it!</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice but you should get the hang of it very quickly, and this tool with become irreplaceable.</li>
            <li>I have purchased more expensive ones in the past, and they are not as good as this one.</li>
            <li>But they are good quality, and since I&#x27;m new to fake lashes, I&#x27;m just judging it by the thickness of the metal.</li>
            <li>Does not hold the lashes securely,  in order to puy them in place, it won&#x27;t squeeze tightly</li>
            <li>This is the best fake eye-lash tool I sware!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to fake eyelashes, but honestly using my fingers is much easier for me than using this tool.</li>
            <li>making the attachment of the half moon gripping eyelash part all the way to the end that way it would grip more of the false lash not just part of it.</li>
            <li>This little tool is fabulous for placing strip lashes with ease.</li>
            <li>This item worked okay, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to open wide enough to grab the lashes after pushing the lash</li>
            <li>I like for my lashes to look natural, and this applicator does the job.</li>
            <li>its VERY sturdy and actually helps me put the lashes on unlike the ones like Ardell give you.</li>
            <li>As far as the item I felt like it didn&#x27;t do what I thought it was going to do.</li>
            <li>it really helps you when trying to put on your lashes especially for a beginner like me!</li>
            <li>Item came early</li>
            <li>Part of the trick is to not close your eye completely because when you do your lash line creases, causing unevenness.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful for makeup artist, especially for applying lashes on clients</li>
            <li>Tools is very solid and seems very durable.  </li>
            <li>The handle a Little stiff but good for its price</li>
            <li>Its been very useful, i use it everyday.</li>
            <li>When they&#x27;re dry I can mascara the whole place up, and we&#x27;re in business!</li>
            <li>(so I can see what Im doing and to avoid getting glue on my real lashes - don&#x27;t worry, they will lay right when you put them on) and set them in the middle of your lash line, pulling the lashes one way or the other if I need to.</li>
            <li>You really could just use tweezers or hemostats (scissors with flat rounded tops).</li>
            <li>These tool works much better than using normal tweezer to correctly place false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Took a little too long to ship in my opinion, but still worth money paid for this item, so very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This made false eyelashes application fast and easy.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the tiny expense and such a simple idea that works as intended.</li>
            <li>Its a little hard to use but when u get the hang of it its good to have.</li>
            <li>the spring that opens it doesn&#x27;t open it enough for long, super curvy lashes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Retro, Goth, burlesque or anyone wearing false eyelashes would do well with this...an easy recommend!</li>
            <li>And adding to the fun of wondering if I&#x27;d ever regain the gift of sight, would be the attempt afterwards to track down my toddler son and encourage him to &amp;#34;unlearn&amp;#34; all the spicy new vocabulary Mama had just been screeching, hopefully before the next time Grandma comes over....</li>
            <li>and fortunately I&#x27;m lucky enough to not have to worry about having a uni-brow or really bushy brows, or I would look like a real mess by now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great help if you have trouble putting on false lashes.</li>
            <li>this thing made it SO much easier for me to apply &amp; then my fake lashes started looking the way they were supposed to when I put them on :)</li>
            <li>I use it to get the false eyelashes over my real ones, then use tweezers to apply close to the lash line, then use this again to secure lashes in place.</li>
            <li>Fortunately it was not expensive, but they are worthless and cheap.</li>
            <li>I barely use it.</li>
            <li>This costs just a few dollars and is a useful tool.</li>
            <li>IT SUPPER COOL AND SMALL.</li>
            <li>LOVE it and would recommend to anyone who is tired of putting an eye out while getting their lashes on.</li>
            <li>When I did get them I couldn&#x27;t wait to see if they were the magic I had been waiting for to apply false lashes.  </li>
            <li>but it seems like it&#x27;ll be very useful or at least i hope it will.</li>
            <li>does its job, but i find myself using it mostly for other random beauty tricks.(not worth naming)</li>
            <li>I applied the first pair in less than a minute.</li>
            <li>I find that in order to use this applicator, I have to squeeze pretty tightly so the lashes don&#x27;t fall out of the tool.</li>
            <li>Not so practical as i expected, they dont open much, so you end up hitting the lashes</li>
            <li>I love this little tool, it cuts down the amount of time it takes me to apply my false eyelashes, it makes it easier for me to secure the lash line to my eyelids.</li>
            <li>kind of stiff and hard to use</li>
            <li>it stays open to just right for holding the eyelashes in place until dried in place</li>
            <li>I wear false eyelashes often and use to use just regular tweezers or my fingers, but these make it sooooo much more simple!</li>
            <li>takes way less time than it normaly would for me to get ready.</li>
            <li>This tool makes lash application so much faster, simpler, and less unwieldy than manual application.</li>
            <li>I usually have to try a couple times to get my false lashes on in the right spot, but with this handy little tool, I got both eyes done</li>

            <li> Great so easy to put on my lashes now</li>
            <li> Excellent to handle eyelashes and easy to apply, definitely recommend this, perfect for holding and applying eyelashes, and remove eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This tool is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Liked the idea of these</li>
            <li> Nice price....nicely made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and could sell for much more..</li>
            <li> I could never apply falsies on my own.</li>
            <li> SO IT CAME IN HANDY.</li>
            <li> but there was no way to apply any kind of tension to hold the lash.</li>
            <li> comes in handy and</li>
            <li> then and this comes in handy for application.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular about these.  </li>
            <li> The eyelasher tool makes it easier to apply eyelashes on my own.</li>
            <li> Nice tweezer for removing chin hair that you can&#x27;t see and</li>
            <li> The price was nice as well.</li>
            <li> Nice Tool.</li>
            <li> This is a handy tool to have for applying eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Good grip, much better than the plastic ones.</li>
            <li> Honestly, these didn&#x27;t help me but maybe that&#x27;s just my fault.</li>
            <li> I liked using it.  </li>
            <li> my own word...</li>
            <li> THIS IS A NICE CONCEPT, AND I THOUGHT WHILE LEARNING HOW TO APPLY EYELASHES, THIS WOULD HELP,</li>
            <li> and he likes to keep an emergency kit handy-</li>
            <li> I love it, they&#x27;re really good quality.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly on my eyelid and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not the best but decent.</li>
            <li> I think it a great design and a great concept, but I really don&#x27;t think it helps to get your lashes on better.</li>
            <li> Makes applying lashes nice and easy for us rookies!</li>
            <li> I do it perfect and more fast with this</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and seems well-made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, it came in handy learning to apply the lashes.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best $1 or $2</li>
            <li> no mess perfect application</li>
            <li> This makes it so easy to apply them!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this apparatus!</li>
            <li> It does seem very sturdy and good quality for the price though!</li>
            <li> Using this method I get a perfect lash application almost every time, they look so much more natural now than when I used a tweezer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> i know it sounds too good to be true</li>
            <li> I would tell my girlfriends to order this very crafty tool.</li>
            <li> works perfectly, came quickly, and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> the reach is great, the ergonomic(sp)design makes it easy to apply.. overall a great product...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this tool.</li>
            <li> But I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the money.</li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more to ensure that I would always have it when I needed 1.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll order more &amp; give them to people who would use them as well.</li>
            <li> I really love this tool for the lashes.</li>
            <li> I need this for my lashed of course, :)</li>
            <li> overall Great Buy!!!</li>
            <li> love the price...</li>
            <li> There -- 9 more words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never been able to apply falsies until this baby came to my door.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much better off using my fingers.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased them and recommended them to friends</li>
            <li> Yes, I love this eyelash applicator tweezers.</li>
            <li> Love, love , love it.</li>
            <li> Great product, really works..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use this item as I am still waiting for the eye lashes I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Most of mine fell out, so I wear the falsies every day I put makeup on.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Once again a product without a clue as to how to make the most of it.</li>
            <li> okay product, i seldom use it.</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> I love this tool.</li>
            <li> and I thought my tweezers worked 10xs better.</li>
            <li> I watched many youtube videos and lots use this applicator tool.  </li>
            <li> but they are a lot more money.</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> Would be an awesome tool if it were bigger!</li>
            <li> Okay, here is my problem with this.  </li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t even be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> yeaahh :)</li>
            <li> They were so inexpensive that it would cost more to return them.</li>
            <li> I was able to place on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> But a tweezer worked better at grabbing the sides to place in corner.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> would be better plastic.</li>
            <li> but need to practice a bit more.  </li>
            <li> Product seems ok, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> I love this tool...</li>
            <li> I love beauty gadgets</li>
            <li> so I wanted to love this</li>
            <li> my hand better than this thing</li>
            <li> I would not purchase it again, it tends to be more of a pain to use than anything.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do it before and this makes it better.</li>
            <li> Needle nose tweezers would be better</li>
            <li> I purchased more for my clients</li>
            <li> This is an ok tool for the price</li>
            <li> but i think this would have been a better broduct if  it had rubber grips on the ends but</li>
            <li> thought it would have been a bit more sturdy</li>
            <li> I love these</li>
            <li> i soooooooo love it</li>
            <li> I love this tool, it speeds up my application by about 50%.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this item and ended up purchasing more of them.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more just in case I lose mine.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> I am in love.</li>
            <li> This lets you apply the lashes without your hand getting in the way, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite</li>
            <li> and I love it  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Helps with applying lashes and is okay quality.</li>
            <li> There r better for the price</li>
            <li> It is much more comfy to use that the hair-clip looking applicator offered by KISS/IENVY.</li>
            <li> Im better off with my fingers.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the plastic applicators that you see out there.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a great product and I was really hoping that it would help me when applying my lashes.  </li>
            <li> I like it but need to practice more with it..</li>
            <li> YOUR BETTER OF JUST BUYING CUTICLE STICKS AND WORKING WITH THAT.</li>
            <li> I just need to be a bit more coordinated, I guess</li>
            <li> i came with nothing it would be better with  help</li>
            <li> Like I said at the top of this comment, I&#x27;d still rather use tweezers,</li>
            <li> Better than the plastic one I got at walmart.</li>
            <li> but then I realized is better to use my fingers and tweezer</li>
            <li> Cheap, but functional!</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love these for putting on eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price.....</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Just go to Walmart and buy one that looks better and is not used.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to use this - looked like a great concept, but it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> Love this tool.</li>
            <li> Maybe once i get better at it, I&#x27;ll change my technique.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you are putting them on someone else</li>
            <li> I have to use it more often to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> It more easier to use...</li>
            <li> They should have sent directions in English to me instead of a business card to buy more stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I like this very much, it does make the process alot easier good price for it too.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good, i like it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good tool for the cost.  </li>
            <li> these handy little tools are perfect to help in putting the eyelash on placing it pressing it and not getting glue on you</li>
            <li> its ok work fine</li>
            <li> Works great for self placing lashes, or professional use</li>
            <li> It has help apply my lashes easier and more precise.  </li>
            <li> These make the process go much more smoothly with minimal fussing, and they&#x27;re great for adjusting anyway!</li>
            <li> but they are much more comfortable than using tweezers or just my fingers when applying the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Would defintely recommend them.</li>
            <li> This is a good tool to use but it doesn&#x27;t help much..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good condition.</li>
            <li> it came super fast great customer service...</li>
            <li> This tool quickly became one of the most indispensable things in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> nice can work with it if i get the right lashes</li>
            <li> Other then that I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> , it easily bends</li>
            <li> it looks quite easy to use and get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> So much easy to put lashes on</li>
            <li> In the photo it appears as though the tool is bent for easy application, however this is not the case.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to put lashes on.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and keeps the glue off of my fingers.</li>
            <li> I like it but is as easy if you use a stander twizzer</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it its easy to put on your eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this tool has made it so easy to put on my lashes.</li>
            <li> And they are easy for my to place them where they can be.</li>
            <li> they make it so easy for me to put my eyelashes on I defiantly recommend them .</li>
            <li> So much easy with this</li>
            <li> and it was just what she needed it make putting on eye lashes so easy.</li>
            <li> I found the applicator tool to be easy to use, once I figured out the correct pressure to hold the eyelashes during application.</li>
            <li> easy  to use.</li>
            <li> , now it&#x27;s so easy with the tool.</li>
            <li> it males applying eyelashes easy...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy &amp; strong.</li>
            <li> but that was ok for me because I didn&#x27;t need them for something special....</li>
            <li> Now the most important part: GENTLY CLAMP THE TOOL OVER THE LASHES AND SQUEEZE THEM INTO YOUR OWN LASHES.</li>
            <li> But with this handy tool i have a much easier time getting them on!</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use, cheap and did I mention how easy they make putting on eyelashes?  </li>
            <li> works perfectly and got here before time expected!!</li>
            <li> The tool also makes accurate placement easy as your hands don&#x27;t obscure your face while you&#x27;re trying to put it on.</li>
            <li> Fit in my hand and incredibly easy to use</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Product is fine, well.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I had never used one of these before, but I apply eyelashes literally everyday and this applicator was easy to get the hang of and was for a great price!!!</li>
            <li> This little tool is absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> Waited a while which was expected, but glad I did they are great for applying eyelashes</li>
            <li> Was so great that someone actually stole these from me.</li>
            <li> , it is quite hardy for the size, so it fit to my makeup</li>
            <li> Not well aligned, cheap product.</li>
            <li> Waist of money,thank goodness it was cheap.</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool...</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for women.</li>
            <li> I just pop the falsie on and secure the sides with a corner</li>
            <li> Because they are so cheap to buy and came from China, I ordered 2.</li>
            <li> I am a freelance make up artist and my clients are primarily brides.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and came nicely wrapped.</li>
            <li> This is an indispensable tool to apply eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s not that nimble and not that great for final placement.</li>
            <li> but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I love it because I can put on my lashes right where they need to be.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> This product makes applying eyelashes so much easier!!!</li>
            <li> SO MUCH EASIER!!!</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, they seem like they&#x27;ll be very useful.</li>
            <li> A very useful tool.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li> It is a  very useful tool to purchase for anyone using them.</li>

            <li> now with this tool, its so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Makes putting on lashes super easy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love the product works great.. makes applying my lashes soooo much easier than a normal tweezer!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being stainless, it&#x27;s also very easy to keep clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchased price!</li>
            <li> perhaps better instructions in english will be better!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this tool..</li>
            <li> Even thought this tool was super cheap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is completely necessary for the job, but the quality is good and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> but it is a package full of nail art stickers.  </li>
            <li> its cool but</li>
            <li> Cool tool for the price.</li>
            <li> I could probably just use my fingers and tweezers to get job done, but i find that when I use these, I get a more real look with lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just very use full and help full and now I spend more time picking and choosing my outfits and accessories than applying my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Took a full month to receive this product.</li>
            <li> its okay gets the lashes really close to the eyelid line</li>
            <li> Good quality and definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> more straight</li>
            <li> They grab the lashes nicely, but they don&#x27;t allow you to bend them with the natural curve of your eye.</li>
            <li> It is good for personal usage of lashes .</li>
            <li> Best 4 dollars i have spent!!!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing is awesome!  </li>
            <li> Looks like someone super glued the ends to keep it together.</li>
            <li> this came in pretty quick !</li>
            <li> This tool keeps me on an even aim and makes my application quick and hassle-free.....</li>
            <li> The stainless steel makes it easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I received this product fairly quick.</li>
            <li> Helps a newbie like me get real close and apply pretty easily!</li>
            <li> love it high quality  </li>
            <li> this tool is really good because i have long nails that make putting on lashes a pain.</li>
            <li> This tool makes it so easy to put them on, in the right spot, the first time.</li>
            <li> Both ends are completely functional and make applying your eyelashes easy!</li>
            <li> Fast and easy transaction would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This tool is wonderful since I absolutely STINK at using ordinary tweezers or my fingers to apply strip lashes.</li>
            <li> At first i didn&#x27;t know how to use it but since watching some Youtube videos now i know how to use it!</li>
            <li> Makes putting your eyelashes on an absolute breeze!!</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive but the funny thing is that it arrived the day of my party!</li>
            <li> Much much easier to apply lashes now!!</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> A good product of the less is more variety, it works very well in spite of</li>
            <li> This is a great invention, get them and u will never have trouble applying lashes again...</li>
            <li> but it was worth it</li>
            <li> I know a couple of professional make up artists who would love this as well...</li>
            <li> did not expect the quality too much because of such good price.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> (Especially when you have a nice brand) to apply them with!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The price of the applicator and shipping makes it worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like an extra hand which is handy.</li>
            <li> if you starting out doing your own lashes this is the tool to have i am now a expert at putting my lashes on..</li>
            <li> It grabs the lash and places it directly on top of your natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I find it kind of useless but who knows, I&#x27;m not that experienced with applying lashes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like having an extra hand, kind of...  </li>
            <li> but it was worth it</li>
            <li> it pretty cool..</li>

            <li> This allows you to see exactly where your puting your lashes without your hands being in the way.</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t help but now I&#x27;ve figured out how to use it.</li>
            <li> This product makes it that much easier!</li>
            <li> but since those are constantly gone I guess I&#x27;m better off with these.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and work wonderful.</li>
            <li> Regular twizers work way better</li>

            <li> Perfect for applying false lashes!</li>
            <li> From a professional point of view, I like the fact that it is stainless steel and can be easily sanitized between clients.</li>
            <li> This will adhere them very well and ensure that the are right at the lash line.</li>
            <li> regular tweezers work better for me, glad this was cheap, but still a waste...</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner, was smaller than I was  expecting but overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a better tool for eyelash application because I have clumsy fingers that aren&#x27;t able to apply the eyelash &amp;#34;just</li>
            <li> I used to dread lash application: I needed two more hands; my hands would get in the way; I&#x27;d get the lashes crooked; the lashes would fall off, and/or I&#x27;d get glue matted up in my real lashes.</li>
            <li> ok but took too long to arrive.  </li>
            <li> Better than tweezers by a long shot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit small, so it&#x27;s good for travel.</li>
            <li> Makes putting on the eyelashes easy because my big fingers aren&#x27;t in my eyes!  </li>
            <li> In the past i used my fingers and shorter tool for application, however nothing so far has compared to the great product.</li>
            <li> I love this tool it makes it super easy to apply my false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Its incredibly easy to apply the false lashes and blend them in with your own.</li>
            <li> I am able to get right down to the lash line</li>
            <li> Never been able to apply bottom lashes before, but using his nifty little tool, I did it on the first try!</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because it took awhile to come, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold lashes in nice tight straight line.  </li>

            <li> Fast Shipper</li>
            <li> Arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> Was very inexpensive though,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the need for this applicator tool.</li>
            <li> and it creates much easier control of placement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will recommend that people buy it thanks so much</li>
            <li> it was very helpful to me</li>
            <li> Self explanatory really.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived very well packaged and no marks on it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I recently got comfortable with strip lashes.</li>
            <li> DIDNT REALLY CARE FOR IT.</li>
            <li> These are very use.</li>
            <li> Literally took me a whole month to receive it, that when it came I thought it was a mistake.</li>
            <li> Really like it and still learning how to use it.</li>
            <li> I hold them so the lashes point straight up towards my eyebrows</li>
            <li> but that is my experience - maybe it really works for others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it makes putting eyelashes on sooo much easier!!&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> Really helps a lot...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really endorse this.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> This was really helpful for me when i put on lashes....</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go out of my way to do business with them again because it took so much longer than said, and lost product just for this item when it was so really a fill in to save on shipping.</li>
            <li> And they make applying lashes so much easier.</li>
            <li> I apply my eyelashes really fast w this.</li>
            <li> It puts it really close to the real lashes</li>
            <li> Item worked very well, lash fitted well when using this tool.</li>
            <li> Really helps with application</li>
            <li> its not cheap feeling it has a nice weight to</li>
            <li> I would always give up in our arguments and he would get my tweezers since &#x27;being prepared for an emergency outweighs the need for a makeup tool&#x27; and my suggestions of him getting his own damn tweezers would always be ignored or he would just come back later and take them when I wasn&#x27;t around.</li>
            <li> Works great for holding false lashes..</li>
            <li> Took FOREVER to arrive, but is a very useful tool for applying lashes, especially for a beginner.</li>
            <li> it applies my eyelashes very easily and evenly without a mess</li>
            <li> but it is an effective tool used primarily for  the steady and meticulous application of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing to put fake eyelashes on with!</li>
            <li> I really tried loving this product but It is bulky and the space between the tongs isn&#x27;t wide enough.</li>
            <li> honestly all you need is a pair of tweezers or the end of a small makeup brush to put ur lashes into place</li>
            <li> This helps me apply (full strip only ) lashes close to lash line</li>
            <li> Still havent got the hang of these yet, But I am new to eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing lashes and this made them 10x easier to put on!</li>
            <li> Slight learning curve but much MUCH better than applying eyelashes with fingers alone.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it was super obvious that they were falsies, because they were so bent from this applicator tool!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in search of a decent eyelash applicator, this it the one for you.</li>
            <li> it was ok, i ended up just using my fingertips, it was more difficult to apply lashes with them then without.</li>
            <li> decent.</li>
            <li> I received them early, they were more than I expected.</li>
            <li> You will have a few seconds to re-adjust if you are too far from your own lashes.  </li>
            <li> cause i always feel ill poke my eye out, but this makes it easy, and its little curve is perfect when pushing the lash down to secure it</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> Makes applying false lashes super easy!</li>
            <li> and now I just use my fingers and my favorite pair of tweezers to attach them into place a little bit.</li>
            <li> i wish the handle was a little more thicker or maybe came with a grip.</li>
            <li> i love this little thing</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 stars as it could have been a little more flexible.</li>
            <li> it lost a star because with the design it is easy to apply in the right eye(in my opinion) but harder on the left..</li>
            <li> Only reason why it didnt get the whole five stars because its really took really long to get here but other than that it was really good.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be flimsy and a cheap material</li>
            <li> Once the glue&#x27;s ready, you can apply the lash directly to your lid.</li>
            <li> You could use the end of this eyelash gadget in order for you to make sure that your lashes are firmly placed on your eyelids.</li>
            <li> These are great to apply false lashes with!</li>
            <li> I s more easy for me to put the fake eyelash using this clip</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t open right</li>
            <li> I immediately went right back to tweezers.</li>
            <li> I carefully use these to squeeze the false lashes to my own lashes, to help them settle closely and look more natural.</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy little tool that definitely helps me to apply my lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at applying lashes but this tools has seemed to make it simpler for me</li>
            <li> love,love,love,love it and can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> applicator feels strange at first and you may drop your eyelash but after some practice it makes the process much easier.</li>
            <li> It is suppose to help put on false lashes, however I find them more cumbersome than useful.</li>
            <li> The fish tool on the other end is very useful for poking the eyelashes for correct placement.</li>
            <li> The shape makes it easy to apply them and they seem like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Pointless tweezers are better</li>
            <li> This tool make you feel like a professional!</li>
            <li> But now my lashes look professionally done!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m finally able to apply eyelashes to my lids and not halfway on my eyebrows like as I usually do, I&#x27;ll deal.</li>
            <li> but so far.. I have found I have a knack for it!</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice but you should get the hang of it very quickly, and this tool with become irreplaceable.</li>
            <li> I have purchased more expensive ones in the past, and they are not as good as this one.</li>
            <li> But they are good quality, and since I&#x27;m new to fake lashes, I&#x27;m just judging it by the thickness of the metal.</li>
            <li> Does not hold the lashes securely,  in order to puy them in place, it won&#x27;t squeeze tightly</li>
            <li> This is the best fake eye-lash tool I sware!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to fake eyelashes, but honestly using my fingers is much easier for me than using this tool.</li>
            <li> making the attachment of the half moon gripping eyelash part all the way to the end that way it would grip more of the false lash not just part of it.</li>
            <li> This little tool is fabulous for placing strip lashes with ease.</li>
            <li> This item worked okay, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to open wide enough to grab the lashes after pushing the lash</li>
            <li> I like for my lashes to look natural, and this applicator does the job.</li>
            <li> its VERY sturdy and actually helps me put the lashes on unlike the ones like Ardell give you.</li>
            <li> As far as the item I felt like it didn&#x27;t do what I thought it was going to do.</li>
            <li> it really helps you when trying to put on your lashes especially for a beginner like me!</li>
            <li> Item came early</li>
            <li> Part of the trick is to not close your eye completely because when you do your lash line creases, causing unevenness.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful for makeup artist, especially for applying lashes on clients</li>
            <li> Tools is very solid and seems very durable.  </li>
            <li> The handle a Little stiff but good for its price</li>
            <li> Its been very useful, i use it everyday.</li>
            <li> When they&#x27;re dry I can mascara the whole place up, and we&#x27;re in business!</li>
            <li> (so I can see what Im doing and to avoid getting glue on my real lashes - don&#x27;t worry, they will lay right when you put them on) and set them in the middle of your lash line, pulling the lashes one way or the other if I need to.</li>
            <li> You really could just use tweezers or hemostats (scissors with flat rounded tops).</li>
            <li> These tool works much better than using normal tweezer to correctly place false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Took a little too long to ship in my opinion, but still worth money paid for this item, so very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This made false eyelashes application fast and easy.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the tiny expense and such a simple idea that works as intended.</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to use but when u get the hang of it its good to have.</li>
            <li> the spring that opens it doesn&#x27;t open it enough for long, super curvy lashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Retro, Goth, burlesque or anyone wearing false eyelashes would do well with this...an easy recommend!</li>
            <li> And adding to the fun of wondering if I&#x27;d ever regain the gift of sight, would be the attempt afterwards to track down my toddler son and encourage him to &amp;#34;unlearn&amp;#34; all the spicy new vocabulary Mama had just been screeching, hopefully before the next time Grandma comes over....</li>
            <li> and fortunately I&#x27;m lucky enough to not have to worry about having a uni-brow or really bushy brows, or I would look like a real mess by now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great help if you have trouble putting on false lashes.</li>
            <li> this thing made it SO much easier for me to apply &amp; then my fake lashes started looking the way they were supposed to when I put them on :)</li>
            <li> I use it to get the false eyelashes over my real ones, then use tweezers to apply close to the lash line, then use this again to secure lashes in place.</li>
            <li> Fortunately it was not expensive, but they are worthless and cheap.</li>
            <li> I barely use it.</li>
            <li> This costs just a few dollars and is a useful tool.</li>
            <li> IT SUPPER COOL AND SMALL.</li>
            <li> LOVE it and would recommend to anyone who is tired of putting an eye out while getting their lashes on.</li>
            <li> When I did get them I couldn&#x27;t wait to see if they were the magic I had been waiting for to apply false lashes.  </li>
            <li> but it seems like it&#x27;ll be very useful or at least i hope it will.</li>
            <li> does its job, but i find myself using it mostly for other random beauty tricks.(not worth naming)</li>
            <li> I applied the first pair in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> I find that in order to use this applicator, I have to squeeze pretty tightly so the lashes don&#x27;t fall out of the tool.</li>
            <li> Not so practical as i expected, they dont open much, so you end up hitting the lashes</li>
            <li> I love this little tool, it cuts down the amount of time it takes me to apply my false eyelashes, it makes it easier for me to secure the lash line to my eyelids.</li>
            <li> kind of stiff and hard to use</li>
            <li> it stays open to just right for holding the eyelashes in place until dried in place</li>
            <li> I wear false eyelashes often and use to use just regular tweezers or my fingers, but these make it sooooo much more simple!</li>
            <li> takes way less time than it normaly would for me to get ready.</li>
            <li> This tool makes lash application so much faster, simpler, and less unwieldy than manual application.</li>
            <li> I usually have to try a couple times to get my false lashes on in the right spot, but with this handy little tool, I got both eyes done</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose of putting false eyelashes on, but everyone has different shape eyes, so not necessarily is it made to fit.</li>
            <li> Very useful tool for false lashes.</li>
            <li> Maybe you can&#x27;t teach an old dog new tricks, but I find this cumbersome, bulky and just hard to use.</li>
            <li> You still have to carefully press your lashes down into place, but it was so much easier to see what I was doing.</li>
            <li> I used the back end of the tool to push the lash down into the client&#x27;s natural lashes.</li>
            <li> hard to get to know how to use it at first</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for what it does, but took entirely too long to be shipped</li>
            <li> I waited a long time before these finally arrived.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone who has eyes that are only a centimeter long??</li>
            <li> I use this to put my eye lashes on, especially when I have long nails.</li>
            <li> Only problem was it took a really long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> I really sucked at putting on falsies, would take me 20 mins just to get them on, with this tool i have my lashes on in less than 3 mins!!</li>
            <li> I can see where I am applying it, and if it is not perfect upon 1st application it is easy to correct with this product..</li>
            <li> I like it a lot; you can&#x27;t go wrong with the cheap price either.</li>
            <li> So difficult to use, but cheap..</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time because it does come from out of the US, I believe.</li>
            <li> The waiting was to long</li>
            <li> Shopping didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought .</li>
            <li> Ships from China and took a long time</li>
            <li> Shipping took too long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already taking too long for my liking....</li>
            <li> I have long nails and was having issues trying to put on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I had questions that were answered promptly and the product arrived earlier than expected.......</li>
            <li> I thought the wait was gonna be so long</li>
            <li> Shipping takes a long time...</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole fake lash world.</li>
            <li> Squeeze the grip shut and use the curved part as a tool to push the false lashes into your lashes, and use the long pointed parts to grab each end and place it right on your lash line.</li>
            <li> The product arrived faster than I expected, actually faster than any other product from the same order that I placed.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It helps get the false lashes right where they are supposed to be</li>
            <li> A little makeup tip though gals you dont need an expensive DUO glue weave glue works better ,.</li>
            <li> look for my tweezers (which was actually what he was doing)- even when I bought pink tweezers and found them in his gear, as if the Army issues pink</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve come to use this almost every single day, and every time I put lashes on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to people who are using false eyelashes, either individual or strip.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t open very wide at all to even get a grip on the eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> They look a little weird, but these stainless steel tweezers are very easy to use and make false lash application a breeze!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to use if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand which I don&#x27;t have!!!</li>
            <li> I found this took helpful when applying false eyelashes, but it&#x27;s a bit to large.</li>
            <li> I think I should just stick to the regular tweezers until I can find something to file the sharp edges down.</li>
            <li> These little things make such a difference when I&#x27;m applying eyelashes!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little awkward, but it helps a lot, i like it better than tweezers</li>
            <li> item was a little smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste your funds use your regular tweezers!</li>
            <li> This is harder than it looks to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is useful but difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not a worry anymore, just be careful not to let them touch the glue of the falsies will stick to them</li>
            <li> It was here sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> should have spent it on a vending machine.  </li>
            <li> the end is wide.  </li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as I expected and felt it was too wide.</li>
            <li> I think I like it so much because the price decreased to something like $2.99, hell</li>
            <li> But not very study</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, it does do the job.</li>
            <li> Since they are far away shipping is slow.</li>
            <li> Very helpful include placing the false eyelashes in place.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s stainless steel because the one I&#x27;ve received, the part where you use to apply your false lashes was rusty.</li>
            <li> This works very well to apply my false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier to apply false lashes</li>
            <li> Putting my false lashes on much easier.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them much as I don&#x27;t wear false eye-lashes all the time</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier to apply false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Can get the same results with plain tweezers.</li>
            <li> it is a bit roughly cut and sharp</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t hold the lashes as tight as you&#x27;d think it would, but as long as you keep pressure applied, they won&#x27;t fall.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I lost it and will need to buy a new one, but for the price, it&#x27;s not a big deal...</li>
            <li> Definitely does the job, although I am new to false lashes, this helps a ton!</li>
            <li> but the other end appears to have been fashioned for something as well. ?</li>
            <li> The tool is different from anything that I have owned in the past</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s what other people do with it.</li>
            <li> they are made of the softest metal, that they collapse on the first use and are rendered useless.</li>
            <li> So I use for that other use as well.</li>
            <li> so i had to even it out manually, but other than that, it does the job</li>
            <li> sometimes I find that it&#x27;s easier to use than the other one and sometimes not.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product is necessary or not.</li>
            <li> BUT I will say that it DOES help hold the lashes to apply them if you do not want to handle them with your fingers, or mix them up with other makeup, glue, etc.</li>
            <li> then I use my finger on the other sides of the eyelash, so it&#x27;s not that helpful to me.</li>
            <li> IT HELPS A NEW USER OF FALSE EYELASHES</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to people who is new to applying false lashes.  </li>
            <li> but I am brand new to false lashes and I&#x27;m hoping that this tool helps.</li>
            <li> Unless your eye is specifically shaped like this, it&#x27;s super awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Such a big help with applying my false lashes.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time applying lashes, that I gave up on wearing them.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle of returning but won&#x27;t purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Makes putting fake lashes so much easier.</li>
            <li> And I am a pro at putting on false lashes, but wow, do these make the job a lot faster and easier.</li>
            <li> Repeat pushing the lashes down with the tool.</li>
            <li> It crimps the lashes, and the edges are so sharp!</li>
            <li> It comes with a little pouch for you to keep it in, with foreign instructions on it.</li>
            <li> I mean I can&#x27;t manage to use regular tweezers to get my eyelashes on</li>
            <li> Lucky it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> They cut down half the time.</li>
            <li> I can apply each eyelas perfectly in less than 5 min.</li>
            <li> Helps me put on my lashes in less that one minute</li>
            <li> how much less fear they had that I was going to jab their eyes out).</li>
            <li> This tool takes me less than 5 minutes to put them on.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them for the half or corner lashes.</li>
            <li> Pair - 102 Demi, Black (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> and then you get a goopy mess.</li>
            <li> gave up using it that way when instead of extravagant movie star eyelashes, I was ending up with a tear-stained mess of what appeared to be caterpillars crawling out of my eyesockets.</li>
            <li> instead, I use this after I&#x27;ve used blunt, non-metal implements (my fingers) to get the gluey lashes in the general vicinity of where I want them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grip on to the lashes tight.</li>
            <li> When I squeeze tightly, though, it sometimes bends the lashes.</li>
            <li> i am new to the fake eyelash thing..</li>
            <li> Not easy to use at all - perhaps down to my inexperience, but still ....</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but still does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the little plastic applicator tool some of the eyelashes come with, I&#x27;ve used tweezers, I&#x27;ve used my fingers.  </li>
            <li> This little tool has made this process easier than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> and I like that it has a little curve on the grip.</li>
            <li> Also, it helps bend the eyelashes a little</li>
            <li> Closes up a little sometimes.</li>
            <li> but it works quite well and being all metal if a little glue gets on it</li>
            <li> the design needs a little improvement.</li>
            <li> At first it was difficult to keep it closed on the false lash while I placed it on my eyelid</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little longer that way</li>
            <li> I like this little tool, I have try serial times to wear lashes</li>
            <li> This little tool is a must have for people who use the eyelashes....</li>
            <li> A little adjustment is still required, of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I suck at putting fake eyelashes on so this little tool only made me hate the process even more -</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wear lashes almost everyday for work</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I wasted my two bucks...</li>
            <li> I wear my lashes everyday.</li>
            <li> I like that they are metal as I have a few of the plastic ones that come with the lash packs.</li>
            <li> The clip holds the lash firmly in place and holds its shape without damaging it while you apply glue.</li>
            <li> but after a few practice run I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> and I misplaced them</li>
            <li> i wear them everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all different methods of applying false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> If you wear false lashes you definitely need this tool.</li>
            <li> recommend this for MUAs and anyone else who applies false lashes on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used false eyelashes for years with regular tweezers and felt like a change.</li>
            <li> I use it on clients and its a lot less scarier than tweezers!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s plain appearance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (From corner to corner) it was really hard to use, and bent the fake lashes every time, making it impossible to get them as close to my eyelash line as I would have liked...</li>
            <li> I bought these for applying false lashes, they didn&#x27;t grip them at all I had to use fingers, also took long to ship.</li>
            <li> I used to have such a hard time putting on false eye lashes untill</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone who has trouble applying fake lashes with fingers.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to, but so does putting on lashes!</li>
            <li> Took a few minutes to get the hang of how hard to hold it together.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but works no better than ordinary tweezers.</li>
            <li> Makes applying lashes even quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> I am not actually sure what this tool is meant for.</li>
            <li> I wear lashes almost everyday and this has helped me become a PRO in putting them on!</li>
            <li> No more glue everywhere.</li>
            <li> It also came with a small pouch to put it in when your not using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> they usually sell this item in store for about 6 to 10 dollars.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no winning with him.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s no more arguments since I got this tool, instead he just whines because he can&#x27;t find tweezers.</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> These are way too small to hold the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Pointless tool, not helpful in putting on lashes.</li>
            <li> like cutting my lashes in half and/or using only lash accents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am sorry it took me so long to try this out.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, I envisioned it was to hold the gluey strip of lash as you guide it toward your lashline to stick it down.</li>
            <li> and when you pinch the lash, it&#x27;s hard to apply.</li>
            <li> For people that have a hard time applying lashes</li>
            <li> I am still having a hard time putting on lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;ll poke my eye with regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> This thing sucks.</li>
            <li> This tool seems a bit clumsy but it may just be me or the way I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> At least these stick around</li>
            <li> helps a lot , arrived late</li>
            <li> My fingers are too thick to go at it alone.  </li>
            <li> but I am sorry when I tried to use it, not very useful..</li>
            <li> I usually just use my fingers but if you are picky then these are for you!</li>
            <li> and and i would rather use a pair of small tweezers to apply my false lashes</li>
            <li> No more do I have to try and get my false eyelashes on with my finger tips or tweezers.</li>
            <li> If you are not used to using a tool to apply false lashes, there is a small learning curve.</li>
            <li> Putting on false lashes was really hard for me.</li>
            <li> My fingers make it hard to see when I put my false lashes on.</li>
            <li> Stiff and difficult to use</li>
            <li> The edges are sharp and I&#x27;m afraid of getting cut while using it.</li>
            <li> Bad qualty, and not practical and big to the size dont make u to do ur eyelashes the same, worthless tool</li>
            <li> Tweezers are dangerous for me as I am shaky and impatient.  </li>
            <li> very hard to position lashes with this thing.  </li>
            <li> These are a little awkward to use.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY ITS HARD TO WORK WITH.</li>
            <li> Fairly unnecessary.</li>
            <li> So damn frustrating...</li>
            <li> This eyelash applicator makes puting on false eyelashes easier than ever.</li>
            <li> This tool makes applying false lashes easier.</li>
            <li> So I wear false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> though sometimes it does help me to apply the false eyelashes on though, but sometimes use my fingers</li>
            <li> I apply false lashes every now and</li>
            <li> I use these to put on my false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> for someone who has always struggled to apply false lashes, this has made it a dream for me</li>
            <li> I find it is easier to just use your hands to apply false eye lashes</li>
            <li> ; if you wear or use false lashes, grab a set of these.</li>
            <li> I use this tool to help put on my false lashes.</li>
            <li> It feels like it gets in the way when I use it versus to just putting false eyelashes on by hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner with false lashes</li>
            <li> I use these for applying false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I like wearing false lashes, but I have a devil of a time applying them, because I can never see what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> Very awkward trying to use due to its shape</li>
            <li> TO GUIDE INTO CORRECT POSITION AND NOT PLAE ON WRONG EYE LOCATION.</li>
            <li> So I purchased the applicator to apply fake lashes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a useless tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to put on fake eyelashes with this item.</li>
            <li> This applicator looks complicated</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t like the way the fake lashes look when i use this to apply it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner at fake eyelashes and look horrid putting them on with tweezers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not perfectly even</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this tool, but I knew I needed something to help me apply my lashes.  </li>
            <li> This tool is difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> I USE IT TO APPLY FALSE LASHES!</li>
            <li> Recommend this for experience and inexperience false eyelash wearers!</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to squeeze the tips together because of the thin material.  </li>
            <li> I have a fused joint in my thumb and holding this was awkward.</li>
            <li> terrible don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> but i was soooo wrong !</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> But at this price, can&#x27;t be too mad.</li>
            <li> I hate putting on fake eye lashes with all the sticky glue and then putting them on my lashes.</li>
            <li> bad prefectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone would be disappointed if they tried it out.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this tool. Shipping took a long time because it does come from out of the US, I believe. But I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> Arrived in good time. And very helpful for putting on lashes</li>
            <li> The waiting was to long but it was worth it</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but still does the job.</li>
            <li> IT HELPS A NEW USER OF FALSE EYELASHES LIKE ME TO GUIDE INTO CORRECT POSITION AND NOT PLAE ON WRONG EYE LOCATION.</li>
            <li> Shopping didn&#x27;t take as long as I thought . Good service &#x27;</li>
            <li> At first i didn&#x27;t know how to use it but since watching some Youtube videos now i know how to use it! :) Very Easy to use!!</li>
            <li> MAYBE BECAUSE IM A LEFTY</li>
            <li> So I purchased the applicator to apply fake lashes.  The sticker on the package says that but it is a package full of nail art stickers.  To the person that packaged it.  &amp;#34;Women Stainless Steel Exten....plicatir Tool Fish Tail Clip&amp;#34; and nail art stickers are not the same.  I&#x27;ll guess I&#x27;ll go do my daughters nails??!!!  Not worth the hassle of returning but won&#x27;t purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> This eyelash applicator makes puting on false eyelashes easier than ever. I can apply each eyelas perfectly in less than 5 min. A girls best friend!</li>
            <li> It is suppose to help put on false lashes, however I find them more cumbersome than useful. It&#x27;s okay for the money.</li>
            <li> very helpful for taking off and putting my eyelashes on. takes way less time than it normaly would for me to get ready.</li>
            <li> very very nice work wale</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t hold lashes in nice tight straight line.  very hard to position lashes with this thing.  don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Just like the photo! What I needed! Since they are far away shipping is slow. Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT I USE IT TO APPLY FALSE LASHES!</li>
            <li> Look just like there pic hope they work just as well</li>
            <li> Works great for self placing lashes, or professional use</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, it easily bends so you can shape it to your eye shape.</li>
            <li> Was so great that someone actually stole these from me. I guess that alone should speak volumes perhaps. Who the hell steals eyelash extension tweezers?!</li>
            <li> Very helpful include placing the false eyelashes in place. You could use the end of this eyelash gadget in order for you to make sure that your lashes are firmly placed on your eyelids. Definitely a must buy</li>
            <li> Great so easy to put on my lashes now</li>
            <li> Pretty good, i like it and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I couldn&#x27;t do my lashes until I got this. It&#x27;s sturdy &amp; strong. I ordered 2 more to ensure that I would always have it when I needed 1. I think I&#x27;ll order more &amp; give them to people who would use them as well. I know a couple of professional make up artists who would love this as well...</li>
            <li> Liked the idea of these but when I tried to place my lashes on the lash line with them, they would just come off and stick to these tweezers...cause you try to get close to the lash line..but then glue touches and the lashes won&#x27;t stay but will rather stick to the tweezers. They are made well.</li>
            <li> Applying false lashes has never been easier!!! Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered on 4/26 and received today (5/7/15)) wasn&#x27;t scheduled for delivery until the 20th! Product works great!</li>
            <li> I really love this tool for the lashes. Its incredibly easy to apply the false lashes and blend them in with your own.</li>
            <li> I need this for my lashed of course, :)&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect the quality too much because of such good price.&lt;br /&gt;BUT OMG......&lt;br /&gt;It is actually very good quality and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchased price! Makes putting your eyelashes on an absolute breeze!! (Especially when you have a nice brand) to apply them with!&lt;br /&gt;  I HIGhly recommend these tweezers for your use!! Very well made as well!  ;)</li>
            <li> perfect for  the lashes</li>
            <li> its cool but honestly all you need is a pair of tweezers or the end of a small makeup brush to put ur lashes into place</li>
            <li> ok but took too long to arrive.  Price is really good and quality is good as well.</li>
            <li> Got here fast and I love it !</li>
            <li> Makes putting falsies way easier.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work don&#x27;t waste your funds use your regular tweezers! To flimsy needs to be more sturdy! Don&#x27;t go out and buy</li>
            <li> Nice price....nicely made.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for what it does, but took entirely too long to be shipped</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality and could sell for much more.. But I realized that it&#x27;s easier to just use my fingers to but on my eyelashes</li>
            <li> The product arrived faster than I expected, actually faster than any other product from the same order that I placed.&lt;br /&gt;For that, I am very impressed and satisfated.&lt;br /&gt;I havent practice quite enough time to review the product.&lt;br /&gt;But it looks quite easy to use and get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is quite hardy for the size, so it fit to my makeup bad prefectly.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great experience at amazon again. Thank you</li>
            <li> Wife likes it and it works. Arrived on time and in great shape.</li>
            <li> Works great just what I needed to be able to do my own lashes....Ships from China and took a long time but that was ok for me because I didn&#x27;t need them for something special....</li>
            <li> Stiff and difficult to use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are necessary. I just end up using my tweezers instead</li>
            <li> This tool makes applying false lashes easier. I&#x27;m new at applying lashes but this tools has seemed to make it simpler for me</li>
            <li> Still havent got the hang of these yet, But I am new to eyelashes! Better than tweezers by a long shot.</li>
            <li> This product makes applying eyelashes so much easier!!! I had never used one of these before, but I apply eyelashes literally everyday and this applicator was easy to get the hang of and was for a great price!!! overall Great Buy!!!</li>
            <li> So much easy to put lashes on I recommend getting it</li>
            <li> Very happy with product and service.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is harder than it looks to use. I think it may just require a lot of practice. Great price. Fast and easy transaction would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It took some practise but I like it. Works easier than just your fingers. I would give it my recommendation.</li>
            <li> I like this very much, it does make the process alot easier good price for it too.  Took a little too long to ship in my opinion, but still worth money paid for this item, so very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. It makes eyelash application so much easier than trying to use tweezers or my fingers...</li>
            <li> Its been very useful, i use it everyday. I really like the material, it is not flimsy like others</li>
            <li> Its ok...guess i gotta get use to this...been using tweezers for awhile...love the price...these things cost like $15 in Sephora!!!</li>
            <li> I could never apply falsies on my own. This tool is so easy to use and makes application quick and simple. I can&#x27;t imagine doing my makeup without it.</li>
            <li> This costs just a few dollars and is a useful tool. Word, word, word, word, word, word, etc. etc. etc. There -- 9 more words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is useful but difficult to use. I&#x27;, going to order something else for the first eyelash application. The tweezers-like tool can be used for adjustments.</li>
            <li> I AM STILL LEARNING HOW TO APPLY EYELASHES. I DO RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT. I FEEL IT HELPS TO APPLY THE EYELASHES.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to apply falsies until this baby came to my door. I love it and it helped make me beautiful!</li>
            <li> I had one of these before, and it made applying falsies both on myself, and on clients sooooo much easier! Unfortunately I lost it and will need to buy a new one, but for the price, it&#x27;s not a big deal... It is a must have if you use falsies or as a makeup artist to have in your kit!!</li>
            <li> This little tool is fabulous for placing strip lashes with ease. However, as with all lash applications you must wait for the glue to get tacky! Lashes can never be rushed! ;)</li>
            <li> Pointless tweezers are better</li>
            <li> So I got this when I was a beginner at putting on lashes and now I just use my fingers and my favorite pair of tweezers to attach them into place a little bit. With these the end is just too big and they just get in the way so I&#x27;ll probably give them to one of my friends because I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE THEY REALLY HELPED ME... I DO LASHES SO IT CAME IN HANDY. IT GETS THE JOB DONE</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and seems well-made. I don&#x27;t use it very often so I can;t say if it&#x27;s gonna hold up very well but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> practical to ad eye lashed ,happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;the size and the material and ease to use&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the tool</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! Paid a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product, it came in handy learning to apply the lashes. I would tell my girlfriends to order this very crafty tool. i wish the handle was a little more thicker or maybe came with a grip. Other then that I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> they are great it helps out with  the  no more glueing of the hands ....  best idea ever for girls who love their eyelashes</li>
            <li> I waited a long time before these finally arrived.  When I did get them I couldn&#x27;t wait to see if they were the magic I had been waiting for to apply false lashes.  WRONG!  Maybe it was just the one I received but there was no way to apply any kind of tension to hold the lash.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully with falsies. Shortens my time in applying lashes.</li>
            <li> From China not using probably has lead</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and serving its purpose.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but works no better than ordinary tweezers.</li>
            <li> Not well aligned, cheap product. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It crimps the lashes, and the edges are so sharp! In the photo it appears as though the tool is bent for easy application, however this is not the case. I&#x27;m much better off using my fingers.</li>
            <li> Fit in my hand and incredibly easy to use</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes applying lashes so much easier. It is definitely a must have in your makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing is awesome!  I usually have to try a couple times to get my false lashes on in the right spot, but with this handy little tool, I got both eyes done right the first try!  A great tool to have in my beauty arsenal and inexpensive to boot!  This one&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> regular tweezers work better for me, glad this was cheap, but still a waste...</li>
            <li> Perfect product for applying false lashes. Makes applying lashes even quicker than usual. Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Awesome guide for those who wear glasses.. I do and it helps greatly!!</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used this yet but it seems like it&#x27;ll be very useful or at least i hope it will.</li>
            <li> I used to have such a hard time putting on false eye lashes untill I got this tool. This tool allows you to get right at the lash line, and make the lashes look so real! Sturdy material!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase. This eyelash applicator works very well. I took about 2-weeks to arrive. But that&#x27;s okay. The price of the applicator and shipping makes it worth the wait. I have already used the applicator and plan on using it regularly now. It was a great addition to my make up collection.</li>
            <li> These tool works much better than using normal tweezer to correctly place false eyelashes.  Glad I purchased them and recommended them to friends</li>
            <li> Yes, I love this eyelash applicator tweezers. It has help apply my lashes easier and more precise.  I would recommend these to anyone. Love, love , love it.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to put lashes on.</li>
            <li> Very helpful with applying lashes it makes the process so much easier.</li>
            <li> Great product, really works..comes in handy and it works!..excellent  A++ i would buy again  Anyone that applies lashes should try it</li>
            <li> I saw a video with a girl who used a pair like this to apply her lashes so I got it thinking it would help. It sort of does but I still end up putting them on with out these.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT ! It doesn&#x27;t seem like it would make a difference but it does ! Very helpful putting on lashes! I love it !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a useless tool. It&#x27;s cumbersome. It doesn&#x27;t help you at all, on the contrary. I don&#x27;t recommend at all this product.</li>
            <li> This allows you to see exactly where your puting your lashes without your hands being in the way</li>
            <li> helps apply eyelashes...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use this item as I am still waiting for the eye lashes I ordered.  Hope they come soon.</li>
            <li> So I wear false eyelashes.  Most of mine fell out, so I wear the falsies every day I put makeup on.  I&#x27;ve used the little plastic applicator tool some of the eyelashes come with, I&#x27;ve used tweezers, I&#x27;ve used my fingers.  This little tool has made this process easier than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  One thing to note, it doesn&#x27;t hold the lashes as tight as you&#x27;d think it would, but as long as you keep pressure applied, they won&#x27;t fall.</li>
            <li> it doesnt work that well and and i would rather use a pair of small tweezers to apply my false lashes</li>
            <li> I love it. Makes placing eye lashes much easier. I used to struggle so much and now it&#x27;s a snap. Thank you</li>
            <li> Once again a product without a clue as to how to make the most of it. Seems fairly straight forward to use the tweeser side but the other end appears to have been fashioned for something as well. ? Cool tool for the price.</li>
            <li> Great for applying falsies. I&#x27;m always afraid I&#x27;ll poke my eye with regular tweezers. Not a worry anymore, just be careful not to let them touch the glue of the falsies will stick to them and then you get a goopy mess.</li>
            <li> I am learning to use this product. Good price. The tool is different from anything that I have owned in the past so I am just now learning to use it.</li>
            <li> okay product, i seldom use it. though sometimes it does help me to apply the false eyelashes on though, but sometimes use my fingers</li>
            <li> This thing sucks. It doesn&#x27;t grip on to the lashes tight.</li>
            <li> Works awesome and places the lashes perfectly on the eyelid. Doesn&#x27;t stick to my eyelash glue...aligned perfectly with my lash line.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Best pair for lashe tweezers i have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> I use them to apply the lashes I bought. Easy to handle and keeps the glue off of my fingers.</li>
            <li> I love this tool. It really has helped me in the process of applying my eyelashes. I would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Everyone who wears falsies needs this tool, especially if you are a beginner like me. It doesn&#x27;t get it as close to the eyelash line as I would like, but thats probably user error rather than problem with the tool. I use it to get the false eyelashes over my real ones, then use tweezers to apply close to the lash line, then use this again to secure lashes in place. I could probably just use my fingers and tweezers to get job done, but i find that when I use these, I get a more real look with lashes.</li>
            <li> Works great. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to people who is new to applying false lashes.  It&#x27;s like an extra hand which is handy.</li>
            <li> Waist of money,thank goodness it was cheap. I used it once and I thought my tweezers worked 10xs better. I wear lashes almost everyday for work and I&#x27;m going to stick to using tweezers.</li>
            <li> I wear false eyelashes often and use to use just regular tweezers or my fingers, but these make it sooooo much more simple!</li>
            <li> I just recently received this product.. The shipping took quite some time. I have yet to use the tool since I haven&#x27;t worn any lashes in a bit. From what I can tell, they seem like they&#x27;ll be very useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been into makeup however I just started to wear eyelashes. This makes it so easy to apply them! It comes with a little pouch for you to keep it in, with foreign instructions on it. Arrived quickly thanks to prime. Will definitely be ordering another for my purse. So pleased!</li>
            <li> I am not actually sure what this tool is meant for. When I ordered it, I envisioned it was to hold the gluey strip of lash as you guide it toward your lashline to stick it down. Maybe that&#x27;s what other people do with it. Talented people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave up using it that way when instead of extravagant movie star eyelashes, I was ending up with a tear-stained mess of what appeared to be caterpillars crawling out of my eyesockets. And adding to the fun of wondering if I&#x27;d ever regain the gift of sight, would be the attempt afterwards to track down my toddler son and encourage him to &amp;#34;unlearn&amp;#34; all the spicy new vocabulary Mama had just been screeching, hopefully before the next time Grandma comes over....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So instead, I use this after I&#x27;ve used blunt, non-metal implements (my fingers) to get the gluey lashes in the general vicinity of where I want them. I carefully use these to squeeze the false lashes to my own lashes, to help them settle closely and look more natural. When they&#x27;re dry I can mascara the whole place up, and we&#x27;re in business!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a good grip of the lashes. Not a fan. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I apply false lashes every now and then and this comes in handy for application. I watched many youtube videos and lots use this applicator tool.  You can buy them at stores but they are a lot more money.</li>
            <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
            <li> they are a great item!!!</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to use but when u get the hang of it its good to have. Makes it easier to apply lashes if u r just starting to learn.</li>
            <li> I received it ahead of time which is always prefect.Its everything the description said it would be,it works great i would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very Helpful! Love them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anyone who has eyes that are only a centimeter long?? (From corner to corner) it was really hard to use, and bent the fake lashes every time, making it impossible to get them as close to my eyelash line as I would have liked... Not to mention, it was super obvious that they were falsies, because they were so bent from this applicator tool! Would be an awesome tool if it were bigger!</li>
            <li> These things make lash application so much easier!</li>
            <li> I love this little tool, it cuts down the amount of time it takes me to apply my false eyelashes, it makes it easier for me to secure the lash line to my eyelids. It&#x27;s just very use full and help full and now I spend more time picking and choosing my outfits and accessories than applying my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked and looked for a replacement for my eyelash extender and finally found it on Amazon and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> low cost and my wife doesn&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> I use this to put my eye lashes on, especially when I have long nails. This helps me apply (full strip only ) lashes close to lash line</li>
            <li> Okay, here is my problem with this.  It doesn&#x27;t open very wide at all to even get a grip on the eyelashes!  This picture shows it opening further than it actually does.  I probably won&#x27;t even be able to use it.  It is a great idea if I could get it clasped on the eyelash!  I think tweezers would be easier.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know how to use it,never have, as there were no directions to help me use it. . What a shame. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignorant,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee Evers</li>
            <li> Took FOREVER to arrive, but is a very useful tool for applying lashes, especially for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Gave them as a gift to my mother who is still learning to do her lashes! Quick shipping! Good price!</li>
            <li> I use these to put on my false eyelashes. I&#x27;m not sure this is completely necessary for the job, but the quality is good and the price is excellent. It does it&#x27;s job. Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> This is a functionality</li>
            <li> Very handy! Helps a newbie like me get real close and apply pretty easily!</li>
            <li> for someone who has always struggled to apply false lashes, this has made it a dream for me yeaahh :)</li>
            <li> nice can work with it if i get the right lashes</li>
            <li> I hate putting on fake eye lashes with all the sticky glue and then putting them on my lashes. This is the best fake eye-lash tool I sware!!</li>
            <li> Saw this on a youtube guru.I wanted to try it.I like it but is as easy if you use a stander twizzer</li>
            <li> Helps me put on my lashes in less that one minute I swear its the best investment and the glue always goes on nicely. A little makeup tip though gals you dont need an expensive DUO glue weave glue works better ,. For one its a dollar. when you line the glue on the lash you must give it 20 second to become tacky and then apply the lash .</li>
            <li> its quite helpful. hard to get to know how to use it at first but once you get the hang of it its easy to put on your eye lashes. the instructions come printed on the packaging. its not cheap feeling it has a nice weight to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;personally i would redesign the product. making the attachment of the half moon gripping eyelash part all the way to the end that way it would grip more of the false lash not just part of it.</li>
            <li> I love this tool it makes it super easy to apply my false eyelashes. It was here sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I wear lashes almost everyday and this has helped me become a PRO in putting them on! It takes a couple times for you to really figure out how to do it but I&#x27;ve come to use this almost every single day, and every time I put lashes on.</li>
            <li> So flimsy.  Almost impossible to squeeze the tips together because of the thin material.  They were so inexpensive that it would cost more to return them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love the product works great.. makes applying my lashes soooo much easier than a normal tweezer! happy i got it.</li>
            <li> This item worked okay, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to open wide enough to grab the lashes after pushing the lash I was able to place on the eyelid. But a tweezer worked better at grabbing the sides to place in corner.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little awkward, but it helps a lot, i like it better than tweezers cause i always feel ill poke my eye out, but this makes it easy, and its little curve is perfect when pushing the lash down to secure it</li>
            <li> I inadvertinly ordered this item.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;ll try it later.  Tell you more at a later date.</li>
            <li> Took a full month to receive this product. Looks exactly like the picture. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I am brand new to false lashes and I&#x27;m hoping that this tool helps.</li>
            <li> These work very well at holding your falsies in place while trying to apply them.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;m uncertain as to whether I will purchase them again, or just use a pair of tweezers to do the same. Both work equally well to do the same job.</li>
            <li> Unless your eye is specifically shaped like this, it&#x27;s super awkward to use.</li>
            <li> This eyelash strip applicator took forever to come. However this is a great tool to use to apply eyelash strips along the lash line perfect every time!</li>
            <li> Best 4 dollars i have spent!!!!! makes applying falsies effortless. I really sucked at putting on falsies, would take me 20 mins just to get them on, with this tool i have my lashes on in less than 3 mins!!</li>
            <li> All right with the the purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> does its job, but i find myself using it mostly for other random beauty tricks.(not worth naming)...&lt;br /&gt;But considering the price i really cant complain</li>
            <li> They look a little weird, but these stainless steel tweezers are very easy to use and make false lash application a breeze! Love them!</li>
            <li> This is a good item to have! It&#x27;s easier to put on fake eyelashes with this item.</li>
            <li> Cheep and crappy. they are made of the softest metal, that they collapse on the first use and are rendered useless. you cannot ever bend them back to a point/curve. just like tin foil. BEWARE</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner, was smaller than I was  expecting but overall a good buy. Satisfied with my purchase. It does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a great invention, get them and u will never have trouble applying lashes again...love,love,love,love it and can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool... I recommend to use for lashes. The price was even more attractive. I even used to pick up rhinestones.</li>
            <li> This applicator looks complicated but i wanted to try it aside from the fact its metal i works well would be better plastic.</li>
            <li> My mom got these and uses them. Very durable!</li>
            <li> this product works as advertised and my wife says she would buy it again.  Me?  I&#x27;d just use tweezers.  lol</li>
            <li> good for putting on face eyelashes.  it really does help.  but need to practice a bit more.  I poked it in my eye accidentally.</li>
            <li> Shipping took too long. Product seems ok, nothing fancy. It is what it is</li>
            <li> These were inexpensive and makes life so much easier. I highly recommend these to people who are using false eyelashes, either individual or strip.</li>
            <li> its okay gets the lashes really close to the eyelid line but i don&#x27;t like the way the fake lashes look when i use this to apply it. i prefer using my fingers instead. thanks though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Very easy to use. Helps a lot people that doesn&#x27;t know how to use a eyelash. Love it a lot!</li>
            <li> this does not make applying the eyelashes (also threw them away, garbage product) any easier. perhaps better instructions in english will be better!</li>
            <li> And will take forever to get this product!  I could not see anywhere in the writeup that  was obvious to the unsuspecting buyer that it&#x27;s being shipped from HongKong!  I bought this last week and the shipping says I will receive it between 6-2-14 and 6-19-14!!!!  What a deal! YeahRight.  So buyers beware, you won&#x27;t get this product for a while.  It&#x27;s already taking too long for my liking....and I still have a ways to go to get it!  What a scam!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this tool has made it so easy to put on my lashes. This is literally the fourth one I&#x27;ve bought because I keep giving them to my friends...they love them too!!!</li>
            <li> These are great to apply false lashes with! I really like it. Now I don&#x27;t have to use my tweezers anymore!! Lol</li>
            <li> if you starting out doing your own lashes this is the tool to have i am now a expert at putting my lashes on.. no mess perfect application I love this tool...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read label right.. I was suprised to recieve two! But they are good quality, and since I&#x27;m new to fake lashes, I&#x27;m just judging it by the thickness of the metal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier for my to apply lash strips with my fingers or tweezers. Maybe you can&#x27;t teach an old dog new tricks, but I find this cumbersome, bulky and just hard to use. the curve isn&#x27;t right and I can&#x27;t seem to grip the lashes as well with this as I can with tweezers. I love beauty gadgets so I wanted to love this but it was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Its quite good, it holds the lash and I like that it has a little curve on the grip. It makes it much easier to put them on.</li>
            <li> Just tried them to apply my lashes and it works well for me. No more glue everywhere.</li>
            <li> my hand better than this thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all different methods of applying false eyelashes.  This tool is by far the best way to position them perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole fake lash world. These help me to put on the lashes as close as possible.</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular about these.  Can get the same results with plain tweezers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s stainless steel because the one I&#x27;ve received, the part where you use to apply your false lashes was rusty. The edges are sharp and I&#x27;m afraid of getting cut while using it. I think I should just stick to the regular tweezers until I can find something to file the sharp edges down.</li>
            <li> Even thought this tool was super cheap I would not purchase it again, it tends to be more of a pain to use than anything. I find it is easier to just use your hands to apply false eye lashes</li>
            <li> Perfect for applying false lashes! Good price too.</li>
            <li> It really helps me put on my eyelashes because I have trouble seeing my eyes with my hand in the way. LOL Also, it helps bend the eyelashes a little so the lashes will go onto your eyes perfectly (but this also depends what type of eyes you have).</li>
            <li> The eyelasher tool makes it easier to apply eyelashes on my own. I couldn&#x27;t do it before and this makes it better.</li>
            <li> This is a good eyelash applicator. I use it on clients and its a lot less scarier than tweezers! If you&#x27;re in search of a decent eyelash applicator, this it the one for you.</li>
            <li> I wasted my two bucks...should have spent it on a vending machine.  I tried to use it.  It doesn&#x27;t open right and when you pinch the lash, it&#x27;s hard to apply. I would not recommend.  Needle nose tweezers would be better</li>
            <li> Great tool to assist in the application of false lashes, easy to use for a real newby as i am.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Makes applying false lashes super easy!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best $1 or $2 I have ever spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have two kids in competitive dance. And I am a pro at putting on false lashes, but wow, do these make the job a lot faster and easier. The fishtail edge is a great way to hold the lashes while you&#x27;re applying adhesive, and then you can use the edges to press them on... worked amazingly well and I want to buy them for everyone in my kids&#x27; classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t care if I had to replace them as often as I do the lashes; if you wear or use false lashes, grab a set of these. Even my kids commented how much faster it was (and how much less fear they had that I was going to jab their eyes out).</li>
            <li> For people that have a hard time applying lashes this is a good tool. Great Buy. I purchased more for my clients</li>
            <li> This tool make you feel like a professional! This tool is amazing. It grabs the lash and places it directly on top of your natural eyelashes. This is a fantastic product for women.</li>
            <li> Nice tweezer for removing chin hair that you can&#x27;t see and the end is wide.  So I use for that other use as well.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly on my eyelid and is super easy to use. I&#x27;m a beginner at fake eyelashes and look horrid putting them on with tweezers. But now my lashes look professionally done!</li>
            <li> Awesome this is wonderful in helping to applying of lashes. So very pleased.. made applying lashes so much easier. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Great tool to have in your kit . This makes putting on lashes so much easier . For the price you get beat it. I went to ulta and the same tool was 15.00 .</li>
            <li> I love it because I can put on my lashes right where they need to be. And they are easy for my to place them where they can be.</li>
            <li> This is an ok tool for the price but i think this would have been a better broduct if  it had rubber grips on the ends but its ok work fine i guess.</li>
            <li> thought it would have been a bit more sturdy</li>
            <li> Received the item very fast but I am sorry when I tried to use it, not very useful..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not perfectly even so i had to even it out manually, but other than that, it does the job and it does help a lot with my fake lashes!!</li>
            <li> Great for eyelash application very good</li>
            <li> Works great.  Took a few minutes to get the hang of how hard to hold it together. but it is a great option for applying lashes.</li>
            <li> Only reason why it didnt get the whole five stars because its really took really long to get here but other than that it was really good. It works great</li>
            <li> I thought it would go across whole eye. It still works and I like it.  All my clients want one.</li>
            <li> These are a great tool for applying eyelashes.  Makes it much easier and you don&#x27;t get glue on your fingers! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this apparatus! I have purchased more expensive ones in the past, and they are not as good as this one. This applicator helps you apply your lashes perfectly, every time. I like for my lashes to look natural, and this applicator does the job. It is very durable too!</li>
            <li> I use this tool to help put on my false lashes. It helps I really like it. The price was nice as well.</li>
            <li> This product is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; if you do your own lashes using the strips!  It&#x27;s so much easier to hold the lashes using this tool rather than your fingers!  Follow me on PinInterest.....BrooklynGirl626</li>
            <li> I love these they make it so easy for me to put my eyelashes on I defiantly recommend them .</li>
            <li> This works very well to apply my false eyelashes.  Only problem was it took a really long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> Just as described. It&#x27;s a great help if you have trouble putting on false lashes. It&#x27;s also a bit small, so it&#x27;s good for travel.</li>
            <li> I havent tried it yet, but it looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> Saved my life when it comes to applying my lashes. I&#x27;d always get glue on my fingertips and everywhere but not anymore. I just pop the falsie on and secure the sides with a corner and that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;d recommend it !</li>
            <li> These do the job! I usually just use my fingers but if you are picky then these are for you!</li>
            <li> The packaging when it arrived was great but when I opened it up, it fell apart. Looks like someone super glued the ends to keep it together.</li>
            <li> So helpful.  Really allows the lashes to be put close to the lashline.</li>
            <li> Bad qualty, and not practical and big to the size dont make u to do ur eyelashes the same, worthless tool</li>
            <li> helps as a guide to apply the lashes as close as possible to your lash line. i likee! and you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> Makes putting on falsh eyelashes SO MUCH EASIER!!! Great makeup tool!</li>
            <li> For my ladies that like to wear strip lashes this is a helpful too you can use this tool to pick up the lashes and place them on eyelid as you can see here it has the same shape of your eyelids.</li>
            <li> i soooooooo love it i do my own lashes and these are the best i would recommend them to others</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a better tool for eyelash application because I have clumsy fingers that aren&#x27;t able to apply the eyelash &amp;#34;just so&amp;#34; close at the eyelash edge.  This didn&#x27;t do the trick.  Perhaps if the applicator &amp;#34;curved&amp;#34; to the shape of the eye the application might be easier.  Again, this doesn&#x27;t do the trick. Lucky it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> thank you seller.  I love this tool, it speeds up my application by about 50%. I applied the first pair in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> Nice Tool. Fast Shipper</li>
            <li> Well, we are leaving with that.</li>
            <li> it was ok, i ended up just using my fingertips, it was more difficult to apply lashes with them then without.</li>
            <li> my plastic applicator broke and this was a better replacement!</li>
            <li> This is a handy tool to have for applying eyelashes.  It helps place them in the correct spot without getting your fingers in the adhesive.</li>
            <li> Putting on false lashes was really hard for me. But with this handy tool i have a much easier time getting them on!</li>
            <li> works perfectly and got here before time expected!!</li>
            <li> this came in pretty quick ! I expected this to be flimsy and a cheap material but i was soooo wrong ! its VERY sturdy and actually helps me put the lashes on unlike the ones like Ardell give you. i suggest this for everyone who wears falsies, it makes things so much easier ! especially for beginners, i wish i had this when i was starting !</li>
            <li> This arrived from China almost a month after my initial order. I just wish that the sellers could be more communicative in regards to shipment, otherwise I am happy with the purchase. It took lots of practice but it is an effective tool used primarily for  the steady and meticulous application of false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Not so practical as i expected, they dont open much, so you end up hitting the lashes, u can not grab the lashes with it</li>
            <li> Life is easier with this eyelash tool. Thank you. I wear my lashes everyday. This tool takes me less than 5 minutes to put them on.</li>
            <li> But this tool makes it easier for me to put on lashes.</li>
            <li> kind of stiff and hard to use</li>
            <li> I like them. Nothing wrong with the product. I like that they are metal as I have a few of the plastic ones that come with the lash packs. These are smaller and sometimes I find that it&#x27;s easier to use than the other one and sometimes not. So, it&#x27;s just a preference. Because they are so cheap to buy and came from China, I ordered 2. Will probably get one away as part of a gift one day.</li>
            <li> Arrived very promptly. Good grip, much better than the plastic ones. Good quality and definitely a keeper. Makes putting on strip lashes easier.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN APPLY MY EYELASHES LOVE IT SUPPER COOL AND SMALL. loveee it</li>
            <li> Very awkward trying to use due to its shape</li>
            <li> I bought these for applying false lashes, they didn&#x27;t grip them at all I had to use fingers, also took long to ship. Was very inexpensive though,</li>
            <li> I love this item and ended up purchasing more of them. I will be buying more just in case I lose mine.</li>
            <li> Very Good Product. I love it! :</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product is necessary or not. It serves the purpose of putting false eyelashes on, but everyone has different shape eyes, so not necessarily is it made to fit. It feels like it gets in the way when I use it versus to just putting false eyelashes on by hand.</li>
            <li> Because of the shape of the &#x27;foot&#x27;, eyelash application is easier.</li>
            <li> Arrived early , easy to use . Good grip and perfect tension . I am very satisfied .</li>
            <li> Worked great for me I&#x27;m a beginner with false lashes but this helped my apply them. It also came with a small pouch to put it in when your not using it.</li>
            <li> It helps. I still use my regular tweezers but this helps line up the lashes to your eye. I use it when I need to</li>
            <li> I use these for applying false eyelashes. Works great! I plan on buying more. Only ones that work for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it. Fairly unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Havent used it yet because there are no directions. They should have sent directions in English to me instead of a business card to buy more stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, these didn&#x27;t help me but maybe that&#x27;s just my fault. For whatever reason, I just can&#x27;t seem to put lashes on successfully.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool to apply false lashes bands with.</li>
            <li> My fingers make it hard to see when I put my false lashes on. Now I can put them on easier and faster!</li>
            <li> The handle a Little stiff but good for its price</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. Great for pulling lashes into place. Closes up a little sometimes. But it&#x27;s fine. I like this.</li>
            <li> I have long nails and was having issues trying to put on my eyelashes. This little tool is absolutely perfect! LOVE it and would recommend to anyone who is tired of putting an eye out while getting their lashes on.</li>
            <li> It works well enough, although I&#x27;m terrified that I&#x27;ll poke my eye out every time I use it. Since I&#x27;m finally able to apply eyelashes to my lids and not halfway on my eyebrows like as I usually do, I&#x27;ll deal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not easy to use at all - perhaps down to my inexperience, but still ....</li>
            <li> it can help you hold the lashes properly..it is a bit roughly cut and sharp so be careful. IMO, It doesnt make it any easier.....BUT I will say that it DOES help hold the lashes to apply them if you do not want to handle them with your fingers, or mix them up with other makeup, glue, etc.</li>
            <li> the clamp is crooked and does not hold the eyelash</li>
            <li> Great for extension lashes</li>
            <li> Took a while to arrive but the funny thing is that it arrived the day of my party! I went to the mail and didn&#x27;t even know what it was until I opened it up. Great product, put my lashes on great!</li>
            <li> This is as described arrived ahead of anticipated date and is super easy to use. It does not crimp the eyelashes and allows one-handed application.  I like that it can be sterilized and comes with a storage pouch.  It is definitely worth the tiny expense and such a simple idea that works as intended. I am happy with this product and I recommend it without hesitation. You dont need instructions but a pictorial is provided on the pouch.</li>
            <li> Took a while to come but I love it! It helps get the false lashes right where they are supposed to be</li>
            <li> I never knew these existed until coming on amazon. Have yet to try them but I know we&#x27;re going to have a wonderful life together.</li>
            <li> item was a little smaller than expected. the end helps with the application on the corners of the lashes tho.</li>
            <li> Does not hold the lashes securely,  in order to puy them in place, it won&#x27;t squeeze tightly</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever. As far as the item I felt like it didn&#x27;t do what I thought it was going to do. I ended up just going back to my regular tweezers to put my lashes on.</li>
            <li> Very good easy to use</li>
            <li> What are you going to do, just hold the lashes up to the lid with this?  It doesn&#x27;t have the mobility that fingers have to help press and attach the lashes to the lid.  I find it kind of useless but who knows, I&#x27;m not that experienced with applying lashes.  This is just my experience.  I don&#x27;t really see the need for this applicator tool.</li>
            <li> this tool is really good because i have long nails that make putting on lashes a pain. now with this tool, its so quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and we&#x27;ll made.  Love them would definitely buy them again!</li>
            <li> Very useful tool for false lashes.</li>
            <li> So much easy with this</li>
            <li> Will never do lashes without this again!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tools ever! No more do I have to try and get my false eyelashes on with my finger tips or tweezers. This tool makes it so easy to put them on, in the right spot, the first time. If you wear false lashes you definitely need this tool.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  My fingers do a better job, but I&#x27;ve found many other uses for this item unrelated to eyelash application.</li>
            <li> I am in love. I like wearing false lashes, but I have a devil of a time applying them, because I can never see what I&#x27;m doing. This lets you apply the lashes without your hand getting in the way, and I love it. I will definitely be purchasing more of these as gifts.</li>
            <li> its a good product. they usually sell this item in store for about 6 to 10 dollars. So you save a lot.</li>
            <li> Very helpful nt very good at putting them on so this was a great buy</li>
            <li> I bought this to insure cleanliness for my clients (I&#x27;m a MUA) so in order to avoid using my fingers when coming to falsies I bought this and it creates much easier control of placement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it also came earlier than the suggested delivery date which was a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for MUAs and anyone else who applies false lashes on a daily basis. If you&#x27;d like to see my work follow @/makeupbykaylannie on Instagram!</li>
            <li> Makes putting on the eyelashes easy because my big fingers aren&#x27;t in my eyes!  It&#x27;s just like having an extra hand, kind of...  I liked using it.  You still have to carefully press your lashes down into place, but it was so much easier to see what I was doing.</li>
            <li> This is something I ordered for my wife and it urns out to be a great move. The wife says it works great and it was just what she needed it make putting on eye lashes so easy. I would give it 5 stars it just took a while to get but it was worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used false eyelashes for years with regular tweezers and felt like a change. These are great! Perfect tension and easy to use. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite but it works practice makes the difference 👍</li>
            <li> I just received my eyelash applicator and I love it  and I will recommend that people buy it thanks so much</li>
            <li> I love this it applies my eyelashes very easily and evenly without a mess it was very helpful to me</li>
            <li> I found the applicator tool to be easy to use, once I figured out the correct pressure to hold the eyelashes during application. The fish tool on the other end is very useful for poking the eyelashes for correct placement.</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as I expected and felt it was too wide. I went back to my regular tweezers to apply lashes.</li>
            <li> idk if im using it wrong or what.. thought it would have been easier, guess i need more practice with this product.</li>
            <li> I have to have these to put eyelashes on now!</li>
            <li> Am a rookie at lashes and all its works but this helped me alot in placing the lashes almost perfect...&lt;br /&gt;Con- it took almost a month to get to me...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using this to apply eyelash strips. I think this works better for individual eyelashes. It&#x27;s difficult to use if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand which I don&#x27;t have!!!</li>
            <li> It definitely great to use.  I just have to get use to holding it right.  Definitely great, I am able to place it where I want it.</li>
            <li> Helps with applying lashes and is okay quality. Not the best but decent. decent. There r better for the price but these will do ...</li>
            <li> I received these in less than two weeks, and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;I like cutting my lashes in half and/or using only lash accents.&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect tool for a great price, not flimsy either.</li>
            <li> It comes from China - so it take a while but it is very good for applying lashes</li>
            <li> WORKS TO KEEP PLACEMENT STEDY</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this tool.. I mean I can&#x27;t manage to use regular tweezers to get my eyelashes on so I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this. Boy was I wrong! This is the best thing to put fake eyelashes on with! Both ends are completely functional and make applying your eyelashes easy! Definetly glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier to apply false lashes</li>
            <li> The outcome was to mutual satisfaction</li>
            <li> This tool makes applying eyelashes easier for a novice like myself. I had questions that were answered promptly and the product arrived earlier than expected....... Thank you</li>
            <li> this eyelash tool is great to apply eyelashes. it stays open to just right for holding the eyelashes in place until dried in place</li>
            <li> Helps me put on my lashes easier</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this tool, but I knew I needed something to help me apply my lashes.  Tweezers are dangerous for me as I am shaky and impatient.  My fingers are too thick to go at it alone.  This tool keeps me on an even aim and makes my application quick and hassle-free.....my own word...lol... i know it sounds too good to be true but I am sorry it took me so long to try this out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing lashes and this made them 10x easier to put on! Would definitely suggest for both a newbie and a guru!</li>
            <li> These work great! Much much easier to apply lashes now!!</li>
            <li> thought I would just try it because of the price but it works quite well and being all metal if a little glue gets on it just wipes right off.</li>
            <li> These little things make such a difference when I&#x27;m applying eyelashes! They are so easy to use, cheap and did I mention how easy they make putting on eyelashes?  Genius tool and a must have for eyelash wearers.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as pictured, great shipping time! No complaints at all, great price for the quality!</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Self explanatory really. Mine arrived very well packaged and no marks on it whatsoever. Definitely does the job, although I am new to false lashes, this helps a ton!</li>
            <li> I received them early, they were more than I expected. I luv them they make. Putting my false lashes on much easier. I went from taking 30 min to 15 min. They cut down half the time. I will recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I recently got comfortable with strip lashes. This tool is wonderful since I absolutely STINK at using ordinary tweezers or my fingers to apply strip lashes. It is much more comfy to use that the hair-clip looking applicator offered by KISS/IENVY.</li>
            <li> I barely use it. Im better off with my fingers.</li>
            <li> i love this little thing it really helps you when trying to put on your lashes especially for a beginner like me!</li>
            <li> l can see the differents in the look there more straight and l dont struggle to put my lashes on this is a must item</li>
            <li> I love this lash applicator! Especially for applying corner lashes such as Ardell&#x27;s Accent Lashes! It is perfect for that. I have not tried them on strip lashes yet. I would recommend them for the half or corner lashes. This is much better than the plastic applicators that you see out there.</li>
            <li> This tool makes lash application so much faster, simpler, and less unwieldy than manual application. The clip holds the lash firmly in place and holds its shape without damaging it while you apply glue. Once the glue&#x27;s ready, you can apply the lash directly to your lid. I used to dread lash application: I needed two more hands; my hands would get in the way; I&#x27;d get the lashes crooked; the lashes would fall off, and/or I&#x27;d get glue matted up in my real lashes. Now I can apply like a pro. Well, almost; I&#x27;m getting there! There is a bit of a learning curve for using this, but it&#x27;s still a lot easier for me than manual application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being stainless, it&#x27;s also very easy to keep clean and sanitary. Just an added perk.</li>
            <li> I found this tool for applying eyelashes and it&#x27;s AMAZING! I wonder why we can&#x27;t find them in our drug stores - they are a must have for sure!</li>
            <li> Seemed like a great product and I was really hoping that it would help me when applying my lashes.  This tool seems a bit clumsy but it may just be me or the way I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> it pretty cool..I like it but need to practice more with it..it came super fast great customer service...I recommended to my friends already</li>
            <li> Took a while to receive from this seller but it was worth the wait. Makes eyelash application a lot easier for beginner&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I will never put on eyelashes without using this too;l again. I am able to get right down to the lash line</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use!</li>
            <li> the spring that opens it doesn&#x27;t open it enough for long, super curvy lashes.  the design needs a little improvement.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A NICE CONCEPT, AND I THOUGHT WHILE LEARNING HOW TO APPLY EYELASHES, THIS WOULD HELP, UNFORTUNATELY ITS HARD TO WORK WITH. YOUR BETTER OF JUST BUYING CUTICLE STICKS AND WORKING WITH THAT. I ONLY USED THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES--DIDNT REALLY CARE FOR IT.</li>
            <li> These are very use. I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone who has trouble applying fake lashes with fingers. These make the process go much more smoothly with minimal fussing, and they&#x27;re great for adjusting anyway!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great but it helps some. I just need to be a bit more coordinated, I guess</li>
            <li> I really tried loving this product but It is bulky and the space between the tongs isn&#x27;t wide enough. You sort have have to feed your lashes into it from the side. It took me forever to get the lashes loaded and the glue on them.  I immediately went right back to tweezers.</li>
            <li> Easy to figure out how to use and very handy for false lashes. Just what I was looking for! Very inexpensive tool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing falsies occasionally for years, and I never used any of the tools or anything. These are so worth it. They make putting on falsies a breeze and I don&#x27;t get glue all over my fingers.</li>
            <li> Literally took me a whole month to receive it, that when it came I thought it was a mistake. Hahah&lt;br /&gt;Nothing beats the price though</li>
            <li> frist of all i dont know how to use it i came with nothing it would be better with  help</li>
            <li> Really like it and still learning how to use it.</li>
            <li> Waited a while which was expected, but glad I did they are great for applying eyelashes</li>
            <li> these work but they are tricky and take some getting used to. Needs practice I guess lol. I do like them though</li>
            <li> Works ok once you get used to and and figure the way it works best for you. For the price I paid it works well</li>
            <li> This item arrived ahead of time and in good order. I Couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  At first it was difficult to keep it closed on the false lash while I placed it on my eyelid but after a few practice run I got the hang of it. This allows you to see exactly where your puting your lashes without your hands being in the way. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it holds the eyelash perfectly so i can add the glue but kinda make the lashes stick together. i will keep using it and hopefully i can get the lashes to not stick together</li>
            <li> Excellent to handle eyelashes and easy to apply, definitely recommend this, perfect for holding and applying eyelashes, and remove eyelashes. In the past i used my fingers and shorter tool for application, however nothing so far has compared to the great product.</li>
            <li> Item came early I opened the product and when I touched it, a greenish film like rust come off of it.</li>
            <li> This tool quickly became one of the most indispensable things in my makeup bag! At first it didn&#x27;t help but now I&#x27;ve figured out how to use it. Put adhesive on the lashes, grip them about 2/3 of the way up with a curve in them similar to your lash shape. I hold them so the lashes point straight up towards my eyebrows (so I can see what Im doing and to avoid getting glue on my real lashes - don&#x27;t worry, they will lay right when you put them on) and set them in the middle of your lash line, pulling the lashes one way or the other if I need to. Squeeze the grip shut and use the curved part as a tool to push the false lashes into your lashes, and use the long pointed parts to grab each end and place it right on your lash line. Repeat pushing the lashes down with the tool. Now the most important part: GENTLY CLAMP THE TOOL OVER THE LASHES AND SQUEEZE THEM INTO YOUR OWN LASHES. Don&#x27;t pinch your eyelid. This will adhere them very well and ensure that the are right at the lash line. Using this method I get a perfect lash application almost every time, they look so much more natural now than when I used a tweezer. It takes a little practice but you should get the hang of it very quickly, and this tool with become irreplaceable.</li>
            <li> With this non-tweezer hold the strip at the middle and start from the inside out.  Part of the trick is to not close your eye completely because when you do your lash line creases, causing unevenness.  Try to get the strip as close the lash line as possible.  You will have a few seconds to re-adjust if you are too far from your own lashes.  Once in place press and hold falsies against your lashes for 30 seconds.  Then put on liner –liquid is best to cover the line and your mascara, take a deep breath and start on the other eye. That how I do it.</li>
            <li> Love it! I like that it&#x27;s a little longer that way it gives you room to see where you are placing your lashes</li>
            <li> Pretty good tool for the cost.  I&#x27;m always looking for different ways to apply lashes and I&#x27;d say for the cost it&#x27;s worth trying at least.</li>
            <li> i am new to the fake eyelash thing.. but so far.. I have found I have a knack for it! This product makes it that much easier! I can see where I am applying it, and if it is not perfect upon 1st application it is easy to correct with this product.. the reach is great, the ergonomic(sp)design makes it easy to apply.. overall a great product... it lost a star because with the design it is easy to apply in the right eye(in my opinion) but harder on the left..</li>
            <li> Somehow in using this item, it got lost.. I think it worked well. Been looking for it since I got it, but it arrived as guaranteed and I used it once. Ask me where it is. I guess it should have a chain on it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I prefer tweezers, maybe just because it&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to using. However my husband is a former medic in the Army and currently in college to be a nurse and he likes to keep an emergency kit handy- I swear we must have 20 kits around here. When he was still in the Army he would always steal my tweezers and add them to his aid bag. Now that he&#x27;s out it has switched to his kits. There&#x27;s no winning with him. I would argue with him about it all the time as he insisted he didn&#x27;t take them and I misplaced them and I&#x27;m just trying take the tweezers out of his kit rather than look for my tweezers (which was actually what he was doing)- even when I bought pink tweezers and found them in his gear, as if the Army issues pink tweezers- I should know, I&#x27;m medically retired Army supply. I would always give up in our arguments and he would get my tweezers since &#x27;being prepared for an emergency outweighs the need for a makeup tool&#x27; and my suggestions of him getting his own damn tweezers would always be ignored or he would just come back later and take them when I wasn&#x27;t around. GRRRrrr!!! So damn frustrating...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, there&#x27;s no more arguments since I got this tool, instead he just whines because he can&#x27;t find tweezers. He has no need for this so he leaves it alone. I doubt he even knows what it is. Like I said at the top of this comment, I&#x27;d still rather use tweezers, but since those are constantly gone I guess I&#x27;m better off with these. At least these stick around and fortunately I&#x27;m lucky enough to not have to worry about having a uni-brow or really bushy brows, or I would look like a real mess by now.</li>
            <li> not sure why but I suck at putting fake eyelashes on so this little tool only made me hate the process even more - but that is my experience - maybe it really works for others.</li>
            <li> I am a freelance make up artist and my clients are primarily brides. I recently purchased this tool and used it to apply strip lashes. If you are not used to using a tool to apply false lashes, there is a small learning curve. It does a good job of holding the lash in place while you center it on the lash line. I used the back end of the tool to push the lash down into the client&#x27;s natural lashes. I used this with Ardell lashes and the clear Revlon lash adhesive with the fine brush applicator. From a professional point of view, I like the fact that it is stainless steel and can be easily sanitized between clients. Considering it is mailed from Asia, it arrived quite quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003TTB4SG Revlon Precision Lash Adhesive 0.17 fl oz]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B003ZS8MMW Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 102 Demi, Black (Pack of 4)]]</li>
            <li> I received my items 5 days before the delivery date which was good... If you know how to use it then it will be a great tool I love lashes i wear them everyday so this has helped me a lot... I just wish it was a bigger piece but overall 5 stars</li>
            <li> its actual metal.&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;it makes putting eyelashes on sooo much easier!!&lt;br /&gt;its easy  to use. and its the perfect size!</li>
            <li> Really helps a lot...I prefer them than regular teasers...for those that are learning how to apply eye lashes I recommend them...it worked for me C:</li>
            <li> Very helpful for makeup artist, especially for applying lashes on clients</li>
            <li> So worth the wait. I thought the wait was gonna be so long and since I wasn&#x27;t in a rush..... Let me tell you, I use these all the time. Should have gotten a couple of these. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price and work wonderful. I use them in all my youtube tutorials. The shipping was fast and came nicely wrapped. Had mine for a couple of months now.</li>
            <li> But if there is, I couldn&#x27;t find it.  And since everything was in Chinese....the grasping end doesn&#x27;t grasp well at all.  And the glue stuck to it instead of my lash line and lashes. Can&#x27;t really endorse this.</li>
            <li> The product was affordable and it works! Was shipped pretty quickly too!!</li>
            <li> These are a little awkward to use. They grab the lashes nicely, but they don&#x27;t allow you to bend them with the natural curve of your eye. I found my self putting the lash to my eye then using my fingers to adjust.</li>
            <li> This is a good tool to use but it doesn&#x27;t help much.. I like starting out using it to stick to the middle of my eyelash line then I use my finger on the other sides of the eyelash, so it&#x27;s not that helpful to me.</li>
            <li> Better than the plastic one I got at walmart.</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy little tool that definitely helps me to apply my lashes. It keep me from getting makeup on my fingers and/or smearing my eye makeup. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I brought this but then I realized is better to use my fingers and tweezer It came on time for that price is good</li>
            <li> Using my hands seemed to be easier than having these tweezers. But at this price, can&#x27;t be too mad. If your curios, go ahead.... But don&#x27;t expect much. 3 stars for price</li>
            <li> I found this took helpful when applying false eyelashes, but it&#x27;s a bit to large. I think they could have made the end smaller for more precise placement. I don&#x27;t use it ever time I wear eyelashes because I find it easier to use tweezers, but I think it can be helpful for others who maybe have larger eyes.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but functional! A good product of the less is more variety, it works very well in spite of it&#x27;s plain appearance.&lt;br /&gt;Retro, Goth, burlesque or anyone wearing false eyelashes would do well with this...an easy recommend!</li>
            <li> It takes a minute or two to get the hang of using this.. However&lt;br /&gt;when you get it, you get it.</li>
            <li> Its a great product. It takes a while to receive, but It gets the job done. I am completely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works good does its job . Received on time</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Makes putting fake lashes so much easier. All my friends loved it and always borrows it.</li>
            <li> Makes applying lashes nice and easy for us rookies!</li>
            <li> I like this little tool, I have try serial times to wear lashes but I couldn&#x27;t put them on, now it&#x27;s so easy with the tool.</li>
            <li> I love these for putting on eyelashes. The shape makes it easy to apply them and they seem like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Never put on lashes before I like this it help put them on and holds the lash so you can put the glue on it great deal came on time</li>
            <li> It makes applying my lashes a lot easier</li>
            <li> This little tool is a must have for people who use the eyelashes....this thing made it SO much easier for me to apply &amp; then my fake lashes started looking the way they were supposed to when I put them on :)</li>
            <li> This was really helpful for me when i put on lashes.... the only thing is i tend to pinch my skin because im still a newbie.... othwe then rhat grwat product great price</li>
            <li> Regular twizers work way better</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not coordinated, but I can&#x27;t get it to work. Could be me, could be the product. You be the judge</li>
            <li> These are way too small to hold the eyelashes. Fortunately it was not expensive, but they are worthless and cheap.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them much as I don&#x27;t wear false eye-lashes all the time but they are much more comfortable than using tweezers or just my fingers when applying the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Would defintely recommend them.</li>
            <li> So the 1st one never came months later. Had to contact seller and Sarah (lady I emailed with) was very nice and resent another one. Arrived a wk later than stated, but it is arriving from another country and going through customs soooo.. I won&#x27;t go out of my way to do business with them again because it took so much longer than said, and lost product just for this item when it was so really a fill in to save on shipping. If it is something I want and they can guarantee if I email before than I will see. Product is fine, well. You really could just use tweezers or hemostats (scissors with flat rounded tops). good product though!</li>
            <li> Tools is very solid and seems very durable.  Would buy again. Comes looking exactly like the photo in the description.</li>
            <li> Never been able to apply bottom lashes before, but using his nifty little tool, I did it on the first try!</li>
            <li> I saw this tool and purchased it immediately-LOL...  I have such a hard time applying lashes, that I gave up on wearing them. This tool does help line the lash up with your lash line. I like it a lot; you can&#x27;t go wrong with the cheap price either. I don&#x27;t think anyone would be disappointed if they tried it out. I think I like it so much because the price decreased to something like $2.99, hell - you can&#x27;t go wrong with that-LOL!!!</li>
            <li> Took a minute to get it in the mail. But once received, it met my expectations. Packaged well. No instructions. I dropped them in a boiling pot of water,to sterilize. And they make applying lashes so much easier.</li>
            <li> I love it, they&#x27;re really good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price.....</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because it took awhile to come, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok.  It does the job.  But not very study</li>
            <li> I luv it! I apply my eyelashes really fast w this. Its a  must have</li>
            <li> Great, would buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> It is good for personal usage of lashes .</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work well for me...but may work well for others.  I have a fused joint in my thumb and holding this was awkward.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty great. Slight learning curve but much MUCH better than applying eyelashes with fingers alone.</li>
            <li> Works great for holding false lashes..</li>
            <li> This is an indispensable tool to apply eyelashes. Especially to pick them up after glue has been applied so it does not get all over your hands and results in pulling off your eyelashes after they&#x27;ve been applied. The tool also makes accurate placement easy as your hands don&#x27;t obscure your face while you&#x27;re trying to put it on. A little adjustment is still required, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator feels strange at first and you may drop your eyelash but after some practice it makes the process much easier. The stainless steel makes it easy to clean. I am giving it 4 stars as it could have been a little more flexible.</li>
            <li> Still trying to figure out how to hold lashes in place properly with tweezer</li>
            <li> Its exactly what i wanted. Makes putting on lashes super easy. It puts it really close to the real lashes n u just adjust the ends. I love it!</li>
            <li> This made false eyelashes application fast and easy. A very useful tool.</li>
            <li> I s more easy for me to put the fake eyelash using this clip&lt;br /&gt;after try 2 or 3 times I do it perfect and more fast with this</li>
            <li> Its OK I barely use it.</li>
            <li> This eyelash applicator was used by someone else and it had stains and sticky residue all over it. Do not recommend this to anyone. Just go to Walmart and buy one that looks better and is not used.</li>
            <li> works perfectly, came quickly, and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Item worked very well, lash fitted well when using this tool. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> terrible don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Great for applying false lashes precisely.  Love them.</li>
            <li> Very easy &amp; simple to use</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work well at all. Fast shipping and good condition. Dont work well</li>
            <li> I find that in order to use this applicator, I have to squeeze pretty tightly so the lashes don&#x27;t fall out of the tool. When I squeeze tightly, though, it sometimes bends the lashes. Plus, it&#x27;s not that nimble and not that great for final placement. I keep finding myself going back to my regular tweezers to finish off the job. I really wanted to use this - looked like a great concept, but it just doesn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> Love this tool. Reasonable price and quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to fake eyelashes, but honestly using my fingers is much easier for me than using this tool. Maybe once i get better at it, I&#x27;ll change my technique. I&#x27;m sure if you are putting them on someone else it&#x27;s very useful. It does seem very sturdy and good quality for the price though! I was impressed when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Durable, lightweight, and makes eyelash application much easier! Recommend this for experience and inexperience false eyelash wearers!</li>
            <li> these handy little tools are perfect to help in putting the eyelash on placing it pressing it and not getting glue on you</li>
            <li> Pointless tool, not helpful in putting on lashes.</li>
            <li> It makes the application process easier and for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> this wasnt for me and im not a girl so idk what to say but im assuming it gets the job done</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, it does do the job.</li>
            <li> Great device to help unsteady hands.</li>
            <li> love it high quality  helps a lot , arrived late</li>
            <li> Perfect!! Shipping takes a long time...</li>
            <li> This tool is difficult to use.  I have to use it more often to get the hang of it I suppose, but I will let you know soon if I find it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Such a big help with applying my false lashes. Makes it about 100 times easier and I&#x27;m so happy with it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curve to the lashes all that great and I find it&#x27;s faster and easier just to use my fingers or regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> It more easier to use...</li>
            <li> So difficult to use, but cheap..</li>
            <li> These are perfect it males applying eyelashes easy... it now takes me like 20 aeconds to apply with these</li>
            <li> I received this product fairly quick. I think it a great design and a great concept, but I really don&#x27;t think it helps to get your lashes on better. I like my bare hands better.</li>
            <li> Gives you extra time to place the lashes on! It takes a little getting used to, but so does putting on lashes!</li>
            <li> Really helps with application</li>
            <li> There alright, I don&#x27;t know if it me or the tool I am still having a hard time putting on lashes.</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier to apply false eyelashes. It is a  very useful tool to purchase for anyone using them.</li>
            <li> Great and useful tool !!</li>
    </ol>
