            <li>For the legs, it is okay.</li>

            <li>I cannot believe how smooth my legs are with this razor!</li>
            <li>I love Venus razors.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Many have come and gone.</li>
            <li>The women who used them seemed pleased, so, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring.</li>
            <li>I have seen people swear by their favorite brands</li>
            <li>Love these razors.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, love it.</li>
            <li>The razor is amazing, and my legs have never been so smooth .</li>
            <li>I love the design of this toolkit.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re not my favorite -</li>
            <li>I love Venus</li>
            <li>but this razor isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t love it because of that one flaw.</li>
            <li>She loves it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more cheaper here than the stores.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite razor of all time</li>
            <li>&amp; I love that you can use the handle with any number of their interchangeable cartridges.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>They have much better pricing than any of the discount stores or grocery stores.  </li>
            <li>5 blades definitely work the best.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li>Love the Embrace razor.</li>
            <li>Love this razor and had to get my husband one</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and it gives a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking that it is better than my Husbands Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>I have one blade disposable razors work better .</li>
            <li>The 3 blades are way better will not purchase another Venus ever..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, getting to the part that&#x27;s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing.</li>
            <li>it is much much better than others</li>
            <li>My favorite blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this Razor.  </li>
            <li>One of the things I love about this razor is that you don&#x27;t have to shave as often.</li>
            <li>I was told by my sister and I let eveyone know how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>The moisture ribbon is a good addition because it aids in providing a smooth shave that is free from cuts.</li>
            <li>Many Venus razors have come and gone in my house.</li>
            <li>I used to have to throw on some stockings to cover it up but using the tea tree oil wash I can be comfortable in my own skin again.</li>
            <li>I have tried others but I have given up as there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>But I had the opportunity to get a free sample of this razor, and thought hey, maybe a women&#x27;s razor would be a nice upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this razor..</li>
            <li>Seems like they just keep coming out with better products.</li>
            <li>Love the close shave with no nicks.</li>
            <li>It is much better than my thought.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I would be one to gush about a razor, of all things, but I LOVE this razor.  </li>
            <li>I love the 5 blades and it gives a quicker cleaner cut.</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>I love this razor and that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus handle.</li>
            <li>I simply love this razor.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the better razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>So for any of you reading this trust me that the hydrosilk by schick is much better.</li>
            <li>I have waxed my legs before and to me, shaving with this razor is much better.</li>
            <li>My wife feel in love with it.</li>
            <li>Been using the Venus for a year and 1/2 now and recommend them to any woman wanting a smooth leg!</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>sweet  timely and bargin love this product,,One for me one for my daughter!</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an older razor for my wife and she said this works great.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to hold, and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Its super smooth, super efficient, Its a great razor.</li>
            <li>This one works just as good and the price is more reasonable.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin and these work great for me.</li>
            <li>The Embrace hs soothing pads at the top and bottom which help moisturize the skin right after shaving which is nice.</li>
            <li>Gives a very smooth shave and cuts very rarely through my skin.</li>
            <li>It also lasts for a couple more shaves then cheap razors</li>
            <li>But as noted above, the shave is incredible.</li>
            <li>I switched to the schick 4 blade, works much better for those important places.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth It makes my legs after I shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and glides over your skin smoothly for a nice clean shave on the legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very light razor, about as light as one of the cheap disposables.</li>
            <li>and i actually left it there on accident good thing i bought one just for the trip!</li>
            <li>So easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>The built in moistener gets sticky and clogges the blades also with hair and shave cream gets clogged easily and takes longer to shave.</li>
            <li>The handle grips fairly easily</li>
            <li>We both like the timely manner, Very quick.</li>
            <li>Has moisturizer all over it so easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and when I saw the deal on it, I jumped right on it!</li>
            <li>and it comes with two refills.. pretty handy .. and underarms dont feel scratchy after using this one..</li>
            <li>Have used this for the first time after seeing the ad in TV and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I know inexperience was part of the problem, but she does just fine with the venus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the razor itself is fine.</li>
            <li>Does a fine job.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite razor!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Venus Embrace razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using cheap dollar store razors for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Press lightly and don&#x27;t touch the blades</li>
            <li>I thought the holder for the razor and extra blades was a great idea too</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this one,but it gave me razor burn, and it&#x27;s not as smooth as the iNtuitio razor</li>
            <li>This razor gives a smooth shave without lots of nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>it keeps me silky smooth</li>
            <li>Plus her legs are smooth, so</li>
            <li>The blade on this razor leaves a smooth feeling on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have never had my legs feel so smooth after a shave.  </li>
            <li>My lags have never felt this smooth.</li>
            <li>smoothly</li>
            <li>The case can be attached to smooth surface</li>
            <li>However, in practice the razor glides so smoothly and shaves so closely with no pressure</li>
            <li>Anyway, the embrace is really light</li>
            <li>I recommend using this razor along with EOS Shave Cream for an extremely smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It felt smooth, the gel bars seemed to be helping it glide across my skin.</li>
            <li>and they stay smooth forver after</li>
            <li>It feels smooth to use while shaving, and my legs are so smooth after shaving.  </li>
            <li>No cuts and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using venus razors for years, and i find them to be very durable and effective.</li>
            <li>It makes skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>The shave is so smooth</li>
            <li>and they leave you smooth..</li>
            <li>Venus makes my life so much easier!!!</li>
            <li>Very nice and moisturizing, shower mount and case comes with it (for the extra head).</li>
            <li>I would reccommend it to anyone wanting a clean smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>Buy it if you&#x27;re someone with sensitive skin or simply want a nice, soft, awesome razor! :)</li>
            <li>I love it, and it has worked great for me, and it leaves my skin smoother than any other that I have ever tried, and I have tried them all!</li>
            <li>It is super gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>it has been many moons, since the first time I started shaving my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li>Forget the pretty packaging to lure you in and try one of the men&#x27;s shavers - I promise you the difference in quality of shave is astonishing</li>
            <li>original review was in October</li>
            <li>I love venus razors and use them pretty exclusively, but the &amp;#34;embrace&amp;#34; just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li>razor leaves your legs nice and soft, with a fine shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super smooth.</li>
            <li>say goodbye to all of that since this baby comes with a suction cup holder that allows water to cleanly drift off of it.  </li>
            <li>One can buy cheap razors about anywhere, but Gillette makes an extraordinary product.  </li>
            <li>Shaves clean with no sticky residue like some.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really gets my lower legs smooth, which is great because when I take my pain meds I can feel every single hair touching my pant legs.  </li>
            <li>It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs.</li>
            <li>A very smooth and gently cut.</li>
            <li>Great product as expected from Gillette.</li>
            <li>and this is the only razor that consistently gives me a great shave without using gel.</li>
            <li>And as it goes in the advertisement, it DOES do a very close shave, much much better than the electrical one I have( Panasonic).</li>
            <li>I love Venus razors but what really took the cake for this purchase&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>I also loved the fact that it came with the extra cartridge</li>
            <li>No bad .No</li>
            <li>no bad</li>
            <li>After about 30 seconds, it started to burn a bit, but I quickly rinsed off and that seemed to help it.</li>
            <li>The razor was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The shave was pretty smooth</li>
            <li>I like it very much!  </li>
            <li>love my venus razor couldnt live with out it.</li>
            <li>I love my new razor.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, this razor was overall pretty good.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and easy on my legs.</li>
            <li>The case has space for the two refill cartridges so the whole kit can be easily stored together.</li>
            <li>Product is excellent, last a long time</li>
            <li>Recently received this razor and 2 Venus heads through my Influenster program - and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>The ladies in our household only use the Venus shavers and the deal we got on Amazon for a new one with two cartridges was great.</li>
            <li>Super smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li>bacause those cheap dollar store razers cut her to much.</li>
            <li>Not quite as smooth and gentle of a shave as I thought.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money for a close shave with fewer nicks.</li>
            <li>and i feel it really worth the price.</li>
            <li>Close shave and rarely have I ever cut myself.</li>
            <li>the handy holder that came with it to hold the extra cartridges&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Perfect razor for women to remove unnecessary hair.</li>
            <li>I love how the different cartridges fit on each handle</li>
            <li>I rarely ever cut myself anymore.</li>
            <li>I also found that I did not get anywhere near the close and long-lasting shave I&#x27;ve enjoyed when using a men&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li>The refills can be pricey, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li>Although the replacement cartridges can be arguably pricey, the end result is always well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Hydrosilk for about six months now and it is by far a better razor.</li>
            <li>I have been using many razors and the Venus Embrace is by far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rare that I cut myself shaving anymore, it really does curve to your body as you</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I can&#x27;t get the suction cup to stick to my shower wall, so it&#x27;s not doing me a lot of good.  </li>
            <li>Got it right away.</li>
            <li>Price is right and it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>The burning feeling is gone right after use</li>
            <li>and I do really like this one, leaves my legs pretty smooth without leaving nicks.</li>
            <li>I use them to shave my balls and my grundel (which is very hairy and full of dingleberries).</li>
            <li>- I was just looking for a quick, (relatively) fast way to remove unwanted stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold</li>
            <li>Very good product and blade razor last longer compared to other brands</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle to my skin</li>
            <li>There is a little &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; when I shave my legs, but it&#x27;s a good razor.  </li>
            <li>Love the big head on the razor, but once the lubrication wears out (which is VERY fast)</li>
            <li>Actually the best razor for women I&#x27;ve ever used is the plain old original Daisy disposable.</li>
            <li>The first time using Gillette is okay, but for private areas, it can&#x27;t handle the job.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite razors next to the SCHICK HYDRO because of their softness while preses against the skin</li>
            <li>I really like this one!</li>
            <li>ones)&lt;br /&gt;However this is my first use</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m quite confident it makes them last wayyyy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different razors over the years</li>
            <li>First I have to commend Venus on there packaging.</li>
            <li>this the first time i use the one which came without the soap.</li>
            <li>It shaves very!</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve nicked the back of my angles</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I gave it two stars in the first place.</li>
            <li>, I tried this out, and things seemed to be going pretty well.</li>
            <li>If you need to shave your hairy legs (and most women definitely need to do that at some point in their lives), this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not so expensive and great quality get it while you can!!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been using men&#x27;s disposable razors for the last 5 or so years because I find them to be better than the ones made for women.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered and exactly what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>It was the first time for me that I bought a Venus razor</li>
            <li>The Schick Hydro is the closest, smoothest, gentlest, easy to hold, nicely weighted razor on the market for doing legs and they last forever - a very good value if ugly as sin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that really helps cure the razor burn up right away though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to try out different blades without having to buy a whole new razor!</li>
            <li>but I have found that some of the refill cartridges don&#x27;t always work so well, kind of like they aren&#x27;t as sharp as others.</li>
            <li>I use a razor everyday on my legs and underarms just to make sure I&#x27;m as smooth as can be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time to use razor and this one worked very well.</li>
            <li>I love how long lasting and how easy it is to shave with them</li>
            <li>overall i&#x27;m very happy with venus razors and will likely keep buying them (although i&#x27;m intrigued by the men&#x27;s razors that other reviewers are recommending...)</li>
            <li>I have only used one cartridge and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>The face of the razor is almost to large, though.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Certainly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use different kinds of blades without buying a new handle.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find the same product for a little bit cheaper price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is definitely better than cheap disposable razors, but my sister complained that these could have been sharper.</li>
            <li>However, if you are like me and have discomfort while shaving then these really help.</li>
            <li>It cuts very close</li>
            <li>It gets a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, the product works very well</li>
            <li>This razor works really well for me.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like the razor itself and</li>
            <li>I ordered this package for my wife after we checked and found out how much money we could save by purchasing her razors and blade refills through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It seems as though it creates a much softer, closer to the skin, shave.  </li>
            <li>give a very close shave ..</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>and I find I don&#x27;t cut myself much at all.   </li>
            <li>And the moisturizing tips really seem to work.</li>
            <li>Tea Tree Oil Skin Wash + FREE 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil]])</li>
            <li>I really like this razor.</li>
            <li>The product also leaves the legs much smoother for longer than my razor ever did, so it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
            <li>It gives you a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I really like that I can change the heads to</li>
            <li>It works better than I had expected it to, I would purchase again and tell others to purchase.</li>
            <li>It gives a really close shave with out nicks or scrapes.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>5 blades really does make a difference</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I love the pink color.</li>
            <li>Take it slow after that your good.</li>
            <li>I works better than any other razor I have tried and I have tried a lot.  </li>
            <li>It gives an extremely close shave and will leave your legs so smooth!</li>
            <li>and I never get as many nicks on my ankles as I do with some other razors.  </li>
            <li>It has to be the embrace because the gel seems to work better than other Venus razors.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s not dirty, and she&#x27;s never gotten an infection from shaving before, so it was strange that it occurred right after switching razors.</li>
            <li>I do however refuse to buy this at full price since it only lasts about 3-4 shavings.</li>
            <li>The coupons generally range from $3-4 and are well worth it for that price.</li>
            <li>I now use them exclusively at least the brand venus all of them i have tried work well better than the other kind no razor burn for me</li>
            <li>I bought this one because I was told by many friends that five blades ensure a closer shave and less chance of cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Subsequently, I have tried many different types of depilatories (lotions, potions, waxes, razor blades and the like).</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the simply packaged product arrived at my home, just yesterday.</li>
            <li>This was decent.</li>
            <li>(I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cut myself so many times - the last cut actually took out a CHUNK of my leg in three lines.</li>
            <li>This one is very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly, highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>I am not a tiny woman 135lbs 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; - however this GIGANTIC razor is not exactly a good size for fitting in &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; places :)  Great for legs, but too expensive in my book to use on legs.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it costs a little more, but the shaving experience is just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s really efficient so far and</li>
            <li>normally my meetings are in the afternoon</li>
            <li>Honestly, who can find anything negative to say about this product?</li>
            <li>Certainly worth the extra bucks.</li>
            <li>This is not a very firm razor but certainly gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back.</li>
            <li>I am actually purchasing this right now for her</li>
            <li>The moisturizing strip also really work which I have found not to be true foe other brands  </li>
            <li>So I looked to try a new razor.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, new razor.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;had\\&quot; to have a new one in her Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li>and you can buy replacements or just buy a new one of these, either or, these and the replacements are on subscribe and save, so whichever works for you!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I feel the various different versions are that much different from each other, but it is a great razor no matter what.</li>
            <li>of venus&#x27;s products always leave my legs and body feeling incredibly smooth, and no razor burn or bumps, and they last for multiple uses!</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin and this razor does not irritate it in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just remember to change the blade in a timely fashion or be stocked to clear up razor burn!</li>
            <li>, what more can I say about it?&lt;br /&gt;It fits other Venus razor cartridges, so you don&#x27;t have to stick only to Venus Embrace</li>
            <li>I only shave about once or twice a week (more like every other day under arms).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and, as woman needing to shave every day, it&#x27;s important for me to use a really sharp razor.</li>
            <li>It fits much better in the hand than others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>That was how smooth the razor glided down my legs, and under my arms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really sharp and does really clean up the hair on my legs in one sweep pass.</li>
            <li>I lost my old razor, which was a 4-blade, and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that it wasn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li>The refill blades on this thing are nearly five dollars more per pack than the Schick Hydro blades and this razor barely lasted longer than a Daisy disposable while a single Schick Hydro blade often lasts through WEEKS of daily shaving.</li>
            <li>it comes with another cartridge as well, but each last a long time, longer than most last!</li>
            <li>no problem easy to clean the only one thats a little wierd is the olay venus ones they must be wet to work</li>
            <li>It produces great results and I never have to worry about cutting myself.  </li>
            <li>Ordered the pink color and extra cartridges along with it which arrived in one secure package just two days after ordering.</li>
            <li>These are the ONLY razors that I have ever found that are gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive legs and used to use Schick Quattro.</li>
            <li>i buy them for my 13 yr old daughter too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every ladies&#x27; razor on the market.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see stubble, after nearly twelve hours - which is unheard of, for me.</li>
            <li>, wow, I was pleasantly surprised with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it worked so soft.</li>
            <li>The men&#x27;s are so much better; they obviously don&#x27;t know how to make a women&#x27;s shaver beyond coloring them pink, and purple, and yellow.</li>
            <li>I found some natural wash made with tea tree oil ([[ASIN:B009FT5QBU Herbal Authority</li>
            <li>Was just about finished, went to shave a tiny spot on my foot, and this razor decided to really help me out by taking a dime-sized chunk of skin off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When my 14 year old lost hers at a friends, she told me she</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t see ever going back to disposable.</li>
            <li>opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original.</li>
            <li>If you have really fine hair and don&#x27;t usually worry about razor burn/cuts then these might just be &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for you.</li>
            <li>and I have dark coarse hair which means I have to shave my legs every day if I want a smooth finish</li>
            <li>High recommend if you want such a product.</li>
            <li>and I have done some MAJOR nicking in my time!</li>
            <li>Which is basically a pink chic version of the original grey men&#x27;s  razor.</li>
            <li>* sound while I was shaving, even though I used my usual shave lubricant in addition to the supposedly lubricating strip on the razor.</li>
            <li>When you use this razor be careful the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>Also the blades don&#x27;t seem to stay as sharp as my last razor, but it&#x27;s not bad for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for the upper legs, regardless of how hard you press or which direction you go into.  </li>
            <li>shave seems to last a few days longer than a cheap one blade razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only gotten one cut since  the blade was new and fresh but other than that these last me quite a while.</li>
            <li>I have not nicked my skin since I have been using it, and I normally nick myself at least once if not many many times when I shave!</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is the quickness that the blades dull, but I suppose it is my own fault for leaving it in the shower!</li>
            <li>I generally like gillette razors.  </li>
            <li>If I am in the shower long enough before I shave, I don&#x27;t need shaving cream, which really saves time.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis on my legs and have to be careful about razors because I can get really cut.  </li>
            <li>only switched razors because I had my old one forever and thought it may be time for a change.</li>
            <li>I end up only having a small pool of blood to clean up after my shower.</li>
            <li>so big one cannot even get the blade itself near the actual parts to be shaved.</li>
            <li>so it is worth the few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>In the past I occasionally had a mild break out after shaving, but never with this one.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfy to grip but still not worth paying so much for replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li>We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you&#x27;re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you&#x27;ve created.</li>
            <li>I have trouble because some of my hair is really fine and other razors just pass over the hair even if I shave several different directions to get it.</li>
            <li>I typically like the mens proglide razors and I feel they give me a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>The shavers work fine (according to my girlfriend), but I was not happy to discover that at the local market they are virtually the same price.</li>

            <li> The women who used them seemed pleased, so, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring.</li>
            <li> I have seen people swear by their favorite brands</li>
            <li> Love these razors.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, love it.</li>
            <li> The razor is amazing, and my legs have never been so smooth .</li>
            <li> I love the design of this toolkit.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re not my favorite -</li>
            <li> I love Venus</li>
            <li> but this razor isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t love it because of that one flaw.</li>
            <li> She loves it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more cheaper here than the stores.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite razor of all time</li>
            <li> &amp; I love that you can use the handle with any number of their interchangeable cartridges.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> They have much better pricing than any of the discount stores or grocery stores.  </li>
            <li> 5 blades definitely work the best.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this razor.</li>
            <li> Love the Embrace razor.</li>
            <li> Love this razor and had to get my husband one</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and it gives a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that it is better than my Husbands Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> I have one blade disposable razors work better .</li>
            <li> The 3 blades are way better will not purchase another Venus ever..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, getting to the part that&#x27;s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing.</li>
            <li> it is much much better than others</li>
            <li> My favorite blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this Razor.  </li>
            <li> One of the things I love about this razor is that you don&#x27;t have to shave as often.</li>
            <li> I was told by my sister and I let eveyone know how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> The moisture ribbon is a good addition because it aids in providing a smooth shave that is free from cuts.</li>
            <li> Many Venus razors have come and gone in my house.</li>
            <li> I used to have to throw on some stockings to cover it up but using the tea tree oil wash I can be comfortable in my own skin again.</li>
            <li> I have tried others but I have given up as there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> But I had the opportunity to get a free sample of this razor, and thought hey, maybe a women&#x27;s razor would be a nice upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this razor..</li>
            <li> Seems like they just keep coming out with better products.</li>
            <li> Love the close shave with no nicks.</li>
            <li> It is much better than my thought.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I would be one to gush about a razor, of all things, but I LOVE this razor.  </li>
            <li> I love the 5 blades and it gives a quicker cleaner cut.</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> I love this razor and that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus handle.</li>
            <li> I simply love this razor.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the better razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> So for any of you reading this trust me that the hydrosilk by schick is much better.</li>
            <li> I have waxed my legs before and to me, shaving with this razor is much better.</li>
            <li> My wife feel in love with it.</li>
            <li> Been using the Venus for a year and 1/2 now and recommend them to any woman wanting a smooth leg!</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> sweet  timely and bargin love this product,,One for me one for my daughter!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older razor for my wife and she said this works great.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to hold, and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Its super smooth, super efficient, Its a great razor.</li>
            <li> This one works just as good and the price is more reasonable.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin and these work great for me.</li>
            <li> The Embrace hs soothing pads at the top and bottom which help moisturize the skin right after shaving which is nice.</li>
            <li> Gives a very smooth shave and cuts very rarely through my skin.</li>
            <li> It also lasts for a couple more shaves then cheap razors</li>
            <li> But as noted above, the shave is incredible.</li>
            <li> I switched to the schick 4 blade, works much better for those important places.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth It makes my legs after I shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and glides over your skin smoothly for a nice clean shave on the legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a very light razor, about as light as one of the cheap disposables.</li>
            <li> and i actually left it there on accident good thing i bought one just for the trip!</li>
            <li> So easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> The built in moistener gets sticky and clogges the blades also with hair and shave cream gets clogged easily and takes longer to shave.</li>
            <li> The handle grips fairly easily</li>
            <li> We both like the timely manner, Very quick.</li>
            <li> Has moisturizer all over it so easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and when I saw the deal on it, I jumped right on it!</li>
            <li> and it comes with two refills.. pretty handy .. and underarms dont feel scratchy after using this one..</li>
            <li> Have used this for the first time after seeing the ad in TV and really liked it.</li>
            <li> I know inexperience was part of the problem, but she does just fine with the venus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the razor itself is fine.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite razor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Venus Embrace razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap dollar store razors for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Press lightly and don&#x27;t touch the blades</li>
            <li> I thought the holder for the razor and extra blades was a great idea too</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this one,but it gave me razor burn, and it&#x27;s not as smooth as the iNtuitio razor</li>
            <li> This razor gives a smooth shave without lots of nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> it keeps me silky smooth</li>
            <li> Plus her legs are smooth, so</li>
            <li> The blade on this razor leaves a smooth feeling on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have never had my legs feel so smooth after a shave.  </li>
            <li> My lags have never felt this smooth.</li>
            <li> smoothly</li>
            <li> The case can be attached to smooth surface</li>
            <li> However, in practice the razor glides so smoothly and shaves so closely with no pressure</li>
            <li> Anyway, the embrace is really light</li>
            <li> I recommend using this razor along with EOS Shave Cream for an extremely smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It felt smooth, the gel bars seemed to be helping it glide across my skin.</li>
            <li> and they stay smooth forver after</li>
            <li> It feels smooth to use while shaving, and my legs are so smooth after shaving.  </li>
            <li> No cuts and smooth feeling.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using venus razors for years, and i find them to be very durable and effective.</li>
            <li> It makes skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> The shave is so smooth</li>
            <li> and they leave you smooth..</li>
            <li> Venus makes my life so much easier!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice and moisturizing, shower mount and case comes with it (for the extra head).</li>
            <li> I would reccommend it to anyone wanting a clean smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> Buy it if you&#x27;re someone with sensitive skin or simply want a nice, soft, awesome razor! :)</li>
            <li> I love it, and it has worked great for me, and it leaves my skin smoother than any other that I have ever tried, and I have tried them all!</li>
            <li> It is super gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> it has been many moons, since the first time I started shaving my legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> Forget the pretty packaging to lure you in and try one of the men&#x27;s shavers - I promise you the difference in quality of shave is astonishing</li>
            <li> original review was in October</li>
            <li> I love venus razors and use them pretty exclusively, but the &amp;#34;embrace&amp;#34; just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li> razor leaves your legs nice and soft, with a fine shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super smooth.</li>
            <li> say goodbye to all of that since this baby comes with a suction cup holder that allows water to cleanly drift off of it.  </li>
            <li> One can buy cheap razors about anywhere, but Gillette makes an extraordinary product.  </li>
            <li> Shaves clean with no sticky residue like some.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really gets my lower legs smooth, which is great because when I take my pain meds I can feel every single hair touching my pant legs.  </li>
            <li> It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs.</li>
            <li> A very smooth and gently cut.</li>
            <li> Great product as expected from Gillette.</li>
            <li> and this is the only razor that consistently gives me a great shave without using gel.</li>
            <li> And as it goes in the advertisement, it DOES do a very close shave, much much better than the electrical one I have( Panasonic).</li>
            <li> I love Venus razors but what really took the cake for this purchase&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> I also loved the fact that it came with the extra cartridge</li>
            <li> No bad .No</li>
            <li> no bad</li>
            <li> After about 30 seconds, it started to burn a bit, but I quickly rinsed off and that seemed to help it.</li>
            <li> The razor was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> The shave was pretty smooth</li>
            <li> I like it very much!  </li>
            <li> love my venus razor couldnt live with out it.</li>
            <li> I love my new razor.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, this razor was overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and easy on my legs.</li>
            <li> The case has space for the two refill cartridges so the whole kit can be easily stored together.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent, last a long time</li>
            <li> Recently received this razor and 2 Venus heads through my Influenster program - and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The ladies in our household only use the Venus shavers and the deal we got on Amazon for a new one with two cartridges was great.</li>
            <li> Super smooth and gentle.</li>
            <li> bacause those cheap dollar store razers cut her to much.</li>
            <li> Not quite as smooth and gentle of a shave as I thought.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money for a close shave with fewer nicks.</li>
            <li> and i feel it really worth the price.</li>
            <li> Close shave and rarely have I ever cut myself.</li>
            <li> the handy holder that came with it to hold the extra cartridges&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Perfect razor for women to remove unnecessary hair.</li>
            <li> I love how the different cartridges fit on each handle</li>
            <li> I rarely ever cut myself anymore.</li>
            <li> I also found that I did not get anywhere near the close and long-lasting shave I&#x27;ve enjoyed when using a men&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> The refills can be pricey, but the quality is worth it.</li>
            <li> Although the replacement cartridges can be arguably pricey, the end result is always well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Hydrosilk for about six months now and it is by far a better razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using many razors and the Venus Embrace is by far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rare that I cut myself shaving anymore, it really does curve to your body as you</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I can&#x27;t get the suction cup to stick to my shower wall, so it&#x27;s not doing me a lot of good.  </li>
            <li> Got it right away.</li>
            <li> Price is right and it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> The burning feeling is gone right after use</li>
            <li> and I do really like this one, leaves my legs pretty smooth without leaving nicks.</li>
            <li> I use them to shave my balls and my grundel (which is very hairy and full of dingleberries).</li>
            <li> - I was just looking for a quick, (relatively) fast way to remove unwanted stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold</li>
            <li> Very good product and blade razor last longer compared to other brands</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle to my skin</li>
            <li> There is a little &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; when I shave my legs, but it&#x27;s a good razor.  </li>
            <li> Love the big head on the razor, but once the lubrication wears out (which is VERY fast)</li>
            <li> Actually the best razor for women I&#x27;ve ever used is the plain old original Daisy disposable.</li>
            <li> The first time using Gillette is okay, but for private areas, it can&#x27;t handle the job.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite razors next to the SCHICK HYDRO because of their softness while preses against the skin</li>
            <li> I really like this one!</li>
            <li> ones)&lt;br /&gt;However this is my first use</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m quite confident it makes them last wayyyy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different razors over the years</li>
            <li> First I have to commend Venus on there packaging.</li>
            <li> this the first time i use the one which came without the soap.</li>
            <li> It shaves very!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve nicked the back of my angles</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I gave it two stars in the first place.</li>
            <li> , I tried this out, and things seemed to be going pretty well.</li>
            <li> If you need to shave your hairy legs (and most women definitely need to do that at some point in their lives), this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not so expensive and great quality get it while you can!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using men&#x27;s disposable razors for the last 5 or so years because I find them to be better than the ones made for women.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and exactly what I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> It was the first time for me that I bought a Venus razor</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro is the closest, smoothest, gentlest, easy to hold, nicely weighted razor on the market for doing legs and they last forever - a very good value if ugly as sin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that really helps cure the razor burn up right away though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to try out different blades without having to buy a whole new razor!</li>
            <li> but I have found that some of the refill cartridges don&#x27;t always work so well, kind of like they aren&#x27;t as sharp as others.</li>
            <li> I use a razor everyday on my legs and underarms just to make sure I&#x27;m as smooth as can be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use razor and this one worked very well.</li>
            <li> I love how long lasting and how easy it is to shave with them</li>
            <li> overall i&#x27;m very happy with venus razors and will likely keep buying them (although i&#x27;m intrigued by the men&#x27;s razors that other reviewers are recommending...)</li>
            <li> I have only used one cartridge and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> The face of the razor is almost to large, though.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Certainly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use different kinds of blades without buying a new handle.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find the same product for a little bit cheaper price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is definitely better than cheap disposable razors, but my sister complained that these could have been sharper.</li>
            <li> However, if you are like me and have discomfort while shaving then these really help.</li>
            <li> It cuts very close</li>
            <li> It gets a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, the product works very well</li>
            <li> This razor works really well for me.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like the razor itself and</li>
            <li> I ordered this package for my wife after we checked and found out how much money we could save by purchasing her razors and blade refills through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It seems as though it creates a much softer, closer to the skin, shave.  </li>
            <li> give a very close shave ..</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> and I find I don&#x27;t cut myself much at all.   </li>
            <li> And the moisturizing tips really seem to work.</li>
            <li> Tea Tree Oil Skin Wash + FREE 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil]])</li>
            <li> I really like this razor.</li>
            <li> The product also leaves the legs much smoother for longer than my razor ever did, so it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
            <li> It gives you a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I really like that I can change the heads to</li>
            <li> It works better than I had expected it to, I would purchase again and tell others to purchase.</li>
            <li> It gives a really close shave with out nicks or scrapes.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> 5 blades really does make a difference</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I love the pink color.</li>
            <li> Take it slow after that your good.</li>
            <li> I works better than any other razor I have tried and I have tried a lot.  </li>
            <li> It gives an extremely close shave and will leave your legs so smooth!</li>
            <li> and I never get as many nicks on my ankles as I do with some other razors.  </li>
            <li> It has to be the embrace because the gel seems to work better than other Venus razors.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s not dirty, and she&#x27;s never gotten an infection from shaving before, so it was strange that it occurred right after switching razors.</li>
            <li> I do however refuse to buy this at full price since it only lasts about 3-4 shavings.</li>
            <li> The coupons generally range from $3-4 and are well worth it for that price.</li>
            <li> I now use them exclusively at least the brand venus all of them i have tried work well better than the other kind no razor burn for me</li>
            <li> I bought this one because I was told by many friends that five blades ensure a closer shave and less chance of cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Subsequently, I have tried many different types of depilatories (lotions, potions, waxes, razor blades and the like).</li>
            <li> Sure enough, the simply packaged product arrived at my home, just yesterday.</li>
            <li> This was decent.</li>
            <li> (I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cut myself so many times - the last cut actually took out a CHUNK of my leg in three lines.</li>
            <li> This one is very soft and gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly, highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I am not a tiny woman 135lbs 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; - however this GIGANTIC razor is not exactly a good size for fitting in &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; places :)  Great for legs, but too expensive in my book to use on legs.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it costs a little more, but the shaving experience is just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really efficient so far and</li>
            <li> normally my meetings are in the afternoon</li>
            <li> Honestly, who can find anything negative to say about this product?</li>
            <li> Certainly worth the extra bucks.</li>
            <li> This is not a very firm razor but certainly gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back.</li>
            <li> I am actually purchasing this right now for her</li>
            <li> The moisturizing strip also really work which I have found not to be true foe other brands  </li>
            <li> So I looked to try a new razor.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, new razor.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;had\\&quot; to have a new one in her Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> and you can buy replacements or just buy a new one of these, either or, these and the replacements are on subscribe and save, so whichever works for you!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I feel the various different versions are that much different from each other, but it is a great razor no matter what.</li>
            <li> of venus&#x27;s products always leave my legs and body feeling incredibly smooth, and no razor burn or bumps, and they last for multiple uses!</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin and this razor does not irritate it in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just remember to change the blade in a timely fashion or be stocked to clear up razor burn!</li>
            <li> , what more can I say about it?&lt;br /&gt;It fits other Venus razor cartridges, so you don&#x27;t have to stick only to Venus Embrace</li>
            <li> I only shave about once or twice a week (more like every other day under arms).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and, as woman needing to shave every day, it&#x27;s important for me to use a really sharp razor.</li>
            <li> It fits much better in the hand than others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> That was how smooth the razor glided down my legs, and under my arms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sharp and does really clean up the hair on my legs in one sweep pass.</li>
            <li> I lost my old razor, which was a 4-blade, and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that it wasn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li> The refill blades on this thing are nearly five dollars more per pack than the Schick Hydro blades and this razor barely lasted longer than a Daisy disposable while a single Schick Hydro blade often lasts through WEEKS of daily shaving.</li>
            <li> it comes with another cartridge as well, but each last a long time, longer than most last!</li>
            <li> no problem easy to clean the only one thats a little wierd is the olay venus ones they must be wet to work</li>
            <li> It produces great results and I never have to worry about cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> Ordered the pink color and extra cartridges along with it which arrived in one secure package just two days after ordering.</li>
            <li> These are the ONLY razors that I have ever found that are gentle on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive legs and used to use Schick Quattro.</li>
            <li> i buy them for my 13 yr old daughter too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every ladies&#x27; razor on the market.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see stubble, after nearly twelve hours - which is unheard of, for me.</li>
            <li> , wow, I was pleasantly surprised with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it worked so soft.</li>
            <li> The men&#x27;s are so much better; they obviously don&#x27;t know how to make a women&#x27;s shaver beyond coloring them pink, and purple, and yellow.</li>
            <li> I found some natural wash made with tea tree oil ([[ASIN:B009FT5QBU Herbal Authority</li>
            <li> Was just about finished, went to shave a tiny spot on my foot, and this razor decided to really help me out by taking a dime-sized chunk of skin off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my 14 year old lost hers at a friends, she told me she</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t see ever going back to disposable.</li>
            <li> opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original.</li>
            <li> If you have really fine hair and don&#x27;t usually worry about razor burn/cuts then these might just be &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for you.</li>
            <li> and I have dark coarse hair which means I have to shave my legs every day if I want a smooth finish</li>
            <li> High recommend if you want such a product.</li>
            <li> and I have done some MAJOR nicking in my time!</li>
            <li> Which is basically a pink chic version of the original grey men&#x27;s  razor.</li>
            <li> * sound while I was shaving, even though I used my usual shave lubricant in addition to the supposedly lubricating strip on the razor.</li>
            <li> When you use this razor be careful the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> Also the blades don&#x27;t seem to stay as sharp as my last razor, but it&#x27;s not bad for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for the upper legs, regardless of how hard you press or which direction you go into.  </li>
            <li> shave seems to last a few days longer than a cheap one blade razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only gotten one cut since  the blade was new and fresh but other than that these last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I have not nicked my skin since I have been using it, and I normally nick myself at least once if not many many times when I shave!</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the quickness that the blades dull, but I suppose it is my own fault for leaving it in the shower!</li>
            <li> I generally like gillette razors.  </li>
            <li> If I am in the shower long enough before I shave, I don&#x27;t need shaving cream, which really saves time.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my legs and have to be careful about razors because I can get really cut.  </li>
            <li> only switched razors because I had my old one forever and thought it may be time for a change.</li>
            <li> I end up only having a small pool of blood to clean up after my shower.</li>
            <li> so big one cannot even get the blade itself near the actual parts to be shaved.</li>
            <li> so it is worth the few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> In the past I occasionally had a mild break out after shaving, but never with this one.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfy to grip but still not worth paying so much for replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you&#x27;re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you&#x27;ve created.</li>
            <li> I have trouble because some of my hair is really fine and other razors just pass over the hair even if I shave several different directions to get it.</li>
            <li> I typically like the mens proglide razors and I feel they give me a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> The shavers work fine (according to my girlfriend), but I was not happy to discover that at the local market they are virtually the same price.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t familiar with this razor, use caution when using it for the first few times because there is no need to press down too hard while shaving...</li>
            <li> These razors can be expensive in stores and it was nice to order one and get some other things shipped to me at the same time!</li>
            <li> However, I have found an alternate solution (I jam it into the wire rack where I keep my shower gel) to keep it dry.</li>
            <li> Only a modest amount of pressure and the plastic handle broke at the narrow area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After all is said and done, I&#x27;m bleeding completely through a bandaid, have tons of tiny knicks all over my legs, awful razor burn, and there&#x27;s still way more hair on my legs than is reasonable considering the resulting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smooth and close shave but a bit too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll keep getting our razor products here as long as the pricing holds out.</li>
            <li> But it only came with two refill blades-I expected 3</li>
            <li> For a long time I&#x27;ve used a men&#x27;s Mach 3 razor for shaving, and never had any issues.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> minor caution/gripe: this package comes with a holder that has a suction cup for attachment to the shower wall.  </li>
            <li> however the replacement blades are very expensive but over all I&#x27;ll pay more for the extra comfort of this razor</li>
            <li> The area wasn&#x27;t completely dry and the blue part around the blades got wet and made the razor stick to the tub.)  </li>
            <li> It also seems to last longer than other brands for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette mach turbo for years ( a men&#x27;s razor), but thought I&#x27;d try and get a more feminine razor that cost a little less for once to try, not happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to anything for very long.</li>
            <li> I recommend pairing it with Skintimate Lotionized Dry Skin Gel.</li>
            <li> can even dry shave some areas</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s dry from the weather.</li>
            <li> Sure it is very expensive...</li>
            <li> The Gel part above and below the razors disintegrates too fast and then you are left with a ugly old looking razor.  </li>
            <li> The bar runs out very quickly and I was always cutting myself</li>
            <li> They do provide a pretty close shave, but there&#x27;s a lot of extra plastic around the blades, which can make it difficult to shave in all the nooks and cranies.  </li>
            <li> The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they&#x27;re a lot less of a problem.</li>
            <li> Once you use a five blade razor on your legs you can&#x27;t go back to junky disposable razors, there is much less razor burn (on your legs)</li>
            <li> I seem to cut myself less often around my ankles and knees (actually, I can&#x27;t remember cutting myself at all since I started using this a couple of weeks ago), and it&#x27;s also smooth to use under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is harder to get in tight spots though, so you might need a second razor.</li>
            <li> Basically, it shaved like an old dull razor with something rubber in the way, causing it to skid across my skin.</li>
            <li> Hard to go back to anything lesser.</li>
            <li> These are expensive but the results are worth while.</li>
            <li> Does what it is expected to do.</li>
            <li> and I made the switch a few times to try, but I always end up back with the Gillette Venus.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Venus Embrace Pink Razor, 1 Razor handle and 2 Womens Razor Refill</li>
            <li> The refill blades are expensive but well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Venus Embrace Pink Razor, 1 Razor 2 Cartridges]]</li>
            <li> Just be careful with that one.</li>
            <li> It works well, just as I expected.</li>
            <li> My reason being is that they are both pink and they match.</li>
            <li> rubbing rubber across a wet surface</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really what I needed anyways.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s got enough blades that I catch all the little hairs other razors miss.</li>
            <li> Finally, the lubricating strip seriously irritated my skin and left my legs itchy and bumpy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I can ever go back to another razor.  </li>
            <li> I get a closer shave that lasts longer than other razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> With other razors, my legs will sometimes get irritated after I shave.</li>
            <li> and I dont use any other brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like any other razor.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer strip gets gooey and messy unless you&#x27;ve let it COMPLETELY dry.   </li>
            <li> Whenever she would use other brands she would get out of the shower with blood dripping down her legs.</li>
            <li> And I actually got small scratches and bled a little bit by using it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price of the refills, but that is the case with all of the brands.</li>
            <li> me, I am an Italian-Irish mix...aka white, white sking with black, black leg hair - not a good mix!</li>
            <li> Plus, I do not press down when I shave, so that wasn&#x27;t the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also stays sharper a lot longer at least twice as long as other brands I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to shave with the handle now down to about an inch in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is a little pricey, unless you get it at 50% off</li>
            <li> It also has this little squishy suction cup thing, which is suppose to make the razor holder stick to the bathroom wall.</li>
            <li> These razors are not worth the hype!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably go with something a little firmer.</li>
            <li> and they feel a little slimmy but cant say they dont work they do</li>
            <li> It shaves closely &amp; painlessly &amp; gets all the hair in just a few swipes.</li>
            <li> Bought it a few years&#x27; ago.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So I switch back to Schick, not ideal because of the soap sometimes makes my skin hurt a little bit.</li>
            <li> Price should be a little competitive though!</li>
            <li> I usually just use disposable razors, but I decided to try something else.</li>
            <li> I usually use Schick Intuition Plus, which has a soap around the blade.</li>
            <li> I do not get crazy razor burn and my legs feel soft after shaving.</li>
            <li> If you looked at my legs, you would see a road map of scrapes from past dalliances with razors.</li>
            <li> and I have never cut my bony shins with it which has always been a problem for me in the past</li>
            <li> I usually cut my knees, but with the Venus you can shave all around the knees</li>
            <li> I have used disposable razors in the past and there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> I went back out and bought another venus razor even though they are expensive.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the gel is a little weird once it gets wet, it made strings (think mozzarella cheese) when I pulled it away.</li>
            <li> Not very good for my skin</li>
            <li> replacement blades are hard to find and over priced.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Venus razors since I was in my late teens</li>
            <li> I recommend it for women who want a delicate razor.</li>
            <li> Does your significant others razor linger upon a shelf in your shower gathering water, then dirty water, then that horrible slimy water that you only realize is there when you go to move</li>
            <li> At the first stroke I hated it.</li>
            <li> The ultra-light weight and shape of the razor is not satisfying to hold and the ginormous and weirdly shaped head made it hard to maneuver around my ankles.</li>
            <li> but you gotta realize buying a 12 pack of razors for a dollar is not good.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try one day when I was feeling girly and was sick of my ugly blue and grey men&#x27;s Schick Hydro with five blades.</li>
            <li> This razor is so wide it is impossible to shave if you have bony knees</li>
            <li> One bad thing about the moisturizer is that it makes it harder to travel with it.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the shape of the area surrounding the blade that just seems unnecessary to me.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than shaving your face with your razor after it has been used to shave a woman&#x27;s legs.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid when I saw the four blades in the razor head, thinking &#x27;wow, that could make for a nasty nick&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have never had an issue cutting myself in the past.</li>
            <li> I take my hair removal very seriously.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> but it is too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I totally wrong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst especially when I have a date or a business meeting.</li>
            <li> The base holder has suction cups that stick firmly to the wall of our shower.</li>
            <li> the razor holder is virtually useless.</li>
            <li> But they know the secret!</li>
            <li> The Embrace has a stupid rubber head and it is hard to use on curves because it doesn&#x27;t glide.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten razor burn with these even if I shave when I am cold.  </li>
            <li> You will not be sorry with Venus Embrace!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t gone bad yet.</li>
            <li> The design is just bad.</li>
            <li> then you know how painful that can be).</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a razor cut so close without causing those annoying knicks.</li>
            <li> This Razor is just crap.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible habit of cutting myself while shaving.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is just awful.</li>
            <li> I was out of town and forgot my razor and bought a disposible razor it was so terrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I usually just use disposable razors, but I decided to try something else. I love this razor! It gives a nice close shave every time and no nicks!</li>
            <li> after reading the reviews, I still want to give it a try.  I usually use Schick Intuition Plus, which has a soap around the blade. The first time using Gillette is okay, but for private areas, it can&#x27;t handle the job. And I actually got small scratches and bled a little bit by using it. For the legs, it is okay. But again, every blades can handle legs. I am more expecting it to play a role elsewhere. So I switch back to Schick, not ideal because of the soap sometimes makes my skin hurt a little bit. But for the price and durability, I definitely will choose Schick over this.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite razors next to the SCHICK HYDRO because of their softness while preses against the skin :) Works great and doesn&#x27;t cut the skin! Buy it if you&#x27;re someone with sensitive skin or simply want a nice, soft, awesome razor! :)</li>
            <li> In NY this cost about 10 dollars + taxes.&lt;br /&gt;So I was happy to find the same product for a little bit cheaper price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is good, what more can I say about it?&lt;br /&gt;It fits other Venus razor cartridges, so you don&#x27;t have to stick only to Venus Embrace&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive legs and used to use Schick Quattro. These are expensive but the results are worth while. I do not get crazy razor burn and my legs feel soft after shaving. If you have really fine hair and don&#x27;t usually worry about razor burn/cuts then these might just be &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for you. However, if you are like me and have discomfort while shaving then these really help.</li>
            <li> I really like this one! It moves over my skin really good &amp; leaves my legs smooth! Great razor! Try it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor with my kind of price on it!  If it&#x27;s possible to look forward to using a razor, it&#x27;s on my look-forward-to list. Very smooth shaving!</li>
            <li> This comes with one blade, and one replacement blade (they look the same)&lt;br /&gt;the handle is very nice, and the pick stuff is a very soft rubber and nice to hold on to</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I ever used. Close shave, no nicks. Super smooth. i buy them for my 13 yr old daughter too. Whenever she would use other brands she would get out of the shower with blood dripping down her legs. I know inexperience was part of the problem, but she does just fine with the venus.</li>
            <li> I love love love this razor! I have been using another brand, the Schick Intuition (the one with the built-in shave bar) for 5+ years. The bar runs out very quickly and I was always cutting myself so I decided to switch razors.   I cannot believe how smooth my legs are with this razor! It cuts very close and I haven&#x27;t cut myself once (I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now). I don&#x27;t even mind having to use shaving cream. I&#x27;d highly, highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> Great razor, I&#x27;ve used just about every Venus razor and I do really like this one, leaves my legs pretty smooth without leaving nicks. Not that exciting that I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the best razor ever but I did look online for best reviews and this was at the top of the list.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors I use.  I have psoriasis on my legs and have to be careful about razors because I can get really cut.  These are great, almost no cuts but still gets the hair off.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor for the price, miss my intuition. Would recommend if like to use shave gel separately.</li>
            <li> Great quality shave. The five blades do a great job, but nothing spectacular.  The face of the razor is almost to large, though.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a little pricey, unless you get it at 50% off like I did here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Venus razors. This one has 5 blades, which is especially nice. I shave my legs with an electric razor for convenience, but always shave my armpits in the shower with a Venus. It shaves closely &amp; painlessly &amp; gets all the hair in just a few swipes. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> For the price (being under &amp;lt;$10 at the time of purchase), this was a good deal. The razor pack is not at all defective, like I feared it might be. It comes with the handle and refill cartridges. It also has this little squishy suction cup thing, which is suppose to make the razor holder stick to the bathroom wall. (The squishy cup doesn&#x27;t work.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the razor itself is fine. It does give a close shave. I have not noticed any difference between this razor and some of the more expensive ones. Therefore, I would recommend getting this. I use mine daily and have been for several weeks now. It hasn&#x27;t gone bad yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using the regular Venus razor for several years.  Recently I started to experience irritation on my legs from it.  In effect, I was getting a razor burn type reaction.  I tried to salvage the situation by using shaving cream with it, but it was still giving me razor burn.  So I looked to try a new razor.  I ordered this one from Amazon and I&#x27;m not sure I can ever go back to another razor.  It is super gentle and effective.  It gives a closer shave then I&#x27;ve ever had before.  And no razor burn!  Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Once you use a Venus razor, you&#x27;re spoiled for all the rest of them. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every ladies&#x27; razor on the market. Nothing else you can buy shaves closer or leaves your skin softer. I always have these on hand and want no substitutes.</li>
            <li> Does what it is expected to do. Nice shape for handling both in the shower and out. It cleans up well after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of razor for awhile now and I love it. It gets a very close shave. The only reason I gave it four stars was because It sounds like it comes with a razor with a shave head on it AND two extra, when in face you only get the two shaving heads.</li>
            <li> The shavers work fine (according to my girlfriend), but I was not happy to discover that at the local market they are virtually the same price.</li>
            <li> Only razor that doesn&#x27;t nick and cut me or give me razor burn.</li>
            <li> it has been many moons, since the first time I started shaving my legs and underarms. Subsequently, I have tried many different types of depilatories (lotions, potions, waxes, razor blades and the like). God knows, I have the cuts and scars to prove it. If you looked at my legs, you would see a road map of scrapes from past dalliances with razors. Many have come and gone. Frankly, I was often not even looking for quality - I was just looking for a quick, (relatively) fast way to remove unwanted stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold - I happened to read some reviews of Gillette Venus Embrace Pink Razor, complete with 1 Razor and 2 Women&#x27;s Razor Refill Cartridges. The women who used them seemed pleased, so, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring. Sure enough, the simply packaged product arrived at my home, just yesterday. In need of a touch up job, I decided to try my hand at this blade. I must say, I was very pleased. It didn&#x27;t feel like I was even shaving! That was how smooth the razor glided down my legs, and under my arms. The moisture strip definitely did the trick. No ashy, flakey skin or the pain I come to associate with razor burn. The shave was close, too. I don&#x27;t see stubble, after nearly twelve hours - which is unheard of, for me. I am from Lebanese/Latino/Indo European stock. We grow our hair with pride...So, yes, I will try this razor again. Good show.</li>
            <li> Best razor on the market.  I have seen people swear by their favorite brands and I made the switch a few times to try, but I always end up back with the Gillette Venus.  5 blades, amazing shave.  Love these razors.  I shave every time I shower, so that can be 1-3 times a day.  The heads last about 2 weeks.  Well worth the money for a close shave with fewer nicks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cheap dollar store razors for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, wow, I was pleasantly surprised with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor leaves your legs nice and soft, with a fine shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave seems to last a few days longer than a cheap one blade razor. Press lightly and don&#x27;t touch the blades - they&#x27;re sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this razor won me over enough to want to splurge for nicer razors every time. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> This would probably get a 5 except for the fact that the refills are so pricey. Aside from that, the product works very well - as advertised!</li>
            <li> I have never used a razor before!(I&#x27;m Chinese and I used to use electrical ones)&lt;br /&gt;However this is my first use and I shaved my underarm the minute I got it. Everything went exceptionally well!!! No accident at all. And as it goes in the advertisement, it DOES do a very close shave, much much better than the electrical one I have( Panasonic). Anyway, love it. I think I&#x27;ll continue to use it regularly and stock up some cartridges before I go back to China!!!</li>
            <li> I lost my old razor, which was a 4-blade, and needed a new one.  This one looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really gets my lower legs smooth, which is great because when I take my pain meds I can feel every single hair touching my pant legs.  It&#x27;s okay for the upper legs, regardless of how hard you press or which direction you go into.  I still like it, though, so I&#x27;ll keep buying.</li>
            <li> Man, razors nowadays cost a fortune! I am so happy that I got this razor on Amazon as I saved lots of $$$$. The razor is amazing, and my legs have never been so smooth .</li>
            <li> This razor works really well for me. I have trouble because some of my hair is really fine and other razors just pass over the hair even if I shave several different directions to get it. I thought the holder for the razor and extra blades was a great idea too but it doesn&#x27;t suction well to the tub. It falls off after a couple days and I just put it back up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a razor that works.  I think all these types of razor blade products are way over priced.  But I needed something.</li>
            <li> I choose this because i had one before and need to by one for my daughter with good quality and better price. Fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchase this at a discount and i feel it really worth the price. High recommend if you want such a product.</li>
            <li> love my venus razor couldnt live with out it. bought this for our trip to mexico and i actually left it there on accident good thing i bought one just for the trip! ive never in my life cut my self with a venus. i have very sensitive skin and these work great for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always nice to buy a good razor with a coupon.  The razor is nice and it comes with a refill cartridge and a suction cup holder for the shower.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this one,but it gave me razor burn, and it&#x27;s not as smooth as the iNtuitio razor</li>
            <li> I thought this product was going to come with 3 razors, one already connected to the handle plus 2 refills.  I was wrong.  It only includes 2 razors.  They do provide a pretty close shave, but there&#x27;s a lot of extra plastic around the blades, which can make it difficult to shave in all the nooks and cranies.  I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a smooth shave without lots of nicks and cuts.  I like the wall hanger that comes with it too. Good product for the sale price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I love this razor! I have been buying Venus razors since I was in my late teens and I will continue buying them. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like the razor itself and the refills are awesome but I have found that some of the refill cartridges don&#x27;t always work so well, kind of like they aren&#x27;t as sharp as others.</li>
            <li> Very cute product!! I love the design of this toolkit. So easy to use in the shower. I&#x27;d definitely recommend getting it.</li>
            <li> its a razor and it is good ! thats all i want to say! well idk the price in the mall but this is good for me</li>
            <li> I bought these because there was a 50% off coupon on amazon for them so I said &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34;. I typically like the mens proglide razors and I feel they give me a much closer shave. I do like the 5 blades but I cant say whether or not they actually left my legs smoother longer. The shave was pretty smooth and I didn&#x27;t have any nicks or cuts (despite shaving with just conditioner in a hotel shower). If there&#x27;s ever a coupon again, I&#x27;d probably buy these again but they&#x27;re not my favorite - I think it&#x27;s the shape of the area surrounding the blade that just seems unnecessary to me.</li>
            <li> I love Venus but this razor isn&#x27;t my favorite.  For this you definitely need either soap or shaving cream because this doesn&#x27;t have that built in soothing bar or whatever newer Venus products have.  It still works great I just don&#x27;t love it because of that one flaw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette mach turbo for years ( a men&#x27;s razor), but thought I&#x27;d try and get a more feminine razor that cost a little less for once to try, not happy with the results. The built in moistener gets sticky and clogges the blades also with hair and shave cream gets clogged easily and takes longer to shave. I&#x27;ll be going back to the Mach turbo when these are gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this through amazon because it was cheaper than I could find in stores. I&#x27;ve been using Veuns for a decade and will never use snother brand again. Close shave and rarely have I ever cut myself.</li>
            <li> replacement blades are hard to find and over priced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a razor.  It shaves.  Other than that it wasn&#x27;t anything special.  Everyone has their favorites, this one isn&#x27;t one of mine.  I&#x27;ll stick with my BIC Bella Soleil.</li>
            <li> My step daughted just started shaveing. I got this for her bacause those cheap dollar store razers cut her to much. She loves it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These razors are not worth the hype! Love the big head on the razor, but once the lubrication wears out (which is VERY fast) you might as well cut your legs with an actual razorblade. Horrible.</li>
            <li> Great razor! I have been using for 1 month and no nicks or cuts. It is harder to get in tight spots though, so you might need a second razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, but not the best. It&#x27;s a great deal! It&#x27;s much more cheaper here than the stores. Great buy I guess.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the Venus Razors!With Venus, it&#x27;s a perfect fit every time! That&#x27;s because ANY Venus blade refill fits ANY Venus razor handle. which makes it easy for me to find the perfect blade for my skin! I love how long lasting and how easy it is to shave with them</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite razor of all time &amp; I love that you can use the handle with any number of their interchangeable cartridges. The handle grips fairly easily &amp; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a razor cut so close without causing those annoying knicks. Definitely, by far, the best razor on the market for your money.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the venus razors are interchangeable!!  I received a complimentory razor and refill blade from @Influenster to test out.  I love that I can use different kinds of blades without buying a new handle.  I&#x27;ve never had another razor that can do that.</li>
            <li> I love this 5 blade razor! it keeps me silky smooth and I never get nicks, cuts, razor burn, or a rash. I highly suggest this to all my fellow ladies looking for a great razor that is great for all of our hairy parts!</li>
            <li> I like the one with the soap on the razor but it is too expensive.  This one works just as good and the price is more reasonable.</li>
            <li> Not very good for my skin</li>
            <li> Gillette Venus Embrace Pink Razor, 1 Razor handle and 2 Womens Razor Refill...&lt;br /&gt;Venus is the only razor one should ever use! I love it</li>
            <li> This was decent. It is definitely better than cheap disposable razors, but my sister complained that these could have been sharper. She got 2 cuts while shaving her armpits, BOTH which resulted in a gnarly infection. She&#x27;s not dirty, and she&#x27;s never gotten an infection from shaving before, so it was strange that it occurred right after switching razors. I ended up buying her a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide razor. It&#x27;s the one I use and personally I&#x27;d recommend spending the extra money from the start. Anyways, this razor was overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> Got it right away. Very convenient and easy on my legs. No nicks or cuts. I recommend it for women who want a delicate razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered this package for my wife after we checked and found out how much money we could save by purchasing her razors and blade refills through Amazon.  They have much better pricing than any of the discount stores or grocery stores.  We&#x27;ll keep getting our razor products here as long as the pricing holds out.</li>
            <li> sweet  timely and bargin love this product,,One for me one for my daughter! We both like the timely manner, Very quick.</li>
            <li> Best razor, they say you don&#x27;t need this many blades but I&#x27;m quite confident it makes them last wayyyy longer.&lt;br /&gt;They say you&#x27;re supposed to switch the blade every 3 months I think. This can go way longer, you can probs stretch it out to 6-- but I don&#x27;t recommend that just for sanitation reasons.</li>
            <li> Does your significant others razor linger upon a shelf in your shower gathering water, then dirty water, then that horrible slimy water that you only realize is there when you go to move it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well say goodbye to all of that since this baby comes with a suction cup holder that allows water to cleanly drift off of it.  Plus her legs are smooth, so thats sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT IT!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and when I saw the deal on it, I jumped right on it! These razors can be expensive in stores and it was nice to order one and get some other things shipped to me at the same time! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have always purchased Venus razors.  They last FOREVER.  I only change my blades MAYBE once every two months, sometimes longer than that &amp; I shave my legs 3x a week.  I had never tried the Embrace before, but I do like it.  It seems as though it creates a much softer, closer to the skin, shave.  Definitely recommend this product &amp; would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this razor!!  I works better than any other razor I have tried and I have tried a lot.  I also stays sharper a lot longer at least twice as long as other brands I have tried.  The moisturizing strip also really work which I have found not to be true foe other brands  This defiantly will be my blade of choice.</li>
            <li> I generally like gillette razors.  However I found the posting misleading.  The post said 1 razor and 2 refill blades.  But it only came with two refill blades-I expected 3</li>
            <li> Great product!  I got them for my wife for Christmas and she loves them!</li>
            <li> Wife likes it... Great product as expected from Gillette. 5 blades definitely work the best.  Price should be a little competitive though!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife because she kept stealing my razors. Then one day she used my Gillette razor and oohed  and awed over it. So I ordered the Venus for her. Which is basically a pink chic version of the original grey men&#x27;s  razor. She Loves it and no longer asks for mine.</li>
            <li> One can buy cheap razors about anywhere, but Gillette makes an extraordinary product.  The blade on this razor leaves a smooth feeling on your skin.  The refill blades are expensive but well worth the price.  This is the shaver for those who need a close shave on their legs and underarms.  Along with Olay&#x27;s shave gel you can&#x27;t miss with this product.</li>
            <li> This is not a very firm razor but certainly gets the job done. I&#x27;d probably go with something a little firmer.</li>
            <li> I have never had my legs feel so smooth after a shave.  Very impressed with this razor. My Husband even noticed a difference and could not keep his hands off my legs! Ladies, switch to this if you are looking to switch brands or razors! You will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this razor. I loved it so much I bought one for my daughter. Flexible so you won&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different razors over the years but I always end up going back to this one.  It produces great results and I never have to worry about cutting myself.  It also seems to last longer than other brands for me.  I don&#x27;t like to use shave gel and this is the only razor that consistently gives me a great shave without using gel.</li>
            <li> Love the Embrace razor. Glides over body with virtually no cuts on skin. Love this razor and had to get my husband one</li>
            <li> Very good product and blade razor last longer compared to other brands</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Gives a very smooth shave and cuts very rarely through my skin. Hard to go back to anything lesser.</li>
            <li> Not quite as smooth and gentle of a shave as I thought.  There is a little &amp;#34;drag&amp;#34; when I shave my legs, but it&#x27;s a good razor.  Also the blades don&#x27;t seem to stay as sharp as my last razor, but it&#x27;s not bad for the money.</li>
            <li> I love Venus razors but what really took the cake for this purchase&lt;br /&gt;was the handy holder that came with it to hold the extra cartridges&lt;br /&gt;and the razor. It fits snugly on my shower wall and does not budge until I pop&lt;br /&gt;it off.</li>
            <li> I love it.. give a very close shave .. and it comes with two refills.. pretty handy .. and underarms dont feel scratchy after using this one..</li>
            <li> Perfect razor for women to remove unnecessary hair. My wife uses this razor with happy face. :)</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about a month and I have dark coarse hair which means I have to shave my legs every day if I want a smooth finish I have only used one cartridge and it is still going strong. My lags have never felt this smooth.</li>
            <li> Yeah, new razor. I love it. Its super smooth, super efficient, Its a great razor. Comes with two blades, and a holder for the shower.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite razor! I love that you can use any cartridge with the handle! You never have to worry about the store not having them, because there are so many cartridges to choose from!</li>
            <li> Bought it a few years&#x27; ago.  Still using it.  Does a fine job.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is offered at a great price (even better if you watch for a $2 0ff coupon in your Amazon coupon book). This has to be the best razor I have ever purchased!  It gives an extremely close shave and will leave your legs so smooth! If you aren&#x27;t familiar with this razor, use caution when using it for the first few times because there is no need to press down too hard while shaving...it will do the job without causing razor burn! I also loved the fact that it came with the extra cartridge and I especially liked the \\&quot;ShowerPod\\&quot; for storing the razor and additional cartridges in the shower!  I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a great product for a great price![[ASIN:B0039LMT9C Gillette Venus Embrace Pink Razor, 1 Razor 2 Cartridges]]</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome.  Sure it is very expensive...but it doesn&#x27;t tear up my legs and it gives a nice smooth shave.  It also lasts for a couple more shaves then cheap razors so it is worth the few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz show says to use a single-blade razor to avoid ingrown hairs.  Personally, I&#x27;m sticking with this 5-blader.   It works really well and I find I don&#x27;t cut myself much at all.   I also like the moisturizer around the blades, but you do still need to use shaving cream.    One bad thing about the moisturizer is that it makes it harder to travel with it.  The moisturizer strip gets gooey and messy unless you&#x27;ve let it COMPLETELY dry.   I end up keeping it in it&#x27;s own zip lock baggy while I\\&quot;m traveling to avoid getting all my toiletries gummed up.</li>
            <li> This Razor is just crap. I bought this thinking that it is better than my Husbands Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;Was I totally wrong I have one blade disposable razors work better . The 3 blades are way better will not purchase another Venus ever..</li>
            <li> First I have to commend Venus on there packaging. We all know what a pain it is trying to get things out when they are encased in plastic, and your scissors can barely cut through the edges, and then you&#x27;re trying not to get cut by the new sharp, jagged edges you&#x27;ve created. Venus cut us all a break and designed the packaging with an easy open spot in the back. That alone made my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the package, I was happily surprised to find suction cups for attaching the holder to your shower instead of little strips of adhesive like the original. This is a definite plus; it makes it much easier to get off your shower when you need to and still be able to reattach it to the same shower later or a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, getting to the part that&#x27;s really important, the razor is (as stated in the title) amazing. The knees are always a problem area, but with this razor, all of a sudden they&#x27;re a lot less of a problem. It just takes so much less effort with this razor to have smooth, beautiful legs. I love it!</li>
            <li> i is amazing. this the first time i use the one which came without the soap. it is much much better than others and it works perfect . no need for wetting the area of interest at all.it works great</li>
            <li> This razor is the best one. It works well and it does not hurt my skin. I am very satisfied with it and therefore strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am partial to these, as they have been the smoothest shave so far, aside form my husbands razor.  My biggest complaint is the quickness that the blades dull, but I suppose it is my own fault for leaving it in the shower!</li>
            <li> Works great! I&#x27;ve only gotten one cut since  the blade was new and fresh but other than that these last me quite a while. My favorite blade.</li>
            <li> I will use this happily b/c it does what it is supposed to do. It shaves very! smoothly and I have never cut my bony shins with it which has always been a problem for me in the past</li>
            <li> i order couple of weeks back. started using it and it really great. i think it gonna run months for me. it worked so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this Razor.  One of the things I love about this razor is that you don&#x27;t have to shave as often.</li>
            <li> This was purchased at a great sale price.  I love my new razor.  I would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Venus.  It&#x27;s always been my go to lady razor.  I love how the different cartridges fit on each handle so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying the start up kits.  And they keep coming out with the most amazing refills!!  Venus makes my life so much easier!!!</li>
            <li> Only a modest amount of pressure and the plastic handle broke at the narrow area.  It&#x27;s not easy to shave with the handle now down to about an inch in length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When is Gillette going to learn that women travel and could use a razor case that would protect the blade from damage?</li>
            <li> The ladies in our household only use the Venus shavers and the deal we got on Amazon for a new one with two cartridges was great.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this razor when I used it for the first time. I usually cut my knees, but with the Venus you can shave all around the knees and I have yet to cut myself. A very smooth and gently cut. I am now a customer for life of this razor. I was told by my sister and I let eveyone know how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible habit of cutting myself while shaving. I cannot tell you how many times I&#x27;ve nicked the back of my angles (and if you&#x27;ve ever done that then you know how painful that can be). I bought this one because I was told by many friends that five blades ensure a closer shave and less chance of cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s the only brand I use. I get a closer shave that lasts longer than other razors I&#x27;ve used. I rarely ever cut myself anymore. The moisture ribbon is a good addition because it aids in providing a smooth shave that is free from cuts.</li>
            <li> this is awesome! Venus just is the best. one pull and every since hair is gone!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try one day when I was feeling girly and was sick of my ugly blue and grey men&#x27;s Schick Hydro with five blades. At the first stroke I hated it. The ultra-light weight and shape of the razor is not satisfying to hold and the ginormous and weirdly shaped head made it hard to maneuver around my ankles. Finally, the lubricating strip seriously irritated my skin and left my legs itchy and bumpy. I also found that I did not get anywhere near the close and long-lasting shave I&#x27;ve enjoyed when using a men&#x27;s razor. The refill blades on this thing are nearly five dollars more per pack than the Schick Hydro blades and this razor barely lasted longer than a Daisy disposable while a single Schick Hydro blade often lasts through WEEKS of daily shaving. I&#x27;d say we&#x27;ve been duped. Forget the pretty packaging to lure you in and try one of the men&#x27;s shavers - I promise you the difference in quality of shave is astonishing and it&#x27;s so much cheaper! The Schick Hydro is the closest, smoothest, gentlest, easy to hold, nicely weighted razor on the market for doing legs and they last forever - a very good value if ugly as sin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review was in October but I&#x27;ve just updated my review from two stars to just one. I don&#x27;t know why I gave it two stars in the first place. This razor cannot be used around the ankles and is definitely not designed for private parts as the head is so big one cannot even get the blade itself near the actual parts to be shaved. The lubricating strip irritated me too and I&#x27;ve never had that happen. The package came with two blades and I never even opened the second one. This is just awful. Actually the best razor for women I&#x27;ve ever used is the plain old original Daisy disposable. Just be careful with that one. The men&#x27;s are so much better; they obviously don&#x27;t know how to make a women&#x27;s shaver beyond coloring them pink, and purple, and yellow.</li>
            <li> It works well, just as I expected. The case can be attached to smooth surface (ie. bathroom wall). The case has space for the two refill cartridges so the whole kit can be easily stored together.</li>
            <li> Certainly recommend this razor. Shaves clean with no sticky residue like some. Price is right and it lasts forever.  If you;re searching, your search is over.</li>
            <li> I was a little afraid when I saw the four blades in the razor head, thinking &#x27;wow, that could make for a nasty nick&#x27;. However, in practice the razor glides so smoothly and shaves so closely with no pressure whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very light razor, about as light as one of the cheap disposables. When I removed it from the package and felt how light it was, I wondered if it would be any good. But as noted above, the shave is incredible. And the moisturizing tips really seem to work. With other razors, my legs will sometimes get irritated after I shave. But with this razor, there was no irritation whatsoever. That also may be because no pressure is required. Either way, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Many Venus razors have come and gone in my house. The Embrace is one of my favorites. The refills can be pricey, but the quality is worth it. I use a razor everyday on my legs and underarms just to make sure I&#x27;m as smooth as can be. The Embrace hs soothing pads at the top and bottom which help moisturize the skin right after shaving which is nice. It&#x27;s eliminated my need for shaving cream as well which I love because I always used to miss one silly spot because the cream would wash off or something. Anyway, the embrace is really light and it&#x27;s got enough blades that I catch all the little hairs other razors miss. It works well around the bikini line too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use one blade for about a month. Sometimes if I haven&#x27;t had a chance to run to the store I&#x27;ll push it an extra week and I&#x27;ll inevitably wind up with some razor burn on my legs. It&#x27;s the worst especially when I have a date or a business meeting. I found some natural wash made with tea tree oil ([[ASIN:B009FT5QBU Herbal Authority Tea Tree Oil Skin Wash + FREE 100% Australian Tea Tree Oil]]) that really helps cure the razor burn up right away though. The burning feeling is gone right after use and there&#x27;s no bumps or redness in a matter of hours. I used to have to throw on some stockings to cover it up but using the tea tree oil wash I can be comfortable in my own skin again. I like to show off my legs so it&#x27;s plenty of time to save a date and normally my meetings are in the afternoon so my skin has ample time to recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the embrace is great just remember to change the blade in a timely fashion or be stocked to clear up razor burn!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older razor for my wife and she said this works great. The base holder has suction cups that stick firmly to the wall of our shower. Inside you can store replacement razors. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Honestly, who can find anything negative to say about this product? Gillette/Venus is clearly the best brand of razors out there. Although the replacement cartridges can be arguably pricey, the end result is always well worth it. I have been using Venus disposables for years but I finally decided it was time to give in and buy the actual razor. Ordered the pink color and extra cartridges along with it which arrived in one secure package just two days after ordering. I recommend using this razor along with EOS Shave Cream for an extremely smooth shave. You will not be sorry with Venus Embrace!</li>
            <li> I have been using  gillette venus for over 10 years. I have tried others but I have given up as there is nothing better. When you use this razor be careful the first time you use it. Take it slow after that your good. I never nick my legs anymore and it gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I choosed this razor because it has 5 blades, and when i got it I was really happy because it works really good</li>
            <li> For a long time I&#x27;ve used a men&#x27;s Mach 3 razor for shaving, and never had any issues. But I had the opportunity to get a free sample of this razor, and thought hey, maybe a women&#x27;s razor would be a nice upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried this out, and things seemed to be going pretty well. It felt smooth, the gel bars seemed to be helping it glide across my skin. The consistency of the gel is a little weird once it gets wet, it made strings (think mozzarella cheese) when I pulled it away. After about 30 seconds, it started to burn a bit, but I quickly rinsed off and that seemed to help it. Was just about finished, went to shave a tiny spot on my foot, and this razor decided to really help me out by taking a dime-sized chunk of skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all is said and done, I&#x27;m bleeding completely through a bandaid, have tons of tiny knicks all over my legs, awful razor burn, and there&#x27;s still way more hair on my legs than is reasonable considering the resulting carnage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll go back to the men&#x27;s razor, I&#x27;ve never managed to cut myself with it, and it actually gets all the hair.</li>
            <li> If you need to shave your hairy legs (and most women definitely need to do that at some point in their lives), this is the product for you. I recommend pairing it with Skintimate Lotionized Dry Skin Gel. My reason being is that they are both pink and they match.</li>
            <li> Love this razor.. Been using Venus for years. Seems like they just keep coming out with better products. Love the close shave with no nicks.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor and I love the holder it comes with to attach to the shower.  With the online coupon it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Venus Embrace razors. They shave so nice and I never get as many nicks on my ankles as I do with some other razors.  Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> Its a good razor and seems to do its job just right!&lt;br /&gt;Not so expensive and great quality get it while you can!!</li>
            <li> This razor has 5 blades, gives closer and smoother shave. I even got these for a real good price. Definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling really soft and smooth. And Venus is great because it gives you the option of using any Venus razor refill so you can switch them out.</li>
            <li> I really like this razor. I only shave about once or twice a week (more like every other day under arms). So I think the blades might last a while. If I am in the shower long enough before I shave, I don&#x27;t need shaving cream, which really saves time. The holder works well. Ive had razors where the holder comstantly falls off the shower wall. That&#x27;s not the case here.I will continue using this razor.</li>
            <li> I am not a tiny woman 135lbs 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; - however this GIGANTIC razor is not exactly a good size for fitting in &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; places :)  Great for legs, but too expensive in my book to use on legs.  I switched to the schick 4 blade, works much better for those important places.</li>
            <li> Have used this for the first time after seeing the ad in TV and really liked it. This is the best razor I have ever used. Super smooth and gentle. Did not irritate your skin at all.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than shaving your face with your razor after it has been used to shave a woman&#x27;s legs. Now that I purchased this for my wife I no longer have to worry about her stealing mine and unknowingly lighting my face on fire with razor burn. The product also leaves the legs much smoother for longer than my razor ever did, so it&#x27;s a win-win. We&#x27;re both happy with the razor, despite the not-so-friendly price these items fetch nowadays.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and, as woman needing to shave every day, it&#x27;s important for me to use a really sharp razor. I have been using men&#x27;s disposable razors for the last 5 or so years because I find them to be better than the ones made for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give a fancy women&#x27;s razor another try so I ordered this one, plus a refill pack. This razor gave me razor burn, the shave isn&#x27;t close enough and I nicked myself. It scraped my skin and made a *rubbing rubber across a wet surface* sound while I was shaving, even though I used my usual shave lubricant in addition to the supposedly lubricating strip on the razor. Plus, I do not press down when I shave, so that wasn&#x27;t the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Basically, it shaved like an old dull razor with something rubber in the way, causing it to skid across my skin. What a waste of money. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> It is much better than my thought.  I like it very much!  I have used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Venus for years. I don&#x27;t know that I feel the various different versions are that much different from each other, but it is a great razor no matter what. I have two daughters, 14 and 11. They both use this razor as well. When my 14 year old lost hers at a friends, she told me she \\&quot;had\\&quot; to have a new one in her Christmas stocking. She literally said \\&quot;they don&#x27;t tear up my legs and they stay smooth forver after I shave.\\&quot; She may be one of the pickiest children on the planet, so this is quite a statement coming from her. I am actually purchasing this right now for her stocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I am an Italian-Irish mix...aka white, white sking with black, black leg hair - not a good mix! I take my hair removal very seriously. This razor does the trick. It shaves very close, so even in the dead of winter, when my legs are glowing they are so white, you can&#x27;t see any stubs from the hair. I also have very sensitive skin and this razor does not irritate it in the slightest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor. Excellent purchase. My only complaint is the price of the refills, but that is the case with all of the brands.</li>
            <li> For the longest time, I just used big box store brand razors for shaving my legs and underarms.  I figured, hey, it&#x27;s just a razor, it doesn&#x27;t make a difference what kind of razor I use.  Then, while cleaning my linen closet, I found a package of razorblades for a Gillette Venus razor, but no handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, I went out to the same big box store and bought this combination package of handle and cartridges.  And then I used this product to shave my legs.  I never thought I would be one to gush about a razor, of all things, but I LOVE this razor.  This is what I will be buying for the foreseeable future.  Yes, it costs a little more, but the shaving experience is just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor just glides over my skin.  It feels smooth to use while shaving, and my legs are so smooth after shaving.  I seem to cut myself less often around my ankles and knees (actually, I can&#x27;t remember cutting myself at all since I started using this a couple of weeks ago), and it&#x27;s also smooth to use under my arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor caution/gripe: this package comes with a holder that has a suction cup for attachment to the shower wall.  On the one hand, I applaud the effort, as some sort of holder is definitely needed.  (I let mine sit face-down on the edge of the tub a couple of times.  The area wasn&#x27;t completely dry and the blue part around the blades got wet and made the razor stick to the tub.)  On the other hand, I can&#x27;t get the suction cup to stick to my shower wall, so it&#x27;s not doing me a lot of good.  However, I have found an alternate solution (I jam it into the wire rack where I keep my shower gel) to keep it dry.</li>
            <li> These are great for men and women. I use them to shave my balls and my grundel (which is very hairy and full of dingleberries). I end up only having a small pool of blood to clean up after my shower.</li>
            <li> This razor is so wide it is impossible to shave if you have bony knees (I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cut myself so many times - the last cut actually took out a CHUNK of my leg in three lines. I have never had an issue cutting myself in the past. The design is just bad. It doesn&#x27;t go around actual body parts well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only switched razors because I had my old one forever and thought it may be time for a change. I&#x27;ll be going back to my Schick.</li>
            <li> I have used disposable razors in the past and there is no comparison. This one is very soft and gentle. No cuts and smooth feeling. In the past I occasionally had a mild break out after shaving, but never with this one. Certainly worth the extra bucks. I also like the way the handle feels. It fits much better in the hand than others I have used in the past. It comes with 2 refill cartridges, so you will be set for a while.</li>
            <li> I love the 5 blades and it gives a quicker cleaner cut. Love this and I dont use any other brand plus I never get cut like I did years ago with regular razors. Keep your legs gorgeous and summer ready !!!</li>
            <li> This Razor is great. It has 5 blades. It gives you a very close shave. I love how smooth It makes my legs after I shave.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using venus razors for years, and i find them to be very durable and effective. this is my third one over the course of seven years or so, and the only reason i&#x27;ve replaced them is because the plastic finally gave in and cracked. overall i&#x27;m very happy with venus razors and will likely keep buying them (although i&#x27;m intrigued by the men&#x27;s razors that other reviewers are recommending...)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like any other razor. the razor holder is virtually useless. It doesn&#x27;t stick to anything for very long. But it doesn&#x27;t matter. It&#x27;s not really what I needed anyways.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and exactly what I thought it would be.  Excellent product, very convenient and easy to change out cartridges.</li>
            <li> Once you use a five blade razor on your legs you can&#x27;t go back to junky disposable razors, there is much less razor burn (on your legs) however the replacement blades are very expensive but over all I&#x27;ll pay more for the extra comfort of this razor and I really can&#x27;t see ever going back to disposable. I was out of town and forgot my razor and bought a disposible razor it was so terrible and it ripped my legs I went back out and bought another venus razor even though they are expensive. I dont know how I ever used those disposible razors.</li>
            <li> I do not know how it is possible to have five blades and not be removing layers of skin! But they know the secret! I really like that I can change the heads to whatever Venus razor i want!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these razors! Great for all the shave-able areas, interchangeable razor cartridges to try out any of the Venus Embrace products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use razor and this one worked very well. The package arrived on time. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> No bad .No good .IS cheaper shaver .but not that feel great .I plan rid off of them sooner .price no bad</li>
            <li> The razor was shipped quickly. It works better than I had expected it to, I would purchase again and tell others to purchase.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price. Product is excellent, last a long time and I am ordering another one,&lt;br /&gt;Very soon.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and that any Venus blade refill fits any Venus handle. Too many times I can find the razor that fits my hand perfectly but I can never find the refills. Now I can use any refill I am in heaven!</li>
            <li> Any Venus razor is worth your buck, and the best razor on the market. Venus is great because any Venus handle fits ANY blade! So if you don&#x27;t like the embrace, try the Olay cartridges, and so on. It&#x27;s serioulsy awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of venus&#x27;s products always leave my legs and body feeling incredibly smooth, and no razor burn or bumps, and they last for multiple uses!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of razors in my time, but this one is the best.  It gives a very nice smooth and guided shave.  No pulling and no cuts.  Has moisturizer all over it so easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Recently received this razor and 2 Venus heads through my Influenster program - and I LOVE it! It&#x27;s very rare that I cut myself shaving anymore, it really does curve to your body as you shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Venus razors for years, but never knew that literally ANY Venus blade can fit onto ANY Venus razor!! It&#x27;s a nice way to try out different blades without having to buy a whole new razor!</li>
            <li> Venus razors now can fit any blade, so all you have to do is buy the handle and then pick a favorite blade! its awesome if you haven&#x27;t found your perfect razor yet, you can try just blades til you find the one you like!</li>
            <li> I simply love this razor.  It gives a really close shave with out nicks or scrapes.  Easy to use and glides over your skin smoothly for a nice clean shave on the legs and underarms. I would reccommend it to anyone wanting a clean smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better razors I&#x27;ve used. It gets my skin very smooth and I haven&#x27;t experienced any nicks or cuts while shaving. It is also very easy to hold, and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I used to be frugal about things but you gotta realize buying a 12 pack of razors for a dollar is not good. You get what you pay for. It&#x27;s like nicks and scars only appear if you put in effort to make them. It makes skin so smooth. If you never get good razors and wonder why you&#x27;re legs don&#x27;t come out all nice, then I&#x27;m telling you now, it&#x27;s time to upgrade.</li>
            <li> These are the ONLY razors that I have ever found that are gentle on my sensitive skin.  I have never gotten razor burn with these even if I shave when I am cold.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I received this as a stocking stuffer and let me just say that Santa got ripped off!! I have been using the Hydrosilk for about six months now and it is by far a better razor. The Embrace has a stupid rubber head and it is hard to use on curves because it doesn&#x27;t glide. So for any of you reading this trust me that the hydrosilk by schick is much better.</li>
            <li> I have been using many razors and the Venus Embrace is by far. I have waxed my legs before and to me, shaving with this razor is much better.</li>
            <li> I love venus razors and use them pretty exclusively, but the &amp;#34;embrace&amp;#34; just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  The Gel part above and below the razors disintegrates too fast and then you are left with a ugly old looking razor.  I personally would stick with the traditional venus razors,  but bought these because they were on sale.</li>
            <li> My wife has been looking for a GOOD razor and we saw this. My wife feel in love with it. It has suction cups so you can stick it to the shower or tub. WORTH THE PRICE TOO!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these razors! The shave is so smooth and I have yet to nick myself--and I have done some MAJOR nicking in my time! Been using the Venus for a year and 1/2 now and recommend them to any woman wanting a smooth leg!</li>
            <li> I love this razor! I have not nicked my skin since I have been using it, and I normally nick myself at least once if not many many times when I shave! so I will stick with this one! it comes with another cartridge as well, but each last a long time, longer than most last! so that is a plus! and you can buy replacements or just buy a new one of these, either or, these and the replacements are on subscribe and save, so whichever works for you!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to everyone! I love it, and it has worked great for me, and it leaves my skin smoother than any other that I have ever tried, and I have tried them all!</li>
            <li> I now use them exclusively at least the brand venus all of them i have tried work well better than the other kind no razor burn for me can even dry shave some areas no problem easy to clean the only one thats a little wierd is the olay venus ones they must be wet to work and they feel a little slimmy but cant say they dont work they do and they leave you smooth.. so give them a try..</li>
            <li> Very nice and moisturizing, shower mount and case comes with it (for the extra head). Met my expectations and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smooth and close shave but a bit too expensive for me. The handle is comfy to grip but still not worth paying so much for replacement cartridges. I&#x27;ve switched to dollar shave club.</li>
            <li> I love my gillette venus razors, they work perfectly and leave my skin smooth and sexy! &#x3D;) Good product at good price!</li>
            <li> Got my Venus Embrace Razor as a free sample but boy is it awesome! For one thing It&#x27;s really sharp and does really clean up the hair on my legs in one sweep pass. Note though not to use without cream or lotion because I tried that and my legs kind of felt a bit burnt up (no bleeding whatsoever though) because it&#x27;s dry from the weather. But it&#x27;s really efficient so far and 5 blades really does make a difference</li>
            <li> the product is excellent, I love it, I would like to buy more and the quality is good,  as show in the picture..</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It has to be the embrace because the gel seems to work better than other Venus razors. I do however refuse to buy this at full price since it only lasts about 3-4 shavings. The coupons generally range from $3-4 and are well worth it for that price.</li>
            <li> It was the first time for me that I bought a Venus razor and I really like it. It&#x27;s very gentle to my skin and I love the pink color. Amazon has the best price for it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend after she had mentioned she wanted a quality razor. She says its by far the best razor she has ever used and she loves it, says it gets a closer shave than anything she has ever used before as well.</li>
