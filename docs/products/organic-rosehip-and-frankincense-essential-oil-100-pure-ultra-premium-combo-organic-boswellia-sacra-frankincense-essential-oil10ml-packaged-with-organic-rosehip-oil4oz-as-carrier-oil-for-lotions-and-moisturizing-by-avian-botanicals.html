            <li>/&gt;This is a very nice oil.</li>
            <li>My best advice is to use with CARE, not assuming it&#x27;s all simply safe to slather all over.</li>
            <li>My best advice is to use with CARE, not assuming it&#x27;s all simply safe to slather all over.</li>
            <li>Perfect in a diffuser, I add a drop of this with one of my favorite perfumes for an even richer softer fragrance.</li>
            <li>They both have a pleasant smell, but my biggest concern is the tops of bottles.</li>
            <li>this combo is super !, frankincense oil is great for PAIN! !</li>

            <li>Good for body massage too</li>
            <li>This rosehip oil is neutral in smell, and furthermore it makes a good carrier oil for the patchouli component.</li>
            <li>Well yes it is like something, a good neutral massage oil.</li>
            <li>Massage oil and earthy oil is a good thing, if that&#x27;s what I was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has antibacterial properties and is good for a variety of uses and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Think about it: It was a gift from the 3 wise men 2 thousand years ago along with Myrr and gold, so they must have thought it quite</li>
            <li>frankincense smells absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I really loved using Rosehip seed oil for my skin care in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rose hip oil is light and pleasant, perfect for a night mask, though the pump dispenser that comes with it is a bit fiddly.  </li>
            <li>This vial is excellent; it gives me full control over the amount of drops that I use, and it does not leak at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with both of these items.</li>
            <li>love the fragrance of this Frankincense oil!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with Both of them  !</li>
            <li>The benefits of Rosehip Seed Oil are amazing for me, helping with both complexion issues and skin appearance on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing and versatile oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was asked to try this product for an honest review and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s me control the amount better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aromatherapy is fascinating....</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s me control the amount better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aromatherapy is fascinating....</li>
            <li>Frankincense has so many amazing properties, but I loved using this in a diffuser.  </li>
            <li>thank you to the manufacturer for asking me to try this to duct and write out my honest thoughts.</li>
            <li>The oil goes on nicely and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>In addition to cosmeceutical skin care, the combination of frankincense and rose hip oil can be used to massage areas affected by lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also perfect for using with my essential oils as a great carrier oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a good refreshing</li>
            <li>Received free to evaluate and glad I had the opportunity !!</li>
            <li>You blend them together to make a very nice light oil for your face.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the packaging of this particular brand&#x27;s Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty all purpose: aftershave, skin refresher, and just a hippy good scent (lol).</li>
            <li>Always do a patch test to check for allergies, but this is usually very safe for most people.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened my Amazon box I could smell the frankincense- a very strong pine scent.</li>
            <li>The Rosehip oil has a very mild scent, if at all, and it can also be used as a massage oil on its own, or for scars, etc.  </li>
            <li>Frankincense is earthy and kind of strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was given this product for free to review and I&#x27;m quite satisfied!</li>
            <li>(I have always used Jojoba) is a five win for me, and certainly one to try yourself. :)</li>
            <li>Rosehip seed oil can also be extracted from Rosa canina, which grows in many regions of the world including South Africa and Europe.</li>
            <li>The oil contains provitamin A (mostly beta-Carotene).</li>
            <li>Okay, lecture over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, lecture over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I love the Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li>I have most enjoyed about this product</li>

            <li>It makes the bathroom seem more like a spa.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a better complexion.</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Because once you start reading about and investigating the &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; of aromatherapy, I guarantee you will want to build many fragrance</li>
            <li>love the smell of the Frankinsense oil.  </li>
            <li>I was sent these products free to try in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The loveliness of this oil inspires me to make some interesting face serums at a fraction of the price of what you&#x27;d pay</li>
            <li>frankincense has a lovely, haunting aroma, but it takes some getting used to for some people.</li>
            <li>It heals, cools, calms, elevates the mood, and more.</li>
            <li>happily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to have learned about this supplier, too.</li>
            <li>many years ago</li>

            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>reason Aviano is my favorite?</li>
            <li>My favorite though is a couple of drops in the bath.</li>
            <li>However, when combined with the Rosehip Oil as a carrier oil, this delivered some excellent results, especially for a hair conditioning</li>
            <li>/&gt;Frankincense oil promotes healthy cell regeneration and keeps existing cells and tissues healthy.</li>
            <li>Frankincense oil promotes healthy cell regeneration and keeps existing cells and tissues healthy.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;The strangeness of the oil bothered me, so I wrote to the company asking if this was some kind of specially processed rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I use The &#x27;RHO&#x27; ON MY HAIR,FACE,HANDS, and it soak in good after a hot shower...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aviano Botanicals rosehip seed oil is pretty good size for the price.</li>
            <li>the Rosehip Oil from AVIANO comes in a 4 oz pump bottle making apply the product to the skin easy and sure.</li>
            <li>I received this product free for review but as always, despite receiving a free product I&#x27;m perfectly candid in my review.  </li>
            <li>It can also smooth the appearance of healthy looking skin.  </li>
            <li>does well in vibrational diffusers and in humidifiers, that lightness becoming quite heady as it breaks up and goes about its olfactory business.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While i am a certified aromatherapist, the most important thing for newbies is to buy from someone you trust.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, and really feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spicy and earthy and a little bit exotic, a wonderful smell.  </li>
            <li>Add in the even more concentrated, great topical benefits that rosewater itself gave me, and this &amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34; of rosehip oil</li>
            <li>I received this as a complimentary review oil with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.</li>

            <li>It does wonders on complexion problems I have on my shoulders clearing them up very quickly.  </li>

            <li>This Aviano Botanicals Frankincense oil comes with dropper for easy use</li>
            <li>The Rosehip Oil is smooth and clear and is a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Your nose if finely tuned will tell.</li>
            <li>Frankincense is like nature of &#x27;ben gay&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that this oil absorbs quickly and it and replenishes the moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li>This enables Frankincense as effective against many diseases, making it ideal for supporting the body&#x27;s natural healing abilities, uniquely able to address diseases, and research is in the process of studying Frankincense for its potential to treat cancer.</li>
            <li>Here are no words to describe the unique fragrance and effect this oil has and AVIANO makes dispensing it easy and safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this duo I also received the Frankincense oil which is a GREAT EO to use for spiritual focus and also on the bottoms of your feet to alleviate nervous energy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read several testimonials that it may work great.</li>
            <li>, Pinterest is a great site to see recipes and ideas for different uses.  </li>
            <li>, Pinterest is a great site to see recipes and ideas for different uses.  </li>
            <li>The bottle comes with an eye dropper making it perfect for getting a few drops into the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is amazing-and the quality of their oil is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Comes in a plastic bottle with a light scent.</li>
            <li>Voila, smooth, silky hair.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also arrives with a pump which is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I&#x27;m loving Rosehip Oil?</li>
            <li>I have attained the best results with the combination of the Rosehip as a carrier oil with the addition of a few drops of the Frankincense Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I trust the plant based sources and find it far more effective than lab made chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is a very rich and powerful scent, so I do believe it is truly 100% Frankincense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, this is a really unique product</li>
            <li>special!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have these products in my collection and will continue using them</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is normally somewhat sweet with a rose smell.</li>
            <li>The rose hip oil is pure, cold-pressed, and suitable for using directly on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a very light oil that seems to absorb much faster than any hand lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a cool pump to get the oil out to&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li>Rose hip oil is also frequently used to heal scarring and diminish photo-aging.</li>
            <li>I have used Fractionated Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond, and Grapeseed before.  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised to find that the Rose Hips oil is not greasy.</li>
            <li>I like to add several drops of Frankincense to my coconut butter, baking soda toothpaste I make because it is good for your teeth and gums (but never ingest this).</li>
            <li>Like I said, heavenly!!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs into the skin replenishing moisture and creates a protective barrier on the skin to help prevent</li>
            <li>However, the lightness of the oil works against it in the simple fan operated diffusers (which the heavier frankincense does best in - humidifiers always seem to be the middle ground).</li>
            <li>Has a serum-like texture that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>may argued that oil is oil, but from my experience using Rosehip seed oil for many years, I can say for sure not all Rosehip oils’ quality is same.  </li>
            <li>I received a Free sample for an evaluation; my research is from multiple internet sites, and my usages, statements and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>The eyedropper makes it easy to deliver exactly the right amount of</li>
            <li>main thing I had with the rosewater was that just a tad too much in my mixture had me smelling like a rose arbor</li>
            <li>You want to be sure your oils are real, organic not fake, and so on.</li>
            <li>It is very effective skin care product, far better than any of facial serum that I’ve used and paid high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Frankincense comes in a little brown bottle and has a great dropper for ease of use.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice (definitely not a frilly perfumey smell, more earthy and soft)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Couples, this is fun</li>
            <li>I received these at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li>for the Rose Hip Essential Oil</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li>I also bought a book on Aromatherapy and also a chart: so far the chart and Pinterest have been the most helpful.  </li>
            <li>Some have distinct &amp;#34;rules&amp;#34; for application and usage.</li>
            <li>be like a friend of mine who heard garlic cloves were good for earaches, and who was supposed to make an oil and crushed and filtered garlic blend:  </li>

            <li>I have found that all the purposes for this product, have all worked great so far, so I would definitly purchase these items in the future.</li>
            <li>i received Aviano Botanicals Frankincense, I noticed this is far more concentrated than the one that I am using.  </li>
            <li>The Frankincense has about the right smell.</li>
            <li>For those only familiar with the aromatherapy aspects, explore this: Rose hip seed oil is a pressed seed oil, extracted from the seeds of a wild rose bush in the southern Andes.</li>
            <li>Alternatively, a few drops sprinkled on a clean cloth and inhaled or added to bathwater for a rejuvenating soak is another way to receive the benefit of an effective sedative.</li>
            <li>I was unsure at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a very versatile oil!</li>
            <li>AVIANO BOTANICALS is a first class outfit.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t get more &#x60;essential than that.</li>
            <li>of these essential oils are top of the line.</li>
            <li>instead she stuck whole cloves in her kid&#x27;s ears!  </li>
            <li>instead she stuck whole cloves in her kid&#x27;s ears!  </li>
            <li>It comes in an amber bottle with an eyedropper - exactly the way it should to protect against oxidation.</li>
            <li>It is the first carrier oil that I have come across that truly has no fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>You only need to add a drop or two to add an exotic and elusive note to your aromatherapy mix.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this reminds me of the bottle that I used, enjoyed till last drop.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a very versatile oil!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip Oil is one of my top favorites, however the Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Organic Rosehip is very different from the others that I have used.</li>

            <li>Not only do they make available to us 100% pure ultra premium oils, but the make the dispensers and the packaging special, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the frankincense oil - a tradition form centuries past and here it is with all of its allure to bring an amazing sense of peace and</li>
            <li>It had a strong middle eastern vibe to it which I&lt;br /&gt;though</li>
            <li>It also is 10% pure and organic.</li>
            <li>Aviano Botanicals rosehip seed oil is so pure.</li>
            <li>Kind of like you&#x27;ve been caught--after a cleansing rain--in the middle of a bright green, wild flower-covered meadow, surrounded by a deep woods filled with old oaks and conifer trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These products are very high quality.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s great to use with a few drops of essential oil to put on your body.</li>

            <li>how much frankincense I need to add to the&lt;br /&gt;Rosemary.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really shoots so</li>
            <li>is a real alternative to synthetic products that make us sicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s placebo effect in my mind, but I really do believe it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li>She stuck whole cloves in his shoes.  </li>
            <li>She stuck whole cloves in his shoes.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a very high-quality product.</li>
            <li>Really has softened my hands and skin.  </li>
            <li>I myself was very surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The two don&#x27;t really work together</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for letting me try this.</li>
            <li>Frankinsense bottle has a dropper lid, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Really, though, it&#x27;s a workhorse in the aromatherapy world.</li>
            <li>it was very therapeutic for my knee  </li>
            <li>thanks so much for my samples</li>
            <li>that the item has definitly met my expectations, and works very well.</li>
            <li>bottle comes with pump (you have to insert after you open the secure bottle cap) and it does not work effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>I much rather has dropper instead of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use this in my diffuser every night and it calms mind and very relexing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to anyone who wants to try it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to anyone who wants to try it.  </li>
            <li>And, if I add a few drops of Frankincense, it smells nice and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can also mix seven drops of rose essential oil, six drops of frankincense, and three drops of lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li>The oil won&#x27;t stay fresh for long--definitely not as long as the bottle lasts--because the fragrance is quickly oozing out from the rubber squeeze head.</li>
            <li>As other reviews have indicated, the pump that comes with the oil is flimsy and does not work most of the time.  </li>
            <li>particular bottle of oil exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I can only smell the faintest odor and it is not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>find that this company, Aviano, creates high quality products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil ..</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend the Aviano frankincense oil.  </li>
            <li>Due the sesquiterpenes, (the naturally occurring compounds within Frankincense Oil) it is able to go beyond the blood-brain barrier and stimulate the limbic system of the brain.</li>
            <li>I add a few drops to all of my lotions and potions and pray for the magic to happen...</li>
            <li>This frankincense is therapeutic grade, not food grade, which means you can use it topically in a carrier oil (such as rose hip oil) but not internally.</li>
            <li>other places, this oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>act like it&#x27;s something new</li>
            <li>act like it&#x27;s something new</li>
            <li>I am new to this oil...</li>
            <li>At first glance, these two oils don&#x27;t seem like an obvious pair.  </li>
            <li>There are many other uses for this essential oil</li>
            <li>Taking Spark Naturals Frankincense essential oil as my main comparison, this is a much lighter oil with a softer presence.</li>
            <li>It’s useful for skin health, and can help treat dry skin, reverse signs of aging, and reduce the appearance of stretch marks and scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;This seems like a good value for the versatility they provide, and a little goes a long way, so it will last for a while.</li>
            <li>the rosehip oil is so soft and light and you only need a drop because it goes a long ,no scent, these two together is the MAX for me...</li>
            <li>more or less chronological order.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both of these bottles have secure tops that can twist quite tightly</li>
            <li>I strongly believe in using natural products to help improve the health of my family whenever possible, and I&#x27;ve been collecting quite a bit of essential oils for various ailments, helping with stress, asthma, focus, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The oil is clear and in a clear plastic pump bottle.</li>
            <li>It is a beautifully clear oil, too.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been around forever, far before there was a medicine aisle in a grocery store.</li>
            <li>I am in no way rejecting Western modern medicine, I still take prescriptions when I need to, but this enlightened me to how I could customize some things at home and try.  </li>

            <li>It leaves your skin soft but not oily</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was provided with review samples of these old to test and evaluate.</li>
            <li>They are actually soft and smooth!!&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>result provided my normally dry hair, with lots of body, incredibly soft, manageable, glossy clean, luxuriously thick, silky, moisturized and smooth, NO frizz, and my hair smelled great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The distributors, Aviano Botanicals, suggests that the rosehip oil be stored in a cool, dark place to preserve the quality of the organic, cold-pressed oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it on my hair and it surpassed Argan oil or (any other oil) for its ability to quench my dry, thirsty curly hair without leaving a trace, only a lovely shine.</li>
            <li>It jammed on the first use</li>
            <li>As a topical agent, please use a carrier oil (my preferred is Jojoba) to help diffusion across the epidermis, as well as preventing any adverse reaction that can happen when a pure essential makes contact with the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve used essential oils a lot, Frankincense was new to me.  </li>
            <li>Add a new essential oil as your budget allows and as your imagination blossoms.  </li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is another oil you can use on hair to prevent a flat iron from burning your hair-in addition to conditioning hair, the high temps of the iron will burn the oil off before it singes your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip is extremely high in essential fatty acids (almost 80%), Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, especially Vitamin C, Vitamin A (retinol), and linoleic and linolenic acids—all superstars for skin and hair health.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is kind of hard to describe the scent for those who have not smelled it before: It is spicy, with no hot or acrid notes; it has a touch of a resin-y scent, and also a woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>A hard worker that is light and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their Rose Hip Essential Oil is 100% pure, unrefined and cold pressed.</li>
            <li>The Frankincense oil  is very powerful and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>so I barely had a chance to try them.  </li>
            <li>At least with eye-dropper, I have direct and full control of the amount I wish to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>At least with eye-dropper, I have direct and full control of the amount I wish to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanical Rosehip Oil mixed with a few drops of Frankincense Oil in the same manner that I have used the others, mostly as a facial and body moisturizer, but regarding a deep conditioning treatment for my hair and scalp, I have received some outstanding results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>I prefer the dropper to other essential oil tops- make it much easier to use!</li>
            <li>as frankincense should - which is a little rare, some vendors use a blend that interferes with the proper scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aviano Botanicals rosehip seed oil has no detectable scent, maybe slightly nutty if I really want to find smell, which is sign of good cold pressed oil</li>
            <li>Those with vibrational diffusers, take note - the no-heat method of vibrational diffusers have trouble properly agitating heavy oils like many sandalwoods and, yes, frankincense.</li>
            <li>It rubs into my skin easily and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, although it does feel a little slippery on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Smelled a little stronger but noticed his sleep was very solid...unusual for him.</li>
            <li>Combined with just a few drops of the Frankincense oil, it makes a simple, worthy fragrance without other additions.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Absolutely great fragrance.</li>

            <li> lol.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;This is a very nice oil.</li>
            <li> My best advice is to use with CARE, not assuming it&#x27;s all simply safe to slather all over.</li>
            <li> My best advice is to use with CARE, not assuming it&#x27;s all simply safe to slather all over.</li>
            <li> Perfect in a diffuser, I add a drop of this with one of my favorite perfumes for an even richer softer fragrance.</li>
            <li> They both have a pleasant smell, but my biggest concern is the tops of bottles.</li>
            <li> this combo is super !, frankincense oil is great for PAIN! !</li>

            <li> Well yes it is like something, a good neutral massage oil.</li>
            <li> Massage oil and earthy oil is a good thing, if that&#x27;s what I was expecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has antibacterial properties and is good for a variety of uses and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Think about it: It was a gift from the 3 wise men 2 thousand years ago along with Myrr and gold, so they must have thought it quite</li>
            <li> frankincense smells absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I really loved using Rosehip seed oil for my skin care in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rose hip oil is light and pleasant, perfect for a night mask, though the pump dispenser that comes with it is a bit fiddly.  </li>
            <li> This vial is excellent; it gives me full control over the amount of drops that I use, and it does not leak at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with both of these items.</li>
            <li> love the fragrance of this Frankincense oil!</li>

            <li> This is an amazing and versatile oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was asked to try this product for an honest review and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s me control the amount better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aromatherapy is fascinating....</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s me control the amount better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aromatherapy is fascinating....</li>
            <li> Frankincense has so many amazing properties, but I loved using this in a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> thank you to the manufacturer for asking me to try this to duct and write out my honest thoughts.</li>
            <li> The oil goes on nicely and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> In addition to cosmeceutical skin care, the combination of frankincense and rose hip oil can be used to massage areas affected by lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also perfect for using with my essential oils as a great carrier oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a good refreshing</li>
            <li> Received free to evaluate and glad I had the opportunity !!</li>
            <li> You blend them together to make a very nice light oil for your face.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the packaging of this particular brand&#x27;s Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty all purpose: aftershave, skin refresher, and just a hippy good scent (lol).</li>
            <li> Always do a patch test to check for allergies, but this is usually very safe for most people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened my Amazon box I could smell the frankincense- a very strong pine scent.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil has a very mild scent, if at all, and it can also be used as a massage oil on its own, or for scars, etc.  </li>
            <li> Frankincense is earthy and kind of strong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was given this product for free to review and I&#x27;m quite satisfied!</li>
            <li> (I have always used Jojoba) is a five win for me, and certainly one to try yourself. :)</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil can also be extracted from Rosa canina, which grows in many regions of the world including South Africa and Europe.</li>
            <li> The oil contains provitamin A (mostly beta-Carotene).</li>

            <li> I just love this stuff.</li>

            <li> reason Aviano is my favorite?</li>
            <li> My favorite though is a couple of drops in the bath.</li>
            <li> However, when combined with the Rosehip Oil as a carrier oil, this delivered some excellent results, especially for a hair conditioning</li>

            <li> I was very excited to try this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strangeness of the oil bothered me, so I wrote to the company asking if this was some kind of specially processed rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I use The &#x27;RHO&#x27; ON MY HAIR,FACE,HANDS, and it soak in good after a hot shower...</li>

            <li> I received this product free for review but as always, despite receiving a free product I&#x27;m perfectly candid in my review.  </li>
            <li> It can also smooth the appearance of healthy looking skin.  </li>
            <li> does well in vibrational diffusers and in humidifiers, that lightness becoming quite heady as it breaks up and goes about its olfactory business.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While i am a certified aromatherapist, the most important thing for newbies is to buy from someone you trust.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly, and really feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spicy and earthy and a little bit exotic, a wonderful smell.  </li>
            <li> Add in the even more concentrated, great topical benefits that rosewater itself gave me, and this &amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34; of rosehip oil</li>
            <li> I received this as a complimentary review oil with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.</li>

            <li> Comes in a plastic bottle with a light scent.</li>
            <li> Voila, smooth, silky hair.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also arrives with a pump which is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I&#x27;m loving Rosehip Oil?</li>
            <li> I have attained the best results with the combination of the Rosehip as a carrier oil with the addition of a few drops of the Frankincense Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I trust the plant based sources and find it far more effective than lab made chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is a very rich and powerful scent, so I do believe it is truly 100% Frankincense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, this is a really unique product</li>
            <li> special!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have these products in my collection and will continue using them</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is normally somewhat sweet with a rose smell.</li>
            <li> The rose hip oil is pure, cold-pressed, and suitable for using directly on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very light oil that seems to absorb much faster than any hand lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a cool pump to get the oil out to&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li> Rose hip oil is also frequently used to heal scarring and diminish photo-aging.</li>
            <li> I have used Fractionated Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond, and Grapeseed before.  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised to find that the Rose Hips oil is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I like to add several drops of Frankincense to my coconut butter, baking soda toothpaste I make because it is good for your teeth and gums (but never ingest this).</li>
            <li> Like I said, heavenly!!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs into the skin replenishing moisture and creates a protective barrier on the skin to help prevent</li>
            <li> However, the lightness of the oil works against it in the simple fan operated diffusers (which the heavier frankincense does best in - humidifiers always seem to be the middle ground).</li>
            <li> Has a serum-like texture that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> may argued that oil is oil, but from my experience using Rosehip seed oil for many years, I can say for sure not all Rosehip oils’ quality is same.  </li>
            <li> I received a Free sample for an evaluation; my research is from multiple internet sites, and my usages, statements and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> The eyedropper makes it easy to deliver exactly the right amount of</li>
            <li> main thing I had with the rosewater was that just a tad too much in my mixture had me smelling like a rose arbor</li>
            <li> You want to be sure your oils are real, organic not fake, and so on.</li>
            <li> It is very effective skin care product, far better than any of facial serum that I’ve used and paid high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Frankincense comes in a little brown bottle and has a great dropper for ease of use.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice (definitely not a frilly perfumey smell, more earthy and soft)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couples, this is fun</li>
            <li> I received these at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> for the Rose Hip Essential Oil</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s fun.</li>
            <li> I also bought a book on Aromatherapy and also a chart: so far the chart and Pinterest have been the most helpful.  </li>
            <li> Some have distinct &amp;#34;rules&amp;#34; for application and usage.</li>
            <li> be like a friend of mine who heard garlic cloves were good for earaches, and who was supposed to make an oil and crushed and filtered garlic blend:  </li>

            <li> I have found that all the purposes for this product, have all worked great so far, so I would definitly purchase these items in the future.</li>
            <li> i received Aviano Botanicals Frankincense, I noticed this is far more concentrated than the one that I am using.  </li>
            <li> The Frankincense has about the right smell.</li>
            <li> For those only familiar with the aromatherapy aspects, explore this: Rose hip seed oil is a pressed seed oil, extracted from the seeds of a wild rose bush in the southern Andes.</li>
            <li> Alternatively, a few drops sprinkled on a clean cloth and inhaled or added to bathwater for a rejuvenating soak is another way to receive the benefit of an effective sedative.</li>
            <li> I was unsure at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a very versatile oil!</li>
            <li> AVIANO BOTANICALS is a first class outfit.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t get more &#x60;essential than that.</li>
            <li> of these essential oils are top of the line.</li>
            <li> instead she stuck whole cloves in her kid&#x27;s ears!  </li>
            <li> instead she stuck whole cloves in her kid&#x27;s ears!  </li>
            <li> It comes in an amber bottle with an eyedropper - exactly the way it should to protect against oxidation.</li>
            <li> It is the first carrier oil that I have come across that truly has no fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> You only need to add a drop or two to add an exotic and elusive note to your aromatherapy mix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this reminds me of the bottle that I used, enjoyed till last drop.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a very versatile oil!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip Oil is one of my top favorites, however the Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Organic Rosehip is very different from the others that I have used.</li>

            <li> It soaks in quickly and makes skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Not only do they make available to us 100% pure ultra premium oils, but the make the dispensers and the packaging special, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the frankincense oil - a tradition form centuries past and here it is with all of its allure to bring an amazing sense of peace and</li>
            <li> It had a strong middle eastern vibe to it which I&lt;br /&gt;though</li>
            <li> It also is 10% pure and organic.</li>
            <li> Aviano Botanicals rosehip seed oil is so pure.</li>
            <li> Kind of like you&#x27;ve been caught--after a cleansing rain--in the middle of a bright green, wild flower-covered meadow, surrounded by a deep woods filled with old oaks and conifer trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These products are very high quality.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s great to use with a few drops of essential oil to put on your body.</li>
            <li> really help escape for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> how much frankincense I need to add to the&lt;br /&gt;Rosemary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really shoots so</li>
            <li> is a real alternative to synthetic products that make us sicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s placebo effect in my mind, but I really do believe it&#x27;s helping.</li>

            <li> She stuck whole cloves in his shoes.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a very high-quality product.</li>
            <li> Really has softened my hands and skin.  </li>
            <li> I myself was very surprised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two don&#x27;t really work together</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try this.</li>
            <li> Frankinsense bottle has a dropper lid, which I really like.  </li>
            <li> very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Really, though, it&#x27;s a workhorse in the aromatherapy world.</li>
            <li> it was very therapeutic for my knee  </li>
            <li> thanks so much for my samples</li>
            <li> that the item has definitly met my expectations, and works very well.</li>
            <li> bottle comes with pump (you have to insert after you open the secure bottle cap) and it does not work effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> I much rather has dropper instead of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use this in my diffuser every night and it calms mind and very relexing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to anyone who wants to try it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to anyone who wants to try it.  </li>
            <li> And, if I add a few drops of Frankincense, it smells nice and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can also mix seven drops of rose essential oil, six drops of frankincense, and three drops of lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> The oil won&#x27;t stay fresh for long--definitely not as long as the bottle lasts--because the fragrance is quickly oozing out from the rubber squeeze head.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have indicated, the pump that comes with the oil is flimsy and does not work most of the time.  </li>
            <li> particular bottle of oil exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I can only smell the faintest odor and it is not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> find that this company, Aviano, creates high quality products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil ..</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend the Aviano frankincense oil.  </li>
            <li> Due the sesquiterpenes, (the naturally occurring compounds within Frankincense Oil) it is able to go beyond the blood-brain barrier and stimulate the limbic system of the brain.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to all of my lotions and potions and pray for the magic to happen...</li>
            <li> This frankincense is therapeutic grade, not food grade, which means you can use it topically in a carrier oil (such as rose hip oil) but not internally.</li>
            <li> other places, this oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> act like it&#x27;s something new</li>
            <li> act like it&#x27;s something new</li>
            <li> I am new to this oil...</li>
            <li> At first glance, these two oils don&#x27;t seem like an obvious pair.  </li>
            <li> There are many other uses for this essential oil</li>
            <li> Taking Spark Naturals Frankincense essential oil as my main comparison, this is a much lighter oil with a softer presence.</li>
            <li> It’s useful for skin health, and can help treat dry skin, reverse signs of aging, and reduce the appearance of stretch marks and scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;This seems like a good value for the versatility they provide, and a little goes a long way, so it will last for a while.</li>
            <li> the rosehip oil is so soft and light and you only need a drop because it goes a long ,no scent, these two together is the MAX for me...</li>
            <li> more or less chronological order.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both of these bottles have secure tops that can twist quite tightly</li>
            <li> I strongly believe in using natural products to help improve the health of my family whenever possible, and I&#x27;ve been collecting quite a bit of essential oils for various ailments, helping with stress, asthma, focus, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The oil is clear and in a clear plastic pump bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a beautifully clear oil, too.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been around forever, far before there was a medicine aisle in a grocery store.</li>
            <li> I am in no way rejecting Western modern medicine, I still take prescriptions when I need to, but this enlightened me to how I could customize some things at home and try.  </li>

            <li> It leaves your skin soft but not oily</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was provided with review samples of these old to test and evaluate.</li>
            <li> They are actually soft and smooth!!&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> result provided my normally dry hair, with lots of body, incredibly soft, manageable, glossy clean, luxuriously thick, silky, moisturized and smooth, NO frizz, and my hair smelled great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The distributors, Aviano Botanicals, suggests that the rosehip oil be stored in a cool, dark place to preserve the quality of the organic, cold-pressed oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair and it surpassed Argan oil or (any other oil) for its ability to quench my dry, thirsty curly hair without leaving a trace, only a lovely shine.</li>
            <li> It jammed on the first use</li>
            <li> As a topical agent, please use a carrier oil (my preferred is Jojoba) to help diffusion across the epidermis, as well as preventing any adverse reaction that can happen when a pure essential makes contact with the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve used essential oils a lot, Frankincense was new to me.  </li>
            <li> Add a new essential oil as your budget allows and as your imagination blossoms.  </li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is another oil you can use on hair to prevent a flat iron from burning your hair-in addition to conditioning hair, the high temps of the iron will burn the oil off before it singes your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip is extremely high in essential fatty acids (almost 80%), Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, especially Vitamin C, Vitamin A (retinol), and linoleic and linolenic acids—all superstars for skin and hair health.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is kind of hard to describe the scent for those who have not smelled it before: It is spicy, with no hot or acrid notes; it has a touch of a resin-y scent, and also a woodsy scent.</li>
            <li> A hard worker that is light and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their Rose Hip Essential Oil is 100% pure, unrefined and cold pressed.</li>
            <li> The Frankincense oil  is very powerful and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so I barely had a chance to try them.  </li>
            <li> At least with eye-dropper, I have direct and full control of the amount I wish to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> At least with eye-dropper, I have direct and full control of the amount I wish to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanical Rosehip Oil mixed with a few drops of Frankincense Oil in the same manner that I have used the others, mostly as a facial and body moisturizer, but regarding a deep conditioning treatment for my hair and scalp, I have received some outstanding results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I prefer the dropper to other essential oil tops- make it much easier to use!</li>
            <li> as frankincense should - which is a little rare, some vendors use a blend that interferes with the proper scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aviano Botanicals rosehip seed oil has no detectable scent, maybe slightly nutty if I really want to find smell, which is sign of good cold pressed oil</li>
            <li> Those with vibrational diffusers, take note - the no-heat method of vibrational diffusers have trouble properly agitating heavy oils like many sandalwoods and, yes, frankincense.</li>
            <li> It rubs into my skin easily and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, although it does feel a little slippery on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Smelled a little stronger but noticed his sleep was very solid...unusual for him.</li>
            <li> Combined with just a few drops of the Frankincense oil, it makes a simple, worthy fragrance without other additions.  </li>
            <li> (just right, and it helped accentuate the patchouli, but it has been hard to hit that point).</li>
            <li> I put a little in a ring that fits over a light bulb and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used both products for thier intended purposes, and have worked out nicely so far, the only thing that I was kinda dissapointed in, was that the spray nozzel on the the one item, quit working only about half way throught the bottle.</li>
            <li> Frankincense Oil&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of Frankincense oils (and a few of incense as well), and the scent itself does vary wildly.</li>
            <li> It will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This combination of oils is a strange one that I would order separately in the future.  </li>
            <li> Spark Naturals is one of these heavier frankincense that I have to use in other types of diffusers, such as a humidifier or a simple fan diffusion, like the Aromifier by</li>
            <li> The Frankincense Oil is definitely high quality; the oil is clear and silvery with a slight green tinge, as opposed to other brown-yellow varieties, which are cheaper and have an inferior quality.</li>
            <li> &#x27; Botanicals is clear in color, without any scent, packaged in a clear plastic bottle with an airless pump spray, it is 100% pure and organic, unrefined and cold</li>
            <li> must also say, I really do prefer the eye-dropper that Aviano uses over the common euro-dropper used by Puritans Pride, Spark Naturals, etcetera .</li>

            <li> So...again...I rub a few drops near my temples...</li>
            <li> This is a strange pair of oils in one box.</li>
            <li> is, when I use it in my diffuser (a few drops in the water ), smell of Frankincense last  long time, whereas my current oil that I am using, it only last little while and smell just disappeared like I didn&#x27;t add enough oil to the water.  </li>

            <li> I live in Southern Calfornia, which means I&#x27;m barefoot a LOT, my heels are, I mean were cracked and dry.</li>
            <li> You can also add any other essential oils to the Rosehip oil and then rub them into your skin.  </li>
            <li> Botanicals Organic Rosehip oil looks, feels and smells very different from the other rosehip oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip oil is so moisturizing for dry skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> For hair, a bit can be rubbed onto dry ends to make them manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s often used in skin potions for dry skin or</li>
            <li> Put the small jar of Rosehip oil in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes, until the oil is warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;still is above average.</li>
            <li> I used the rosehip oil on my color-treated hair and the very dry heels of my feet</li>
            <li> I have tough hands and do very rugged hands on work</li>
            <li> I also use this on other parts of the body if dry.</li>
            <li> It is commonly used for a variety of skin conditions, including dermatitis, acne and eczema, for mature and sun burnt skin as well as brittle nails and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> People of old knew what to use directly and not think they had to buy an expensive box of unidentifiable ingredients.</li>

            <li> Absolutely great fragrance. What a name. Frankincense! I trust the plant based sources and find it far more effective than lab made chemicals. This one was soothing... I was provided a sample in exchange of  a review.</li>
            <li> The rose hip oil is light and pleasant, perfect for a night mask, though the pump dispenser that comes with it is a bit fiddly.  The frankincense smells as frankincense should - which is a little rare, some vendors use a blend that interferes with the proper scent.  The two of them together make for a wonderful skin tonic.  These were sent to me for the purpose of review.</li>
            <li> I was asked to try this product for an honest review and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not your typical scented oil. I thought it was but I was wrong. To me,&lt;br /&gt;this is a beauty care product for the skin. I was unsure at first. However,&lt;br /&gt;I need not worry. This feels so good on your skin. Not too greasy and  still soothing&lt;br /&gt;to all skin types. Please note, if you have Psoriasis then don&#x27;t put this on skin plaque.&lt;br /&gt;All other places, this oil is fantastic. Good for body massage too you couples&lt;br /&gt;out there. Keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the frankincense is not the best I ever smelled, but it&lt;br /&gt;still is above average. It had a strong middle eastern vibe to it which I&lt;br /&gt;though was relaxing. Put some Buddha Bar music on as you oil up. It&lt;br /&gt;will really help escape for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I took a star off my rating. I wish it had clearer directions. I just&lt;br /&gt;took a guess as to how much frankincense I need to add to the&lt;br /&gt;Rosemary.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a cool pump to get the oil out to&lt;br /&gt;use in a neater fashion. It really shoots so don&#x27;t push too hard.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is a really unique product and I hope it catches on.&lt;br /&gt;Here is a real alternative to synthetic products that make us sicker.&lt;br /&gt;Couples, this is fun so give it a shot. Others, get that skin&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and Glowing. Buy this great product!</li>
            <li> The organic rosehip and frankincense come separately. You blend them together to make a very nice light oil for your face. I am of the age when I am trying to age gracefully, and this combo seems to do the trick. I like using products like this because you know what you are getting - no chemicals!</li>
            <li> I purchased Rosehip because of it&#x27;s numerous uses from wrinkles to scars, from acne to dandruff.  It&#x27;s really a very versatile oil! I was impressed with the packaging of this particular brand&#x27;s Rosehip oil.  It not only has a screw-top lid but underneath that is another plastic insert that protects the oil from leaking out.  You take off the cover and pull out the insert to screw on the enclosed pump.  The Rosehip oil absorbs well and leaves you without feeling greasy like you would expect with an oil product.  With this duo I also received the Frankincense oil which is a GREAT EO to use for spiritual focus and also on the bottoms of your feet to alleviate nervous energy! It can also smooth the appearance of healthy looking skin.  This is a GREAT package pairing of oils as the Rosehip oil is unscented whereas the Frankincense is a bit stronger and on the musky side. I received these at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> AVIANO BOTANICALS is a first class outfit. Not only do they make available to us 100% pure ultra premium oils, but the make the dispensers and the packaging special, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the frankincense oil - a tradition form centuries past and here it is with all of its allure to bring an amazing sense of peace and well being when allowed to be used in aromatherapy or simply place in a room to let the relaxing essence permeate the air. Here are no words to describe the unique fragrance and effect this oil has and AVIANO makes dispensing it easy and safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Rose Hip Essential Oil the AVIANO form is 100% pure and is unrefined and cold pressed. It can&#x27;t get more &#x60;essential than that. For those only familiar with the aromatherapy aspects, explore this: Rose hip seed oil is a pressed seed oil, extracted from the seeds of a wild rose bush in the southern Andes. Rosehip seed oil can also be extracted from Rosa canina, which grows in many regions of the world including South Africa and Europe. The oil contains provitamin A (mostly beta-Carotene). It contains levels of tretinoin or all-trans retinoic acid, a vitamin A acid that retinol converts to. It is commonly used in skin care products. It is commonly used for a variety of skin conditions, including dermatitis, acne and eczema, for mature and sun burnt skin as well as brittle nails and wrinkles. Rose hip oil is also frequently used to heal scarring and diminish photo-aging. It quickly absorbs into the skin replenishing moisture and creates a protective barrier on the skin to help prevent dehydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the Rosehip Oil from AVIANO comes in a 4 oz pump bottle making apply the product to the skin easy and sure. Use it on the face, hands, d&amp;eacute;colletage or those annoying little spots that appear on aging skin about anywhere on the body. The results are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these essential oils are top of the line. Highly recommended.

            <li> While I&#x27;ve used essential oils a lot, Frankincense was new to me.  I had seen it mentioned for usage in numerous ways, and I was looking forward to trying it in terms of anxiety and blemishes for me, and for asthma and coughs for my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had made a solution of Eucalyptus, Rosemary, and Lavender with a carrier oil to put on my son&#x27;s feet at night.  That worked well. I added Frankincense to that solution.  Smelled a little stronger but noticed his sleep was very solid...unusual for him. And while he has frequent nightmares (due to an unfortunate incident with an angry person threatening our family with a gun), he hasn&#x27;t had any since.  Maybe it&#x27;s placebo effect in my mind, but I really do believe it&#x27;s helping. I&#x27;m used to hearing him whimper in his sleep, and I sleep on the floor by his bed often, and it hasn&#x27;t been happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I wanted to try the Frankincense on my neck acne scars, basically dark spots in pigmentation left from previous pimples. I&#x27;m almost 50 and still get these!!!  So I haven&#x27;t yet noticed a difference, but I will post if it doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve read several testimonials that it may work great. Also, I put some drops in a carrier oil and have rubbed on the stretch marks on my hips.  Not like I&#x27;m in a bikini, but still, they bug me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, in regard to Frankincense, I have a bad shoulder that is aggravating me. I put a few drops of this with some Eucalyptus and Lavender and have been rubbing it in directly to the sore spot. The scent is nice (definitely not a frilly perfumey smell, more earthy and soft) and I do feel a tingle so I&#x27;m going to continue with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did need a carrier oil so was happy to try the Rosehip. I have used Fractionated Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond, and Grapeseed before.  None of them were bad, although the coconut felt very slippery and greasy.  The Rosehip is neither greasy nor slippery.  I tried Olive Oil and hated that, the scent even of EEVO was too much for a carrier oil.  Rosehip has really no scent, and now is my go-to carrier oil.  I had problems with the pump but I put on a dropper lid that I had from a different empty container and that works great.  Let&#x27;s me control the amount better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aromatherapy is fascinating....a lot of people (my mom!) act like it&#x27;s something new but it&#x27;s been around forever, far before there was a medicine aisle in a grocery store. People of old knew what to use directly and not think they had to buy an expensive box of unidentifiable ingredients. I am in no way rejecting Western modern medicine, I still take prescriptions when I need to, but this enlightened me to how I could customize some things at home and try.  And it&#x27;s fun. I have one box that I keep in a closet with all my oils, and just opening the closet smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Pinterest is a great site to see recipes and ideas for different uses.  I also bought a book on Aromatherapy and also a chart: so far the chart and Pinterest have been the most helpful.  My best advice is to use with CARE, not assuming it&#x27;s all simply safe to slather all over. Some have distinct &amp;#34;rules&amp;#34; for application and usage. Be very careful with infants.  Keep out of kid&#x27;s reach, and out of the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be like a friend of mine who heard garlic cloves were good for earaches, and who was supposed to make an oil and crushed and filtered garlic blend:  instead she stuck whole cloves in her kid&#x27;s ears!  She stuck whole cloves in his shoes.  He smelled bad and his earaches got worse.  So you can&#x27;t be lazy and just use essential oils randomly.  Okay, lecture over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rec&#x27;d samples of both to try for an extended period for inspection and review purposes.Rosehip has really no scent, and now is my go-to carrier oil.

            <li> I have an aversion to greasy stuff on my skin so I was surprised to find that the Rose Hips oil is not greasy. Doesn&#x27;t seem possible. I am experimenting with different uses for the oil and have found it helpful. It has no odor that I can detect. Seems to be a very high-quality product.</li>
            <li> -- Rosehip Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Rosewater as the third part of my patchouli and distilled, fragrance-free hazel witch topical spray - it&#x27;s pretty all purpose: aftershave, skin refresher, and just a hippy good scent (lol). And now I have switched from the rosewater to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing I had with the rosewater was that just a tad too much in my mixture had me smelling like a rose arbor (just right, and it helped accentuate the patchouli, but it has been hard to hit that point). This rosehip oil is neutral in smell, and furthermore it makes a good carrier oil for the patchouli component. Add in the even more concentrated, great topical benefits that rosewater itself gave me, and this &amp;#34;discovery&amp;#34; of rosehip oil (I have always used Jojoba) is a five win for me, and certainly one to try yourself. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Frankincense Oil&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of Frankincense oils (and a few of incense as well), and the scent itself does vary wildly. Taking Spark Naturals Frankincense essential oil as my main comparison, this is a much lighter oil with a softer presence. Those with vibrational diffusers, take note - the no-heat method of vibrational diffusers have trouble properly agitating heavy oils like many sandalwoods and, yes, frankincense. Spark Naturals is one of these heavier frankincense that I have to use in other types of diffusers, such as a humidifier or a simple fan diffusion, like the Aromifier by SpaRoom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So does well in vibrational diffusers and in humidifiers, that lightness becoming quite heady as it breaks up and goes about its olfactory business. However, the lightness of the oil works against it in the simple fan operated diffusers (which the heavier frankincense does best in - humidifiers always seem to be the middle ground). As a topical agent, please use a carrier oil (my preferred is Jojoba) to help diffusion across the epidermis, as well as preventing any adverse reaction that can happen when a pure essential makes contact with the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must also say, I really do prefer the eye-dropper that Aviano uses over the common euro-dropper used by Puritans Pride, Spark Naturals, etcetera . Those drive me nuts sometimes. At least with eye-dropper, I have direct and full control of the amount I wish to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I received this as a complimentary review oil with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.

            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this Francincense oil. It&#x27;s wonderful. And I love the Rosehip Oil. I use it on my face. It even removes stubborn make up. But it&#x27;s great to use with a few drops of essential oil to put on your body.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this [[ASIN:B00VIMYF82 Organic Rosehip Seed Oil By Av&amp;iacute;anō Botanicals]] and here&#x27;s why. The benefits of Rosehip Seed Oil are amazing for me, helping with both complexion issues and skin appearance on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have most enjoyed about this product is the moisturizing nature it has. I have tough hands and do very rugged hands on work and I like that this product almost rolls back time on the roughness I expose my hands to. Really has softened my hands and skin.  It does wonders on complexion problems I have on my shoulders clearing them up very quickly.  I myself was very surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a 4oz (120ml) bottle with a pump top. Using only a couple drops per application, this product size seems to last forever and I find the pump dispenser helps me to get even amounts for application without going overboard with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included in this kit is a 10ML bottle of Frankincense essential oil.  Frankincense has so many amazing properties, but I loved using this in a diffuser.  The bottle comes with an eye dropper making it perfect for getting a few drops into the diffuser.  Excellent smell of frankincense and very pleased with both products in this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I think that frankincense oil is one of the oldest oils out there...doesn&#x27;t it go along with something called myrrh?  I am new to this oil...but its properties are wide and varied!  It can help you to relax. It is a soothing oil...it can help your immune system...again...I am just starting to learn about and use this oil but the are some of the facts I have discovered in my reading.  I also read that it has astringent properties which are always great!  So...again...I rub a few drops near my temples...I add a few drops to all of my lotions and potions and pray for the magic to happen...lol.  But truly...I just love the smell...anything else it does is a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thank you to the manufacturer for asking me to try this to duct and write out my honest thoughts.</li>
            <li> I use these both for massage and they&#x27;re great! They both have a pleasant smell, but my biggest concern is the tops of bottles. Many oils have insecure tops which can increase the risk of leakage when I carry them in bags. Both of these bottles have secure tops that can twist quite tightly so I&#x27;ve not had a problem with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for free to review and I&#x27;m quite satisfied!</li>
            <li> I strongly believe in using natural products to help improve the health of my family whenever possible, and I&#x27;ve been collecting quite a bit of essential oils for various ailments, helping with stress, asthma, focus, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to receive a sample of this product for review purposes.  At first glance, these two oils don&#x27;t seem like an obvious pair.  But then I realized the Rosehip oil could be a carrier for other oils, then I understood.  The Rosehip oil has a very mild scent, if at all, and it can also be used as a massage oil on its own, or for scars, etc.  The Frankincense oil  is very powerful and a little goes a long way.  You can add a drop to some Rosehip oil and it is diluted a bit.  You can also add any other essential oils to the Rosehip oil and then rub them into your skin.  The Rosehip oil has a pump and is 4 ounces but the Frankincense is a dropper bottle and is only one ounce I believe.  I noticed that I can add a drop of the Frankincense oil to my vaporizer when I&#x27;m sick.  It can also be added to bathwater, or in the shower to mix with the steam.  It makes the bathroom seem more like a spa.&lt;br /&gt;This seems like a good value for the versatility they provide, and a little goes a long way, so it will last for a while.</li>
            <li> This is a strange pair of oils in one box. Rosehip oil is normally somewhat sweet with a rose smell. Frankincense is earthy and kind of strong. The two don&#x27;t really work together very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then the oils are a little strange. The Frankincense has about the right smell. It comes in an amber bottle with an eyedropper - exactly the way it should to protect against oxidation. The eyedropper makes it easy to deliver exactly the right amount of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosehip oil is nothing like anything I have ever used before. Well yes it is like something, a good neutral massage oil. There is no odor. I tried to imagine roses, but it didn&#x27;t work. The oil is clear and in a clear plastic pump bottle. The oil goes on nicely and moisturizes my skin. It rubs in wonderfully. And, if I add a few drops of Frankincense, it smells nice and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting roses and earth - instead I got earth and massage oil. Massage oil and earthy oil is a good thing, if that&#x27;s what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strangeness of the oil bothered me, so I wrote to the company asking if this was some kind of specially processed rosehip oil. I never heard back. It has been a couple of weeks, so I guess they don&#x27;t know why it is an oil and not rosehips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like oil and earth - hey this combo is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A free sample was provided for review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with both of these items. I mixed a little bit of frankincense in with the rosehip oil and use it faithfully on my face, neck instead of other face creams and I&#x27;ve noticed a better complexion. I also use this on other parts of the body if dry. I just love this stuff. Thanks for letting me try this. I&#x27;d like to try out other items you have as well.&lt;br /&gt;chest, feet and</li>
            <li> I used the rosehip oil on my color-treated hair and the very dry heels of my feet and it was amazing. The oil is rosehip, not rose oil, so it has no fragrance at all. It is a very light oil that seems to absorb much faster than any hand lotion. It leaves your skin soft but not oily, I didn&#x27;t have a problem leaving finger prints all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit confused about the combo of the two products. I read up about frankincense and saw that people claim if heals everything from migraine headaches to warts. I have neither (or any of the other ailments mentioned) but I do like the scent. I put a little in a ring that fits over a light bulb and a little goes a long way. The smell is nice and natural, not like nasty air fresheners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given samples of both products to try and test.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set, and a wonderful way to get started on a hobby of creating aromatherapy fragrances.  The rosehip is a superb carrier oil. It is the first carrier oil that I have come across that truly has no fragrance at all. It is a beautifully clear oil, too. It soaks in quickly, and really feels great on my skin. It has done wonders for my elbows.  Combined with just a few drops of the Frankincense oil, it makes a simple, worthy fragrance without other additions.  Add a new essential oil as your budget allows and as your imagination blossoms.  Because once you start reading about and investigating the &amp;#34;science&amp;#34; of aromatherapy, I guarantee you will want to build many fragrance combinations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance of this Frankincense oil! It is a very rich and powerful scent, so I do believe it is truly 100% Frankincense. You only need to add a drop or two to add an exotic and elusive note to your aromatherapy mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of hard to describe the scent for those who have not smelled it before: It is spicy, with no hot or acrid notes; it has a touch of a resin-y scent, and also a woodsy scent. Kind of like you&#x27;ve been caught--after a cleansing rain--in the middle of a bright green, wild flower-covered meadow, surrounded by a deep woods filled with old oaks and conifer trees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice oil. I wish they capped the bottle with a screw-top lid, rather than the rubbery dropper head. The oil won&#x27;t stay fresh for long--definitely not as long as the bottle lasts--because the fragrance is quickly oozing out from the rubber squeeze head. I&#x27;m all for having a dropper included with the bottle, but not in it. I will be re-capping mine, as it is a standard size/shape bottle.  (Good thing I keep all my empty bottles and caps.  They always come in handy!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The distributors, Aviano Botanicals, suggests that the rosehip oil be stored in a cool, dark place to preserve the quality of the organic, cold-pressed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Aviano Botanicals.&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Aviano Botanicals.</li>
            <li> I received this product free for review but as always, despite receiving a free product I&#x27;m perfectly candid in my review.  My observations follow below in more or less chronological order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of the Frankinsense oil.  It&#x27;s spicy and earthy and a little bit exotic, a wonderful smell.  I have used it in a diffuser and also have mixed it with the carrier oil and put it on my hands to help relieve dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Frankinsense bottle has a dropper lid, which I really like.  It makes measuring/counting drops very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the pump bottle for the rosehip oil.  It jammed on the first use but since then has been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosehip oil has no scent so it does not detract from the essential oil&#x27;s fragrance.  It rubs into my skin easily and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, although it does feel a little slippery on my skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it regularly so I can&#x27;t address any effect it has had on dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I hope my review was helpful.  If it was not, then please let me know what I left out that you’d want to know.  I always aim to improve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rosehip oil on my skin for quite some time. I like Argon oil for my hair, even though this is great stuff for hair too, but I prefer Rosehip oil for my skin. I use it almost everyday on my face and neck. I&#x27;ve not used the combination of Frankincense with my oil but this is a wonderful addition and the Frankincense smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products are very high quality. The Rosehip oil is so moisturizing for dry skin and wrinkles. It has almost no scent alone and is colorless. The Frankincense adds some color and scent, or you can use either one alone for whatever purposes you use them for. I like to add several drops of Frankincense to my coconut butter, baking soda toothpaste I make because it is good for your teeth and gums (but never ingest this). It has antibacterial properties and is good for a variety of uses and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that this company, Aviano, creates high quality products. Rosehip oil is amazing-and the quality of their oil is fabulous. It soaks in quickly and makes skin very soft. For hair, a bit can be rubbed onto dry ends to make them manageable and shiny. Rosehip oil is another oil you can use on hair to prevent a flat iron from burning your hair-in addition to conditioning hair, the high temps of the iron will burn the oil off before it singes your hair. There are lots of great uses for it.  Together, Rosehip Oil and Frankincense is a wonderful idea. I am thankful to the company for providing  me the product to try for review. I really like it. The only complaint I have is the pumper on the bottle of Rosehip oil is a little hard to push. It does control the amount of product that comes out so you don&#x27;t waste it-but it is a little hard to pump. The Frankincense comes in a little brown bottle and has a great dropper for ease of use.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5006e712a2da52688cde589f786cbd20]] Rosehip Oil comes with a pump that likes to stick and Frankincense with an dropper to avoid spilling. The oil combo came together, the rosehip oil in a box with a cap and pump included, and the frankincense oil in bubble wrap. As soon as I opened my Amazon box I could smell the frankincense- a very strong pine scent. I was sent these products free to try in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Av¨ªan¨­ Botanicals Organic Rosehip oil looks, feels and smells very different from the other rosehip oils I have tried. Comes in a plastic bottle with a light scent. Has a serum-like texture that absorbs quickly. The pump on my bottle likes to stick. I used it as a carrier oil for the frankincense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aviano Botanicals Frankincense Essential Oil is a small glass bottle that didn&#x27;t come with a cap but instead a dropper. I prefer the dropper to other essential oil tops- make it much easier to use! I used the frankincense by adding a few drops to existing air freshener bag that had lost its scent mixed with rosehip oil, lavender, and lemon and frankincense scent lasts much longer than topically on skin. My van has been smelling great and it has a calming effect on my passengers.</li>
            <li> I was invited to review these two products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the oil. It is the Rolls Royce (or among that class) of oils for the face, working wonders to tighten, lighten spots, soften, and heal scars. A hard worker that is light and non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular bottle of oil exceeded my expectations. I used it on my hair and it surpassed Argan oil or (any other oil) for its ability to quench my dry, thirsty curly hair without leaving a trace, only a lovely shine. The loveliness of this oil inspires me to make some interesting face serums at a fraction of the price of what you&#x27;d pay retail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While i am a certified aromatherapist, the most important thing for newbies is to buy from someone you trust. You want to be sure your oils are real, organic not fake, and so on. Your nose if finely tuned will tell. You can then find lots of recipes specialized for your needs online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frankincense has a lovely, haunting aroma, but it takes some getting used to for some people. Really, though, it&#x27;s a workhorse in the aromatherapy world. It heals, cools, calms, elevates the mood, and more. It&#x27;s often used in skin potions for dry skin or wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about it: It was a gift from the 3 wise men 2 thousand years ago along with Myrr and gold, so they must have thought it quite special!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited to have these products in my collection and will continue using them happily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad to have learned about this supplier, too.</li>
            <li> The rose hip oil is pure, cold-pressed, and suitable for using directly on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides essential fatty acids and nutrients, including a plant-derived vitamin A that can heal scarring and sun damage. My grandmother used it for everything from insect bites to burns to age spots. Always do a patch test to check for allergies, but this is usually very safe for most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frankincense smells absolutely gorgeous. It also is 10% pure and organic. It has anti-inflammatory properties and gets used a lot in anti-aging skin care products. This frankincense is therapeutic grade, not food grade, which means you can use it topically in a carrier oil (such as rose hip oil) but not internally. In addition to cosmeceutical skin care, the combination of frankincense and rose hip oil can be used to massage areas affected by lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. A woman can rub some on her lower abdomen for relief from menopause symptoms or other kinds of discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with review samples of these old to test and evaluate.</li>
            <li> this combo is super !, frankincense oil is great for PAIN! ! it was very therapeutic for my knee  I was so surprise ? I highly recommend this oil ..the rosehip oil is so soft and light and you only need a drop because it goes a long ,no scent, these two together is the MAX for me...I&#x27;m in love with Both of them  ! I use The &#x27;RHO&#x27; ON MY HAIR,FACE,HANDS, and it soak in good after a hot shower...LV-it.. thanks so much for my samples , I will order this combo .</li>
            <li> I recieved the product as a promotional item. I used both products for thier intended purposes, and have worked out nicely so far, the only thing that I was kinda dissapointed in, was that the spray nozzel on the the one item, quit working only about half way throught the bottle. But honestly when do those things work flawlessly anyway. Lol. Other than that the item has definitly met my expectations, and works very well. I have found that all the purposes for this product, have all worked great so far, so I would definitly purchase these items in the future.</li>
            <li> Rosehip Seed Oil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may argued that oil is oil, but from my experience using Rosehip seed oil for many years, I can say for sure not all Rosehip oils’ quality is same.  I have Chilean friend who gave me a bottle of Rosehip seed oil  many years ago and this reminds me of the bottle that I used, enjoyed till last drop.  I was given this item to try and write my review and I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Aviano Botanicals rosehip seed oil is so pure. When I apply to skin, my skin soak it up like water and leave no oily residue.  It looks and feels like oil, but when contact with skin, it does not feel sticky or heavy like typical oil or serum.&lt;br /&gt;Aviano Botanicals rosehip seed oil has no detectable scent, maybe slightly nutty if I really want to find smell, which is sign of good cold pressed oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip is extremely high in essential fatty acids (almost 80%), Rich in vitamins and antioxidants, especially Vitamin C, Vitamin A (retinol), and linoleic and linolenic acids—all superstars for skin and hair health.  I really loved using Rosehip seed oil for my skin care in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aviano Botanicals rosehip seed oil is pretty good size for the price. It will last for a long time. It is very effective skin care product, far better than any of facial serum that I’ve used and paid high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle comes with pump (you have to insert after you open the secure bottle cap) and it does not work effortlessly.  Sometimes pump locks and won’t pump any of the product.  I much rather has dropper instead of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense Oil:&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I ordered Frankincense Essential oil for my shoulder injury. Frankincense is like nature of &#x27;ben gay&#x27;.  Frankincense is also refer as &amp;#34;miracle in a bottle&amp;#34; and usually it is very expensive.  I also use this in my diffuser every night and it calms mind and very relexing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i received Aviano Botanicals Frankincense, I noticed this is far more concentrated than the one that I am using.  Another thing to note on Aviano Botanicals Frankincense  is, when I use it in my diffuser (a few drops in the water ), smell of Frankincense last  long time, whereas my current oil that I am using, it only last little while and smell just disappeared like I didn&#x27;t add enough oil to the water.  This Aviano Botanicals Frankincense oil comes with dropper for easy use and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am avid essential oil user and some Frankincense oil that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past were over $65 and still didn&#x27;t do the job as well as Aviano Botanicals Frankincense oil.  I don&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this to anyone who wants to try it.  Especially when you order this item, not only you get the good Rosehip seed oil, you  will also get to try Frankcense Oil.Frankincense  is, when I use it in my diffuser (a few drops in the water ), smell of Frankincense last  long time, whereas my current oil that I am using, it only last little while and smell just disappeared like I didn&#x27;t add enough oil to the water.

            <li> Got wrinkles you want to minimize?  You can also mix seven drops of rose essential oil, six drops of frankincense, and three drops of lavender essential oil. These Aviano oils will definitely help you get rid of wrinkles and spots around your cheeks and eyes.  The rosehip oil will also give your skin an incredible glow and over time will minimize acne scars an even out your skin tone.  We recently had about ten days of non-stop rain and my hair was getting frizzy.  I put a couple of drops the rosehip oil in my palms and dabbed it in my hair...Voila, smooth, silky hair.  The Aviano rosehip oil is not greasy and will instantly sink into your skin and/or hair.  As other reviews have indicated, the pump that comes with the oil is flimsy and does not work most of the time.  However, it obviously does not affect the effectiveness of the rosehip oil...you can use the oil without the pump.  The fragrance is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aviano frankincense oil is a great antiseptic.  You can even use it on wounds.  It is also has digestive properties...it will help with indigestion and acidity.  The frankincense oil promotes the secretion of essential digestive juices in your stomach.  There are many other uses for this essential oil and I highly recommend the Aviano frankincense oil.  Some of the other reviewers have commented about the odor of the oil...I can only smell the faintest odor and it is not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> This combination of oils is a strange one that I would order separately in the future.  Sample received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It no sooner came in the door and my wife snatched them both up so I barely had a chance to try them.  The Rosehip Oil is smooth and clear and is a great moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t know what to do with Frankincense since I didn&#x27;t care for the aroma but my wife did.  She said it was for soothing the nerves and started rubbing it on her feet.  If it works, great.</li>
            <li> I am an Aviano Botanicals fan through and through. Their Rose Hip Essential Oil is 100% pure, unrefined and cold pressed. I love the fact that this oil absorbs quickly and it and replenishes the moisture in my skin. I adore this oil on the heels of my feet. I live in Southern Calfornia, which means I&#x27;m barefoot a LOT, my heels are, I mean were cracked and dry. This oil has transformed my heels!! They are actually soft and smooth!!&lt;br /&gt;Next reason Aviano is my favorite? This is a big bottle! 4 ounces! Also arrives with a pump which is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;Another reason I&#x27;m loving Rosehip Oil? I&#x27;ve been putting this oil on my age spots; not just on my face put hands too and they are actually getting lighter!! I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased!! .&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip oil is a beauty product that should be on every one&#x27;s counter! This is an amazing and versatile oil.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased Rosehip because of it&#x27;s numerous uses from wrinkles to scars, from acne to dandruff. It&#x27;s really a very versatile oil! Great for scars, healing skin, fading age spots. Don&#x27;t let the name scare you, Rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;ll smell like a florist. Rosehip oil has no scent to it. It&#x27;s also perfect for using with my essential oils as a great carrier oil.&lt;br /&gt;The Frankincense, oh my goodness what a heavenly fragrance!! Perfect in a diffuser, I add a drop of this with one of my favorite perfumes for an even richer softer fragrance. My favorite though is a couple of drops in the bath. Add a drop or two in with my Rosehip Oil as a body moisturizer, I don&#x27;t need any perfume or cologne. Like I said, heavenly!!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way.</li>
            <li> Worthwhile !!  Received free to evaluate and glad I had the opportunity !!</li>
            <li> I have attained the best results with the combination of the Rosehip as a carrier oil with the addition of a few drops of the Frankincense Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is one of my top favorites, however the Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Organic Rosehip is very different from the others that I have used. The Rosehip Oil by Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanicals is clear in color, without any scent, packaged in a clear plastic bottle with an airless pump spray, it is 100% pure and organic, unrefined and cold pressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Frankincense Essential Oil comes in a dark brown amber bottle with the normal vial delivery. This vial is excellent; it gives me full control over the amount of drops that I use, and it does not leak at all. The Frankincense Oil is definitely high quality; the oil is clear and silvery with a slight green tinge, as opposed to other brown-yellow varieties, which are cheaper and have an inferior quality. This Frankincense oil has a woody, earthy, spicy, and slightly fruity aroma, a good refreshing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I tried the Frankincense in my diffuser, but I did not feel that the scent dispersed well. However, when combined with the Rosehip Oil as a carrier oil, this delivered some excellent results, especially for a hair conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested the Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanical Rosehip Oil mixed with a few drops of Frankincense Oil in the same manner that I have used the others, mostly as a facial and body moisturizer, but regarding a deep conditioning treatment for my hair and scalp, I have received some outstanding results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Conditioning Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;• 2 tbsp. Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanicals Rosehip Oil (heated)&lt;br /&gt;• 7 drops of Frankincense&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Pour the Rosehip oil in a small glass covered jar (a small baby food jar is perfect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Put the small jar of Rosehip oil in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes, until the oil is warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Add 7 drops of Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanicals Frankincense Oil and swish around until blended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Massage into scalp thoroughly, then comb through the hair to distribute the oils throughout the hair strands and down to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Either let the oils soak in for a few hours, or overnight, or use a heating cap, for a faster treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Shampoo and rinse thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result provided my normally dry hair, with lots of body, incredibly soft, manageable, glossy clean, luxuriously thick, silky, moisturized and smooth, NO frizz, and my hair smelled great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people are not aware of the benefits of Frankincense Oil. Due the sesquiterpenes, (the naturally occurring compounds within Frankincense Oil) it is able to go beyond the blood-brain barrier and stimulate the limbic system of the brain. This enables Frankincense as effective against many diseases, making it ideal for supporting the body&#x27;s natural healing abilities, uniquely able to address diseases, and research is in the process of studying Frankincense for its potential to treat cancer. Scientists have observed that there’s an agent in this oil that not only stops cancer from spreading, but also induces cancerous cells to close themselves down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Benefits of Frankincense Oil&lt;br /&gt;The health benefits of frankincense oil are its anti-inflammatory, astringent, antiseptic, disinfectant, digestive, diuretic, and expectorant properties. However, I am only listing the topical or inhalation advantages below.&lt;br /&gt;• Arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) – reduces inflammation&lt;br /&gt;• Colds and respiratory disorders – helpful in the capacity to break up phlegm deposits in the respiratory tract and lungs, and can relieve bronchitis-related congestion.&lt;br /&gt;• Oral health problems – The antiseptic qualities of this oil can help prevent bad breath, cavities, toothaches, mouth sores, and other infections.&lt;br /&gt;• Strengthens gums&lt;br /&gt;• Strengthen hair roots&lt;br /&gt;• Stops wound bleeding&lt;br /&gt;• Speeds up healing for cuts, acne, boils, and insect bites&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects and benefits of Av&amp;iacute;an&#x27; Botanicals Frankincense oil by inhalation with a diffuser or vaporizer, works for treating colds and clearing up respiratory blockages. Alternatively, a few drops sprinkled on a clean cloth and inhaled or added to bathwater for a rejuvenating soak is another way to receive the benefit of an effective sedative. This induces the feeling of mental piece, relaxation, and helps to relieve anxiety, anger and stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For pain relief, blend a few drops with the Rosehip Oil for a soothing massage, or for a small area regarding healing skin irritations apply the Frankincense oil directly to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankincense oil promotes healthy cell regeneration and keeps existing cells and tissues healthy. It’s useful for skin health, and can help treat dry skin, reverse signs of aging, and reduce the appearance of stretch marks and scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation; my research is from multiple internet sites, and my usages, statements and opinions are my own.ernatively, a few drops sprinkled on a clean cloth and inhaled or added to bathwater for a rejuvenating soak is another way to receive the benefit of an effective sedative.
