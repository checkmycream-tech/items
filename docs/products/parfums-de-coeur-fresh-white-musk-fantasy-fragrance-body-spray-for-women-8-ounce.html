            <li>I love this fragrance, I use to buy it at Walmart,but they stopped selling it,and I have to have it.</li>
            <li>It has such a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>I hope Parfums de Coeur will consider making much more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve purchased many, many fragrances over the years, and I&#x27;m sure you know there are many fragrances that label themselves \\&quot;perfume\\</li>
            <li>musk)I love this spray</li>
            <li>mmmmmmm You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I use it as a parfum also :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have much more to say</li>
            <li>I Love this fragrance</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 just to spread the charge over more than one product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to most scents.</li>
            <li>I have ordered many bottles and will continue to stock up.</li>
            <li>trust me when I say that this is one of my top 5 favorites.</li>
            <li>it lasts ALL day long AND smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>If it floats your boat, more power to you, but I&#x27;m a HIGHLY vanilla-y kind of person, and I love cotton candy scents as well.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>when my returning customers come they say ( we knew you were here because of the wonderful smell in the air from my fresh white</li>
            <li>and I have to say that the fragrance was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it overly strong</li>
            <li>this spray is really good is not too strong but I will advice you if you put some on just put two sprays or other wise</li>
            <li>This fragrance smelled nice when I first smelled it in Walmart.</li>
            <li>The price is great, shipping fast, and this fragrance is divine, it smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Light.</li>
            <li>what more could one say about anything that just brings fun to your life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to strong or sweet smelling .</li>
            <li>I tried it and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>&quot; - supposedly the most concentrated and longest-lasting form of fragrance - that cost many, many times the price of Fresh White Musk Fantasy Body Spray but that fade away very quickly after you&#x27;ve applied them.  </li>
            <li>It is light and fresh and never overpowers.  </li>
            <li>Then, of course like most products I really like, it dissappeared.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very quick and it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a clean fresh smell with a hint of musk.</li>
            <li>It is a bit heavy but still smells wonderful once it is aired out.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent,not over powering.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the mail fee though to purchase it by mail.  </li>
            <li>It seems to make the ladies smile.</li>
            <li>and I always receive copliments on how \\&quot;fresh and clean\\&quot;, it smells.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>you would start to sneeze or get allergies depending on how your body reacts but other than that it is really good.</li>
            <li>For me, when just applied the smell kind of bother my allergy, little too strong..</li>
            <li>This is a clean, fresh, floral, with just a hint of musk - not heavy or cloying at all, like some musks are.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on this scent, even after eight hours at work when I&#x27;ve applied it some nine hours before, and this is now the only fragrance I wear.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If you love White Musk, Body Fantasies is the way to go!!!</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed it lightly because it smelled heavy and even lightly spraying made me sneeze</li>
            <li>Amazing quantity for such a low price</li>
            <li>This product, Fresh White Musk Fantasy body spray, is the only scent that I have used for many years.  </li>
            <li>Really missed the smell afte a while, AND missed the compliments as well so</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loathed the fragrance for this reason.</li>
            <li>The mail charges are as much as the product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this fresh scent and remember when nearly every grocery store carried the product.</li>
            <li>Seriously it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it last all day long!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find this for a few years and just love the smell it has.</li>
            <li>I like it, but it smells better after it dried.</li>
            <li>I like better after dried.</li>
            <li>hmm not hard to decide.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li>People I don&#x27;t know frequently stop and say they like my perfume and sometimes ask what is it.  </li>
            <li>I was going to buy the Donna Karen Cashmere Mist because it has a soft scent</li>
            <li>I have been using Fresh White Musk Fantasy Body Spray for several years...</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a lovely fragrance for those who enjoy that sort of thing, but unfortunately I despised it!</li>
            <li>I might as well just save my money on other expensive stuff that is out there and just stock up on this...     Great product.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle scent of musk and I am constantly being complimented and asked &amp;</li>
            <li>The can market it like Skin So Soft...which i have used and it would only work on one bug like mosquitoes but not black flies or vice versa.</li>
            <li>And for less than seven dollars for an eight-ounce bottle, I promise you the fragrance really DOES last all day!</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t find this very often in the stores, and when I do find it, it&#x27;s the small bottle.</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent.  </li>
            <li> For a long time, that&#x27;s where I continued to buy it.  </li>
            <li> One spray goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I get compliments all day long!</li>
            <li> Very strong that it gave me a bad cold!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I was introduced to this product a few years back from a co-worker who got a bottle for a dollar at the Family Dollar Store here in our area.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as if I wasted money getting the set with white musk ( I wanted to get stuff purse-sized) because if I needed air freshner, it does the job to kill odors.</li>
            <li> She was unable to find this particular product in the larger size bottle, so she will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> That is why I went to the trouble to try to find a place to purchase it when it appeared that WalMart, where I usually bought it, was not carrying it anymore.  </li>
            <li> When people ask what it is, I always say Chanel no. 11 -- no one ever guesses my little secret.</li>
            <li> This was a random little gift I bought my mom.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry this is hard to find.</li>
            <li> , that should have been my tip off of worse to come.</li>
            <li> too bad we can\t get it in Canada.  </li>

            <li> The smell was great but the spray part came off as soon as I opened it, I couldn&#x27;t put it back on either</li>
            <li> This is a great smell. It is a bit heavy but still smells wonderful once it is aired out. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  This is the only perfume I use and I get a lot of compliments on it.  It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> You sure get a lot for your money with this one... it lasts ALL day long AND smells wonderful.  I always find myself coming back to using this scent. I might as well just save my money on other expensive stuff that is out there and just stock up on this...     Great product. I dont know what I would do if they stopped producing it.</li>
            <li> People I don&#x27;t know frequently stop and say they like my perfume and sometimes ask what is it.  I just say its musk and don&#x27;t let on that its a $7 body spray.</li>
            <li> The body spray is great... I have to hand it to my girlfriend... that is the scent that she wears and she just loves it.</li>
            <li> This product, Fresh White Musk Fantasy body spray, is the only scent that I have used for many years.  It is light and fresh and never overpowers.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments and have given it as gifts and recommended it to many others.</li>
            <li> I found this body splash at my local Walgreen&#x27;s and I immediately thought back to a friend of mine who loves White Musk anything.  I tried it and was not disappointed.  I have been trying to cut back on my parfum/body splash spending and I have decided this is going to be my go to scent.  I also receive many compliments while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is it makes me sneeze while applying, but most body splashes make me sneeze anyway.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I was introduced to this product a few years back from a co-worker who got a bottle for a dollar at the Family Dollar Store here in our area.  For a long time, that&#x27;s where I continued to buy it.  Then, of course like most products I really like, it dissappeared.  Really missed the smell afte a while, AND missed the compliments as well so................I looked it up on the I-net and \\&quot;whala,\\&quot; there it was on my (always) trusty Amazon website.  It&#x27;s no longer a dollar of course, but I do love the smell and will continue to try to keep it close at hand. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using Fresh White Musk Fantasy Body Spray for several years...I love the light scent and continue to receive compliments on how good I smell....it works for me...thanks!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smelled nice when I first smelled it in Walmart. I got this along with the Vanilla. So, anyhow, I put this spray on before work and I have to say that the fragrance was too strong for me. It was giving me a headache and I absolutely loathed the fragrance for this reason. I sprayed it lightly because it smelled heavy and even lightly spraying made me sneeze, that should have been my tip off of worse to come. I think it&#x27;s a lovely fragrance for those who enjoy that sort of thing, but unfortunately I despised it! I think I will ship this to my sister.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, I use to buy it at Walmart,but they stopped selling it,and I have to have it. I went on line and now I can get it again.It has such a wonderful smell.I always get compliments when I go out.It has a fresh scent,not over powering.You just have to get this Body spray.Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry this is hard to find. While everyone else buys it for the smell of cologne...what you must not know is that this is the best bug dope out there. we have used it in think bug infestations and it does wonders.  I use it instead of deet. I hope Parfums de Coeur will consider making much more of this stuff. The can market it like Skin So Soft...which i have used and it would only work on one bug like mosquitoes but not black flies or vice versa. This stuff worked on everything. Please don&#x27;t stop making this stuff. PLEASE!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this fresh scent and remember when nearly every grocery store carried the product. That&#x27;s where I purchased the candles and wish I could still find them. The candles are the best candles I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a clean, fresh, floral, with just a hint of musk - not heavy or cloying at all, like some musks are.  And for less than seven dollars for an eight-ounce bottle, I promise you the fragrance really DOES last all day! I get many compliments on this scent, even after eight hours at work when I&#x27;ve applied it some nine hours before, and this is now the only fragrance I wear. Amazing quantity for such a low price - I&#x27;ve purchased many, many fragrances over the years, and I&#x27;m sure you know there are many fragrances that label themselves \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; - supposedly the most concentrated and longest-lasting form of fragrance - that cost many, many times the price of Fresh White Musk Fantasy Body Spray but that fade away very quickly after you&#x27;ve applied them.  The Body Fantasies line is exceptional quality for the price, and this is among their most lovely scents.  Very highly recommended.  And since my local drug chain has stopped carrying the line, how terrific that I can now order this fragrance from Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful body spray. I Work in a hotel at the front desk and when my returning customers come they say ( we knew you were here because of the wonderful smell in the air from my fresh white musk)I love this spray and I hope it will continue to be processed. If you have not tryed it you should. It&#x27;s not to strong or sweet smelling . It&#x27;s just a clean fresh smell with a hint of musk. mmmmmmm You&#x27;ll love it. Thanks! BB</li>
            <li> Love it! Didn&#x27;t find this for a few years and just love the smell it has. I use it as a parfum also :)</li>
            <li> Light. Airy. Inexpensive. Perfect for sumer. I&#x27;ve used it for years in the summer time. Love it. Don&#x27;t have much more to say - I think I&#x27;ve said it all.</li>
            <li> I Love this fragrance</li>
            <li> This was a random little gift I bought my mom. She loved it! It arrived very quick and it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I really like it.  That is why I went to the trouble to try to find a place to purchase it when it appeared that WalMart, where I usually bought it, was not carrying it anymore.  I don&#x27;t think it is worth the mail fee though to purchase it by mail.  The mail charges are as much as the product.  I bought 2 just to spread the charge over more than one product (3 products would have increased the mail charge again).</li>
            <li> I like it, but it smells better after it dried. For me, when just applied the smell kind of bother my allergy, little too strong.. I like better after dried. Nice refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> I only have this because I was getting the set with vanilla and cotton candy. If it floats your boat, more power to you, but I&#x27;m a HIGHLY vanilla-y kind of person, and I love cotton candy scents as well.&lt;br /&gt;But I don&#x27;t feel as if I wasted money getting the set with white musk ( I wanted to get stuff purse-sized) because if I needed air freshner, it does the job to kill odors. So, for that reason, I give it a five.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my mother and she was very pleased with the purchase. She was unable to find this particular product in the larger size bottle, so she will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend told me, \\&quot;This smells soft and delicious. I believe that this is what the angels in heaven smell like. Seriously it&#x27;s that good. I was going to buy the Donna Karen Cashmere Mist because it has a soft scent but then I found this in a rite aid store and I never went back to DK. You just can beat the smell or price. $60-$80 bucks or $6.99 and smelling like heaven?? hmm not hard to decide.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would recommend buying this product. It seems to make the ladies smile.</li>
            <li> I discovered the white musk scent when I bought body wash with this scent in Italy. After finding a product with the white musk scent in the USA through the Internet, I bought it. I&#x27;m allergic to most scents. This one doesn&#x27;t affect me allergy-wise, and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume ever -- I get more compliments about it than any other scent I wear, which is really impressive at $6 a bottle.  When people ask what it is, I always say Chanel no. 11 -- no one ever guesses my little secret.</li>
            <li> this body mist is the greatest , I have used it for years and still get tons of compliments on how great I smell!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> Delivery was excellent.  I love the subtle scent of musk and I am constantly being complimented and asked &amp;#34;What is that scent you have on&amp;#34;?.</li>
            <li> If you love White Musk, Body Fantasies is the way to go!!! The smell is amazing and it last all day long! One spray goes a long way! I get compliments all day long! LOVE IT!!!!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> This smells awesome.  I just ordered myself another bottle.  Long lasting scent.  I don&#x27;t find it overly strong so it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> this body spray is mild and very nicely scented.  too bad we can\t get it in Canada.  Get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this very often in the stores, and when I do find it, it&#x27;s the small bottle. I came to Amazon and was happy to find this. The price is great, shipping fast, and this fragrance is divine, it smells so fresh and clean. I have ordered many bottles and will continue to stock up.</li>
            <li> I wear White Musk Fantasy to work and I always receive copliments on how \\&quot;fresh and clean\\&quot;, it smells. I have the lotion also, which smells great all by itself. I am a \\&quot;perfume-aholic\\&quot;,so trust me when I say that this is one of my top 5 favorites. thank-you</li>
            <li> Smells great!! Fresh. Good value and what more could one say about anything that just brings fun to your life.</li>
            <li> Very strong that it gave me a bad cold!&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product at at all....very very strong</li>
            <li> this spray is really good is not too strong but I will advice you if you put some on just put two sprays or other wise you would start to sneeze or get allergies depending on how your body reacts but other than that it is really good.</li>
