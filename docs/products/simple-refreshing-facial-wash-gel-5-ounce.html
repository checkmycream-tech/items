    <ol>
            <li>Best face wash out there.</li>
            <li>Great product and a must try!</li>
            <li>I used this for a week and wasn&#x27;t too impressed.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li>Until now it has been the best face wash</li>
            <li>The best way to describe the smell?</li>
            <li>Very satisfied!</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re both extremely happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>works\\&quot; lol)</li>
            <li>great finding this product on line</li>
            <li>Works great with Olay Pro-X cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is great to use products that do not iritate the skin.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>but this is a still a great deal.</li>
            <li>It makes a great lather.</li>
            <li>you wear a great deal of makeup, this might make a good prewash, because it will remove whatever is on the surface of your skin.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that the price is very good.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is so good.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser doesn&#x27;t strike a good balance.  </li>
            <li>The drying aspect is surprising considering it contains propylene glycol (humectant) and Panthenol (B5 [moisturizer]).  </li>
            <li>and I figured everyone like a good \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; in the morning, so ...</li>
            <li>this is good product and it&#x27;s for good bargain price.</li>
            <li>I came across this via a free mail sample, it is the greatest!!!</li>
            <li>have ordered this product as a subscribe and save item, which is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>This wash is a good mix of cleansing without the acid burn.</li>
            <li>may not be the greatest idea if my hands aren&#x27;t clean).  </li>
            <li>I have tried soooooo many face washes, but this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I got this from a CVC sample and just love it!</li>
            <li>This product works amazingly with my skin</li>
            <li>is what softens the skin so nicely.</li>
            <li>It lathers up so nicely.  </li>
            <li>and I liked that it wasn&#x27;t scented.</li>
            <li>Stopped my breakouts and leaves my skin super clean.&lt;br /&gt;Had to restock up when I saw a great deal here.</li>
            <li>but it produce suds very easily.  </li>
            <li>Nice that we found something we both love</li>
            <li>Well, I don&#x27;t know too many people that can honestly say they&#x27;ve had slime on their face, but I can tell you for sure this does not feel like slime.</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products from Aveeno to Proactive to Neutrogena, clay masks...just about anything that I could get my hands on and this gel is simple and perfect.</li>
            <li>I use a bit more, but it removes it all.  </li>
            <li>This is a really refreshing face wash.</li>
            <li>it was just OK.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting something minty maybe, or tingly like my Tea Tree shampoo that I love.  </li>
            <li>&quot; the scent is more chemical than natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It would be ideal for a teenager with sensitive, acne-prone skin who does not wear make-up.</li>
            <li>I love washing my face, and some products produce a tingly feel, which I love even more.  </li>
            <li>I love it in the morning, and I also love it in the evenings when I am removing all make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like so many others have stated I felt the difference immediately.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>there is Vitamin E added on top of the Vitamin B5.  </li>
            <li>There are plenty more on the market that work just like it and many others that work much better.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t find it refreshing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are much better ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then, I used my make-up remover to make sure</li>
            <li>Not horrible like many described, but still... it could have been so much better.  </li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t quite call it refreshing, though.</li>
            <li>Recommended!  :-)</li>
            <li>I love this gel moisturizer as a every day moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>I love to wear makeup</li>
            <li>Do I love it?</li>
            <li>more effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike Cetaphil, you want to make sure you wash off all of it&lt;br</li>
            <li>If not, I would recommend using this during the day and something with more strength at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to rinse off, smells nice, cleans well.</li>
            <li>Nice that it leaves skin clean without drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and makes a lovely, smooth foam when you scrub with it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice face wash, it is a gel substance that really gets a good clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much dirt (in a very good way).  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and the vitamin B5</li>
            <li>It takes sunscreen, makeup, and sweat off with no effort at all and leaves my 64 year old face feeling great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a great natural feeling face wash.</li>
            <li>Great inexpensive product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably one of the best benefits I&#x27;ve seen with using this product: it leaves my face feeling fresh/new, clean, smooth, and just overall refreshed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been tricked by its marvelous surface cleansing, I bought 3 more tubes of Simple after I first used it thinking I was doing my skin a favor, and now I&#x27;m stuck with them.  </li>
            <li>I love that breezy, clean feeling after washing my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin irritates easily and this doesn&#x27;t cause after shower redness.  </li>
            <li>product lathers well, and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is scent-free, easy to use and non-drying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Fragrance-free, gentle&lt;br /&gt;- Not sticky or gooey, washes away easily</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then I strongly recommend you give this product a</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 50 years old and have used a lot of different cleansing products over the years and this is, quite honestly, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Great cleanser, does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use any special face wash--my wife is the owner of 95% of the cleaning products in our house--but the scrub did a good job with some break outs on my face</li>
            <li>It was listed as being soap free, dye free, and scent free.  </li>
            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]] brush with it.</li>
            <li>Yes, the film is shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Now I just throw on some light powder and eye</li>
            <li>This facial wash is yet again another great product.  </li>
            <li>Depending on the weather, I might use a moisturizer, but I&#x27;m happy to say that the Simple products have not been drying out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product, fortunately, does not.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>This is a face wash that leaves your skin feeling clean and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It also has a light, clean smell.</li>
            <li>I do feel like it cleans the skin smoothly and cleanly, as promised.  </li>
            <li>but I like the fact it is a clean product free of all Chemicals</li>
            <li>I too got a free sample of this from CVS and it was love at first wash.</li>
            <li>I consider it a \\&quot;time and a place\\&quot; kind of product, because it might be good for occasional use and in certain situations.  </li>
            <li>Simple Refreshing Facial Wash is perfect for my skin type.  </li>
            <li>Who knows if that&#x27;s true, but my face is shiny and smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li>worth a try!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first, as most gel-based creams and cleansers breakout my face.</li>
            <li>Sensitive-skin friendly, fragrance, dye and soap-free.</li>
            <li>In the end, it cleansed my skin just fine - but did better when I hadn&#x27;t put on much make-up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this gel, this gel goes a long way and leaves my face feeling clean and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>This is a \\&quot;simple\\&quot; and clean face wash.  </li>
            <li>also found that it doesn&#x27;t clean that well.</li>
            <li>The biggest thing was that it didn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and rinses away cleanly.</li>
            <li>It cleans without over-drying, and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Skin FEELS clean after using it</li>
            <li>My face was clean at the end, but could i have just used water?  </li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s nothing special</li>
            <li>I feel like a jerk writing this because maybe this is the most amazingly pure face cleanser of all time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, overall a good product.</li>
            <li>It foams up nicely and washes off completely.  </li>
            <li>So I used it to wash my face after a day of full makeup, eye makeup, and some sweat from the gym (I washed as soon as I got home from the gym).  </li>
            <li>It is nice for a mid-day washing and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin as much as most soaps do.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks the best it ever has, and I will definitely be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as gentle as Cetaphil but feels more powerful and removes dirt</li>
            <li>Follow this up with some Simple Vital Night Cream (which gets 10 stars in my book) and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>The non-soap cleanser foams gently, cleaning all makeup, dirt and oil from my face, and it rinses easily.</li>
            <li>This gel cleans my face and leaves a nice look and feel that is not dry or greasy, but just feels like moisturized</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this face wash when it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li>Being an acne-prone adult, I absolutely love that this is sting-free because of it&#x27;s soap-free formula.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t come as a surprise though, because it is a well-known fact that the skin generates more oil to compensate for the natural oils that have been stripped away by cleansing.  </li>
            <li>No artificial smell or perfume,</li>
            <li>just it&#x27;s own natural and very subdued smell.</li>
            <li>With the brush and a fair amount of added water, the gel turned into a nice, thin foam.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft and refreshed and felt very clean.  </li>
            <li>Also, after I used it, I didn&#x27;t have any real sense that my skin was tingly clean.  </li>
            <li>This particular product leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It makes a nice, smooth lather with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for more than two months, morning and evening, and it remains gentle on my skin, which has always been sensitive to soaps, anyway.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 25-year-old female with fair, oily, acne-prone and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The gel texture is nice and it lathers really well; however, after several months of use my pores are still clogged.  </li>
            <li>This is the only facial wash she will use, so I was happy to find them.</li>
            <li>I have found that these Simple facial products seem to be a great inexpensive alternative to my DHC.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for people with delicate and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is very soft, almost like a light lotion.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>product: it leaves my face feeling fresh/new, clean, smooth, and just overall refreshed.</li>
            <li>literally noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>I first put this stuff on my face, I didn&#x27;t like how it felt at all.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoyed the overall feel of the mask.</li>
            <li>the job but the Refreshing Facial Wash Gel tends to be a bit drying.</li>
            <li>I just love the Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Although Cetaphil is fantastic for people with sensitive skin, for some of us</li>
            <li>, i apologize if i&#x27;m under-appreciating your stellar product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser and brush together for several weeks now, and my skin is happy, somewhat clearer than it had been before, and doesn&#x27;t feel dry or stripped.</li>
            <li>use this face wash with Clean and clear oil free moisturiser and my skin feels soft and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, when washing it off my face, it seems to become an even thicker kind of goo-gel and doesn&#x27;t wash off as quickly as other face washes</li>
            <li>The clear gel washes the face without issue and without any side-effects, leaving your face clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin was soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Works well as a cleanser, non-irritating and as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>If you want a basic facial cleanser, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>After having flawless skin throughout my teenage years I developed acne on my chin and forehead at the age of 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried harsh cleansers which &#x27;promise&#x27; to cure my problem skin but have done nothing but irritate it.</li>
            <li>I need gentle cleansers for my skin and Simple offers a nice, inexpensive alternative.</li>
            <li>May not be strong enough for those with acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>and no: it doesn&#x27;t really foam a lot, which I like to a certain extent....</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely on your face and doesn&#x27;t slide off like some cleansers do, but stays on so it can soak into your skin a little before you wash it off.</li>
            <li>well but it really does the job.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise</li>
            <li>The formula seems to be really gentle</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need to put a lot of the gel on your rag.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for stocking them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate having scentless products on my face.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very picky about what I use on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping to like this product</li>
            <li>It is really gentle and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very time-consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I picked up so much dirt and make-up</li>
            <li>This is a gentle, non-irritating, non-dying face wash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- NO irritating dryness&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I love the minimal ingredient list, and the deep yet gentle clean feeling of my skin.</li>
            <li>Actually it&#x27;s the only good thing that Bare Essentials even sells in my book</li>
            <li>I see other reviewers love the product.</li>
            <li>nearby and gently wiped my eye, but because it was dry, it felt very grainy and rough, and it just didn&#x27;t feel good on my eye --</li>
            <li>I tried the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub, which I liked, so I was looking forward to trying this \\&quot;Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel\\&quot; as well.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply, even just a little dab on the tip of the finger is enough for a full wash.  </li>
            <li>For some, the fact that there is essentially no fragrance might be a positive, however I realized that I missed the presence of a fresh, eye-opening fragrance during my morning shower.  </li>
            <li>The facial wash is gentle and works up a lather that leaves my face smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is a gentle cleaner with a neutral scent.  </li>
            <li>I really love Simple Facial Wash Gel.  </li>
            <li>Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel.  </li>
            <li>This Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel seems to do the trick with my skin, even though it is not marketed specifically for acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>After I got out of the shower I put on moisturizer, it sucked in like a drop of water in the sahara, so I put on some super hydration moisturizer I usually only use when we go to Florida</li>
            <li>I really like this facial wash gel; my face feels so clean and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>Usually, I use DHC products for my facial care routine, as they are usually great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve turned to a high quality salicylic wash for those needs.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this with [[ASIN:B0073GO0SC Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub]] and [[ASIN:B0073GNZ8I Simple Soothing Facial Toner]], and the three of them work together great.</li>
            <li>I thought surely it will never clean, (scrub),</li>
            <li>Some products can clean well but leave your face feeling dry or too oily.</li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry and it did feel clean after use.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean, but not overly dry.  </li>
            <li>For Normal to Oily Skin,</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done, it leaves a slimy film I can&#x27;t seem to rinse off, the kind I usually feel when I&#x27;m washing in soft water.  </li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and vaguely pleasant, and it is gentle enough for the eye area as well.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear, St. Ives,, Neutrogena, store brands, expensive brands, too many!</li>
            <li>At first this seemed like a nice cleanser but after using it for a few weeks my face started to dry out</li>
            <li>After the first use, your face feels extra soft and pure.</li>
            <li>I would try the new Neutrogena, but came across this.  </li>
            <li>so i dont have to keep trying out new things.</li>
            <li>typically costs more than the face washes from the big mass market brands you find at local stores (if you buy them when they are on sale or on special), but I think the difference definitely justifies the slightly higher prices.</li>
            <li>But in all, it easily compares with the Olay Foaming Face wash I had been using previously -</li>
            <li>Most products irritate my skin, but I wanted to try something new--bored with the old Cetaphil, so I picked this up at the drugstore a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only bonus was that it seemed to remove make-up well and was very gentle to my ultra-sensitive eye</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I think i need some kind of scientific test to compare the amount of oil left on my skin after washing my skin using this product versus plain water.  </li>
            <li>Make sure it&#x27;s the Cetaphil for oily skin, the traditional Cetaphil has problems similar to this Simple face wash.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it is marketed as -- a basic face wash.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely use it in the summer months when the humidity is much higher.</li>
            <li>I have used other Simple products and I love them all.</li>
            <li>Many of these companies call themselves Simple, Pure, and Natural when 50% of the ingredients are harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feel clean and smooth without irritating or leading to redness.  </li>
            <li>That is why I think it is a product for everyone, at least everyone who wants a clean face!</li>
            <li>I used the toner and really liked it, and I&#x27;ve used the facial wipes, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with the wash gel.</li>
            <li>At a young age I developed mild eczema, most likely inherited from my grandmother, and that means I have dry skin all year round.</li>
            <li>This left my skin feeling clean, but not at all dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but at the same time, while feeling clean and fresh, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling overly moist/soggy or wet</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but at the same time, while feeling clean and fresh, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling overly moist/soggy or wet</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no fragrance and no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>this facial wash has really helped with that.</li>
            <li>so much I gave a bottle to my son who uses it regularly and raves about it as well.</li>
            <li>If your skin is anything like mine, don&#x27;t expect it to have any long-term benefit as far as improving oiliness, providing exfoliation, or clearing clogged pores from the inside out.  </li>
            <li>This will be a part of my daily cleaning routine in the morning and evening absolutely.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and I use it after I work out at the gym, when my face has been in a pool or sweating and therefore sensitive).  </li>
            <li>and my neck developed an itchy rash from irritation.  </li>
            <li>While I got this as a free sample I will likely start using Simple products on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>After using this face wash my skins fell soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and acne.  </li>
            <li>do like the fact that it contains natural</li>
            <li>so I am not heavy on the makeup, and this cleaner couldn&#x27;t even remove that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m surprised because, as I said, I used the toner and wipes with no issues.</li>
            <li>Nearly anything can cause me to break out into some rash or another.</li>
            <li>Feels natural</li>
            <li>There is nothing particularly wrong with this face wash, but nothing particularly good about it either.</li>
            <li>when I first tried water, it just made it thicker, and THEN it started to sting, so I grabbed a towel (dry)</li>
            <li>Simple Refreshing Facial Wash is on par with kiehls or any other high end facial wash.  </li>
            <li>I love that you only have to use a small amount, mix it with some water, and lather.</li>
            <li>and my face has been scoured by the sand, seawater, and possibly chlorine if we get into a pool, and only then did it start feeling any better, although my forehead and cheeks still feel tight.</li>
            <li>The solution is a thick, clear gel, which makes for easy portion control.  </li>
            <li>The gel really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It has a normal clean odor for washing gel and seems to get leave my face very soft and vibrant looking (not dry or [even worse] greasy).  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a LOOOOOOOOONG way with this facial wash, AND it can come out kind of fast at times - and is hard to get back in once out, even when taking the cap off to get to the larger &#x60;hole&#x27; for when it gets super low</li>
            <li>But Simple is a very close second and about a quarter of the price (it was $6 at CVS).  </li>
            <li>It is thick and spreads on easily.</li>
            <li>This goes on easily since it is a thick gel.  </li>
            <li>As I have very sensitive skin and have always used Almay and Clinique, decided to give Simple a chance.</li>
            <li>The gel is viscous enough that when you put a glob on your hand, it sits right there instead of vanishing in the wet of the shower.</li>
            <li>My first recommendation, no, but something that is not hard on the skin, affordable (in my opinion,) lasts long (it&#x27;s lasted me roughly two months</li>
            <li>I find it very drying to my combination skin after initial use, but the oil in my t-zone comes right back within a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I used the simple refreshing face gel and it actually hurt it was so dry and tight.</li>
            <li>house generally gives it a thumbs up.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make any promises to make you look younger or clear up breakouts.  </li>
            <li>so I can see exactly/more clearly where and how much I actually have on, or even what ground I have/have not covered -</li>
            <li>8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]] over Simple for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have alot of sun damage that leave areas that are sort of tender if I am not careful.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it claims to be - a simple face wash without pore cleanser, acne medication, fragrance, scrub material, or any other add ons.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing, you can really feel that the difference especially after a long day of activities when you face becomes extra oily.</li>
            <li>I have tried other face washes and really like this gel and</li>
            <li>At first I thought that this stuff could never clean my face wellenough because I was so used to thicker cleansers with exfoliants in them.</li>
            <li>Because it is a thick gel, it is easy to get too much in the hand and waste the product - or end up with a lot on the face.  </li>
            <li>I had given up hope of finding a cleanser that would work for me when my mother and I were browsing through Target and she, being the penny pincher that she is, beelined for the clearance rack and picked up this small bottle of Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel that was marked down.</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of odd, definitely no perfume (being Simple and all) but some other kind of weird slight smell.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin and was looking for something to cleanse with no residue and not just remove makeup (not a cream cleanser).</li>
            <li>Even though I am well past the age of teenage pimples, I have very oily and sensitive skin that is prone to acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Other than removal of normal dirt accumulation, this product hasn&#x27;t done my skin any favors.  </li>
            <li>Not only does my face have the tendency to dry out, but it also is really sensitive, a bit on the oily side, and redness has been a problem for me for years.</li>

            <li> Until now it has been the best face wash</li>
            <li> The best way to describe the smell?</li>
            <li> Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re both extremely happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> works\\&quot; lol)</li>
            <li> great finding this product on line</li>
            <li> Works great with Olay Pro-X cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It is great to use products that do not iritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> but this is a still a great deal.</li>
            <li> It makes a great lather.</li>
            <li> you wear a great deal of makeup, this might make a good prewash, because it will remove whatever is on the surface of your skin.  </li>
            <li> love the fact that the price is very good.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so good.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser doesn&#x27;t strike a good balance.  </li>
            <li> The drying aspect is surprising considering it contains propylene glycol (humectant) and Panthenol (B5 [moisturizer]).  </li>
            <li> and I figured everyone like a good \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; in the morning, so ...</li>
            <li> this is good product and it&#x27;s for good bargain price.</li>
            <li> I came across this via a free mail sample, it is the greatest!!!</li>
            <li> have ordered this product as a subscribe and save item, which is a good deal.  </li>
            <li> This wash is a good mix of cleansing without the acid burn.</li>
            <li> may not be the greatest idea if my hands aren&#x27;t clean).  </li>
            <li> I have tried soooooo many face washes, but this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I got this from a CVC sample and just love it!</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly with my skin</li>
            <li> is what softens the skin so nicely.</li>
            <li> It lathers up so nicely.  </li>
            <li> and I liked that it wasn&#x27;t scented.</li>
            <li> Stopped my breakouts and leaves my skin super clean.&lt;br /&gt;Had to restock up when I saw a great deal here.</li>
            <li> but it produce suds very easily.  </li>
            <li> Nice that we found something we both love</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know too many people that can honestly say they&#x27;ve had slime on their face, but I can tell you for sure this does not feel like slime.</li>
            <li> My skin is very fair and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products from Aveeno to Proactive to Neutrogena, clay masks...just about anything that I could get my hands on and this gel is simple and perfect.</li>
            <li> I use a bit more, but it removes it all.  </li>
            <li> This is a really refreshing face wash.</li>
            <li> it was just OK.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting something minty maybe, or tingly like my Tea Tree shampoo that I love.  </li>
            <li> &quot; the scent is more chemical than natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It would be ideal for a teenager with sensitive, acne-prone skin who does not wear make-up.</li>
            <li> I love washing my face, and some products produce a tingly feel, which I love even more.  </li>
            <li> I love it in the morning, and I also love it in the evenings when I am removing all make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like so many others have stated I felt the difference immediately.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> there is Vitamin E added on top of the Vitamin B5.  </li>
            <li> There are plenty more on the market that work just like it and many others that work much better.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find it refreshing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are much better ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then, I used my make-up remover to make sure</li>
            <li> Not horrible like many described, but still... it could have been so much better.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t quite call it refreshing, though.</li>
            <li> Recommended!  :-)</li>
            <li> I love this gel moisturizer as a every day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> I love to wear makeup</li>
            <li> Do I love it?</li>
            <li> more effectively.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike Cetaphil, you want to make sure you wash off all of it&lt;br</li>
            <li> If not, I would recommend using this during the day and something with more strength at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to rinse off, smells nice, cleans well.</li>
            <li> Nice that it leaves skin clean without drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and makes a lovely, smooth foam when you scrub with it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice face wash, it is a gel substance that really gets a good clean.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much dirt (in a very good way).  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and the vitamin B5</li>
            <li> It takes sunscreen, makeup, and sweat off with no effort at all and leaves my 64 year old face feeling great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a great natural feeling face wash.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably one of the best benefits I&#x27;ve seen with using this product: it leaves my face feeling fresh/new, clean, smooth, and just overall refreshed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been tricked by its marvelous surface cleansing, I bought 3 more tubes of Simple after I first used it thinking I was doing my skin a favor, and now I&#x27;m stuck with them.  </li>
            <li> I love that breezy, clean feeling after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin irritates easily and this doesn&#x27;t cause after shower redness.  </li>
            <li> product lathers well, and rinses easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is scent-free, easy to use and non-drying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Fragrance-free, gentle&lt;br /&gt;- Not sticky or gooey, washes away easily</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then I strongly recommend you give this product a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 50 years old and have used a lot of different cleansing products over the years and this is, quite honestly, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Great cleanser, does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use any special face wash--my wife is the owner of 95% of the cleaning products in our house--but the scrub did a good job with some break outs on my face</li>
            <li> It was listed as being soap free, dye free, and scent free.  </li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]] brush with it.</li>
            <li> Yes, the film is shiny and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Now I just throw on some light powder and eye</li>
            <li> This facial wash is yet again another great product.  </li>
            <li> Depending on the weather, I might use a moisturizer, but I&#x27;m happy to say that the Simple products have not been drying out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product, fortunately, does not.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> This is a face wash that leaves your skin feeling clean and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It also has a light, clean smell.</li>
            <li> I do feel like it cleans the skin smoothly and cleanly, as promised.  </li>
            <li> but I like the fact it is a clean product free of all Chemicals</li>
            <li> I too got a free sample of this from CVS and it was love at first wash.</li>
            <li> I consider it a \\&quot;time and a place\\&quot; kind of product, because it might be good for occasional use and in certain situations.  </li>
            <li> Simple Refreshing Facial Wash is perfect for my skin type.  </li>
            <li> Who knows if that&#x27;s true, but my face is shiny and smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li> worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first, as most gel-based creams and cleansers breakout my face.</li>
            <li> Sensitive-skin friendly, fragrance, dye and soap-free.</li>
            <li> In the end, it cleansed my skin just fine - but did better when I hadn&#x27;t put on much make-up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this gel, this gel goes a long way and leaves my face feeling clean and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> This is a \\&quot;simple\\&quot; and clean face wash.  </li>
            <li> also found that it doesn&#x27;t clean that well.</li>
            <li> The biggest thing was that it didn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and rinses away cleanly.</li>
            <li> It cleans without over-drying, and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Skin FEELS clean after using it</li>
            <li> My face was clean at the end, but could i have just used water?  </li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s nothing special</li>
            <li> I feel like a jerk writing this because maybe this is the most amazingly pure face cleanser of all time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, overall a good product.</li>
            <li> It foams up nicely and washes off completely.  </li>
            <li> So I used it to wash my face after a day of full makeup, eye makeup, and some sweat from the gym (I washed as soon as I got home from the gym).  </li>
            <li> It is nice for a mid-day washing and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin as much as most soaps do.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks the best it ever has, and I will definitely be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as gentle as Cetaphil but feels more powerful and removes dirt</li>
            <li> Follow this up with some Simple Vital Night Cream (which gets 10 stars in my book) and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> The non-soap cleanser foams gently, cleaning all makeup, dirt and oil from my face, and it rinses easily.</li>
            <li> This gel cleans my face and leaves a nice look and feel that is not dry or greasy, but just feels like moisturized</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this face wash when it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> Being an acne-prone adult, I absolutely love that this is sting-free because of it&#x27;s soap-free formula.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t come as a surprise though, because it is a well-known fact that the skin generates more oil to compensate for the natural oils that have been stripped away by cleansing.  </li>
            <li> No artificial smell or perfume,</li>
            <li> just it&#x27;s own natural and very subdued smell.</li>
            <li> With the brush and a fair amount of added water, the gel turned into a nice, thin foam.</li>
            <li> My skin was soft and refreshed and felt very clean.  </li>
            <li> Also, after I used it, I didn&#x27;t have any real sense that my skin was tingly clean.  </li>
            <li> This particular product leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> It makes a nice, smooth lather with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for more than two months, morning and evening, and it remains gentle on my skin, which has always been sensitive to soaps, anyway.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25-year-old female with fair, oily, acne-prone and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The gel texture is nice and it lathers really well; however, after several months of use my pores are still clogged.  </li>
            <li> This is the only facial wash she will use, so I was happy to find them.</li>
            <li> I have found that these Simple facial products seem to be a great inexpensive alternative to my DHC.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for people with delicate and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is very soft, almost like a light lotion.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> product: it leaves my face feeling fresh/new, clean, smooth, and just overall refreshed.</li>
            <li> literally noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> I first put this stuff on my face, I didn&#x27;t like how it felt at all.</li>
            <li> but I really enjoyed the overall feel of the mask.</li>
            <li> the job but the Refreshing Facial Wash Gel tends to be a bit drying.</li>
            <li> I just love the Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Although Cetaphil is fantastic for people with sensitive skin, for some of us</li>
            <li> , i apologize if i&#x27;m under-appreciating your stellar product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser and brush together for several weeks now, and my skin is happy, somewhat clearer than it had been before, and doesn&#x27;t feel dry or stripped.</li>
            <li> use this face wash with Clean and clear oil free moisturiser and my skin feels soft and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when washing it off my face, it seems to become an even thicker kind of goo-gel and doesn&#x27;t wash off as quickly as other face washes</li>
            <li> The clear gel washes the face without issue and without any side-effects, leaving your face clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Works well as a cleanser, non-irritating and as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> If you want a basic facial cleanser, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> After having flawless skin throughout my teenage years I developed acne on my chin and forehead at the age of 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried harsh cleansers which &#x27;promise&#x27; to cure my problem skin but have done nothing but irritate it.</li>
            <li> I need gentle cleansers for my skin and Simple offers a nice, inexpensive alternative.</li>
            <li> May not be strong enough for those with acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> and no: it doesn&#x27;t really foam a lot, which I like to a certain extent....</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely on your face and doesn&#x27;t slide off like some cleansers do, but stays on so it can soak into your skin a little before you wash it off.</li>
            <li> well but it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise</li>
            <li> The formula seems to be really gentle</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need to put a lot of the gel on your rag.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for stocking them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate having scentless products on my face.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very picky about what I use on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping to like this product</li>
            <li> It is really gentle and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very time-consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I picked up so much dirt and make-up</li>
            <li> This is a gentle, non-irritating, non-dying face wash.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- NO irritating dryness&lt;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love the minimal ingredient list, and the deep yet gentle clean feeling of my skin.</li>
            <li> Actually it&#x27;s the only good thing that Bare Essentials even sells in my book</li>
            <li> I see other reviewers love the product.</li>
            <li> nearby and gently wiped my eye, but because it was dry, it felt very grainy and rough, and it just didn&#x27;t feel good on my eye --</li>
            <li> I tried the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub, which I liked, so I was looking forward to trying this \\&quot;Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel\\&quot; as well.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply, even just a little dab on the tip of the finger is enough for a full wash.  </li>
            <li> For some, the fact that there is essentially no fragrance might be a positive, however I realized that I missed the presence of a fresh, eye-opening fragrance during my morning shower.  </li>
            <li> The facial wash is gentle and works up a lather that leaves my face smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is a gentle cleaner with a neutral scent.  </li>
            <li> I really love Simple Facial Wash Gel.  </li>
            <li> Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel.  </li>
            <li> This Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel seems to do the trick with my skin, even though it is not marketed specifically for acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> After I got out of the shower I put on moisturizer, it sucked in like a drop of water in the sahara, so I put on some super hydration moisturizer I usually only use when we go to Florida</li>
            <li> I really like this facial wash gel; my face feels so clean and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> Usually, I use DHC products for my facial care routine, as they are usually great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve turned to a high quality salicylic wash for those needs.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with [[ASIN:B0073GO0SC Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub]] and [[ASIN:B0073GNZ8I Simple Soothing Facial Toner]], and the three of them work together great.</li>
            <li> I thought surely it will never clean, (scrub),</li>
            <li> Some products can clean well but leave your face feeling dry or too oily.</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry and it did feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean, but not overly dry.  </li>
            <li> For Normal to Oily Skin,</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done, it leaves a slimy film I can&#x27;t seem to rinse off, the kind I usually feel when I&#x27;m washing in soft water.  </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and vaguely pleasant, and it is gentle enough for the eye area as well.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear, St. Ives,, Neutrogena, store brands, expensive brands, too many!</li>
            <li> At first this seemed like a nice cleanser but after using it for a few weeks my face started to dry out</li>
            <li> After the first use, your face feels extra soft and pure.</li>
            <li> I would try the new Neutrogena, but came across this.  </li>
            <li> so i dont have to keep trying out new things.</li>
            <li> typically costs more than the face washes from the big mass market brands you find at local stores (if you buy them when they are on sale or on special), but I think the difference definitely justifies the slightly higher prices.</li>
            <li> But in all, it easily compares with the Olay Foaming Face wash I had been using previously -</li>
            <li> Most products irritate my skin, but I wanted to try something new--bored with the old Cetaphil, so I picked this up at the drugstore a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only bonus was that it seemed to remove make-up well and was very gentle to my ultra-sensitive eye</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I think i need some kind of scientific test to compare the amount of oil left on my skin after washing my skin using this product versus plain water.  </li>
            <li> Make sure it&#x27;s the Cetaphil for oily skin, the traditional Cetaphil has problems similar to this Simple face wash.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it is marketed as -- a basic face wash.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely use it in the summer months when the humidity is much higher.</li>
            <li> I have used other Simple products and I love them all.</li>
            <li> Many of these companies call themselves Simple, Pure, and Natural when 50% of the ingredients are harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feel clean and smooth without irritating or leading to redness.  </li>
            <li> That is why I think it is a product for everyone, at least everyone who wants a clean face!</li>
            <li> I used the toner and really liked it, and I&#x27;ve used the facial wipes, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with the wash gel.</li>
            <li> At a young age I developed mild eczema, most likely inherited from my grandmother, and that means I have dry skin all year round.</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling clean, but not at all dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but at the same time, while feeling clean and fresh, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling overly moist/soggy or wet</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but at the same time, while feeling clean and fresh, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling overly moist/soggy or wet</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no fragrance and no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> this facial wash has really helped with that.</li>
            <li> so much I gave a bottle to my son who uses it regularly and raves about it as well.</li>
            <li> If your skin is anything like mine, don&#x27;t expect it to have any long-term benefit as far as improving oiliness, providing exfoliation, or clearing clogged pores from the inside out.  </li>
            <li> This will be a part of my daily cleaning routine in the morning and evening absolutely.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and I use it after I work out at the gym, when my face has been in a pool or sweating and therefore sensitive).  </li>
            <li> and my neck developed an itchy rash from irritation.  </li>
            <li> While I got this as a free sample I will likely start using Simple products on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> After using this face wash my skins fell soft and nourished.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and acne.  </li>
            <li> do like the fact that it contains natural</li>
            <li> so I am not heavy on the makeup, and this cleaner couldn&#x27;t even remove that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised because, as I said, I used the toner and wipes with no issues.</li>
            <li> Nearly anything can cause me to break out into some rash or another.</li>
            <li> Feels natural</li>
            <li> There is nothing particularly wrong with this face wash, but nothing particularly good about it either.</li>
            <li> when I first tried water, it just made it thicker, and THEN it started to sting, so I grabbed a towel (dry)</li>
            <li> Simple Refreshing Facial Wash is on par with kiehls or any other high end facial wash.  </li>
            <li> I love that you only have to use a small amount, mix it with some water, and lather.</li>
            <li> and my face has been scoured by the sand, seawater, and possibly chlorine if we get into a pool, and only then did it start feeling any better, although my forehead and cheeks still feel tight.</li>
            <li> The solution is a thick, clear gel, which makes for easy portion control.  </li>
            <li> The gel really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It has a normal clean odor for washing gel and seems to get leave my face very soft and vibrant looking (not dry or [even worse] greasy).  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a LOOOOOOOOONG way with this facial wash, AND it can come out kind of fast at times - and is hard to get back in once out, even when taking the cap off to get to the larger &#x60;hole&#x27; for when it gets super low</li>
            <li> But Simple is a very close second and about a quarter of the price (it was $6 at CVS).  </li>
            <li> It is thick and spreads on easily.</li>
            <li> This goes on easily since it is a thick gel.  </li>
            <li> As I have very sensitive skin and have always used Almay and Clinique, decided to give Simple a chance.</li>
            <li> The gel is viscous enough that when you put a glob on your hand, it sits right there instead of vanishing in the wet of the shower.</li>
            <li> My first recommendation, no, but something that is not hard on the skin, affordable (in my opinion,) lasts long (it&#x27;s lasted me roughly two months</li>
            <li> I find it very drying to my combination skin after initial use, but the oil in my t-zone comes right back within a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I used the simple refreshing face gel and it actually hurt it was so dry and tight.</li>
            <li> house generally gives it a thumbs up.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make any promises to make you look younger or clear up breakouts.  </li>
            <li> so I can see exactly/more clearly where and how much I actually have on, or even what ground I have/have not covered -</li>
            <li> 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]] over Simple for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have alot of sun damage that leave areas that are sort of tender if I am not careful.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it claims to be - a simple face wash without pore cleanser, acne medication, fragrance, scrub material, or any other add ons.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing, you can really feel that the difference especially after a long day of activities when you face becomes extra oily.</li>
            <li> I have tried other face washes and really like this gel and</li>
            <li> At first I thought that this stuff could never clean my face wellenough because I was so used to thicker cleansers with exfoliants in them.</li>
            <li> Because it is a thick gel, it is easy to get too much in the hand and waste the product - or end up with a lot on the face.  </li>
            <li> I had given up hope of finding a cleanser that would work for me when my mother and I were browsing through Target and she, being the penny pincher that she is, beelined for the clearance rack and picked up this small bottle of Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel that was marked down.</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of odd, definitely no perfume (being Simple and all) but some other kind of weird slight smell.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and was looking for something to cleanse with no residue and not just remove makeup (not a cream cleanser).</li>
            <li> Even though I am well past the age of teenage pimples, I have very oily and sensitive skin that is prone to acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Other than removal of normal dirt accumulation, this product hasn&#x27;t done my skin any favors.  </li>
            <li> Not only does my face have the tendency to dry out, but it also is really sensitive, a bit on the oily side, and redness has been a problem for me for years.</li>
            <li> It has no dyes, artificial perfumes or harsh irritants and is good for even sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to constantly wipe the bottle top (or bottom) -- approximately every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I rate this 4 starts instead of 5 because it does take a washcloth or other textured items to get it completely off my skin.  </li>
            <li> You can use a very little amount of this and get the whole face.  </li>
            <li> For a product that doesn&#x27;t contain soap, this product cleans suspiciously well (at least on the surface of my skin -- I haven&#x27;t tried it on the stove yet  ;-).  </li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many facial cleansers I&#x27;ve gone through with disappointment.</li>
            <li> and I get dry patches in areas outside of the T-zone.</li>
            <li> My cheeks are still dry and look red after two days.</li>
            <li> I have spent the last six years on a quest for a facial cleanser that I could call my #1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a facial wash that left my face feeling wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a facial wash that left my face feeling wet.</li>
            <li> It maybe a little less drying than a bar of soap, but ultimately I don&#x27;t think it makes much difference.  </li>
            <li> But to me, having sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t bother/irritate and make my skin condition - mainly my complexion - worse.</li>
            <li> A month later my face is softer than it&#x27;s ever been, doesn&#x27;t get dried out like it used to, and my facial skin tone has actually evened out a bit.</li>
            <li> I can deal with the feel as long as it works.  </li>
            <li> If you have acne this will not clear them up.</li>
            <li> And like many others have complained about, the smell is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> My only (tiny) issue is that the opening in the tube is quite wide, and the cleanser is pretty concentrated, so it&#x27;s hard to dispense a small enough amount.</li>
            <li> I simply rolled my eyes, not able to even think of a facial cleanser that would be different from all the others I&#x27;d tried.</li>
            <li> broke out after using this product, which I suspect may have been due to my skin not being properly cleaned.</li>
            <li> and this did not feel like it washed the oil off my face, even on the dry spots.</li>
            <li> I went out a few days later and got the moisturizer, facial scrub, and eye makeup remover as well.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing, I found my skin noticeably softer, compared to my usual face wash which is Cetaphil for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> few years ago I bought Bare Essentials face wash.  </li>
            <li> And this is supposed to be Simple&#x27;s less moisturizing face</li>
            <li> Personally I draw the line at half the price.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but I was pretty grossed out after washing my face twice with the gel and then still having to use several cotton balls on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my skin felt very dry after using it one time.</li>
            <li> And I think the \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; tag line is something they threw on there because \\&quot;Simple Boring Facial Wash Gel\\&quot; wouldn&#x27;t sell so many bottles!</li>
            <li> I have used all different kinds of face washer from the average supercenter to the mega pricey!</li>
            <li> I have very pale very sensitive skin and usually buy facial products that don&#x27;t have dyes or fragrance.  </li>
            <li> For me, this product was neither great nor terrible...</li>
            <li> I had been using Olay cleansing cloths (not cheap by comparison) but Simple is my cleanser of choice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to know the pH of this</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals found in regular soap</li>
            <li> ; for, the gel is very.....thick, though it comes out FAST and looks really thin.</li>
            <li> Depending on your face wash, harsh chemicals can create a bigger problem than they fix.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m also middle aged, so it&#x27;s hard to find a face wash that deals with the oil and yet doesn&#x27;t dry out the dry spots.  </li>
            <li> The gel is thick so just use a small amount; it lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> But I live in an area with very hard water.  </li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t dry and tight when I&#x27;m done, and there&#x27;s no irritation from unneeded chemicals</li>
            <li> It keeps my pores cleaner in between my weekly pore strip sessions than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to be too drying like other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything about it that draws me to it over other products, yet nothing all that off-putting either.  </li>
            <li> I rather like the other with the exfoliating beads in it instead.  </li>
            <li> There is no scent and it seems to work well for other people, but for me I might as well have used a bar of ivory soap.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a face wash in the past, because most of the products geared toward acne have salicylic acid, which I am unfortunately allergic to.  </li>
            <li> products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it annoying that the cap and the part that dispenses the gel, gets clogged and dried very easily.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s what a non-soap cleanser feels like, at least to the Simple folks.  </li>
            <li> A very small amount is needed for basic cleansing.  </li>
            <li> This was just an average face wash gel, with no special properties or cleaning property that I could detect.  </li>
            <li> Would you still get it if you can find face washes from Nivea or Gillette or the like or usable store brands for half the price?</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it arrived as a gooey mess.  </li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s bound to happen with a product that faces down, but I have used other products like this and have not had the problem be this excessive.</li>
            <li> It cleans make-up, mascera and dirt off without making your skin feel tight and stripped of moisture.</li>
            <li> I use my little face spin brush with this product and fallow by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Anyways, the feel and the smell are not significant if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, which it does.  </li>
            <li> I like a LITTLE foam</li>
            <li> No greasy or dried out feeling.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I realized I didn&#x27;t need liquid makeup anymore</li>
            <li> I noticed some people on other review sites have complained about the gel consistency of the cleanser, saying it feels like slime on their face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unperfumed, having only a slight, vague odor that i associate with the bubble soap i used as a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> also find it hard to get all the product off my face, even when I try using less than recommended.</li>
            <li> It has a slight sent, but not really a nice one.  </li>
            <li> Even on eye makeup, which is usually the make it or break it for any face cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what others think about this film, but I like it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure what is supposed to be \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; about this.  </li>
            <li> Usually, I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t necessarily anything wrong with this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> not sure I see a lot of changes in my skin</li>
            <li> It does not foam which can be hard to get used to</li>
            <li> I probably lost at least a tablespoon of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously hooked on this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes me think my face is being protected by a thin coat of something.</li>
            <li> Although it does not cure my acne, it does not make it any worse.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle.  </li>
            <li> No fragrances or other annoying additives.</li>
            <li> I use a mineral powder base and a little blush</li>
            <li> With some of them my skin would get red after use and when I stopped using them I&#x27;d break out horribly.</li>
            <li> My oily t-zone stayed uncomfortably greasy after using this product.</li>

            <li> I just cannot recommend this slime for your face. :(</li>
            <li> but without the annoying scents.</li>

            <li> Best face wash out there.</li>
            <li> I got this from a CVC sample and just love it! After the first use, your face feels extra soft and pure. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products from Aveeno to Proactive to Neutrogena, clay masks...just about anything that I could get my hands on and this gel is simple and perfect. I use my little face spin brush with this product and fallow by a moisturizer. Great product and a must try!</li>
            <li> Finally, a facial cleanser that works for me! I have spent the last six years on a quest for a facial cleanser that I could call my #1 and I&#x27;ve finally found it. At a young age I developed mild eczema, most likely inherited from my grandmother, and that means I have dry skin all year round. Not only does my face have the tendency to dry out, but it also is really sensitive, a bit on the oily side, and redness has been a problem for me for years. I cannot tell you how many facial cleansers I&#x27;ve gone through with disappointment. Clean &amp; Clear, St. Ives,, Neutrogena, store brands, expensive brands, too many! With some of them my skin would get red after use and when I stopped using them I&#x27;d break out horribly. With others I my skin would literally burn after use. I had given up hope of finding a cleanser that would work for me when my mother and I were browsing through Target and she, being the penny pincher that she is, beelined for the clearance rack and picked up this small bottle of Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel that was marked down. I simply rolled my eyes, not able to even think of a facial cleanser that would be different from all the others I&#x27;d tried. She tried it that night and insisted that I try it once. One month and another bottle later and we&#x27;re both extremely happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;I literally noticed a difference after the first use. My face felt noticeably softer. A month later my face is softer than it&#x27;s ever been, doesn&#x27;t get dried out like it used to, and my facial skin tone has actually evened out a bit. I noticed some people on other review sites have complained about the gel consistency of the cleanser, saying it feels like slime on their face. Well, I don&#x27;t know too many people that can honestly say they&#x27;ve had slime on their face, but I can tell you for sure this does not feel like slime. Slime is thicker, sticky, a lot like mucous. This is very soft, almost like a light lotion. At first I thought that this stuff could never clean my face wellenough because I was so used to thicker cleansers with exfoliants in them. But this stuff did the trick! It keeps my pores cleaner in between my weekly pore strip sessions than any other cleanser I&#x27;ve used. It lathers up nicely on your face and doesn&#x27;t slide off like some cleansers do, but stays on so it can soak into your skin a little before you wash it off. There&#x27;s no fragrance and no harsh chemicals so it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and the vitamin B5 is what softens the skin so nicely. I&#x27;m seriously hooked on this stuff. Some people can&#x27;t leave the house in the morning without putting on their makeup or straightening their hair and I can&#x27;t leave my house without washing my face with this stuff now. If I could give this product six stars I would! This is definitely going to be a staple in my bathroom for years to come. Thank you, Simple! (:</li>
            <li> I happened to be in a store where a rep was showing this line. As I have very sensitive skin and have always used Almay and Clinique, decided to give Simple a chance. Works well as a cleanser, non-irritating and as good as the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I love the minimal ingredient list, and the deep yet gentle clean feeling of my skin.</li>
            <li> I too got a free sample of this from CVS and it was love at first wash. Even while applying it I noticed that my skin was already softer. It&#x27;s very light and makes a lovely, smooth foam when you scrub with it. After rinsing, I found my skin noticeably softer, compared to my usual face wash which is Cetaphil for sensitive skin. Being an acne-prone adult, I absolutely love that this is sting-free because of it&#x27;s soap-free formula. My pores feel so refreshed now!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and this did not feel like it washed the oil off my face, even on the dry spots. My oily t-zone stayed uncomfortably greasy after using this product. And this is supposed to be Simple&#x27;s less moisturizing face wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke out after using this product, which I suspect may have been due to my skin not being properly cleaned. The only bonus was that it seemed to remove make-up well and was very gentle to my ultra-sensitive eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend [[ASIN:B001ET73JM Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser For Normal to Oily Skin, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]] over Simple for sensitive skin. Make sure it&#x27;s the Cetaphil for oily skin, the traditional Cetaphil has problems similar to this Simple face wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reviewing different products in the \\&quot;Simple\\&quot; line, and this cleanser is one of my favorites. I&#x27;d tried their scrubbing cleanser, and found that to be awful--such a bad smell!-- but this stuff is great. Easy to use, easy to rinse off, smells nice, cleans well. My only (tiny) issue is that the opening in the tube is quite wide, and the cleanser is pretty concentrated, so it&#x27;s hard to dispense a small enough amount. Not that it does any harm, but it seems a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, overall a good product. If you want a basic facial cleanser, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 50 years old and have used a lot of different cleansing products over the years and this is, quite honestly, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The product has no color or odor... it is, as its name implies, Simple.  The solution is a thick, clear gel, which makes for easy portion control.  A very small amount is needed for basic cleansing.  It foams up nicely and washes off completely.  On days when I use foundation, powder, and rouge (\\&quot;the works\\&quot; lol) I use a bit more, but it removes it all.  No greasy or dried out feeling.  I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but this stuff is miraculous and I am a convert.  I had been using Olay cleansing cloths (not cheap by comparison) but Simple is my cleanser of choice.  I&#x27;ve been using it for more than two months, morning and evening, and it remains gentle on my skin, which has always been sensitive to soaps, anyway.  Try it for yourself, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and I&#x27;m also middle aged, so it&#x27;s hard to find a face wash that deals with the oil and yet doesn&#x27;t dry out the dry spots.  Simple Refreshing Facial Wash is perfect for my skin type.  The non-soap cleanser foams gently, cleaning all makeup, dirt and oil from my face, and it rinses easily. My face isn&#x27;t dry and tight when I&#x27;m done, and there&#x27;s no irritation from unneeded chemicals either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy more of this face wash when it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, does not dry my skin.  This cleanser is so good.  After I use it, there is no makeup residue on my face.</li>
            <li> great finding this product on line the local stores were all out.</li>
            <li> Like washing your face with a slimy substance.  I guess that&#x27;s what a non-soap cleanser feels like, at least to the Simple folks.  I can deal with the feel as long as it works.  So I used it to wash my face after a day of full makeup, eye makeup, and some sweat from the gym (I washed as soon as I got home from the gym).  The results - it works.  Even on eye makeup, which is usually the make it or break it for any face cleanser.  The smell is kind of odd, definitely no perfume (being Simple and all) but some other kind of weird slight smell.  Anyways, the feel and the smell are not significant if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, which it does.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be too drying like other reviewers.  Follow this up with some Simple Vital Night Cream (which gets 10 stars in my book) and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25-year-old female with fair, oily, acne-prone and sensitive skin. Most products irritate my skin, but I wanted to try something new--bored with the old Cetaphil, so I picked this up at the drugstore a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put this stuff on my face, I didn&#x27;t like how it felt at all. It feels quite a bit like aloe vera, which I thought felt slimy. But then I started using my [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System]] brush with it. Oh my! With the brush and a fair amount of added water, the gel turned into a nice, thin foam. It zapped off all my makeup and excess oil, and when a bit of the product splashed into my eye area it didn&#x27;t cause any stinging. I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser and brush together for several weeks now, and my skin is happy, somewhat clearer than it had been before, and doesn&#x27;t feel dry or stripped.</li>
            <li> I have tried soooooo many face washes, but this is a great product., one of the bet I&#x27;ve used. Stopped my breakouts and leaves my skin super clean.&lt;br /&gt;Had to restock up when I saw a great deal here.</li>
            <li> This is a face wash that leaves your skin feeling clean and comfortable. Some products can clean well but leave your face feeling dry or too oily. It is gel like and sort of slips over your skin. I thought surely it will never clean, (scrub), well but it really does the job. It takes sunscreen, makeup, and sweat off with no effort at all and leaves my 64 year old face feeling great. I have alot of sun damage that leave areas that are sort of tender if I am not careful. Much to my surprise this facial wash has really helped with that. I like it so much I gave a bottle to my son who uses it regularly and raves about it as well. That is why I think it is a product for everyone, at least everyone who wants a clean face!</li>
            <li> For a product that doesn&#x27;t contain soap, this product cleans suspiciously well (at least on the surface of my skin -- I haven&#x27;t tried it on the stove yet  ;-).  The gel texture is nice and it lathers really well; however, after several months of use my pores are still clogged.  I find it very drying to my combination skin after initial use, but the oil in my t-zone comes right back within a few hours.  This doesn&#x27;t come as a surprise though, because it is a well-known fact that the skin generates more oil to compensate for the natural oils that have been stripped away by cleansing.  This cleanser doesn&#x27;t strike a good balance.  Cetaphil runs circles around Simple in the balance department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been tricked by its marvelous surface cleansing, I bought 3 more tubes of Simple after I first used it thinking I was doing my skin a favor, and now I&#x27;m stuck with them.  Other than removal of normal dirt accumulation, this product hasn&#x27;t done my skin any favors.  The drying aspect is surprising considering it contains propylene glycol (humectant) and Panthenol (B5 [moisturizer]).  I guess the moisturizers can&#x27;t do their jobs after they&#x27;re rinsed away.  I&#x27;m curious to know the pH of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear a great deal of makeup, this might make a good prewash, because it will remove whatever is on the surface of your skin.  I consider it a \\&quot;time and a place\\&quot; kind of product, because it might be good for occasional use and in certain situations.  If your skin is anything like mine, don&#x27;t expect it to have any long-term benefit as far as improving oiliness, providing exfoliation, or clearing clogged pores from the inside out.  I&#x27;ve turned to a high quality salicylic wash for those needs.  This product just is what it is -- simple.</li>
            <li> I really love Simple Facial Wash Gel.  Just a little goes a long way.  It lathers up so nicely.  When I&#x27;m done, it leaves a slimy film I can&#x27;t seem to rinse off, the kind I usually feel when I&#x27;m washing in soft water.  But I live in an area with very hard water.  I&#x27;m not sure what others think about this film, but I like it.  It makes me think my face is being protected by a thin coat of something. Who knows if that&#x27;s true, but my face is shiny and smooth afterward.  Yes, the film is shiny and smooth.  I like how it feels.  I like how it looks.  I think I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> This is a really refreshing face wash. It is thick and spreads on easily. It does not foam which can be hard to get used to but I really enjoyed the overall feel of the mask. This left my skin feeling clean, but not at all dry. The formula seems to be really gentle and I liked that it wasn&#x27;t scented. This will be a part of my daily cleaning routine in the morning and evening absolutely. I expect it will last about a month.</li>
            <li> For me, this product was neither great nor terrible... it was just OK.  There isn&#x27;t anything about it that draws me to it over other products, yet nothing all that off-putting either.  In the end, it cleansed my skin just fine - but did better when I hadn&#x27;t put on much make-up.  For some, the fact that there is essentially no fragrance might be a positive, however I realized that I missed the presence of a fresh, eye-opening fragrance during my morning shower.  Also, after I used it, I didn&#x27;t have any real sense that my skin was tingly clean.  Not that it wasn&#x27;t, but it all just felt... blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this was on sale when I was out of facial cleanser, I might consider it again, but this is not necessarily something I&#x27;d proactively seek out.</li>
            <li> This is a nice face wash, it is a gel substance that really gets a good clean.  You can use a very little amount of this and get the whole face.  The gel really goes a long way.  It has a normal clean odor for washing gel and seems to get leave my face very soft and vibrant looking (not dry or [even worse] greasy).  This gel cleans my face and leaves a nice look and feel that is not dry or greasy, but just feels like moisturized skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this gel, this gel goes a long way and leaves my face feeling clean and vibrant.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a \\&quot;simple\\&quot; and clean face wash.  It doesn&#x27;t make any promises to make you look younger or clear up breakouts.  It is exactly what it is marketed as -- a basic face wash.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (and I use it after I work out at the gym, when my face has been in a pool or sweating and therefore sensitive).  It also has a light, clean smell. My skin didn&#x27;t feel dry and it did feel clean after use.</li>
            <li> I tried the Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub, which I liked, so I was looking forward to trying this \\&quot;Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel\\&quot; as well. I don&#x27;t normally use any special face wash--my wife is the owner of 95% of the cleaning products in our house--but the scrub did a good job with some break outs on my face and I figured everyone like a good \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; in the morning, so ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really sure what is supposed to be \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; about this.  I was expecting something minty maybe, or tingly like my Tea Tree shampoo that I love.  But there was nothing.  This was just an average face wash gel, with no special properties or cleaning property that I could detect.  It lathers up well, does what it is supposed to do, but that is about it. It maybe a little less drying than a bar of soap, but ultimately I don&#x27;t think it makes much difference.  It has a slight sent, but not really a nice one.  Like the \\&quot;Facial Scrub,\\&quot; the scent is more chemical than natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my wife about it, and she felt the same way. There is nothing particularly wrong with this face wash, but nothing particularly good about it either. And I think the \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; tag line is something they threw on there because \\&quot;Simple Boring Facial Wash Gel\\&quot; wouldn&#x27;t sell so many bottles!</li>
            <li> I used this for a week and wasn&#x27;t too impressed.  I rather like the other with the exfoliating beads in it instead.  This is just me though.</li>
            <li> Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel is a gentle cleaner with a neutral scent.  It is nice for a mid-day washing and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin as much as most soaps do.  It would be ideal for a teenager with sensitive, acne-prone skin who does not wear make-up.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what it claims to be - a simple face wash without pore cleanser, acne medication, fragrance, scrub material, or any other add ons.  If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, then I strongly recommend you give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our house generally gives it a thumbs up.  It lathers well, cleans well, and compares well to products like Cetaphil skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> After having flawless skin throughout my teenage years I developed acne on my chin and forehead at the age of 24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried harsh cleansers which &#x27;promise&#x27; to cure my problem skin but have done nothing but irritate it. I decided to try this Simple face wash to give my skin a break and within a week my forehead pimples had gone and my chin is clearing up (hurray)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this face wash with Clean and clear oil free moisturiser and my skin feels soft and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its worth a try!</li>
            <li> Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel.  I love washing my face, and some products produce a tingly feel, which I love even more.  This particular product leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.  You don&#x27;t really need to put a lot of the gel on your rag.  If you feel it wasn&#x27;t enough, you can always wash again.  I love that breezy, clean feeling after washing my face.  I love it in the morning, and I also love it in the evenings when I am removing all make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  Over and over again.  Each time you wash your face.</li>
            <li> I picked these up for my daughter, the gel wash is getting more difficult to find in my area. This is the only facial wash she will use, so I was happy to find them. Thanks for stocking them.</li>
            <li> Comparative cosmetic for people with skin issues as is mine case....this is good product and it&#x27;s for good bargain price.</li>
            <li> I came across this via a free mail sample, it is the greatest!!! I have used all different kinds of face washer from the average supercenter to the mega pricey! It is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed one day that my Garnier face wash was drying out my skin and making me break out.  I went to CVS thinking I would try the new Neutrogena, but came across this.  It was listed as being soap free, dye free, and scent free.  I have very pale very sensitive skin and usually buy facial products that don&#x27;t have dyes or fragrance.  I bought it and used it as soon as I was home.  Like so many others have stated I felt the difference immediately.  My skin was soft and refreshed and felt very clean.  I went out a few days later and got the moisturizer, facial scrub, and eye makeup remover as well.  After a few weeks I realized I didn&#x27;t need liquid makeup anymore, I didn&#x27;t have blemishes or red spots to cover up anymore.  Now I just throw on some light powder and eye make up and I&#x27;m ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago I bought Bare Essentials face wash.  It&#x27;s pretty much dirt (in a very good way).  It&#x27;s a soapless powder that you foam up with water.  Until now it has been the best face wash I&#x27;ve every used.  Actually it&#x27;s the only good thing that Bare Essentials even sells in my book and they don&#x27;t advertise it.  I would use that if it weren&#x27;t $25 dollars a bottle.  But Simple is a very close second and about a quarter of the price (it was $6 at CVS).  I&#x27;ve been waiting for a company to come out with an affordable soapless facial wash.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier and I hope they continue making it.</li>
            <li> At first this seemed like a nice cleanser but after using it for a few weeks my face started to dry out and my neck developed an itchy rash from irritation.  Many of these companies call themselves Simple, Pure, and Natural when 50% of the ingredients are harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Works great with Olay Pro-X cleanser.  It is very easy to apply, even just a little dab on the tip of the finger is enough for a full wash.  The smell is very subtle.  It doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals found in regular soap but it produce suds very easily.  After rinsing, you can really feel that the difference especially after a long day of activities when you face becomes extra oily.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of expensive cosmetics and I am not picky on face washes, so keep this in mind for this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great natural feeling face wash. No artificial smell or perfume, just it&#x27;s own natural and very subdued smell. The best way to describe the smell? it kinda smells like the container color (if colors had smells). The clear gel washes the face without issue and without any side-effects, leaving your face clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This typically costs more than the face washes from the big mass market brands you find at local stores (if you buy them when they are on sale or on special), but I think the difference definitely justifies the slightly higher prices. Having said that, it is up to the individual to decide where to draw the line. Would you still get it if you can find face washes from Nivea or Gillette or the like or usable store brands for half the price? One third of the price? One fourth of the price? Personally I draw the line at half the price.</li>
            <li> This goes on easily since it is a thick gel.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate skin and I really appreciate having scentless products on my face.  My skin irritates easily and this doesn&#x27;t cause after shower redness.  I do feel like it cleans the skin smoothly and cleanly, as promised.  I rate this 4 starts instead of 5 because it does take a washcloth or other textured items to get it completely off my skin.  Because it is a thick gel, it is easy to get too much in the hand and waste the product - or end up with a lot on the face.  But in all, it easily compares with the Olay Foaming Face wash I had been using previously - but without the annoying scents.</li>
            <li> Usually, I use DHC products for my facial care routine, as they are usually great for sensitive skin. I have found that these Simple facial products seem to be a great inexpensive alternative to my DHC.  For reference, I have combination skin with oily skin in the T-zone and I get dry patches in areas outside of the T-zone. Usually, I use [[ASIN:B001UE60E0 DHC Deep Cleansing Oil 6.7fl.oz./200ml]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel has no scent and it goes on without any lather. It cleans make-up, mascera and dirt off without making your skin feel tight and stripped of moisture. I was hesitant at first, as most gel-based creams and cleansers breakout my face. This gel hasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely repurchase and use this regularly. Great inexpensive product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have now used 5 different Simple products.  This facial wash is yet again another great product.  It leaves my skin feel clean and smooth without irritating or leading to redness.  My skin is very fair and very sensitive.  This product works amazingly with my skin and I&#x27;m very picky about what I use on my skin.  While I got this as a free sample I will likely start using Simple products on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This product contains parabens! That is NOT a simple ingredient. It is a carcinogenic (cancer-causing) hormone that should never come in contact with skin. I was so frustrated about that when I got this product.</li>
            <li> I need gentle cleansers for my skin and Simple offers a nice, inexpensive alternative. I like it and it does the job but the Refreshing Facial Wash Gel tends to be a bit drying. I will definitely use it in the summer months when the humidity is much higher.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin and was looking for something to cleanse with no residue and not just remove makeup (not a cream cleanser). I was really hoping to like this product but my skin felt very dry after using it one time. My cheeks are still dry and look red after two days. I will return this and keep looking.</li>
            <li> I just love the Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel. After using this face wash my skins fell soft and nourished. This facila was has not harmful ingredents and is as it says just simply fancastic. I have used other Simple products and I love them all. It is great to use products that do not iritate the skin. Great product.</li>
            <li> Did help at all , this is different than US product. If you have acne this will not clear them up.</li>
            <li> Nice that it leaves skin clean without drying. I use it and my husband actually shaves with it. And then he uses their replenishing lotion afterwards. Nice that we found something we both love so i dont have to keep trying out new things.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have sensitive skin and acne.  It is really gentle and does not irritate my skin.  Although it does not cure my acne, it does not make it any worse.  I did notice that the one I purchased was shipped from the UK and there is Vitamin E added on top of the Vitamin B5.  The Simple Face Wash Gel that is made in the USA does not have Vitamin E. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t necessarily anything wrong with this product, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. There are plenty more on the market that work just like it and many others that work much better. So, it&#x27;s nothing special and I didn&#x27;t find it refreshing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the fact that it contains natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it annoying that the cap and the part that dispenses the gel, gets clogged and dried very easily. I know that&#x27;s bound to happen with a product that faces down, but I have used other products like this and have not had the problem be this excessive. I have to constantly wipe the bottle top (or bottom) -- approximately every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find it hard to get all the product off my face, even when I try using less than recommended. It&#x27;s very time-consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish the bottle but would not buy it again or recommend it. There are much better ones out there.&lt;br /&gt;I also found that it doesn&#x27;t clean that well. I used the gel to wash my face before going to bed. Then, I used my make-up remover to make sure I got all my make-up off too. I picked up so much dirt and make-up that I used 10 cotton balls of make-up remover to get all the dirt and make-up off my face. I know that&#x27;s what make-up removers were made to do, but the facial gel should get off some of it. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, but I was pretty grossed out after washing my face twice with the gel and then still having to use several cotton balls on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s just not meant for my skin. I see other reviewers love the product. But for me, it didn&#x27;t work as well as others.</li>
            <li> I HATED this face wash with a vengeance. The biggest thing was that it didn&#x27;t clean. I use a mineral powder base and a little blush so I am not heavy on the makeup, and this cleaner couldn&#x27;t even remove that. But then to add insult to injury, when you try to rinse it off IT WON&#x27;T COME OFF! It sticks to your face like glue and I had to rub and go over it several times just to feel like it was off me.  And like many others have complained about, the smell is not pleasant.  Not horrible like many described, but still... it could have been so much better.  I just cannot recommend this slime for your face. :(</li>
            <li> No fragrances or other annoying additives. About as close to nature as you&#x27;re going to get. Perfect for people with delicate and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Even though I am well past the age of teenage pimples, I have very oily and sensitive skin that is prone to acne breakouts.  I have had a hard time finding a face wash in the past, because most of the products geared toward acne have salicylic acid, which I am unfortunately allergic to.  This Simple Refreshing Facial Wash Gel seems to do the trick with my skin, even though it is not marketed specifically for acne-prone skin.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks, and my skin is clearer than what it has been in years.  I use it in the morning while showering, and again at night before I go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product lathers well, and rinses easily.  I cannot feel any residue on my face after using it.  My face feels clean, but not overly dry.  My skin looks the best it ever has, and I will definitely be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> Simple Refreshing Facial Wash is on par with kiehls or any other high end facial wash.  The facial wash is gentle and works up a lather that leaves my face smooth and soft.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used the simple refreshing face gel and it actually hurt it was so dry and tight. My skin felt like sandpaper. I used the toner and really liked it, and I&#x27;ve used the facial wipes, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on with the wash gel. After I got out of the shower I put on moisturizer, it sucked in like a drop of water in the sahara, so I put on some super hydration moisturizer I usually only use when we go to Florida and my face has been scoured by the sand, seawater, and possibly chlorine if we get into a pool, and only then did it start feeling any better, although my forehead and cheeks still feel tight. It also burned a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised because, as I said, I used the toner and wipes with no issues. There is no scent and it seems to work well for other people, but for me I might as well have used a bar of ivory soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with [[ASIN:B0073GO0SC Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub]] and [[ASIN:B0073GNZ8I Simple Soothing Facial Toner]], and the three of them work together great. I prefer to use the scrub in the morning, the gel in the evening, and the toner after both. Depending on the weather, I might use a moisturizer, but I&#x27;m happy to say that the Simple products have not been drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the [[ASIN:B00AO4EKSU Simple Eye Make-Up Remover Pads]] from time to time.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle, non-irritating, non-dying face wash. It lathers well and rinses away cleanly. The scent is subtle and vaguely pleasant, and it is gentle enough for the eye area as well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. Nearly anything can cause me to break out into some rash or another. This product, fortunately, does not. It cleans without over-drying, and rinses clean. The gel is viscous enough that when you put a glob on your hand, it sits right there instead of vanishing in the wet of the shower. It makes a nice, smooth lather with little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t quite call it refreshing, though. It&#x27;s unperfumed, having only a slight, vague odor that i associate with the bubble soap i used as a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate using this with [[ASIN:B005TI7NQ2 Simple Smoothing Facial Scrub]], since i&#x27;ve been told one shouldn&#x27;t use an exfoliating scrub every day.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial wash gel; my face feels so clean and soft after using it.  It is very gentle and does not irritate my skin. The gel is thick so just use a small amount; it lathers up really well. I find myself rubbing my hands on my face after washing with it (which come to think of it may not be the greatest idea if my hands aren&#x27;t clean).  I have tried other face washes and really like this gel and how my skin feels afterward.  It has no dyes, artificial perfumes or harsh irritants and is good for even sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered this product as a subscribe and save item, which is a good deal.  Recommended!  :-)</li>
            <li> not sure I see a lot of changes in my skin but I like the fact it is a clean product free of all Chemicals</li>
            <li> I love this gel moisturizer as a every day moisturizer. It&#x27;s is scent-free, easy to use and non-drying. I wish they still carried this in the US but this is a still a great deal. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. I received a 1.7 oz sample bottle in the mail and it lasted me 6 weeks. I love that you only have to use a small amount, mix it with some water, and lather. It makes a great lather. I noticed the difference the first time I used it. My skin was soft and clean. I love to wear makeup but I noticed after a few weeks of using it that I really didn&#x27;t need facial powder or foundation. I don&#x27;t get pimples too often, usually only around that &#x27;time of the month&#x27;, but with this face wash, I haven&#x27;t had any pimples at all! I&#x27;ve actually noticed that my pores are clearer and I have fewer blackheads as well. My face is oily as well, but using this wash has seemed to balance that out as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that the price is very good. I will definitely be using this for the foreseeable future!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. Do I love it? No. But to me, having sensitive skin, it doesn&#x27;t bother/irritate and make my skin condition - mainly my complexion - worse. A DEFINITE plus in my book. I have accidentally gotten it in my eyes while massaging it in my face, and it didn&#x27;t sting. Granted, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it there, but wiping it away with a damp cloth or a paper towel. *DO NOT* try to wash it out of your eye with water (unless there is actually gel IN your eye); for, the gel is very.....thick, though it comes out FAST and looks really thin. However, when washing it off my face, it seems to become an even thicker kind of goo-gel and doesn&#x27;t wash off as quickly as other face washes I&#x27;ve used/sampled/tried. That is probably the worst part for me. In any case, when trying to wash out some of the facial cleanser out of the eye/eye area- and no: it doesn&#x27;t really foam a lot, which I like to a certain extent....I like a LITTLE foam so I can see exactly/more clearly where and how much I actually have on, or even what ground I have/have not covered - when I first tried water, it just made it thicker, and THEN it started to sting, so I grabbed a towel (dry) nearby and gently wiped my eye, but because it was dry, it felt very grainy and rough, and it just didn&#x27;t feel good on my eye --&gt; that is why I recommend a damp towel/cloth, to avoid abrasions/irritations/roughness on the eye/eye area itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this? Maybe. My first recommendation, no, but something that is not hard on the skin, affordable (in my opinion,) lasts long (it&#x27;s lasted me roughly two months and I&#x27;m STILL working on it.) A little bit goes a LOOOOOOOOONG way with this facial wash, AND it can come out kind of fast at times - and is hard to get back in once out, even when taking the cap off to get to the larger &#x60;hole&#x27; for when it gets super low and you have to unscrew the smaller cap with the smaller hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably one of the best benefits I&#x27;ve seen with using this product: it leaves my face feeling fresh/new, clean, smooth, and just overall refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but at the same time, while feeling clean and fresh, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling overly moist/soggy or wet - like a sponge that has soaked up water. I&#x27;ve tried a facial wash that left my face feeling wet. &gt;.&amp;lt;this product: it leaves my face feeling fresh/new, clean, smooth, and just overall refreshed.

            <li> Although Cetaphil is fantastic for people with sensitive skin, for some of us it just doesn&#x27;t have the cleansing power we need. Enter this gel from Simple. It&#x27;s about as gentle as Cetaphil but feels more powerful and removes dirt more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some my Pros and Cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Fragrance-free, gentle&lt;br /&gt;- Not sticky or gooey, washes away easily&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t cause redness&lt;br /&gt;- Won&#x27;t clog pores&lt;br /&gt;- NO irritating dryness&lt;br /&gt;- Skin FEELS clean after using it&lt;br /&gt;- Feels natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Unlike Cetaphil, you want to make sure you wash off all of it&lt;br /&gt;- May not be strong enough for those with acne-prone skin. If not, I would recommend using this during the day and something with more strength at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Another winner product from Simple. Sensitive-skin friendly, fragrance, dye and soap-free. Depending on your face wash, harsh chemicals can create a bigger problem than they fix. This wash is a good mix of cleansing without the acid burn. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I feel like a jerk writing this because maybe this is the most amazingly pure face cleanser of all time.  My problem was that it felt like i was washing my face with gelatinous water.  My face was clean at the end, but could i have just used water?  I think i need some kind of scientific test to compare the amount of oil left on my skin after washing my skin using this product versus plain water.  Simple, i apologize if i&#x27;m under-appreciating your stellar product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container also seems to have some issues.  When it arrived, it arrived as a gooey mess.  I probably lost at least a tablespoon of product.</li>
            <li> I use all the simple products.  I use this facial wash along with the simple exfoliating facial wash.  All products work!</li>
