            <li>I could not believe how quickly the seller shipped it, and the great price.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love the color.  </li>
            <li>I would have been just as satisfied with a Remington from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>The results were fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It was stylish and attractive, and made my super curly hair pin straight.</li>
            <li>I tried it for more than a month and while it did not burn my hair, it did not straighten as well as the Cortex or the CHI, leaving my hair with a bizarre crimped look.  </li>

            <li>It heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The new iron (GVP) was sold to him with the promise that it too was as good as a CHI.  </li>
            <li>The new iron (GVP) was sold to him with the promise that it too was as good as a CHI.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had mine for five years and it still works good as new.</li>
            <li>I recieved the package quickly and used it that day!</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a heat protectant as it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price at a little below $30 is perfect.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>They have a nice grip to them, and I like how fast they heat up.</li>
            <li>It pulls my hair instead of running over the stands of hair smoothly.</li>
            <li>Worth every dime!</li>
            <li>They may be making improvements that will quickly outshine this one&#x27;s fine qualities, but...</li>
            <li>I looked at a similar straightner at the salon for $125.00 paid $28.00 for this one and it works just as good.</li>
            <li>I had a cheap flat iron from Walmart that fried my hair more and more every time I used it</li>
            <li>I bought mine in pink at marshall&#x27;s for 30 dollars about two years ago , i can either use it as a curling iron and its very effective.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to ANYONE who wants a great flat iron at a good price.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and evenly and when they reach and equilibrium set temp</li>
            <li>this straightner could not be any better, i have used so many different ones and this one does the trick by just going over it twice and</li>
            <li>Initially, I was very happy with this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I live in a high-humidity Gulf coast state and my hair stayed smooth and frizz-free even when the humidity level surpassed 80%!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only cute, but it works wonders on my ethnic hair!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, straightens fast, and is oh-so cute</li>
            <li>Packaging was amazing, it felt like I had just bought a 150 dollar flat iron.</li>
            <li>These are nice flat irons for the price.</li>
            <li>I am able to straighten, curl, or flip my hair with this and it stays pretty much all day, which is a nice change from my previous flat-iron experiences.    </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s piping hot by the time I get around to using it.</li>
            <li>As I only paid about $30, I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a steal for such a FANTASTIC iron!</li>
            <li>I used this iron again on the lowest temperature setting (140 degrees) and it still seems to get excessively hot.  </li>
            <li>Or that is as hot as it gets.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron-can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, shiny, and full of body.</li>
            <li>All in all, it was just as good as my CHI for half the price!!  </li>
            <li>It makes make hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I also liked the adjustable heat settings although I rarely changed them unless I bumped up the heat exponentially because I did not blow dry my hair prior to straightening.  </li>
            <li>It gets VERY hot,too.</li>
            <li>so you know its ready.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>i really recommend it</li>
            <li>This flat iron worked fine for about a year.  </li>
            <li>In this picture it looks like a slightly dull green, but it is actually more of a bright, almost neon, green (which I love).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and very frizzy but this iron actually made it smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I could understand the burning if I had been using a high heat setting but when the iron is set between 200 and 250</li>
            <li>I could understand the burning if I had been using a high heat setting but when the iron is set between 200 and 250</li>
            <li>and my hair was straight, shiny, and soft.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the green one, and I love the color.</li>
            <li>If I leave it plugged in for 15-20 minutes (which I normally do)</li>
            <li>so I tried letting them air dry and blow drying them exclusively on the cool setting but nothing changed.  </li>
            <li>I can plug it in and it&#x27;s ready to go in about 5, though, which is nice on days when I&#x27;m running behind.</li>
            <li>For the first several months, it DID work as well as my CHI.  </li>
            <li>Some days the iron was so hot that my hair actually burned my fingers after it came out of the iron.  </li>
            <li>Now let me clarify by saying that I rarely straighten all of my hair because my hair is long and it is time consuming.  </li>
            <li>I also follow the same exact routine every morning</li>
            <li>the light turns green</li>
            <li>Now with this iron my hair is so soft after every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Wish it had an auto-off feature like my old one, but can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>This Cortex is going directly in the trash while i still have hair on my head.  </li>
            <li>I recommend getting one directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>The instructions for use in the box say that the flat iron heats up fully in about one minute, but I don&#x27;t really see that.</li>
            <li>Other days the iron did not get hot enough to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>Now recently, I&#x27;ve been looking for a new flat iron and thought of the Cortex brand.</li>
            <li>The one downside is that the ceramic plates are not quite set right, so it snags my hair if I&#x27;m not super careful.  </li>

            <li> I ordered this flat iron on May 2nd</li>
            <li> and I only make TWO passes over my bangs, there is NO EXCUSE for such poor performance!!ing them air dry and blow drying them exclusively on the cool setting but nothing changed.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the results had to go over my hair several times and still it did not get it straight.</li>
            <li> My hair has stayed straight for the past 2 days without me having to re-iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my CHI broke, and I didn&#x27;t want to shell out another $60-$100 for a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably at an age where I have no business flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> So, I guess I now would say that there is no age limit on a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I researched several different brands before deciding on this one based on price and reviews from other former CHI owners claiming that it worked just as well.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a flat iron that would straighten my natural hair with little effort.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right size and weight for my hair (shoulder-length and VERY thick islander hair).</li>
            <li> After a few months however, I noticed that the heat seemed to be on a different level even though it was still on the same heat setting.  </li>
            <li> I lowered the heat setting even though it was already on a relatively low heat setting (appx 300) and that worked for a short time but the uneven heating continued</li>

            <li> My hair is naturally dark blonde and not color treated or high-lighted</li>
            <li> I IMMEDIATELY threw the Cortex in the trash can and will be forced to use the GVP until my new CHI arrives.  </li>

            <li> Took a little bit practice, but it turns your hair into shiny, glossy, younger looking follicles.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these straighteners in the last few weeks one for myself and one for a friend.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I was in the mall and one of the kiosks introduced me to the Cortex flat iron.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your time on \\&quot;defective overstock\\&quot; flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I worried that my bangs were just over processed due to the iron</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve had problems with buying items online before</li>
            <li> and I only make TWO passes over my bangs, there is NO EXCUSE for such poor performance!!</li>
            <li> My husband bought me another straightening iron a little over a month ago when I began looking at irons again due to the burning and discoloration.  </li>

            <li> The only complaint I do have is when I purchased the green one, the plates shown are tan.</li>
            <li> When i recieved it, the plates were black.</li>
            <li> In less than three uses, my hair was brassy and discolored again.  </li>

            <li> Just bought this iron a few days ago.</li>
            <li> It was sturdy, the cord was heavy and the plates were firmly mounted.  </li>
            <li> the uneven heating continued.  </li>
            <li> On the 200 degrees setting, I burnt out a small section of my hair in the front.  </li>
            <li> I would have been very disappointed if I had paid $220 for this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> For thirty bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and so did the randomly brassy burning.  </li>

            <li> I ordered this flat iron on May 2nd and I had it on the morning of May 4th. I could not believe how quickly the seller shipped it, and the great price. I ordered the green one, and I love the color. In this picture it looks like a slightly dull green, but it is actually more of a bright, almost neon, green (which I love). The instructions for use in the box say that the flat iron heats up fully in about one minute, but I don&#x27;t really see that. If I leave it plugged in for 15-20 minutes (which I normally do) it&#x27;s piping hot by the time I get around to using it. I can plug it in and it&#x27;s ready to go in about 5, though, which is nice on days when I&#x27;m running behind.It gets VERY hot,too. I am able to straighten, curl, or flip my hair with this and it stays pretty much all day, which is a nice change from my previous flat-iron experiences.    OVERALL: Great product, great price, totally recommend it.</li>

The only complaint I do have is when I purchased the green one, the plates shown are tan. When i recieved it, the plates were black. Not too big of a deal but I find that the tan plates leave my hair with a healthier shine.</li>
            <li> I would have been very disappointed if I had paid $220 for this flat iron.  As I only paid about $30, I am satisfied.  I love the color.  It heats up very quickly.  I like the swivel cord too.  The one downside is that the ceramic plates are not quite set right, so it snags my hair if I&#x27;m not super careful.  I would have been just as satisfied with a Remington from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I was in the mall and one of the kiosks introduced me to the Cortex flat iron. It was stylish and attractive, and made my super curly hair pin straight. BUT because it was 150 dollars, I didn&#x27;t get it. Now recently, I&#x27;ve been looking for a new flat iron and thought of the Cortex brand. I decided to look on Amazon and see that it&#x27;s only 30 dollars! That&#x27;s a steal for such a FANTASTIC iron! I recieved the package quickly and used it that day! It heats up fast, straightens fast, and is oh-so cute (I bought the Lime Green one). Packaging was amazing, it felt like I had just bought a 150 dollar flat iron. I definitely recommend this product to ANYONE who wants a great flat iron at a good price.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Cortex because it was suggested to me by a friend. The price was awesome given that they run for upwards of 100 dollars. When I got it in the mail, it was like Christmas. I cranked it up, and started ironing... The results were fantastic! My hair was soft, shiny, and full of body.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener! I bought this after my CHI broke, and I didn&#x27;t want to shell out another $60-$100 for a flat iron. Amazon&#x27;s price at a little below $30 is perfect. It&#x27;s the right size and weight for my hair (shoulder-length and VERY thick islander hair). Make sure to use a heat protectant as it gets very hot. I highly recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> I love my cortex! Its the best iron I&#x27;ve ever owned and the fact that it reduced my breakage is a plus. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I looked at a similar straightner at the salon for $125.00 paid $28.00 for this one and it works just as good. I love this flat iron-can&#x27;t beat the price!! Also came with a 2 year warranty!! What a deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only cute, but it works wonders on my ethnic hair! It makes make hair super shiny and soft. My roomate uses it too, and she has non-ethnic hair and it works just as well on hers too!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve had problems with buying items online before but this product is great! I had a cheap flat iron from Walmart that fried my hair more and more every time I used it and it finally took a dump and stopped working. Now with this iron my hair is so soft after every time I use it. It also arrived the day after it was shipped so I was very pleased by that. For thirty bucks you can&#x27;t go wrong. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Just bought this iron a few days ago. Used it &amp; I love it! My hair has stayed straight for the past 2 days without me having to re-iron. I am buying another one for my mom! Wish it had an auto-off feature like my old one, but can&#x27;t complain. 1&amp;1/4\\&quot; iron. Definitely worth the price, great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener in July 2011 when my second CHI finally broke.  I researched several different brands before deciding on this one based on price and reviews from other former CHI owners claiming that it worked just as well.  When it arrived, it felt like a quality product.  It was sturdy, the cord was heavy and the plates were firmly mounted.  It even had adjustable temperature settings which my CHI did not.  For the first several months, it DID work as well as my CHI.  My hair is naturally curly and very frizzy but this iron actually made it smooth and soft.  I live in a high-humidity Gulf coast state and my hair stayed smooth and frizz-free even when the humidity level surpassed 80%!  I also liked the adjustable heat settings although I rarely changed them unless I bumped up the heat exponentially because I did not blow dry my hair prior to straightening.  All in all, it was just as good as my CHI for half the price!!  After a few months however, I noticed that the heat seemed to be on a different level even though it was still on the same heat setting.  Some days the iron was so hot that my hair actually burned my fingers after it came out of the iron.  Other days the iron did not get hot enough to style my hair.  Now let me clarify by saying that I rarely straighten all of my hair because my hair is long and it is time consuming.  I wear my hair in a ponytail to work every day so the only part of my hair being styled daily was my bangs.  I also follow the same exact routine every morning so the iron had the same amount time (15 minutes) to heat up every day yet the uneven heating continued.  After about 6 months, the iron began to actually discolor my hair!!  My hair is naturally dark blonde and not color treated or high-lighted so imagine my horror when part of my bangs took on a brassy, fried look.  You could actually SEE the color difference....and it was NOTICEABLE!!  I worried that my bangs were just over processed due to the iron so I tried letting them air dry and blow drying them exclusively on the cool setting but nothing changed.  My hair continued to burn and stayed brassy.  I lowered the heat setting even though it was already on a relatively low heat setting (appx 300) and that worked for a short time but the uneven heating continued and so did the randomly brassy burning.  My husband bought me another straightening iron a little over a month ago when I began looking at irons again due to the burning and discoloration.  The new iron (GVP) was sold to him with the promise that it too was as good as a CHI.  I tried it for more than a month and while it did not burn my hair, it did not straighten as well as the Cortex or the CHI, leaving my hair with a bizarre crimped look.  I became irritated and pulled the Cortex out of retirement praying for a different result but to no avail.  In less than three uses, my hair was brassy and discolored again.  I IMMEDIATELY threw the Cortex in the trash can and will be forced to use the GVP until my new CHI arrives.  I will never buy another Cortex product and will not recommend Cortex either.  I could understand the burning if I had been using a high heat setting but when the iron is set between 200 and 250 and I only make TWO passes over my bangs, there is NO EXCUSE for such poor performance!!ing them air dry and blow drying them exclusively on the cool setting but nothing changed.

            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough for this hair straightener.  It doesn&#x27;t tug at my hair, no fly-aways, and it can be used as both a staightener and a curling iron.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought my Cortex from Marshalls for about $30.00.  I am african american and I am growing out my relaxer.  I wanted a flat iron that would straighten my natural hair with little effort.  Initially, I was very happy with this flat iron.  I used it at 350 degress and my hair was straight, shiny, and soft.  Although it did tend to snag my hair.  This flat iron worked fine for about a year.  Recently, it started frying my hair as if the temperature regulator is defective.  On the 200 degrees setting, I burnt out a small section of my hair in the front.  Thank goodness for bangs.  Also my hair has this burnt smell after usage.  I used this iron again on the lowest temperature setting (140 degrees) and it still seems to get excessively hot.  I burnt my scalp and my hair still smells burnt.  This Cortex is going directly in the trash while i still have hair on my head.  Dont waste your time on \\&quot;defective overstock\\&quot; flat irons.  I recommend getting one directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret this purchase. Worth every dime!</li>
            <li> Make sure to use the warranty! Mine lasted 2 years!</li>
            <li> The product did not heat properly....I think? Or that is as hot as it gets.  Not satisfied with the results had to go over my hair several times and still it did not get it straight. In the process of returning for a refund now.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing ever invented! NOt kidding. I bought mine in pink at marshall&#x27;s for 30 dollars about two years ago , i can either use it as a curling iron and its very effective.  Its time for a renewal and im sticking to this brand. Love it i really recommend it</li>
            <li> this straightner could not be any better, i have used so many different ones and this one does the trick by just going over it twice and its durable i&#x27;ve had mine for five years and it still works good as new. Great product i honestly think its better than a chi :)</li>
            <li> I had this product for only a month and it over heated a bunch one of the plates fell out and it over all stunk. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably at an age where I have no business flat ironing my hair. I bought this at 55. Took a little bit practice, but it turns your hair into shiny, glossy, younger looking follicles. So, I guess I now would say that there is no age limit on a flat iron. Enjoy. This appears to have been very expensive at one time and now is quite affordable. They may be making improvements that will quickly outshine this one&#x27;s fine qualities, but...did I mention I&#x27;m over 55? What do I care? This one works.</li>
            <li> These are nice flat irons for the price. I had another pair that I paid quite a bit for, but they broke, so I replaced them with these. They have a nice grip to them, and I like how fast they heat up.</li>
            <li> This flat iron certainly does not work as well as the previous 2 Cortex flat irons I&#x27;ve had. It pulls my hair instead of running over the stands of hair smoothly.</li>
