            <li>Very pretty in my hair.</li>
            <li>It was very pretty.</li>
            <li>Beautiful hair clip, sets off a plain hairdo.</li>
            <li>It made up many small beads, good quality.</li>
            <li>You might be able to adjust the clip too or because the item is handmade, it might very as far as how it is attached.</li>
            <li>I just put it on yesterday, it is really pretty on my hair!</li>
            <li>Shipping takes a while, but worth it if you can stand the wait.</li>
            <li>A lovely handmade Barret, although the picture is better looking than the actual product, if I had a better picture of the barret I probably would have had second thoughts about purchasing this product, although it looks like it was made with care it</li>
            <li>It came unglued almost right away and the closing mechanism stop working after 4 uses</li>
            <li>Got and they are very pretty thanks for sending them to me very much appricated...</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>But it is pretty when it does get attached.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Likely better for thinner/straight hair than my thick/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>This was pretty, but it&#x27;s a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t look as if it is up to Amazon&#x27;s higher standards</li>
            <li>This is a really pretty barrette.</li>
            <li>And it goes with so many different things.</li>
            <li>beige ones fell apart the first time I put them on.  </li>
            <li>The color was more yellow/beige than pink.</li>
            <li>This item is only cheap in price, not quality.</li>
            <li>The clip works very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this barrette.  </li>
            <li>It is much prettier in person.  </li>
            <li>thanks again&lt;</li>
            <li>Not necessarily for girls, more like for women; really too ornate for a young girl</li>
            <li>I thought it would be okay since it wasn&#x27;t very noticeable, but then as I went to open it to put it on, the metal part that&#x27;s supposed to snap closed, came right off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and she is used high quality stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to just replace the barrette part of it and stick the beads onto a new one.</li>
            <li>Took a long time to arrive but well worth it if you are not in a hurry to receive it.</li>
            <li>Unique right now at least.</li>
            <li>Nice but not dazzling.  </li>
            <li>Took some time getting to me so order early if you think you need it.  </li>
            <li>Looks big in picture, but the clip itself can&#x27;t hold much hair.  </li>
            <li>On closer inspection I realized it was tiny fragments of the clear beads, and when I took the barrette out, a few more beads fell off.</li>
            <li>First of all, it actually was shipped from Hong Kong, I got it in less than 2 weeks</li>
            <li>For the price, even if you are not sure, it is worth having in your supply.</li>
            <li>If you have thicker hair, it can be hard to put larger chunks in, so be aware of that!</li>

            <li> If you have thicker hair, it can be hard to put larger chunks in, so be aware of that!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find decent barrettes that aren&#x27;t too childish, too wild or too heavy....worse, just clips.  </li>
            <li> I expected it was larger</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to have my long hair style with this as an accent piece.</li>
            <li> But the clip can only hold little hair, you need to make your hair on style, then put it on .  </li>
            <li> Quicker than expected delivery as well.</li>
            <li> Did not expect the quality for such a small price.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback would be that it is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for children, women with short or thin long hair as mine is.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long the beading will stay together...</li>
            <li> but can only use it as a 1/2 up 1/2 down hair clip due to heavy thick hair.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 in this style, and 2 in black beads.  </li>
            <li> The clip itself is sort of tight if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but came apart after wearing it 5 times!! &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Holds all my hair, but my hair is thin.  </li>
            <li> It works wells for me as my hair is thin.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a bubble wrap envelope so maybe it was broken before shipping?</li>
            <li> I ordered this prepared to be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I ordered this prepared to be disappointed. First of all, it actually was shipped from Hong Kong, I got it in less than 2 weeks and it is beautiful! Good workmanship and very pleased with it. The only drawback would be that it is a little heavy. But all things considered this was a give-a-way!</li>
            <li> For the price its good.  Some times the latch doesn&#x27;t work.  But it is pretty when it does get attached.</li>
            <li> Good barrette clip. Cute style.  Holds all my hair, but my hair is thin.  Did not expect the quality for such a small price.  Took some time getting to me so order early if you think you need it.  For the price, even if you are not sure, it is worth having in your supply.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is amazing! You get a really good product for its price! It looks elegant and is pretty easy to use! If you have thicker hair, it can be hard to put larger chunks in, so be aware of that!</li>
            <li> Cheap but nice.  Holds up well.  Shipping takes a while, but worth it if you can stand the wait.</li>
            <li> Fear it will break easily. It is very pretty. I probably could have used a larger barrette as I bought it for myself.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a superb product.  Unique right now at least. Thanks again and keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Beautiful hair clip, sets off a plain hairdo. Not necessarily for girls, more like for women; really too ornate for a young girl but it is great for an older woman.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my grand-daughter and she loves it but can only use it as a 1/2 up 1/2 down hair clip due to heavy thick hair.</li>
            <li> It is very very cute. Its really shiny, but again very nice. It looks exactly like the picture. The only reason I am not giving it a five is because all the wires are connected in the back, and I accidentally poked my finger trying to open it. Once I was them, I moved them to the side so they don&#x27;t pose a threat.</li>
            <li> Looks big in picture, but the clip itself can&#x27;t hold much hair.  Likely better for thinner/straight hair than my thick/curly hair.  Fairly &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; beige color.  Not overly impressed, but it was pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Not fast shipping, but Gorgeous!  I tried the braid in the pic.  Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> This is well made and very cute. The clip itself is sort of tight if you have thicker hair. It works wells for me as my hair is thin. It is more pretty in person than it shows on the Internet. I would recommend for children, women with short or thin long hair as mine is. You might be able to adjust the clip too or because the item is handmade, it might very as far as how it is attached. Very beautiful hair piece though! Quicker than expected delivery as well.</li>
            <li> I could never make these&lt;br /&gt;they are really beautiful&lt;br /&gt;Better then described really&lt;br /&gt;my girls and there friends loved them</li>
            <li> This is a lovely hair clip. Was very affordable and looks like it cost much more than it did. I have seen this type of clip in the Mall for so much more money so it was a great deal. Took a long time to arrive but well worth it if you are not in a hurry to receive it.</li>
            <li> I expected it was larger</li>
            <li> Cute item great price</li>

            <li> It is really cute! I just put it on yesterday, it is really pretty on my hair! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Nice but not dazzling.  Smaller bead work and some threads showing, but you&#x27;ll want to keep it.  The color was more yellow/beige than pink.</li>
            <li> This hair clip is very pretty, works good on my hair. I would like to recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty but as I opened the package, some &#x27;dust&#x27; fell into my hand. On closer inspection I realized it was tiny fragments of the clear beads, and when I took the barrette out, a few more beads fell off. I thought it would be okay since it wasn&#x27;t very noticeable, but then as I went to open it to put it on, the metal part that&#x27;s supposed to snap closed, came right off. I tried to put it back and squeeze it into place so it wouldn&#x27;t fall off again, but it did anyway. I&#x27;ll have to just replace the barrette part of it and stick the beads onto a new one. I hope that works. It arrived in a bubble wrap envelope so maybe it was broken before shipping? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Tried to us it and it didn&#x27;t want to snap shut and when it did it would pop back open, I will try to use it again but I do love the design and the sparkle</li>
            <li> This clip is exactly as pictured and beautiful! It has great quality beads, and I do bead work- you couldn&#x27;t purchase just the beads and the clip to make this for the price they are selling it for. This item is only cheap in price, not quality. It seems to be handcrafted and is glued to the clip securely. The clip works very well. I just bought 2 more as gifts. Highly recommended. Allow time for delivery.</li>
            <li> It made up many small beads, good quality. But the clip can only hold little hair, you need to make your hair on style, then put it on .  Look nice on the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this barrette.  It is very light weight so is stays in my hair, but it is also has lots of sparkle.  Very pretty in my hair.</li>
            <li> A lovely handmade Barret, although the picture is better looking than the actual product, if I had a better picture of the barret I probably would have had second thoughts about purchasing this product, although it looks like it was made with care it just doesn&#x27;t look as if it is up to Amazon&#x27;s higher standards</li>
            <li> I like it very much. Thanks , it is let me beautiful</li>
            <li> It is much prettier in person.  Cute if you wear lots of updo&#x27;s but dont want a girlie bow.  Good quality</li>
            <li> This is a really pretty barrette. It seems well-made. It is perfect to us dress up your hair for an occasion.</li>
            <li> My daughter really liked it. It was very pretty. Very nicely made. And it goes with so many different things.</li>
            <li> They look beautiful.  I hope to wear them with my beige, brown, and camel clothing.  Looks well made.  Bought 2 in this style, and 2 in black beads.  Hope that it will be sturdy. Will let you, if they break or fall apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beige ones fell apart the first time I put them on.  They are held by glue, and just came apart.  Would not recommend that anybody get these.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> took like 1 month shipped from china,for the quality you know you can imagine cause its made in china.was cute though,</li>
            <li> If you are willing to wait for the shipping, this barrette arrived and I am just thrilled with it.  It is so elegant, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> good quality, a pair of hair barrettes. I gave them as gift to my niece and she is used high quality stuff, she liked them a lot.</li>
            <li> Nice hair decor.  Not sure how long the beading will stay together...</li>
            <li> Beautiful and looks like a vintage product.  Wonderful craftsmanship. I can&#x27;t wait to have my long hair style with this as an accent piece.</li>
            <li> Great hair clip. I love it. Good quality and is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but came apart after wearing it 5 times!! &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Got and they are very pretty thanks for sending them to me very much appricated...thanks again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like the detail in the clip barrette....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find decent barrettes that aren&#x27;t too childish, too wild or too heavy....worse, just clips.  This one is magically beautiful and holds hair well.</li>
