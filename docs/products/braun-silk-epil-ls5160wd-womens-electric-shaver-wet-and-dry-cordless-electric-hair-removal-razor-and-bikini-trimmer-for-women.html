            <li>a GREAT Mens electric razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was great for bikini area and legs.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works great and the two AA batteries have not been changed in over 3 months.</li>
            <li>There razors are made to set in a very nice cleaning station as it CHARGES...</li>
            <li>very nice shaver</li>
            <li>Excellent Product - Easy to use, does a great job and is a great improvement over a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t successful.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting to get a close shave &amp; not have to go over &amp; over my face again and still not get a good shave.</li>
            <li>The attachments are great and the razor works nicely.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, this was a good choice.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have time for a good shave,</li>
            <li>nice and a great price.</li>
            <li>Love it, works great and like all the attachments.  </li>
            <li>but with how great the shaver is on its own, I bet they help give an even better shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all, light weight and works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate and great for the shower</li>
            <li>you will not get that kind of a leg shave.  </li>
            <li>The three separate head attachments are a nice bonus as well.  </li>
            <li>Effective even though it runs on batteries.</li>
            <li>Does nice job shaving</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice product to keep.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I seen so many people liked it</li>
            <li>This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve owned and</li>
            <li>Great product, clean, smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>Good for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very good to me and fixed the issue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to be rid of the cord and charger.  </li>
            <li>With the others, I could still feel stubble when I was finished, no matter how many times I went over the area but not with this one.</li>
            <li>Have used once...and really love it...</li>
            <li>I love how it shaves.</li>
            <li>I give this product 2 stars for design and engineering, and I love the fact that it runs on batteries.</li>
            <li>However, for all of Braun&#x27;s great reputation, it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>but okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to use it on my underarms with no cuts or irritation,</li>
            <li>Pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay but would not recommend if you want a close shave</li>
            <li>No matter how many times you pass it over your legs you will still have stubble.</li>
            <li>Rather than returning it, I foolishly thought it might have some redeeming features.  </li>
            <li>No, I did not expect a product as outstanding as my husband&#x27;s Braun Series 7.  </li>
            <li>Better than any I have tried before.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>it broke changing the top</li>
            <li>not what I thought it would be when I bought it, still looking for a better shaver.</li>
            <li>I always made sure to put the protective cover on it after using it too.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t require me to say more than I have too.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is battery operated and does not have to be charged.  </li>
            <li>Very impressed  best of all all I don&#x27;t have to worry about her cutting herself</li>
            <li>I loved that one and this looks even better - it comes with one additional attachment (the exfoliator) and better yet, Braun has switched from fixed, non-user-serviceable batteries (plus a wall charger, of course) to two replaceable AAs.  </li>
            <li>its good especially in sensitive places</li>
            <li>Easy to read and understand instructions.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use...especially when you do not have time in the shower or bath.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it took a couple of applications.</li>
            <li>My legs haven&#x27;t been this smooth since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>really smooth shave...</li>
            <li>/&gt;You won&#x27;t be happy if you have been using a standard razor until you give it some time.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a razor but does the job and hassle free.</li>
            <li>Braun should be ashamed to sell this cheap product.  </li>
            <li>It worked great and then it stopped working properly after 4 months!!!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still worth it!</li>
            <li>I bought this about a year ago and while I love how it work and gives a pretty close shave, I have had to replace the screen twice.  </li>
            <li>Still has the original batteries in.</li>
            <li>It left me nice and smooth right away and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have owned 3 electric shavers, 3 different brands, and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>It does not give a close clean shave as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>You will not get a real close shave with this razor and because of that, I have to shave more often.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is nicely engineered - solid, well-balanced, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>Quick ship.</li>
            <li>I love my new Braun Shaver.  </li>
            <li>However, the Braun Silk Epil cut through that forest with a clean first pass.</li>
            <li>Because of the many meds I must take  daily, this razor does a fine job every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Completely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Opening and closing the case will put wear and tear on the O-ring, which I doubt will last 10 years with that kind of use.  </li>
            <li>IMHO, it&#x27;s still well worth</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud and has more of s vibration than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>is how easy it is to just use the razor part to get in close to sensitive areas without the foil getting in the way.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth what I pd for it, I get a much closer, cleaner shave with Nair.</li>
            <li>Only thing that would have been better is a protective cover for the head.</li>
            <li>Had not realized such a product was even available but knew I had to have an alternative to shaving with a razor!</li>
            <li>Fast Ship!</li>
            <li>This is my second Braun shaver and it&#x27;s even better than the first (which lasted about 8 years until I dropped</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>The batteries that came with it didn&#x27;t last for more than six shaves.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even see stumble and for the most part can&#x27;t feel any.  </li>
            <li>My old electric Remington died a slow death - goodbye, good riddance!  </li>
            <li>I wish the trim attachment were adjustable or didn&#x27;t cut so short, but it is very easy to use, unlike my old shaver&#x27;s attachment ever was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and so much easier than a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>There is a picture on the box of a model with really closely shaved legs.  </li>
            <li>I really like taking it in my trailer when we are on camping trips.  </li>
            <li>I expected more.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy model of a shaver.</li>
            <li>It does not feel cheap and shaves well for my spouse who has psoriasis and cannot use a regular shaver.</li>
            <li>so I don think is very well made.  </li>
            <li>For an electric shaver this one is close and actually will smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice and light, however not a great shave if you have course hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  never been able to do with  other electric razors.  </li>
            <li>Lack of a cord will require constant replacement of batteries, adding significantly to the product cost.</li>
            <li>Went to clean the shaving blades and the entire thing fell apart...</li>
            <li>I expected Braun products to last more than that!  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t care much for electric razors; however, I do like this one.</li>
            <li>had to use 4 times to get decent result  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd of these - the first lasted me 9 to 10 years!  </li>
            <li>Works very well so far</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gives a very close shave with little effort.</li>
            <li>I am sure they will work fine as long as I swap them out every couple of weeks - which is how long the previous shaver would run between charges.  </li>
            <li>I guess I had high expectations of this electric razor and have so far been</li>
            <li>It works very well and has several  attachments which are useful for different applications.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use it daily (or at the most every other day)</li>
            <li>Other than the close, clean shave, one thing</li>
            <li>Works almost as well as my old plug-in shaver.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to keep this one going for at least another 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one by far shaved the closest.  </li>
            <li>she is 16 yrs old and it works.</li>
            <li>However, at this price, the Lady Shaver should at least be as safe as a throwaway.  </li>
            <li>It gave a very close shave just like a regular razor.</li>
            <li>They were old.</li>
            <li>It rarely gets all the hair-even after going over the same spot numerous times.  </li>
            <li>Sent the first one back as the slide button for longer hair fell off, Received the second, shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close as I had hoped</li>
            <li>Not sure about the battery power yet, but nephews have similar shavers and love them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>About two to three days later I developed bumps and irritation but it was no different for me than waxing or shaving so this might just be my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried some other shavers, but this one is just much nicer.</li>
            <li>only things missing compared to the previous version are that the old one came with a nice little travel bag and a clip-on holster that prevented it from getting switched on in your luggage, both of which I will re-use with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would prefer a corded model, but the quality is so far above previous Remington and Panasonic models on my very sensitive skin</li>

            <li> Opening and closing the case will put wear and tear on the O-ring, which I doubt will last 10 years with that kind of use.  </li>
            <li> IMHO, it&#x27;s still well worth</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud and has more of s vibration than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> is how easy it is to just use the razor part to get in close to sensitive areas without the foil getting in the way.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth what I pd for it, I get a much closer, cleaner shave with Nair.</li>
            <li> Only thing that would have been better is a protective cover for the head.</li>
            <li> Had not realized such a product was even available but knew I had to have an alternative to shaving with a razor!</li>
            <li> Fast Ship!</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun shaver and it&#x27;s even better than the first (which lasted about 8 years until I dropped</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> The batteries that came with it didn&#x27;t last for more than six shaves.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even see stumble and for the most part can&#x27;t feel any.  </li>
            <li> My old electric Remington died a slow death - goodbye, good riddance!  </li>
            <li> I wish the trim attachment were adjustable or didn&#x27;t cut so short, but it is very easy to use, unlike my old shaver&#x27;s attachment ever was.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and so much easier than a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> There is a picture on the box of a model with really closely shaved legs.  </li>
            <li> I really like taking it in my trailer when we are on camping trips.  </li>
            <li> I expected more.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy model of a shaver.</li>
            <li> It does not feel cheap and shaves well for my spouse who has psoriasis and cannot use a regular shaver.</li>
            <li> so I don think is very well made.  </li>
            <li> For an electric shaver this one is close and actually will smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> Nice and light, however not a great shave if you have course hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  never been able to do with  other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> Lack of a cord will require constant replacement of batteries, adding significantly to the product cost.</li>
            <li> Went to clean the shaving blades and the entire thing fell apart...</li>
            <li> I expected Braun products to last more than that!  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t care much for electric razors; however, I do like this one.</li>
            <li> had to use 4 times to get decent result  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd of these - the first lasted me 9 to 10 years!  </li>
            <li> Works very well so far</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gives a very close shave with little effort.</li>
            <li> I am sure they will work fine as long as I swap them out every couple of weeks - which is how long the previous shaver would run between charges.  </li>
            <li> I guess I had high expectations of this electric razor and have so far been</li>
            <li> It works very well and has several  attachments which are useful for different applications.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use it daily (or at the most every other day)</li>
            <li> Other than the close, clean shave, one thing</li>
            <li> Works almost as well as my old plug-in shaver.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to keep this one going for at least another 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one by far shaved the closest.  </li>
            <li> she is 16 yrs old and it works.</li>
            <li> However, at this price, the Lady Shaver should at least be as safe as a throwaway.  </li>
            <li> It gave a very close shave just like a regular razor.</li>
            <li> They were old.</li>
            <li> It rarely gets all the hair-even after going over the same spot numerous times.  </li>
            <li> Sent the first one back as the slide button for longer hair fell off, Received the second, shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close as I had hoped</li>
            <li> Not sure about the battery power yet, but nephews have similar shavers and love them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> About two to three days later I developed bumps and irritation but it was no different for me than waxing or shaving so this might just be my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried some other shavers, but this one is just much nicer.</li>
            <li> only things missing compared to the previous version are that the old one came with a nice little travel bag and a clip-on holster that prevented it from getting switched on in your luggage, both of which I will re-use with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would prefer a corded model, but the quality is so far above previous Remington and Panasonic models on my very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> A VERY QUALITY SHAVER WITH A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR BOTH FINE HAIR AND LONG HAIR CUTTING CAPABILITY</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t believe any of the electric shavers are capable of accomplishing the &amp;#34;bowling ball&amp;#34; slick that shaving with shaving cream/razor can.</li>
            <li> The jury s still out as to how long the AA batteries last.</li>
            <li> I use this on my legs only and as long as you keep charged batteries in the shaver, it works well.</li>
            <li> I am also saving the foil and the blades from the previous one, which were new last year from a Braun service center.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to only use it as a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I had needed this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver if you are looking for something for long term use.</li>
            <li> It takes 3 times as long to achieve 70% of what I can do with my razor.  </li>
            <li> In the previous design, housing was only opened for servicing - an external socket provided recharging.  </li>
            <li> Not as sharp as a regular razor, so don&#x27;t be deceived by the marketing.  </li>
            <li> Such an improvement over the other models</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a long time (eek!)</li>
            <li> Not really a close shave not so smooth or I might be doing something wrong since all the reviews appreciate its close shaving.</li>
            <li> The attachment that removes dry skin works well.</li>
            <li> I like the dry or wet feature of the product.</li>
            <li> the purchase price if even half as durable as my last one.  </li>
            <li> The only difference is I wish it still had a rechargeable battery as my previous one did.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as I thought it would be, but it does all I expected.  </li>
            <li> well when wet</li>
            <li> Total waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on its performance in wet conditions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are reading carefully about the product I bought.</li>
            <li> and after a few weeks of frustration I threw away the Panasonic and bought the current Braun.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the other two attachments yet,</li>
            <li> women&#x27;s on the other hand is &amp;</li>
            <li> I need to go back and force several times to get tough ones out</li>
            <li> I have complained to Braun on their facebook page and they keep coming back to say &amp;</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Living in CA with a drought, I thought I could cut down water usage in the shower by not shaving my legs in the shower.  </li>
            <li> When the batteries run down I&#x27;ll probably get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use this wet</li>
            <li> This is not true.</li>
            <li> Also, the cover to the battery compartment is so tight I couldn&#x27;t get it off</li>
            <li> Recommend this little gem.</li>
            <li> have yet to find one of the little plastic pieces.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  waste your money</li>
            <li> it a try this winter but give it a few months before you decide.</li>
            <li> it is just a trouble.</li>
            <li> I learned that it quickly savages my legs with bloody tears.  </li>
            <li> ;, has very little power to do the task at hand,&lt;br /&gt;TWO LEGS &amp; Underarms.</li>
            <li> No more razor bumps.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s no magic.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am just inexperienced but I am not happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> they mean every inch of skin all the way up and down your legs!</li>
            <li> I am annoyed how difficult it was to open the case so I can place the batteries in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> No more nicking my legs!  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this razor because of other reviews and it is terrible.  </li>
            <li> A God-send after getting a really bad nick prior to purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> It gives a lousy shave and you have to work really hard to even get that.</li>
            <li> Instead of trimming the hair it&#x27;s just randomly snagging it.</li>
            <li> The screen is  very thin</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the shaved.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing for a Braun product as I&#x27;ve used and purchased Braun for years.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed  </li>
            <li> I feel terrible to have to send it to the eLandfill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for decades, and this is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Does a terrible job.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t care much for electric razors; however, I do like this one.</li>
            <li> Smells like used bananas</li>
            <li> Works very well so far</li>
            <li> This Braun shaver is not reliable.  Only lasted 9 months!  I expected Braun products to last more than that!  I feel terrible to have to send it to the eLandfill.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift great product!</li>
            <li> Living in CA with a drought, I thought I could cut down water usage in the shower by not shaving my legs in the shower.  You will not get a real close shave with this razor and because of that, I have to shave more often.  There is a picture on the box of a model with really closely shaved legs.  Nope...you will not get that kind of a leg shave.  I really like taking it in my trailer when we are on camping trips.  If we ever get out of this drought, I will go back to razor shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as I thought it would be, but it does all I expected.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> shaves well. not ver well when wet</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as a regular razor, so don&#x27;t be deceived by the marketing.  My wife says its &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, I think we will stick the closeness of a gel and double blade disposable.</li>
            <li> HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY!  My old electric Remington died a slow death - goodbye, good riddance!  I&#x27;m glad to be rid of the cord and charger.  Two double A batteries which were included (Duracell) works well for me.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use this wet but I like having the option.  The three separate head attachments are a nice bonus as well.  I have used the optimal head and the exfoliating head and both work well.  Of course the closeness of the shave is not that of a manual razor but I don&#x27;t believe any of the electric shavers are capable of accomplishing the &amp;#34;bowling ball&amp;#34; slick that shaving with shaving cream/razor can.</li>
            <li> Such an improvement over the other models</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is just starting to shave.  Completely worth the money. It is the closest shave I have seen from electric razor.  I can&#x27;t even see stumble and for the most part can&#x27;t feel any.  Very impressed  best of all all I don&#x27;t have to worry about her cutting herself</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It does the job well.  I like the dry or wet feature of the product.</li>
            <li> I read the one review on this item and decided to try it.  What a difference!  My legs haven&#x27;t been this smooth since I was a teenager.  It is the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> Great product, clean, smooth shaves. Ergonomically designed.  Great accessories.  Easy to read and understand instructions.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works almost as well as my old plug-in shaver.  Close shave with no skin irritation.  I prefer to only use it as a dry shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this assuming it was rechargeable, since it says in the &amp;#34;what&#x27;s in the box&amp;#34; section that it comes with an electrical cord. This is not true. It runs on Double A batteries only. No cord in the box.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned.  It gives a close shave without irritation, even in the bikini area. Would prefer a corded model, but the quality is so far above previous Remington and Panasonic models on my very sensitive skin, it&#x27;s still worth it!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  Looks pretty.  Doesn&#x27;t shave hair from flesh.</li>
            <li> Does not provide a close shave</li>
            <li> Love it, works great and like all the attachments.  Recommend this little gem.</li>
            <li> I have owned 3 electric shavers, 3 different brands, and this is by far the best one. With the others, I could still feel stubble when I was finished, no matter how many times I went over the area but not with this one. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Have used once...and really love it...really smooth shave...</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a long time (eek!), so I didn&#x27;t expect great first-over results. However, the Braun Silk Epil cut through that forest with a clean first pass. Other than the close, clean shave, one thing that&#x27;s great is how easy it is to just use the razor part to get in close to sensitive areas without the foil getting in the way. The attachments work well, too. I wish the trim attachment were adjustable or didn&#x27;t cut so short, but it is very easy to use, unlike my old shaver&#x27;s attachment ever was. I haven&#x27;t used the other two attachments yet, but with how great the shaver is on its own, I bet they help give an even better shave. DEFINITELY recommended.</li>
            <li> I love how it shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in the shaved. I was expecting to get a close shave &amp; not have to go over &amp; over my face again and still not get a good shave. It wasn&#x27;t worth what I pd for it, I get a much closer, cleaner shave with Nair.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this razor because of other reviews and it is terrible.  I would not recommend purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> This shaver is nicely engineered - solid, well-balanced, easy to hold.  It&#x27;s waterproof - you can use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this as a replacement for an almost identical model I bought in 2003 that finally died.  I loved that one and this looks even better - it comes with one additional attachment (the exfoliator) and better yet, Braun has switched from fixed, non-user-serviceable batteries (plus a wall charger, of course) to two replaceable AAs.  I am going to use rechargeables.  I am sure they will work fine as long as I swap them out every couple of weeks - which is how long the previous shaver would run between charges.  I am also saving the foil and the blades from the previous one, which were new last year from a Braun service center.  Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to keep this one going for at least another 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things missing compared to the previous version are that the old one came with a nice little travel bag and a clip-on holster that prevented it from getting switched on in your luggage, both of which I will re-use with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose my only hesitation is that the exterior case has not been re-engineered.  It is a snap-fit case, without a dedicated battery box that closes with a \\&quot;trap door\\&quot; style lid. This means that users will have to open the entire waterproof housing every time they swap batteries.  In the previous design, housing was only opened for servicing - an external socket provided recharging.  Opening and closing the case will put wear and tear on the O-ring, which I doubt will last 10 years with that kind of use.  Hopefully they are using a standard size O-ring that can be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the price has gone up $20 since 2003.  C&#x27;est la vie.  IMHO, it&#x27;s still well worth the purchase price if even half as durable as my last one.  I have tried some other shavers, but this one is just much nicer.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product - Easy to use, does a great job and is a great improvement over a safety razor.  Worth the money</li>
            <li> Does not do the job it advertises it will do on the legs. Big surprise</li>
            <li> Because of having a mastectomy I cannot use razors and have tried several electric shavers.  This one by far shaved the closest.  No shaver will cut hair as close as a razor but this one it&#x27;s the closest.</li>
            <li> I give this product 2 stars for design and engineering, and I love the fact that it runs on batteries. However, for all of Braun&#x27;s great reputation, it doesn&#x27;t work very well. I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for decades, and this is the worst one I&#x27;ve ever used. When they say you need to pull the skin taut they mean every inch of skin all the way up and down your legs! It gives a lousy shave and you have to work really hard to even get that. I&#x27;m going back to Remington post haste!</li>
            <li> Sent the first one back as the slide button for longer hair fell off, Received the second, shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close as I had hoped but okay. Went to clean the shaving blades and the entire thing fell apart...have yet to find one of the little plastic pieces. Very disappointing for a Braun product as I&#x27;ve used and purchased Braun for years. I expected more.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to use this product.  It is everything the ad promised.  Because of the many meds I must take  daily, this razor does a fine job every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I seen so many people liked it so I though hey why not. I wish I didn&#x27;t have yes it shaves but it is NOT a close shave at all. It&#x27;s a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Does not give a close shave</li>
            <li> Delivered in a timely manner.  The product is as represented.  Only thing that would have been better is a protective cover for the head.</li>
            <li> It was not what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent ladies razor/trimmer.  It works very well and has several  attachments which are useful for different applications.  I&#x27;ve even been able to use it on my underarms with no cuts or irritation, something  I&#x27;ve  never been able to do with  other electric razors.  This is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve owned and Amazon&#x27;s price is quite reasonable.  Great product, I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Quick ship. Pleased with the product. Highly recommend this product to others. Easy to operate and great for the shower</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd of these - the first lasted me 9 to 10 years!  The only difference is I wish it still had a rechargeable battery as my previous one did.  The attachments are great and the razor works nicely.</li>
            <li> Shaved is great but I wish I ordered a charger one.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t shave the hair from my wife&#x27;s legs as she had hoped.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay but would not recommend if you want a close shave</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I had needed this for a long time.  I especially like the exfoliating head.  It is easy to use...especially when you do not have time in the shower or bath.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t  spend the money on another one. Was very disappointed  had to use 4 times to get decent result  Don&#x27;t  waste your money</li>
            <li> Does a terrible job. No matter how many times you pass it over your legs you will still have stubble. If you don&#x27;t use it daily (or at the most every other day) it can&#x27;t handle the hair at all. Also, the cover to the battery compartment is so tight I couldn&#x27;t get it off at all - took my husband multiple times to open it. When the batteries run down I&#x27;ll probably get rid of it. Total waste of $$.</li>
            <li> I tell my friends I can shave once a week even in the summer and it&#x27;s no nicks and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be happy if you have been using a standard razor until you give it some time. Not as close as a razor but does the job and hassle free. No cord just batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try this winter but give it a few months before you decide. Your hair will grow slower and will be lighter. That&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my grandaughter what can I say she likes it she is 16 yrs old and it works.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife, she is very happy with this razor. Easy to use and gives a very close shave with little effort.</li>
            <li> This product is everything I&#x27;d hoped for. It&#x27;s all, light weight and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This product is described as containing an electrical cord. It does not. Lack of a cord will require constant replacement of batteries, adding significantly to the product cost. DONT BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> Not really a close shave not so smooth or I might be doing something wrong since all the reviews appreciate its close shaving. Tried all the heads and positions to get close shave but nothing. If you trying to get this to shave private areas don&#x27;t consider it please it is just a trouble.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy model of a shaver. Effective even though it runs on batteries. It does not feel cheap and shaves well for my spouse who has psoriasis and cannot use a regular shaver. I cannot comment on its performance in wet conditions. I do like the convenience of a wet/dry shaver. This will be a regular travel companion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Braun should be ashamed to sell this cheap product.  My husband had enormous difficulty opening it to insert the battery.  Rather than returning it, I foolishly thought it might have some redeeming features.  I learned that it quickly savages my legs with bloody tears.  No, I did not expect a product as outstanding as my husband&#x27;s Braun Series 7.  However, at this price, the Lady Shaver should at least be as safe as a throwaway.  The throwaway here was the price paid.</li>
            <li> Nice and light, however not a great shave if you have course hair, so this makes it time consuming.</li>
            <li> No more nicking my legs!  A God-send after getting a really bad nick prior to purchasing this product.  Had not realized such a product was even available but knew I had to have an alternative to shaving with a razor!</li>
            <li> While I like the way the shaver works I am annoyed how difficult it was to open the case so I can place the batteries in.  I have complained to Braun on their facebook page and they keep coming back to say &amp;#34;you can&#x27;t open the case&amp;#34;.  Huh? I don&#x27;t think they are reading carefully about the product I bought.</li>
            <li> Too noisy &amp; doesn&#x27;t shave well. Had to return it</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it took a couple of applications. Better than any I have tried before.Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 5 years, now we got this one for my husband. It is perfect to use in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> It works great. It is a bit loud and has more of s vibration than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> It rarely gets all the hair-even after going over the same spot numerous times.  Every time I&#x27;ve used it, it has taken off skin as well hair.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, this was a good choice. The jury s still out as to how long the AA batteries last.</li>
            <li> it broke changing the top</li>
            <li> Fast Ship! Item as described. Works wonderfully.....I like it!</li>
            <li> does not get as close a shave as advertised, but will work for a quickie when you are in a hurry and you don&#x27;t have time for a good shave, not what I thought it would be when I bought it, still looking for a better shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver works well. Not sure about the battery power yet, but nephews have similar shavers and love them.</li>
            <li> its good especially in sensitive places</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun shaver and it&#x27;s even better than the first (which lasted about 8 years until I dropped it).&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase and try the *Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Shaver for Ladies with Bikini Attachment* which I have rated 1 star on amazon.....and after a few weeks of frustration I threw away the Panasonic and bought the current Braun.  It is great.</li>
            <li> I have waited to purchase the product, Hoping that it would have been perfected by NOW!&lt;br /&gt;The disapoinment lies with Braun. They have No Problem w/ a GREAT Mens electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;The women&#x27;s on the other hand is &amp;#34;batteries operated&amp;#34;, has very little power to do the task at hand,&lt;br /&gt;TWO LEGS &amp; Underarms. A man has his face. There razors are made to set in a very nice cleaning station as it CHARGES... NO BATTERIES! So Once again I have been Disapointed as the Consumer.&lt;br /&gt;Patricia Evanchuck</li>
            <li> I guess I had high expectations of this electric razor and have so far been&lt;br /&gt;diappointed.  It does not give a close clean shave as I had hoped.  I would not purchase&lt;br /&gt;this razor again.</li>
            <li> I love my new Braun Shaver.  It&#x27;s fast and so much easier than a straight razor.  I would recommend this shaver to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago and while I love how it work and gives a pretty close shave, I have had to replace the screen twice.  The screen is  very thin so I don think is very well made.  I always made sure to put the protective cover on it after using it too.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shaver if you are looking for something for long term use.</li>
            <li> A gift to my wife for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It gave a very close shave just like a regular razor. No more razor bumps. I would recommend this to every women.</li>
            <li> This was great for bikini area and legs.  It left me nice and smooth right away and very easy to use.  About two to three days later I developed bumps and irritation but it was no different for me than waxing or shaving so this might just be my sensitive skin.  Will continue to use and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about this product and was looking forward to trying it; however, I was not impressed with this product at all. It didn&#x27;t cut well/close to the skin.  I ended up returning it. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> A VERY QUALITY SHAVER WITH A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR BOTH FINE HAIR AND LONG HAIR CUTTING CAPABILITY</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she wanted. That is all I need to say about the product. Don&#x27;t require me to say more than I have too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a battery operated shaver with also a cord. Couldn&#x27;t find one. This one said it was corded but after receiving two shavers...no cord. There was some confusion with the description posted on Amazon. Amazon was very good to me and fixed the issue. This shaver works great and the two AA batteries have not been changed in over 3 months. Still has the original batteries in. It is not a charge shaver...solely a battery. It has a lot of power and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is battery operated and does not have to be charged.  I keep batteries in a ziploc bag in my vanity drawer.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice and a great price.</li>
            <li> Does nice job shaving but it&#x27;s no magic.  I need to go back and force several times to get tough ones out but it&#x27;s a nice product to keep.</li>
            <li> I have never used an Epilady or electric razor before but wanted something specifically for the summer to use in between razor shaving days.  I bought this product based on the reviews and I wanted something in the middle of the price road which is why this was my choice.  Maybe I am just inexperienced but I am not happy with the results.  It takes 3 times as long to achieve 70% of what I can do with my razor.  Hope this helps someone else and I will continue looking for an electric razor for women that will achieve my goal of the in between days especially during shorts season.</li>
            <li> For an electric shaver this one is close and actually will smooth skin.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I use this on my legs only and as long as you keep charged batteries in the shaver, it works well.</li>
            <li> Good for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> very nice shaver I like it</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t shave as well as a razor, but I needed to protect my skin from cuts. The batteries that came with it didn&#x27;t last for more than six shaves. They were old. The attachment that removes dry skin works well. I wish they included a case for storage and traveling.</li>
            <li> It worked great and then it stopped working properly after 4 months!!! Instead of trimming the hair it&#x27;s just randomly snagging it. I tried to find a replacement head and I wasn&#x27;t successful. My return window has passed just before I started having issues with it. Too bad.</li>
