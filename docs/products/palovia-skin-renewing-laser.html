    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am VERY impressed with this gadget.</li>
            <li>I guess the best thing is that since they offer a 60 day guarantee - you can try for yourself and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>I will be happy!</li>
            <li>As for now, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>have a great return policy, so try it!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m especially happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am VERY impressed with the Trinity.</li>
            <li>Impressive, and a must!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t expect this to make my skin flawless after a treatment.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned</li>
            <li>I am almost 52, and do have very good skin.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have not taken very good care of my skin</li>

            <li>My wife of 53 years has beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>And ladies this is GREAT for the lip area.</li>
            <li>I tried to post a review , but it ended up as a comment to let&#x27;s be honest, who wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews of the PaloVia, I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive mine.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m a happy camper</li>
            <li>Happy with my results.</li>
            <li>I consider it to be a great result.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and the results are great.</li>
            <li>Works great under eyes.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with results</li>
            <li>also used it on the 11&#x27;s and nsao-labial lines and it ws very effective there too&lt;</li>
            <li>As a bonus, I believe I may have gotten the best price in the universe! :)</li>
            <li>results around the eyes are remarkable ,difference is so noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although not as strong as the lasers used by dermatologists and plastic surgeons, the results are still very good!</li>
            <li>Seems like there would be a good result if you used it for a month without a break</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with some freckles and prone</li>
            <li>In between I use a good microdermabrasion exfolliant and/or my microdermabrasion machine.  </li>
            <li>So, when I saw the Palovia on Amazon at a good price, I thought what do I have to lose?</li>
            <li>They both are good.</li>
            <li>I take good care of my looks</li>
            <li>Also, I drink lots of water and am doing a good exfoliation once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>understand I&#x27;m not using the machine to &#x60;manufacturers&#x27; specifications&#x27; but I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>LOVE MY PALOVIA!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I would suggest you follow the instructions that come with the product and know that when you deviate from the instructions it as at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I have never put any kind of a lotion on my skin.  </li>
            <li>But my crow&#x27;s feet, honestly, were fading.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve thankfully been blessed with good skin, but I&#x27;m at the age where my wrinkles show more.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not going to compare anything for one more month...to give it a fair shot.  </li>
            <li>It kind of scared me.</li>
            <li>For the price of the Palovia, there should be some kind of guarantee that it is replaceable if it stops working.</li>
            <li>I am 41 and in good shape, with good skin, but have pretty good wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m adding this comment after a full month and two weeks into twice a week use....still going great</li>
            <li>got my paloVia skin renewing laser at a fast shipment, love the way it gives resaults, Im a very happy customer and will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s worth five stars because of how great I look and feel after two months time.</li>
            <li>Good news is that you din&#x27;t need to use it just once a day, and 25 shots are available every 8 hours, so you could just finish treating your face in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Mostly because I over-used it and kind of burned my face..</li>
            <li>Amazon price was by far the best I could find on the internet.</li>
            <li>the best home skin care product available, convenient, easy to use, exceptional price given what fillers, Botox, professional treatments cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very light complected (think Ann Hathaway).</li>
            <li>I think that the more liberal you are with the gel the better results you get.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I did not have people tell me I looked better,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m considering buying another machine so that I can treat some areas more often.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t work on some people&#x27;s skin, but it sure works on mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it worked for some, but didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Much better trade off.</li>
            <li>This is why you may end-up with more wrinkles after stopping using laser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it is not the most relaxing beauty treatment and it does leave the treated area</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t understand why I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all since so many people were claiming they did.</li>
            <li>So, I started using it again at the end of May, all of June, and now most of July.</li>
            <li>My skin is not in the best shape, since I was visiting tanning salon twice a week for last eight years</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s not like that any more.</li>
            <li>Ok, I guess.</li>
            <li>And, for sure, this machine will not give you any face-lift</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still 70% better than it was before I opened Palovia for myself.</li>
            <li>But with the PaloVia, I would have more control.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT I know that it&#x27;s going to take more time--</li>
            <li>As I said, I&#x27;ve had this done at an office and paid a LOT more money than the price of this laser</li>
            <li>I love Amazon.</li>
            <li>Covering this up with makeup became more and more</li>
            <li>I want it has more variance speed choices.</li>
            <li>breaks?&lt;br /&gt;I should have thought this one out better</li>
            <li>I have noticed more discomfort as I use it.  </li>
            <li>I would give it more stars</li>
            <li>Use the PaloVia, and it will help build up more collagen, and as you do that, the pain will gradually start to get</li>
            <li>Why spend more ?  </li>
            <li>But when I&#x27;ve used the mediaspa laser treatments for thousands of dollars, I had even more discomfort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very excited</li>
            <li>will write another review after the 30 days, but so fair it has been promising!</li>
            <li>B004LE1AX2 Raymax Low Level Laser Therapy unit - Excellent for Skin Care, Skin Rejuvenation, Acne, Scars, Skin Discoloration, Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Blemishes,etc.]][[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The fine lines returned and then started to be prominent wrinkles.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using it fine lines around my eyes don&#x27;t exist any more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am glad there is a fraxel laser available for home use.</li>
            <li>Two uncommon side effects that I experienced were small bumps</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really happy with the laser.</li>
            <li>All the hype is true!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t  expect anything to magically produce a brand new set of skin for my face, although it would be nice to be able to start over knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li>It seems to be easy to work to treat some parts of eyes.</li>
            <li>Device/Side Effects:&lt;br /&gt;The device is easy to use and operate.</li>
            <li>The fine lines have almost disappeared after about 2 months of use twice a day.</li>
            <li>It did give me some results with the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>of course this devise is not for people under 30 who just start noticing some fine lines.</li>
            <li>Again, not one iota of change to any of my fine lines.</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes are almost gone too.  </li>
            <li>I did get some sun damage since I was tanning a lot, an some fine lines with that</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes are diminished.  </li>
            <li>fine or otherwise.</li>
            <li>Also, the PaloVia did not seem to work on any of my fine lines, but again, I may have needed to use the PaloVia for a longer period of time to get results for that.</li>
            <li>I have noticed all the fine lines were obliterated after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>This was a worthy purchase!</li>
            <li>Luckily, the top for the gel screws off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great results with this device so far and have experienced no unexpected issues</li>
            <li>This is actually my very first product endorsement even though I have bought many products from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a HUGE difference</li>
            <li>Each &#x27;stamp&#x27; in a dermatology office costs $2.00, but of cource their machine is more powerful.</li>
            <li>the area is swollen not wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>It does seem to smooth and tighten.</li>
            <li>If you are want to try it yourself, feel free.</li>
            <li>, there is still some pain, there is still redness and puffiness after use, this goes away, and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>If you would like to buy this one i will sell it for cheap.</li>
            <li>I used the PaloVia faithfully and precisely as directed for one month.</li>
            <li>For me, the PaloVia is such a great alternative</li>
            <li>It is a great product which does the same as a laser at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Baby Quasar Photorejuvenation Light Therapy, Blue]][[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that there is real continuing improvement.</li>
            <li>It has not worked for me - I&#x27;m surprised by all the reviews by people saying it worked - but good for them.</li>
            <li>I bought this laser more than a year ago,and I can really say that it works better than anything else to remove wrinkles and sun damage from the skin.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it because its easy, quick, pain free (in my opinion anyway) and the texture of my skin appears improved so I look forward to using this product again and again.</li>
            <li>I started zapping all those fine lines and my face looks incredible and the acne holes appear to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I think in the long run this does more harm than good.  </li>
            <li>I re-bought the laser a month later since I read so many glowing reviews, and really wanted to make sure I gave this thing a fair shot.</li>
            <li>B004LDAYUI Raymax Professional Low Level Laser Therapy unit - Excellent for Skin Care, Skin Rejuvenation, Acne, Scars, Skin Discoloration, Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Blemishes,etc.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so excited about anything in my life.  </li>
            <li>This is a significant problem with the technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, I see a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>My skin has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>The effects of aging on the dermal layer are significant.</li>
            <li>It really is getting rid of fine lines, and at almost 53 years of age, I cannot ask for more from an</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; look better using the PaloVia than using &amp;#34;botox&amp;#34; because the injectables freeze your expression - this looks much more natural.</li>
            <li>I know the manufacturer recommends using it at night, which is great, I have used it in the morning before work and covered up the minimal redness that can happen with BB cream, and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The point was to look better, not worse</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m THRILLED that Phillips has developed this technology so that we can use it at home.  </li>
            <li>It will  take more time on the face,since the skin is much ticker.</li>
            <li>purchase this item from Amazon because Palovia has a policy that you can get a full refund within 60 days of purchase price from authorized dealers.  </li>
            <li>I have not come to a full conclusion after 30 days of use.  </li>
            <li>I have had fraxel laser, so I kinda knew what to expect, yes, it stings and burns afterwards, put ice on your face, and use medicine mamas sweet bee ointment.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>a positive note, Amazon was wonderful about returning the product - they e-mailed me a pre-paid label for the return within a matter of minutes and they credited my charge card within a few days.</li>
            <li>would strongly recommend to those that are thinking of purchasing this unit but are feeling some anxiety or reservations about it, that they first go to a dermatologist to get a consultation and</li>
            <li>The great thing is that the ridiculous reviews claiming such great results can easily be disproved.</li>
            <li>If you take the time to make sure you have steady contact with the skin,I don&#x27;t think there is a problem with interruptions.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the crows feet so much as horizontal &#x27;crinkle&#x27; smile lines where the top of my cheek meets the orbit of my eye.  </li>
            <li>and have nice smooth skin underneath, but no such luck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57 and had high hopes it would smooth out some of the fine lines</li>
            <li>Looking at it that way,it is a good value in the long run.</li>
            <li>The laser window is a small area, so you can&#x27;t cover alot of ground in any particular session, so it works best to come up with a routine.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair, oily skin and am in my late 30s.</li>
            <li>Worked far better than a TCA peel I did on my eyes.</li>
            <li>When I smile they are still there, but not like before.  </li>
            <li>But I hope it worth it.  </li>
            <li>and I think it worth buying.</li>
            <li>To be fair, my crow&#x27;s feet were not extremely deep, but I saw a VERY noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>forehead and smile lines mostly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get the impression from the literature included with the unit that using PaloVia is worry-free and super easy to do, and that&#x27;s not necessarily the case.</li>
            <li>but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>and now they are nothing but a thousand dollars worth of dust</li>
            <li>It is worth a try considering the price of some  &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; creams etc...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on marionettes, smile lines and cheek bones.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a problem because machine is supposed to work by burning skin in grid of holes in certain degree and depth that fresh clean skin fills over the holes.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Other good news is that I spent just 50% of treatment gel in 30 days which is pretty amazing since it&#x27;s not that cheap.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Right after the procedure the area under my eyes looked sunburned, but I didn&#x27;t have any marks not on my cheeks, not on my forehead.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>I love it so far, I find it great even though I will not see complete results for a few more weeks yet, but I notice from the beginning use that that my eye serum really absorbs well when I apply it right after use.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>According to the booklet, most people get mild redness that is gone by the following morning and dryness.  </li>
            <li>It cleared up quickly and I was able to attend functions with regular makeup.  </li>
            <li>but what can I say, I&#x27;m a daredevil and live life on the edge ;-} My face has acne scarring from my youth and now that I am 50 something my face looked like a connect-the-dots picture with fine lines connecting all the acne scars.</li>
            <li>I bought two of these hoping to use it on other ares of my face after reading so many good reviews, but I used it for maybe 4 months and finally gave up</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t smile over 50% of the old wrinkles are now smooth.  </li>
            <li>The bottle of PaloVia Pre-Treatment Gel that came with my original PaloVia unit is still half full, but I can&#x27;t get any more gel to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>However, you do get used to it pretty quickly and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, I am 46 years old and have no lines, not even fine ones around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I loved the idea, the design, even the little beep as it starts up.</li>
            <li>but I am a little dubious if this is a good long-term treatment for eye wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li>,it seems to clog my pores do I use as little as possible,just to get a good contact with the skin.</li>
            <li>My first use was perfect but the two following I got not \\&quot;red marks\\&quot; but red burns in the shape of the laser head.</li>
            <li>I could not tolerate the highest setting, so opted for the lowest to middle setting most of the time.</li>
            <li>I would have done it even three times a day if I was willing to wake up at 6 am.</li>
            <li>It has actually worked better than a filler I had done around the mouth.</li>
            <li>(most likely will get soon) rosacea.</li>
            <li>It is better to start using it BEFORE you start getting really deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>And after you stop a regular usage, all inflammations are gone and they do not create a volume any more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first Amazon review; I thought I need to write it.</li>
            <li>But at the same time I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles.</li>
            <li>25 shots are more then enough for what I have.</li>
            <li>To be fare with you, I&#x27;m totally amazed and satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>I decided to keep going with day-to-day treatment for 30 more days to delete thathalf of wrinkle I have left</li>
            <li>The platform that pushes the gel up to the dispenser suction tube will not move any higher, no matter how may times the plunger is pushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After first treatment, I saw a difference which has continued.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I was able to return it.</li>
            <li>I tried the machine on medium first for a day or two and then went to the highest setting.</li>
            <li>The drawback of using this device on the entire face, however, is that you only get 25 precious, precious zaps every 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>think Botox and filler is a better choice and will prevent further wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think about it when I bought them, but you are then married to these</li>
            <li>The PaloVia helped minimalize the mildly deep wrinkles between my brow and the lines on top of my cheekbones from smashing my face into my pillow at night (I sleep on my side).</li>
            <li>Renewing Laser - the first FDA-cleared at-home laser clinically proven to reduce eye wrinkles-</li>
            <li>Yes, it requires use every day for the first month...</li>
            <li>This is, of course taking longer than a series of four pro treatments, but for the convenience and cost savings, I&#x27;m willing to compromise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine lines under my eyes (especially when I&#x27;m smiling), have \\&quot;smile</li>
            <li>This home lazer actually has allowed me to soften my marionette lines, soften a facial scar and most of my other wrinkles have greatly improved as well.</li>
            <li>I tried many, many products to help in this area: aloe, morrocan oil, Curel extra dry healing lotion, arnica gel, etc.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and my skin had more wrinkles than an old shoe.  </li>
            <li>First, collagen does take time to rebuild so can you really believe anyone saying they see results in a week or two?</li>
            <li>I am sure that this is what it does, but for  me, I don&#x27;t enjoy going around with red marks (especially rectangular-shaped).  </li>
            <li>I used it every day on the high setting for 30 days and then used it more than required (almost every day) during the maintenance phase the second month.</li>
            <li>especially if you hyper pigment easily.</li>
            <li>I tend to get freckles, and have some skin damage from my 20&#x27;s, and mild adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old with mild wrinkles/creases under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>But actually it was fine.</li>
            <li>this little machine is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I cannot recommend enough that you ice your eyes right after treatment for a good 15 minutes, applying a slight pressure to discourage swelling, and it also helps the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if your skin is all puffy, then yes I suppose you don&#x27;t notice your wrinkles as much.</li>
            <li>The dermatologist used too much Botox</li>
            <li>One last note, when I treat my skin I stretch the skin so it is perfectly smooth.  </li>
            <li>want to return.. very agitated..</li>
            <li>Maybe my collagen just rebuilds fast</li>
            <li>but ...have you stopped  to calculate how much you are spending on skin creams every year...</li>
            <li>Yes, Palovia absolutely worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it still works very well,</li>
            <li>you would think I would start out gently,</li>
            <li>It really</li>
            <li>If they didn&#x27;t stop it somewhere, my whole head would just be a smoking</li>
            <li>But wow---it really has worked for me.</li>
            <li>but you know ladies, those eye wrinkles pop up and really show your age.</li>
            <li>However, at this time I can&#x27;t really say that my wrinkles have dramatically diminished</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I think the led derma roller, PaloVia and Trinity are gonna be very helpful in aiding me to achieve my goals.</li>
            <li>But icing helps so much -  </li>
            <li>it works very well.  </li>
            <li>For me, the redness is too much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also tried a red light therapy unit and then an RF machine.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>used the PaloVia for 1 month straight, and gradually scaled off after that.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect this to be as fast as a pro treatment...</li>
            <li>but I think it took as much as 10 years off my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am a 43 year old fair (Irish, German) woman who, since the age of 35 have been doing botox and fillers to maintain.</li>
            <li>: if you buy this item on Amazon, it only carries a 30 day money back guarantee, but Amazon customer service was very kind and took it back after the 30 days as a one time courtesy.</li>
            <li>I could find few flat places along the most prominent wrinkles around my eyes and this is</li>
            <li>It needs to be something that you are willing to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to take your time and ensure the blue light stays steadily lit.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve tried that, I have had red marks on my face from the laser that lasted significantly longer than they would otherwise.  </li>
            <li>My lines looked deeper and it took months before they went back to the original appearance.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this anti-aging device as a most effective no-downtime home technique to reduce fine lines and annoying skin imperfections.</li>
            <li>you decide you do not want to keep the PaloVia laser for any reason within 60 days of your purchase, simply return it to the location where you purchased it for a full refund.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to use the product for 60 to really get an idea if it will make a difference, but if this is the normal condition of my skin using this product, this wont work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a year since I did a full month of the PaloVia, and though the wrinkles between my brows came back some, they still aren&#x27;t anywhere as noticeable as they once were.</li>
            <li>I went to a dermatologist who does Botox and lasering around the eyes and he thought that my wrinkling was not bad enough yet to have any procedures done.  </li>
            <li>and so that you can use more than 25 \\&quot;zaps\\&quot; at a time because after 25 the laser shuts down for 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While a treatment takes little time, the flat treatment area doesn&#x27;t fit many areas of the face.</li>
            <li>After more than half a year of needling and copper peptide treatments my under eye area seems to recover.</li>
            <li>Also, the more collagen you have in your skin, the less pain you will feel, and vice versa.</li>
            <li>According to the instructions, after daily use for a month, you&#x27;ll see dramatic results, but give it three months to see the true outcome since that&#x27;s the minimum time it takes to build new collagen.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Non-invasive, clinically proven to be safe, easily used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t take care of my face at all), but I&#x27;m happy to admit, that my face didn&#x27;t get to the point it was before Palovia treatments, I mean even after all the damage I&#x27;ve done to my face during last 6 months (by tanning a lot, not taking care of my skin and not using Palovia)</li>
            <li>The booklet suggest using once a day on high if you can withstand the pain.</li>
            <li>I started at the highest level, and---well, it was too high.</li>
            <li>So I have decided to use it everyother day one time on high.</li>
            <li>I use the high setting and it is no picnic, the rubber-band snapping analogy is spot on.</li>
            <li>I use it on the High setting.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts like a (can&#x27;t say it here) on the high setting...</li>
            <li>moved my head, moved the Palovia... and some areas are just harder to get good contact due to the contours of the face.  </li>
            <li>I personally love this little device.</li>
            <li>In fact, I may be a total wimp, but at first, it hurt!</li>
            <li>This stylish little laser rebuilds aging skin by passing a laser beam through thousands of microscopic areas in the dermis of your skin.</li>
            <li>- they can hurt quite a bit (even though a topical anesthetic was applied to my skin a good 1/2 hr before the actual treatment) and each time my eyes were pretty swollen, a little bruised and crusty for 2-3 days afterwards.</li>
            <li>Palovia really REALLY does work on getting rid of pretty deep lines!</li>
            <li>, I just couldn&#x27;t bear going more than a few times.</li>
            <li>A larger sun spot on my cheek has nearly disappeared which has pretty much paid for the product already!</li>
            <li>I understand this is normal but</li>
            <li>Gradually, your skin will start to produce more collagen, and the redness won&#x27;t last as long as it did</li>
            <li>Although only cleared for plumping eye wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet, I&#x27;ve seen drastic results on naso-labial skin droop (smile lines) and the area around the lips, using The PaloVia Skin Renewing Laser .  </li>
            <li>I use a heavy night cream, serums and top it all with DHC Oil.</li>
            <li>Right now the only problem I have is with the pre-treatment gel.  </li>
            <li>The redness and dry skin are true.  </li>
            <li>By the next day the area of your skin that was red will feel like fine sand paper.</li>
            <li>A few days later, I got carded for the first time in MANY years when I bought wine.  </li>
            <li>At the doctor&#x27;s office (using totally different professional level machine) they track exactly what areas were done and how much laser burning.</li>
            <li>I live in the South and I have never used sun block.  </li>
            <li>Yes, my wife is taking a new set of photos every month.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be their new poster boy for the over 70 crowd.  </li>
            <li>I think six months is plenty of time for new collagen to grow</li>
            <li>The energy of the laser beam causes drooping collagen to plump up and rebuild, causing your skin to tighten as the new collagen is formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Zones under my left eye looked exactly the same as zone under my right eye before the treatment</li>
            <li>Also the minimal inflammation that does happen, which is temporary, and it actually makes me look better.</li>
            <li>I am also using the red LED vibrating derma roller, a LED red light therapy lamp and a Trinity Nu Face microcurrent system.</li>
            <li>As for covering the redness, I used L&#x27;Oreal True Match Crayon Concealer, as it covers much better than liquid concealer (seriously, I will never go back to liquid</li>
            <li>Sometimes I also use Retinol cream too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars even though the first PaloVia I received only lasted a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done with my first month of daily use and yes, my eye wrinkles are gone.  </li>
            <li>Appears to be working so far!</li>
            <li>I first only used it around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I will admit that I am a total cosmetics junkie.</li>
            <li>I am please with my purchase so far!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the same exact treatment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s due to safety reasons so that people don&#x27;t overdo it because it does make your face red and</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I finish the first month, and to into twice weekly maintenance mode, then a girlfriend who has deep wrinkles is going to use it.</li>
            <li>but what do you want at 44years old!</li>
            <li>That works ok for me because I work from home one day per week, so I simply do it the evening before, have red eyes all day while working at home and am ready to go out in public the next day.  </li>
            <li>While still in its infancy, the household laser category is expected to show tremendous growth in the coming years.  </li>
            <li>Now we need other cool items like this to use at home because women buy this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, you should be aware that Amazon does not generally appear to honor this policy.  </li>
            <li>The redness on the rest of the face is not as significant or as long lasting as that which appears around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have super deep lines, this is more for preventing them from getting worse.</li>
            <li>The redness went away during the first week; afterwards, even after overnight, the redness remained and the skin became increasingly dry, supposedly as a new layer of skin is being uncovered.</li>
            <li>I thought about going to a spa and having this done professionally</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seventy years old and use the lazer where ever I deem a need.</li>
            <li>Some of those lines completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>So you can an even regeneration of young skin.</li>
            <li>I contacted seller for return, because it&#x27;s too old, it&#x27;s not returnable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Based on them I really thought that the following morning I would look like a monster.</li>
            <li>I have been using PaloVia just for two days, so it&#x27;s quite early to speak about any visible results.</li>
            <li>I hope they will disappear completely by the end of 30-days treatment period.</li>
            <li>I was left with a bump from too much filler under one eye.  </li>
            <li>The forehead lines are nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>I took my time and got up to the highest level(within a couple of weeks), I really got used to the sensation around my eyes (the upper lip?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 53 year old woman</li>
            <li>So far I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The reason I&#x60;m writing this review is to say loud THIS WORKS.Good</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So, it would appear that in this instance the same device really can be a 5-star for one person and a 1-star for another.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional Fraxcel and ProFractional sessions</li>
            <li>because even though I experience the same after effects as with the pro treatments, they&#x27;re so much milder - I don&#x27;t have hide in my house for days after a treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have used it all over my face for nearly two years.</li>
            <li>in the beginning it was just the old skin drying up</li>
            <li>but it is still too early to tell.  </li>
            <li>skin must too sensitive for this</li>
            <li>If anyone out there is looking to get rid of enlarged pores, I recommend having a salicylic acid peel done (by a professional).</li>
            <li>and I see a marked improvement in the lines around my eyes, nasolabial folds and forehead lines.</li>
            <li>I hope to continue to see improvements on the parenthesis around my mouth and lines near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>As an adult, I&#x27;ve been diligent to use sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update if something magical happens in the next few months</li>
            <li>Slowly, but surely.  </li>
            <li>basically feels like it&#x27;s slowly burning the top layer of skin away.</li>
            <li>In fact, the number of epidermal cells decreases by 10% per decade, dividing more slowly as we.</li>
            <li>and my husband asks me what did I do to all of a sudden look so vibrant and young!</li>
            <li>Oh how I wanted this to work, but after three months of using the product as directed I actually look older.  </li>
            <li>Please be aware that you can only get 25 TINY stamps in any 8 hr. period of time.  </li>
            <li>Oh, one last thing, I am using it twice a day on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>The redness/dryness is at times difficult to cover even with great makeup and moisturizers, but I feel in the long run the &#x60;down time&#x27; is so worth it.  </li>
            <li>But you cannot really exercise that kind of control with this silly handheld low energy machine</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in my lids as well as under eyes looking tighter, firming the skin, and younger looking, I would buy it again hands down, and I use it almost every day (not just on my eyes!)</li>
            <li>But I wanted to let you know that the laser window is tiny (somewhat around 10mm x 5mm) and for those who has a lot of wrinkles, especially horizontal lines trough the forehead, 25 shots are really nothing.</li>
            <li>The only difference is that the laser screen is smaller which means it doesn&#x27;t cover as much space during the treatment</li>
            <li>The gel actually lasts a pretty long time.  </li>
            <li>(yes, you do look attractive with your \\&quot;gorgeous tan\\&quot; but tanning does damage your skin a lot, unfortunately :-( ).</li>
            <li>I used it on my fine lines around my eyes and on my upper lip area to see if it would help the small vertical lines there.</li>
            <li>so I am putting off further use until the fall and in the meantime getting decent results with a Red Baby</li>
            <li>and this was generally on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no pain, especially if you&#x27;ve had professional treatments done.</li>
            <li>The red welts did not go away by morning for me and while makeup helped to hide them, they never went away completely since I used the laser every day.</li>
            <li>The redness around my eyes had completely gone by the following morning.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t hold the PaloVia and your head completely still it will abort the zap, and no, you don&#x27;t get that zap back.  </li>
            <li>I have had laser treatments done by a doctor, and yes - this is the same technology; HOWEVER, the marks made by the professional treatment went away after about 1 week</li>
            <li>I feel like this gave me back my appearance that natural aging was taking away.  </li>
            <li>The area may look worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>My only issue is it leaves little brown marks, but it goes away quick.</li>
            <li>I had to actually go through the hassle of sending it back and waiting on a new one.</li>
            <li>I have also  used it for crowsfeet, enlarged pores, and some tiny acne scars, but with less success.</li>
            <li>thats why they have different strengths and only allow you 25 stamps, but I was using it twice daily on high every day.</li>
            <li>I was excited initially but then began to have red marks on my skin and the treatment was more painful each day.</li>
            <li>Instructions are clear and the daily procedure takes only about 3-4 minutes a day.  </li>
            <li>works.&lt;br /&gt;The day after I use it the skin around my eyes is usually slightly red, and very dry, so I use a very moisturizing eye cream (like Creme Ancienne by Fresh) and that usually does it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wrinkles under my left eye disappeared, but under my right eye I still have a half of one wrinkle left.</li>
            <li>I use it before I go to bed and the red is gone or barely noticeable when I wake up.</li>
            <li>So my first reaction was that this was a waste of money....</li>
            <li>No matter what, it takes at least two full days after stopping using the laser for the redness to disappear.</li>
            <li>certain that you use it at night before you go to bed, because YES it WILL leave dark, red marks where you used it &amp;</li>
            <li>The only downside is that you only get to zap your wrinkles 25 times in an 8 hour period, so you might need to use it a few different times a day for wrinkles other than crow&#x27;s feet, but the ease of use and painless treatment is easy when watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It uses much less intense laser energy compared to machine the doctor has.</li>
            <li>It will not help to keep your under eye skin young for a long time, but will definitely bring some damage.</li>
            <li>I had had laser done professionally and found it really painful and the down time was pretty serious (my skin is pretty fair).</li>
            <li>Deep wrinkles running from the corners of eyes down to cheeks are still there, but much shorter.</li>
            <li>because I know my skin is eventually going to look much nicer as I can already tell a difference...just not full blown yet.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have the permanent dark circles that appear as we get older and cannot be gotten rid of using any cream out there,</li>
            <li>This is why it hurts worse around the eyes and wrinkles, because you have less collagen in those spots, than say, your chin, which naturally has more collagen.  </li>
            <li>The slowed restructure of these skin-tightening proteins causes your skin to thin, droop and lose elasticity--which often leads to winkles, furrows and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I largely alleviate the dryness by heavily applying moisurizer around the eyes every day, but it is still dryer than if I had not used the laser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>anyone out there know of other new technology for in-home use?</li>
            <li>Definitely see results, but it is painful, you really have to be able to bite the bullet so to speak.</li>

            <li> After reading all the great reviews of the PaloVia, I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive mine.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a happy camper</li>
            <li> Happy with my results.</li>
            <li> I consider it to be a great result.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and the results are great.</li>
            <li> Works great under eyes.</li>
            <li> Lol</li>
            <li> Great results.</li>
            <li> Great results.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with results</li>
            <li> also used it on the 11&#x27;s and nsao-labial lines and it ws very effective there too&lt;</li>
            <li> As a bonus, I believe I may have gotten the best price in the universe! :)</li>
            <li> results around the eyes are remarkable ,difference is so noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although not as strong as the lasers used by dermatologists and plastic surgeons, the results are still very good!</li>
            <li> Seems like there would be a good result if you used it for a month without a break</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with some freckles and prone</li>
            <li> In between I use a good microdermabrasion exfolliant and/or my microdermabrasion machine.  </li>
            <li> So, when I saw the Palovia on Amazon at a good price, I thought what do I have to lose?</li>
            <li> They both are good.</li>
            <li> I take good care of my looks</li>
            <li> Also, I drink lots of water and am doing a good exfoliation once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> understand I&#x27;m not using the machine to &#x60;manufacturers&#x27; specifications&#x27; but I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> LOVE MY PALOVIA!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> I would suggest you follow the instructions that come with the product and know that when you deviate from the instructions it as at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have never put any kind of a lotion on my skin.  </li>
            <li> But my crow&#x27;s feet, honestly, were fading.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve thankfully been blessed with good skin, but I&#x27;m at the age where my wrinkles show more.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not going to compare anything for one more month...to give it a fair shot.  </li>
            <li> It kind of scared me.</li>
            <li> For the price of the Palovia, there should be some kind of guarantee that it is replaceable if it stops working.</li>
            <li> I am 41 and in good shape, with good skin, but have pretty good wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m adding this comment after a full month and two weeks into twice a week use....still going great</li>
            <li> got my paloVia skin renewing laser at a fast shipment, love the way it gives resaults, Im a very happy customer and will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s worth five stars because of how great I look and feel after two months time.</li>
            <li> Good news is that you din&#x27;t need to use it just once a day, and 25 shots are available every 8 hours, so you could just finish treating your face in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Mostly because I over-used it and kind of burned my face..</li>
            <li> Amazon price was by far the best I could find on the internet.</li>
            <li> the best home skin care product available, convenient, easy to use, exceptional price given what fillers, Botox, professional treatments cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very light complected (think Ann Hathaway).</li>
            <li> I think that the more liberal you are with the gel the better results you get.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I did not have people tell me I looked better,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m considering buying another machine so that I can treat some areas more often.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t work on some people&#x27;s skin, but it sure works on mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it worked for some, but didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Much better trade off.</li>
            <li> This is why you may end-up with more wrinkles after stopping using laser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it is not the most relaxing beauty treatment and it does leave the treated area</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand why I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all since so many people were claiming they did.</li>
            <li> So, I started using it again at the end of May, all of June, and now most of July.</li>
            <li> My skin is not in the best shape, since I was visiting tanning salon twice a week for last eight years</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s not like that any more.</li>
            <li> Ok, I guess.</li>
            <li> And, for sure, this machine will not give you any face-lift</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s still 70% better than it was before I opened Palovia for myself.</li>
            <li> But with the PaloVia, I would have more control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT I know that it&#x27;s going to take more time--</li>
            <li> As I said, I&#x27;ve had this done at an office and paid a LOT more money than the price of this laser</li>
            <li> I love Amazon.</li>
            <li> Covering this up with makeup became more and more</li>
            <li> I want it has more variance speed choices.</li>
            <li> breaks?&lt;br /&gt;I should have thought this one out better</li>
            <li> I have noticed more discomfort as I use it.  </li>
            <li> I would give it more stars</li>
            <li> Use the PaloVia, and it will help build up more collagen, and as you do that, the pain will gradually start to get</li>
            <li> Why spend more ?  </li>
            <li> But when I&#x27;ve used the mediaspa laser treatments for thousands of dollars, I had even more discomfort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited</li>
            <li> will write another review after the 30 days, but so fair it has been promising!</li>

            <li> The fine lines returned and then started to be prominent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using it fine lines around my eyes don&#x27;t exist any more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am glad there is a fraxel laser available for home use.</li>
            <li> Two uncommon side effects that I experienced were small bumps</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really happy with the laser.</li>
            <li> All the hype is true!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t  expect anything to magically produce a brand new set of skin for my face, although it would be nice to be able to start over knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li> It seems to be easy to work to treat some parts of eyes.</li>
            <li> Device/Side Effects:&lt;br /&gt;The device is easy to use and operate.</li>
            <li> The fine lines have almost disappeared after about 2 months of use twice a day.</li>
            <li> It did give me some results with the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> of course this devise is not for people under 30 who just start noticing some fine lines.</li>
            <li> Again, not one iota of change to any of my fine lines.</li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes are almost gone too.  </li>
            <li> I did get some sun damage since I was tanning a lot, an some fine lines with that</li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes are diminished.  </li>
            <li> fine or otherwise.</li>
            <li> Also, the PaloVia did not seem to work on any of my fine lines, but again, I may have needed to use the PaloVia for a longer period of time to get results for that.</li>
            <li> I have noticed all the fine lines were obliterated after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This was a worthy purchase!</li>
            <li> Luckily, the top for the gel screws off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great results with this device so far and have experienced no unexpected issues</li>
            <li> This is actually my very first product endorsement even though I have bought many products from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> It made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a HUGE difference</li>
            <li> Each &#x27;stamp&#x27; in a dermatology office costs $2.00, but of cource their machine is more powerful.</li>
            <li> the area is swollen not wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> It does seem to smooth and tighten.</li>
            <li> If you are want to try it yourself, feel free.</li>
            <li> , there is still some pain, there is still redness and puffiness after use, this goes away, and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> If you would like to buy this one i will sell it for cheap.</li>
            <li> I used the PaloVia faithfully and precisely as directed for one month.</li>
            <li> For me, the PaloVia is such a great alternative</li>
            <li> It is a great product which does the same as a laser at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>

            <li> and I can honestly say that there is real continuing improvement.</li>
            <li> It has not worked for me - I&#x27;m surprised by all the reviews by people saying it worked - but good for them.</li>
            <li> I bought this laser more than a year ago,and I can really say that it works better than anything else to remove wrinkles and sun damage from the skin.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it because its easy, quick, pain free (in my opinion anyway) and the texture of my skin appears improved so I look forward to using this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I started zapping all those fine lines and my face looks incredible and the acne holes appear to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I think in the long run this does more harm than good.  </li>
            <li> I re-bought the laser a month later since I read so many glowing reviews, and really wanted to make sure I gave this thing a fair shot.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so excited about anything in my life.  </li>
            <li> This is a significant problem with the technology.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, I see a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> My skin has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> The effects of aging on the dermal layer are significant.</li>
            <li> It really is getting rid of fine lines, and at almost 53 years of age, I cannot ask for more from an</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; look better using the PaloVia than using &amp;#34;botox&amp;#34; because the injectables freeze your expression - this looks much more natural.</li>
            <li> I know the manufacturer recommends using it at night, which is great, I have used it in the morning before work and covered up the minimal redness that can happen with BB cream, and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The point was to look better, not worse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m THRILLED that Phillips has developed this technology so that we can use it at home.  </li>
            <li> It will  take more time on the face,since the skin is much ticker.</li>
            <li> purchase this item from Amazon because Palovia has a policy that you can get a full refund within 60 days of purchase price from authorized dealers.  </li>
            <li> I have not come to a full conclusion after 30 days of use.  </li>
            <li> I have had fraxel laser, so I kinda knew what to expect, yes, it stings and burns afterwards, put ice on your face, and use medicine mamas sweet bee ointment.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> a positive note, Amazon was wonderful about returning the product - they e-mailed me a pre-paid label for the return within a matter of minutes and they credited my charge card within a few days.</li>
            <li> would strongly recommend to those that are thinking of purchasing this unit but are feeling some anxiety or reservations about it, that they first go to a dermatologist to get a consultation and</li>
            <li> The great thing is that the ridiculous reviews claiming such great results can easily be disproved.</li>
            <li> If you take the time to make sure you have steady contact with the skin,I don&#x27;t think there is a problem with interruptions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the crows feet so much as horizontal &#x27;crinkle&#x27; smile lines where the top of my cheek meets the orbit of my eye.  </li>
            <li> and have nice smooth skin underneath, but no such luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 and had high hopes it would smooth out some of the fine lines</li>
            <li> Looking at it that way,it is a good value in the long run.</li>
            <li> The laser window is a small area, so you can&#x27;t cover alot of ground in any particular session, so it works best to come up with a routine.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair, oily skin and am in my late 30s.</li>
            <li> Worked far better than a TCA peel I did on my eyes.</li>
            <li> When I smile they are still there, but not like before.  </li>
            <li> But I hope it worth it.  </li>
            <li> and I think it worth buying.</li>
            <li> To be fair, my crow&#x27;s feet were not extremely deep, but I saw a VERY noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> forehead and smile lines mostly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get the impression from the literature included with the unit that using PaloVia is worry-free and super easy to do, and that&#x27;s not necessarily the case.</li>
            <li> but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> and now they are nothing but a thousand dollars worth of dust</li>
            <li> It is worth a try considering the price of some  &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; creams etc...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on marionettes, smile lines and cheek bones.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a problem because machine is supposed to work by burning skin in grid of holes in certain degree and depth that fresh clean skin fills over the holes.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Other good news is that I spent just 50% of treatment gel in 30 days which is pretty amazing since it&#x27;s not that cheap.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Right after the procedure the area under my eyes looked sunburned, but I didn&#x27;t have any marks not on my cheeks, not on my forehead.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> I love it so far, I find it great even though I will not see complete results for a few more weeks yet, but I notice from the beginning use that that my eye serum really absorbs well when I apply it right after use.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> According to the booklet, most people get mild redness that is gone by the following morning and dryness.  </li>
            <li> It cleared up quickly and I was able to attend functions with regular makeup.  </li>
            <li> but what can I say, I&#x27;m a daredevil and live life on the edge ;-} My face has acne scarring from my youth and now that I am 50 something my face looked like a connect-the-dots picture with fine lines connecting all the acne scars.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these hoping to use it on other ares of my face after reading so many good reviews, but I used it for maybe 4 months and finally gave up</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t smile over 50% of the old wrinkles are now smooth.  </li>
            <li> The bottle of PaloVia Pre-Treatment Gel that came with my original PaloVia unit is still half full, but I can&#x27;t get any more gel to come out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> However, you do get used to it pretty quickly and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I am 46 years old and have no lines, not even fine ones around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I loved the idea, the design, even the little beep as it starts up.</li>
            <li> but I am a little dubious if this is a good long-term treatment for eye wrinkles yet.</li>
            <li> ,it seems to clog my pores do I use as little as possible,just to get a good contact with the skin.</li>
            <li> My first use was perfect but the two following I got not \\&quot;red marks\\&quot; but red burns in the shape of the laser head.</li>
            <li> I could not tolerate the highest setting, so opted for the lowest to middle setting most of the time.</li>
            <li> I would have done it even three times a day if I was willing to wake up at 6 am.</li>
            <li> It has actually worked better than a filler I had done around the mouth.</li>
            <li> (most likely will get soon) rosacea.</li>
            <li> It is better to start using it BEFORE you start getting really deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> And after you stop a regular usage, all inflammations are gone and they do not create a volume any more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first Amazon review; I thought I need to write it.</li>
            <li> But at the same time I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles.</li>
            <li> 25 shots are more then enough for what I have.</li>
            <li> To be fare with you, I&#x27;m totally amazed and satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep going with day-to-day treatment for 30 more days to delete thathalf of wrinkle I have left</li>
            <li> The platform that pushes the gel up to the dispenser suction tube will not move any higher, no matter how may times the plunger is pushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After first treatment, I saw a difference which has continued.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I was able to return it.</li>
            <li> I tried the machine on medium first for a day or two and then went to the highest setting.</li>
            <li> The drawback of using this device on the entire face, however, is that you only get 25 precious, precious zaps every 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> think Botox and filler is a better choice and will prevent further wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think about it when I bought them, but you are then married to these</li>
            <li> The PaloVia helped minimalize the mildly deep wrinkles between my brow and the lines on top of my cheekbones from smashing my face into my pillow at night (I sleep on my side).</li>
            <li> Renewing Laser - the first FDA-cleared at-home laser clinically proven to reduce eye wrinkles-</li>
            <li> Yes, it requires use every day for the first month...</li>
            <li> This is, of course taking longer than a series of four pro treatments, but for the convenience and cost savings, I&#x27;m willing to compromise.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine lines under my eyes (especially when I&#x27;m smiling), have \\&quot;smile</li>
            <li> This home lazer actually has allowed me to soften my marionette lines, soften a facial scar and most of my other wrinkles have greatly improved as well.</li>
            <li> I tried many, many products to help in this area: aloe, morrocan oil, Curel extra dry healing lotion, arnica gel, etc.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and my skin had more wrinkles than an old shoe.  </li>
            <li> First, collagen does take time to rebuild so can you really believe anyone saying they see results in a week or two?</li>
            <li> I am sure that this is what it does, but for  me, I don&#x27;t enjoy going around with red marks (especially rectangular-shaped).  </li>
            <li> I used it every day on the high setting for 30 days and then used it more than required (almost every day) during the maintenance phase the second month.</li>
            <li> especially if you hyper pigment easily.</li>
            <li> I tend to get freckles, and have some skin damage from my 20&#x27;s, and mild adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old with mild wrinkles/creases under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> But actually it was fine.</li>
            <li> this little machine is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I cannot recommend enough that you ice your eyes right after treatment for a good 15 minutes, applying a slight pressure to discourage swelling, and it also helps the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if your skin is all puffy, then yes I suppose you don&#x27;t notice your wrinkles as much.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist used too much Botox</li>
            <li> One last note, when I treat my skin I stretch the skin so it is perfectly smooth.  </li>
            <li> want to return.. very agitated..</li>
            <li> Maybe my collagen just rebuilds fast</li>
            <li> but ...have you stopped  to calculate how much you are spending on skin creams every year...</li>
            <li> Yes, Palovia absolutely worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it still works very well,</li>
            <li> you would think I would start out gently,</li>
            <li> It really</li>
            <li> If they didn&#x27;t stop it somewhere, my whole head would just be a smoking</li>
            <li> But wow---it really has worked for me.</li>
            <li> but you know ladies, those eye wrinkles pop up and really show your age.</li>
            <li> However, at this time I can&#x27;t really say that my wrinkles have dramatically diminished</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I think the led derma roller, PaloVia and Trinity are gonna be very helpful in aiding me to achieve my goals.</li>
            <li> But icing helps so much -  </li>
            <li> it works very well.  </li>
            <li> For me, the redness is too much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also tried a red light therapy unit and then an RF machine.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> used the PaloVia for 1 month straight, and gradually scaled off after that.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect this to be as fast as a pro treatment...</li>
            <li> but I think it took as much as 10 years off my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old fair (Irish, German) woman who, since the age of 35 have been doing botox and fillers to maintain.</li>
            <li> : if you buy this item on Amazon, it only carries a 30 day money back guarantee, but Amazon customer service was very kind and took it back after the 30 days as a one time courtesy.</li>
            <li> I could find few flat places along the most prominent wrinkles around my eyes and this is</li>
            <li> It needs to be something that you are willing to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to take your time and ensure the blue light stays steadily lit.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve tried that, I have had red marks on my face from the laser that lasted significantly longer than they would otherwise.  </li>
            <li> My lines looked deeper and it took months before they went back to the original appearance.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this anti-aging device as a most effective no-downtime home technique to reduce fine lines and annoying skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> you decide you do not want to keep the PaloVia laser for any reason within 60 days of your purchase, simply return it to the location where you purchased it for a full refund.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to use the product for 60 to really get an idea if it will make a difference, but if this is the normal condition of my skin using this product, this wont work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a year since I did a full month of the PaloVia, and though the wrinkles between my brows came back some, they still aren&#x27;t anywhere as noticeable as they once were.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist who does Botox and lasering around the eyes and he thought that my wrinkling was not bad enough yet to have any procedures done.  </li>
            <li> and so that you can use more than 25 \\&quot;zaps\\&quot; at a time because after 25 the laser shuts down for 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While a treatment takes little time, the flat treatment area doesn&#x27;t fit many areas of the face.</li>
            <li> After more than half a year of needling and copper peptide treatments my under eye area seems to recover.</li>
            <li> Also, the more collagen you have in your skin, the less pain you will feel, and vice versa.</li>
            <li> According to the instructions, after daily use for a month, you&#x27;ll see dramatic results, but give it three months to see the true outcome since that&#x27;s the minimum time it takes to build new collagen.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Non-invasive, clinically proven to be safe, easily used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t take care of my face at all), but I&#x27;m happy to admit, that my face didn&#x27;t get to the point it was before Palovia treatments, I mean even after all the damage I&#x27;ve done to my face during last 6 months (by tanning a lot, not taking care of my skin and not using Palovia)</li>
            <li> The booklet suggest using once a day on high if you can withstand the pain.</li>
            <li> I started at the highest level, and---well, it was too high.</li>
            <li> So I have decided to use it everyother day one time on high.</li>
            <li> I use the high setting and it is no picnic, the rubber-band snapping analogy is spot on.</li>
            <li> I use it on the High setting.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts like a (can&#x27;t say it here) on the high setting...</li>
            <li> moved my head, moved the Palovia... and some areas are just harder to get good contact due to the contours of the face.  </li>
            <li> I personally love this little device.</li>
            <li> In fact, I may be a total wimp, but at first, it hurt!</li>
            <li> This stylish little laser rebuilds aging skin by passing a laser beam through thousands of microscopic areas in the dermis of your skin.</li>
            <li> - they can hurt quite a bit (even though a topical anesthetic was applied to my skin a good 1/2 hr before the actual treatment) and each time my eyes were pretty swollen, a little bruised and crusty for 2-3 days afterwards.</li>
            <li> Palovia really REALLY does work on getting rid of pretty deep lines!</li>
            <li> , I just couldn&#x27;t bear going more than a few times.</li>
            <li> A larger sun spot on my cheek has nearly disappeared which has pretty much paid for the product already!</li>
            <li> I understand this is normal but</li>
            <li> Gradually, your skin will start to produce more collagen, and the redness won&#x27;t last as long as it did</li>
            <li> Although only cleared for plumping eye wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet, I&#x27;ve seen drastic results on naso-labial skin droop (smile lines) and the area around the lips, using The PaloVia Skin Renewing Laser .  </li>
            <li> I use a heavy night cream, serums and top it all with DHC Oil.</li>
            <li> Right now the only problem I have is with the pre-treatment gel.  </li>
            <li> The redness and dry skin are true.  </li>
            <li> By the next day the area of your skin that was red will feel like fine sand paper.</li>
            <li> A few days later, I got carded for the first time in MANY years when I bought wine.  </li>
            <li> At the doctor&#x27;s office (using totally different professional level machine) they track exactly what areas were done and how much laser burning.</li>
            <li> I live in the South and I have never used sun block.  </li>
            <li> Yes, my wife is taking a new set of photos every month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be their new poster boy for the over 70 crowd.  </li>
            <li> I think six months is plenty of time for new collagen to grow</li>
            <li> The energy of the laser beam causes drooping collagen to plump up and rebuild, causing your skin to tighten as the new collagen is formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Zones under my left eye looked exactly the same as zone under my right eye before the treatment</li>
            <li> Also the minimal inflammation that does happen, which is temporary, and it actually makes me look better.</li>
            <li> I am also using the red LED vibrating derma roller, a LED red light therapy lamp and a Trinity Nu Face microcurrent system.</li>
            <li> As for covering the redness, I used L&#x27;Oreal True Match Crayon Concealer, as it covers much better than liquid concealer (seriously, I will never go back to liquid</li>
            <li> Sometimes I also use Retinol cream too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars even though the first PaloVia I received only lasted a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with my first month of daily use and yes, my eye wrinkles are gone.  </li>
            <li> Appears to be working so far!</li>
            <li> I first only used it around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I will admit that I am a total cosmetics junkie.</li>
            <li> I am please with my purchase so far!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the same exact treatment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s due to safety reasons so that people don&#x27;t overdo it because it does make your face red and</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I finish the first month, and to into twice weekly maintenance mode, then a girlfriend who has deep wrinkles is going to use it.</li>
            <li> but what do you want at 44years old!</li>
            <li> That works ok for me because I work from home one day per week, so I simply do it the evening before, have red eyes all day while working at home and am ready to go out in public the next day.  </li>
            <li> While still in its infancy, the household laser category is expected to show tremendous growth in the coming years.  </li>
            <li> Now we need other cool items like this to use at home because women buy this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, you should be aware that Amazon does not generally appear to honor this policy.  </li>
            <li> The redness on the rest of the face is not as significant or as long lasting as that which appears around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have super deep lines, this is more for preventing them from getting worse.</li>
            <li> The redness went away during the first week; afterwards, even after overnight, the redness remained and the skin became increasingly dry, supposedly as a new layer of skin is being uncovered.</li>
            <li> I thought about going to a spa and having this done professionally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seventy years old and use the lazer where ever I deem a need.</li>
            <li> Some of those lines completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> So you can an even regeneration of young skin.</li>
            <li> I contacted seller for return, because it&#x27;s too old, it&#x27;s not returnable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Based on them I really thought that the following morning I would look like a monster.</li>
            <li> I have been using PaloVia just for two days, so it&#x27;s quite early to speak about any visible results.</li>
            <li> I hope they will disappear completely by the end of 30-days treatment period.</li>
            <li> I was left with a bump from too much filler under one eye.  </li>
            <li> The forehead lines are nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> I took my time and got up to the highest level(within a couple of weeks), I really got used to the sensation around my eyes (the upper lip?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 53 year old woman</li>
            <li> So far I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x60;m writing this review is to say loud THIS WORKS.Good</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So, it would appear that in this instance the same device really can be a 5-star for one person and a 1-star for another.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional Fraxcel and ProFractional sessions</li>
            <li> because even though I experience the same after effects as with the pro treatments, they&#x27;re so much milder - I don&#x27;t have hide in my house for days after a treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have used it all over my face for nearly two years.</li>
            <li> in the beginning it was just the old skin drying up</li>
            <li> but it is still too early to tell.  </li>
            <li> skin must too sensitive for this</li>
            <li> If anyone out there is looking to get rid of enlarged pores, I recommend having a salicylic acid peel done (by a professional).</li>
            <li> and I see a marked improvement in the lines around my eyes, nasolabial folds and forehead lines.</li>
            <li> I hope to continue to see improvements on the parenthesis around my mouth and lines near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> As an adult, I&#x27;ve been diligent to use sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update if something magical happens in the next few months</li>
            <li> Slowly, but surely.  </li>
            <li> basically feels like it&#x27;s slowly burning the top layer of skin away.</li>
            <li> In fact, the number of epidermal cells decreases by 10% per decade, dividing more slowly as we.</li>
            <li> and my husband asks me what did I do to all of a sudden look so vibrant and young!</li>
            <li> Oh how I wanted this to work, but after three months of using the product as directed I actually look older.  </li>
            <li> Please be aware that you can only get 25 TINY stamps in any 8 hr. period of time.  </li>
            <li> Oh, one last thing, I am using it twice a day on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> The redness/dryness is at times difficult to cover even with great makeup and moisturizers, but I feel in the long run the &#x60;down time&#x27; is so worth it.  </li>
            <li> But you cannot really exercise that kind of control with this silly handheld low energy machine</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in my lids as well as under eyes looking tighter, firming the skin, and younger looking, I would buy it again hands down, and I use it almost every day (not just on my eyes!)</li>
            <li> But I wanted to let you know that the laser window is tiny (somewhat around 10mm x 5mm) and for those who has a lot of wrinkles, especially horizontal lines trough the forehead, 25 shots are really nothing.</li>
            <li> The only difference is that the laser screen is smaller which means it doesn&#x27;t cover as much space during the treatment</li>
            <li> The gel actually lasts a pretty long time.  </li>
            <li> (yes, you do look attractive with your \\&quot;gorgeous tan\\&quot; but tanning does damage your skin a lot, unfortunately :-( ).</li>
            <li> I used it on my fine lines around my eyes and on my upper lip area to see if it would help the small vertical lines there.</li>
            <li> so I am putting off further use until the fall and in the meantime getting decent results with a Red Baby</li>
            <li> and this was generally on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no pain, especially if you&#x27;ve had professional treatments done.</li>
            <li> The red welts did not go away by morning for me and while makeup helped to hide them, they never went away completely since I used the laser every day.</li>
            <li> The redness around my eyes had completely gone by the following morning.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t hold the PaloVia and your head completely still it will abort the zap, and no, you don&#x27;t get that zap back.  </li>
            <li> I have had laser treatments done by a doctor, and yes - this is the same technology; HOWEVER, the marks made by the professional treatment went away after about 1 week</li>
            <li> I feel like this gave me back my appearance that natural aging was taking away.  </li>
            <li> The area may look worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> My only issue is it leaves little brown marks, but it goes away quick.</li>
            <li> I had to actually go through the hassle of sending it back and waiting on a new one.</li>
            <li> I have also  used it for crowsfeet, enlarged pores, and some tiny acne scars, but with less success.</li>
            <li> thats why they have different strengths and only allow you 25 stamps, but I was using it twice daily on high every day.</li>
            <li> I was excited initially but then began to have red marks on my skin and the treatment was more painful each day.</li>
            <li> Instructions are clear and the daily procedure takes only about 3-4 minutes a day.  </li>
            <li> works.&lt;br /&gt;The day after I use it the skin around my eyes is usually slightly red, and very dry, so I use a very moisturizing eye cream (like Creme Ancienne by Fresh) and that usually does it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wrinkles under my left eye disappeared, but under my right eye I still have a half of one wrinkle left.</li>
            <li> I use it before I go to bed and the red is gone or barely noticeable when I wake up.</li>
            <li> So my first reaction was that this was a waste of money....</li>
            <li> No matter what, it takes at least two full days after stopping using the laser for the redness to disappear.</li>
            <li> certain that you use it at night before you go to bed, because YES it WILL leave dark, red marks where you used it &amp;</li>
            <li> The only downside is that you only get to zap your wrinkles 25 times in an 8 hour period, so you might need to use it a few different times a day for wrinkles other than crow&#x27;s feet, but the ease of use and painless treatment is easy when watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It uses much less intense laser energy compared to machine the doctor has.</li>
            <li> It will not help to keep your under eye skin young for a long time, but will definitely bring some damage.</li>
            <li> I had had laser done professionally and found it really painful and the down time was pretty serious (my skin is pretty fair).</li>
            <li> Deep wrinkles running from the corners of eyes down to cheeks are still there, but much shorter.</li>
            <li> because I know my skin is eventually going to look much nicer as I can already tell a difference...just not full blown yet.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have the permanent dark circles that appear as we get older and cannot be gotten rid of using any cream out there,</li>
            <li> This is why it hurts worse around the eyes and wrinkles, because you have less collagen in those spots, than say, your chin, which naturally has more collagen.  </li>
            <li> The slowed restructure of these skin-tightening proteins causes your skin to thin, droop and lose elasticity--which often leads to winkles, furrows and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I largely alleviate the dryness by heavily applying moisurizer around the eyes every day, but it is still dryer than if I had not used the laser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> anyone out there know of other new technology for in-home use?</li>
            <li> Definitely see results, but it is painful, you really have to be able to bite the bullet so to speak.</li>
            <li> You can hardly see them now unless you are in the right lighting.</li>
            <li> One of my biggest complaints has been how the botox does not last long enough in the areas my doctor does to help minimize eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I know how far to move down my face for the next stamp.  </li>
            <li> I used the high intensity level and used the treament around my eyes everyday for 30 days.  </li>
            <li> From day to day zone around your eyes looks worse and worse: more red and very puffy.</li>
            <li> Botox works, but I was interested in this as additional help, and hopefully for those hard to treat under eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Tried, don&#x27;t like product because clearly in order to get FDA approval for home use w/o doctor present, then had to dumb down machine so much (compared to professional machines used in Dermotologist offices) that this product is basically worthless:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only laser burns about 1 cm sq, and you can only do limited number of those in a day.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> At least it has some real science behind it, so we shall see, not to mention they are dirt cheap in comparison.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, to make up for the strength, this home unit has to be used daily for one whole month (compared to just a couple office visits with a real laser).</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> : Gel lasts a long time; ease of use; short length of each treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if  you want only minor improvements, then give this a try.</li>
            <li> If I were to do this, my under eyes would continually be red, dry, bumpy, etc.</li>
            <li> a single container of gel may last for ?</li>
            <li> Limited to only 25 zaps per 8 hour period.</li>
            <li> I have little problem with interruptions thus far</li>
            <li> The laser zaps can be painful at first, especially for the first week.</li>
            <li> Take a break from it on weekends or every few days to allow the redness to subside and allow the sandpaper-y texture from the PaloVia laser to naturally exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Ouch, temporary redness and a use over a long terms...that&#x27;s my expectation</li>
            <li> How long is the warranty?  </li>
            <li> I also noticed after a month or so that the skin on my chest is also smoother due to so much \\&quot;lasering\\&quot;, so it may be possible that it removes the wrinkles under the eyes as well if you try hard, but I found the redness it causes just not acceptable for my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my husband said i look like someone who just got punched in both eyes (not the black and blue look just the redness of coarse).</li>
            <li> When I follow the steps above, I can use this when I get home in the evening, and have little to no redness by the next morning, and apply concealer where I do.</li>
            <li> While I realize you are only supposed to use it around your eyes, after reading about others using it on other areas, I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Just redness and dry skin.</li>
            <li> did experience the redness and dry skin side effects</li>
            <li> In addition the treated areas around the eyes is severely  dry.</li>
            <li> at least one professional ProFractional treatment to see how it actually feels and how your skin responds to the treatment.  </li>
            <li> are: redness, dryness, aborted zaps, limited zaps</li>
            <li> Overall my skin has some  (dark spots)</li>
            <li> I am glad that this laser works for some people - laser treatments at the medspa are very, very expensive.  </li>
            <li> The following 8 hours the swelling goes down but the redness increases.</li>
            <li> However there are some dangerous side affects only lightly mentioned by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> except it only burns on the treated spots (which are small anyway, since you can only use 25 stamps in one session).</li>
            <li> Although I was starting to see some improvement with the creases/wrinkles that I was targeting, my under eye area was generally looking worse on a day to day basis because it was red, dry, and had strange little bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the most painful area on the face though.</li>
            <li> The derma roller is 10 times more painful, then this laser.  </li>
            <li> It has definitely zapped my eyes back at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re missing an entire market.  </li>
            <li> After I used it as directed for a few days I gave up since I couldn&#x27;t show my face in public</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no problem doing two and even three zaps on one spot -</li>
            <li> And that, mr Justice, is worth the money since I&#x27;ve tried for years to get rid of those spots with all sorts of useless creams and serums ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am 55 and did not expect a miracle, but for the price I paid for it, I  did expect to see minimal results.</li>
            <li> The red rectangle marks it leaves go away after a few hours though.</li>
            <li> But I was not comfortable with the fact that I have to use it for my entire life to keep the result.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;s see any progress on the smile lines around my mouth, but since this machine was made just for eye area, it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The sad thing is that I don&#x27;t see any improvements on the smile lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> My skin is not very wrinkled or discolored, but I am in an attack mode to keep the wrinkles and sags at bay.</li>
            <li> And I really do not see any results.</li>
            <li> I do see some improvement with the texture of the skin on my face and orbit areas, but really no dimishing of the eye wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried it under my eyes on two consecutive nights on the lowest setting, was red and swollen for a few days afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But over the last few years, it seems like everything is not looking the way I want it too.  </li>
            <li> spend hundreds bucks on this kind of crap.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to assess the rating as I have stopped using it when I have gotten too red &amp; dry around the eye area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain, but it seems like forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate to pay $30 for a new bottle, when this bottle is still half full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll treat one eye in the morning the other eye at night.  </li>
            <li> so I started using it in other ways than around my eyes, like for example on my decollete area where I had a lot of brown spots due to years of sun exposure as well as age</li>
            <li> I gave only 4 stars because of the 25 zap limit and the small laser head</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;After 30 days of daily use, I did see a small improvement in the under eye wrinkles that I was treating.</li>
            <li> but we will make a one time exception for you due to the confusion\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I have had botox in the past and would say I currently don&#x27;t need it again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the unit on any other part of my face or body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Alas, my second one is going back tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I does dry my skin a lot (I apply few moisturizers, but it doesn&#x27;t help).</li>
            <li> In the morning I use a dead sea peel to take away the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is red, slightly swollen, dry, bumpy, and a few small pimples.  </li>
            <li> i cam still see a little redness theough the makeup but its usually faded enough by the time I get to work and no one has ever noticed it.  </li>
            <li> My eyes began flickering like a bad neon light was on after using the RF machine for a while</li>
            <li> Using the laser every day did not allow enough time for these side effects to go away, so my eyes were looking pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I have found that it is helping to keep away the hollowness  &amp; dark circles that were once under my eyes .&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> The bags/circles under my eyes are almost gone, and it also removed the dark spots on my skin from sun damage.  </li>
            <li> The improvement that I was seeing was not worth the cosmetic unsightliness caused by the side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry, I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> think they actually make you look worse in the long run.</li>
            <li> This machine does not appear to work for dark marks</li>
            <li> She put it down and never used it again.</li>
            <li> you age, your skin&#x27;s collagen and elastin break down faster than your body can re-erect them.</li>
            <li> Swelling goes down within an hour or two.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t mean the product is not working - it may actually work on wrinkles as well, but there is no way you can see the effects</li>
            <li> At least 30% experienced fat loss and are very disappointed with their Fraxel treatment.  </li>
            <li> but I bought the PaloVia for less and can use it</li>
            <li> The only comments I&#x27;ve received is \\&quot;What is wrong with your face, you have a bunch of red marks.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The deeper ones are still there, but less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my under eyes were noticeably red and the redness did not go away until the end of the next day, when it was time to use the laser again.  </li>
            <li> They looked slightly less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> Smoother, tighter with less visible pores.</li>
            <li> was gone and lines were much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cluster still looks the same, though not quite as deep.</li>
            <li> To me these risks and unpleasant side affects wasn&#x27;t worth the fact that the product does work.</li>
            <li> The return window for my Palovia closed at 30 days, which is the usual return period for Amazon products.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and my skin became slightly irritated, as the brochure said it woul, as skin sloughs off.  </li>
            <li> I said, there&#x27;s no way this little device is going to work.  </li>
            <li> It may seem a little pricey...</li>
            <li> The laser feels like little snapping rubberbands...</li>
            <li> just little stings but nothing that makes you squirm unless you&#x27;re a sissy.</li>
            <li> I had the laser set on the medium setting, but it made my skin look just a little bit sunburned (no pain and not that noticeable</li>
            <li> However, once I healed I had no issues with excessive dryness, hyperpigmentation or bumps that have been reported by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I used it on some enlarged pores and 2 acne scars that I have, will little to no luck, but I may have needed to use it longer for pesky spots like those.</li>
            <li> Not only does the dermal layer thin, but also less collagen is produced, and the elastin fibers that provide elasticity wear out.</li>
            <li> In addition, my under eyes were very dry, which tended to enhance the wrinkling under my eyes and made it hard to apply concealer to cover the redness.</li>
            <li> My lips puckered and plumped up a few hours after I treated them.</li>
            <li> and I had to wait for a few days for the redness to subside.</li>
            <li> Not one or two weeks, but a few months.  </li>
            <li> This waste of money product was just that.</li>
            <li> and if they break you have to buy another which was not cheap.</li>
            <li> I still have a few lines there</li>
            <li> At first my skin definitely felt dry, but didn&#x27;t look horrible or anything like that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And for the reviews that claim that the wrinkles disappeared in less than one month (some even after a few days!)</li>
            <li> This stuff is not cheap (for my budget at least) and I want the other people to know what to expect.  </li>
            <li> I do have two small age spots on the face that I have been working on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had laser treatments at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office in the past</li>
            <li> I do my treatments in the morning and apply my makeup as usual.</li>
            <li> I felt that these side effects outweighed the small improvements that I was seeing with my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The medium sized pores shrunk and now look relatively small.</li>
            <li> it make small lines disappear.  </li>
            <li> instruction booklet that comes with the laser has a list of side effects that are common and side effects that are less common.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing as I was very hopeful this product would improve appearance.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> would not recommend and I find it hard to believe it helped anyone</li>
            <li> I have also read where some users have mentioned the after-pain is worse part, but the after-pain feels like...when you put lotion on your skin and it burns a little......</li>
            <li> lately people have been guessing my age from 20-30.</li>
            <li> it takes at least a month for the collagen to recover.</li>
            <li> If I have a complaint</li>
            <li> And go up slowly?</li>
            <li> But start slowly, like you are supposed to, and you DO get used to it, and once you work up to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not experienced excessive dryness as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> And the pick point for such horrible appearance was after two month of stopping the regular usage of the laser.</li>
            <li> At about 25 hours all those bloody little holes turn into little blisters and your skin feels like a lizard that&#x27;s been dried out.</li>
            <li> That one is a little worse...!)</li>
            <li> I was still a little uncomfortable</li>
            <li> All those bad reviews are because people don&#x60;t have enough patience,and expect results in no time,without thinking that it take 30 to 40 years for all that damage to show up .The</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think the pain hurts as bad as a rubber band snapping your skin, like others have said.</li>
            <li> and I think that it is not a good idea to use this laser for people in my age category.</li>
            <li> few misfires (secret: use twice a day if you like!</li>
            <li> By 24 hours it looks like square hickies all over and bloody little pin pricks in every single pore or follicle.</li>
            <li> It was not a pleasant sensation.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I continued to have the redness, dryness, and small bumps.  </li>
            <li> Too painful and causes very dry skin..did not see difference after using for 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> and I am already annoyed about the 25x limit per use..</li>
            <li> However, after using it faithfully every day for 45 days I couldn&#x27;t  see a difference...if anything it has made my wrinkles around my eyes look worse :</li>
            <li> The co promise to replace the broken (dysfunctional) item, but still not...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of people asking \\&quot;What</li>
            <li> but it seems like they are worse.  </li>
            <li> I was getting to the point where I cringed to wear concealor because it looked worse than whatever it was covering up.  </li>
            <li> Seriously the wrong thing to buy.</li>
            <li> I hate the limited use of the product..</li>
            <li> While it IS painful (it feels like snapping rubber bands) on the highest setting, the little vertical lines that ran up from my lips have just about disappeared.  </li>
            <li> After I completely stopped using the laser I started to notice horrible changes under my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little annoying that the unit turns off after 25 pops, but I can see why they do that---probably for people like me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it caused a lot of erythema and dryness</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> however I thought that being a Fraxel laser after all it may not be completely useless</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to doing expensive laser treatments.  </li>
            <li> I feel something weird, but it&#x27;s not pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> Ill be doing either my forehead or those lines that go from my nose to my mouth...eventually both will be done.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am not using all these at once.</li>
            <li> Side effects; shortcomings of the technology; questionable results.</li>
            <li> I can tell that I did something wrong....  </li>
            <li> That being said, the PaloVia can be uncomfortable -</li>
            <li> Considering how EXPENSIVE this item is, the results are unimpressive.</li>
            <li> Because it was so expensive I will continue to use as directed, but if I had it to do over</li>
            <li> I am unable to give a review because i had to return it as it was not for all over the face</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> If you want to share it with anyone else in the family, you too may find the 25 stamp limit is an unhappy feature for you.</li>
            <li> I put a bit of coconut oil on the skin afterwards and it helps with the redness, which is not so bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad you dont sell Restylane and Botox.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> it is mildly painful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what to do..:(</li>
            <li> To go beyond the manufacturers guidelines may result in permanent changes over time that user will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> If your expectations are to use this product vs. treatment with an aesthetician, then you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> To the ones it&#x27;s not working for, I feel bad!</li>
            <li> I hated them -</li>
            <li> I have read that the procedure is very painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hurts but works.  Unfortunately, it caused a lot of erythema and dryness so I could not do it every day.  Wrinkles that I had are gone.</li>
            <li> This is actually my very first product endorsement even though I have bought many products from Amazon.com. I am VERY impressed with this gadget. I thought about going to a spa and having this done professionally but I bought the PaloVia for less and can use it repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;I realize it states for the eye area only and you can only get 25 zaps every 8 hours but what can I say, I&#x27;m a daredevil and live life on the edge ;-} My face has acne scarring from my youth and now that I am 50 something my face looked like a connect-the-dots picture with fine lines connecting all the acne scars. I started zapping all those fine lines and my face looks incredible and the acne holes appear to be less noticeable. The fine lines have almost disappeared after about 2 months of use twice a day. I&#x27;m not even worried about the lines around my eyes anymore.&lt;br /&gt;My frown lines have diminished too. And ladies this is GREAT for the lip area. This is the most painful area on the face though. My lips puckered and plumped up a few hours after I treated them. The lines around the lips are also diminished as well. I do have two small age spots on the face that I have been working on but they have not disappeared yet and maybe they never will.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard that lasers are used for spider veins too so I tried the PaloVia on a couple of them. I would not recommend doing this because they seemed to get larger. The professionals must use a different type of laser for spider veins.&lt;br /&gt;Also I think that the more liberal you are with the gel the better results you get. I can actually hear popping when the gel is thicker and the red after spots are redder so I think the gel intensifies the lasers effects.&lt;br /&gt;After I use this gadget I take the powder from a Hyaluronic Acid capsule mixed with water and rub over my face. Sometimes I also use Retinol cream too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars even though the first PaloVia I received only lasted a week. I don&#x27;t know why but it said, \\&quot;Lose Connection\\&quot; in the screen area. I had to actually go through the hassle of sending it back and waiting on a new one. I still think it&#x27;s worth five stars because of how great I look and feel after two months time. I had a lady guess my age at 45 two days ago. NO KIDDING!&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m not a doctor I would suggest you follow the instructions that come with the product and know that when you deviate from the instructions it as at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE MY PALOVIA!</li>
            <li> It seems to be easy to work to treat some parts of eyes. It is the initial phase before to the medical care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because it does indeed work. Heat is applied onto your skin and it penetrates deep enough that over time you will see results. However there are some dangerous side affects only lightly mentioned by other reviewers. The booklet suggest using once a day on high if you can withstand the pain. There&#x27;s no pain, especially if you&#x27;ve had professional treatments done. However the minutes following the treatment you will be icing yourself. My first use was perfect but the two following I got not \\&quot;red marks\\&quot; but red burns in the shape of the laser head. The following 8 hours the swelling goes down but the redness increases. By 24 hours it looks like square hickies all over and bloody little pin pricks in every single pore or follicle. At about 25 hours all those bloody little holes turn into little blisters and your skin feels like a lizard that&#x27;s been dried out. This is with moisturizer applications about every 20 min. The bars last about 5 days as I tried it again just incase I hadn&#x27;t used enough gel. Here is where there is potential for scaring especially if you hyper pigment easily. To me these risks and unpleasant side affects wasn&#x27;t worth the fact that the product does work. The point was to look better, not worse so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I began using the laser when my husband was away for a week.  He came home, walked in the door, took one look at me and said, \\&quot;Did you get an eye job while I was gone??\\&quot;  This is the man who does not notice when I change my hair color.  A few days later, I got carded for the first time in MANY years when I bought wine.  I&#x27;m done with my first month of daily use and yes, my eye wrinkles are gone.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried this now for about 6 weeks. It has not worked for me - I&#x27;m surprised by all the reviews by people saying it worked - but good for them. I could not tolerate the highest setting, so opted for the lowest to middle setting most of the time. I think there is a immediate improvement that only lasts while the skin is irritated and inflamed- if your skin is all puffy, then yes I suppose you don&#x27;t notice your wrinkles as much. I am 41 and in good shape, with good skin, but have pretty good wrinkles around my eyes. Botox works, but I was interested in this as additional help, and hopefully for those hard to treat under eye wrinkles. Like another reviewer, I did not have people tell me I looked better, only \\&quot; what happened around your eye? \\&quot; - and this was generally on the lowest setting. I will be sending it back. I guess the best thing is that since they offer a 60 day guarantee - you can try for yourself and see if it works for you. I loved the idea, the design, even the little beep as it starts up. But no help at all in the wrinkle department!</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to assess the rating as I have stopped using it when I have gotten too red &amp; dry around the eye area. Seems to work, but have not used this enough to make a formal assessment. Seems like there would be a good result if you used it for a month without a break but I am a little dubious if this is a good long-term treatment for eye wrinkles yet. We shall see.</li>
            <li> This home lazer actually has allowed me to soften my marionette lines, soften a facial scar and most of my other wrinkles have greatly improved as well. I&#x27;m seventy years old and use the lazer where ever I deem a need. I treat my face daily and I&#x27;m considering buying another machine so that I can treat some areas more often. The machine can only deliver 25 &#x27;stamps&#x27; each 8 hours. Each &#x27;stamp&#x27; in a dermatology office costs $2.00, but of cource their machine is more powerful. I paid for Botox injections once and that was an unmitigated disaster. The dermatologist used too much Botox and I ended up looking like a Coon Hound dog for about six weeks. Also, the Botox injections, plus fillers cost 1/3 the cost of a face lift! The smoothing effect of the fillers lasted about six months</li>
            <li> I personally love this little device. Worked far better than a TCA peel I did on my eyes. It has definitely zapped my eyes back at least 10 years. I&#x27;m 38 and lately people have been guessing my age from 20-30. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but no eye cream will give you results even approaching this. To the ones it&#x27;s not working for, I feel bad!</li>
            <li> I tried to post a review , but it ended up as a comment to let&#x27;s be honest, who wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I am 72 years old and my skin had more wrinkles than an old shoe.  I live in the South and I have never used sun block.  Yes, my skin has sun damage.  I bought the laser the end of December 2011.  My wife took close up digital pictures of both my eyes from the front and side.  I said, there&#x27;s no way this little device is going to work.  Boy, was I wrong.  I have been using the laser for almost two months.  When I don&#x27;t smile over 50% of the old wrinkles are now smooth.  When I smile they are still there, but not like before.  You have to remember with only 25 stamps, I can&#x27;t treat the entire area, but it is working.  Slowly, but surely.  Yes, my wife is taking a new set of photos every month.  In six months I&#x27;m going to send them to the company that makes this device.  I&#x27;m going to be their new poster boy for the over 70 crowd.  They&#x27;re missing an entire market.  My wife of 53 years has beautiful skin.  She is even sneaking the PaloVia away from me to experiment.  Oh, one last thing, I am using it twice a day on the high setting.  I&#x27;ll treat one eye in the morning the other eye at night.  The redness lasts about 4 hours and I have never put any kind of a lotion on my skin.  One last note, when I treat my skin I stretch the skin so it is perfectly smooth.  I also push the device into the skin with enough pressure to leave an indentation.  That way I know how far to move down my face for the next stamp.  Next, I&#x27;m going to start treating my forehead, then around my mouth.  I&#x27;ve never been so excited about anything in my life.  I don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t work on some people&#x27;s skin, but it sure works on mine.</li>
            <li> I was going to send this product back since there is no way whatsoever I can go out and look like a zombie with red squares on my face. After I used it as directed for a few days I gave up since I couldn&#x27;t show my face in public and I had to wait for a few days for the redness to subside. So my first reaction was that this was a waste of money.... however I thought that being a Fraxel laser after all it may not be completely useless so I started using it in other ways than around my eyes, like for example on my decollete area where I had a lot of brown spots due to years of sun exposure as well as age I suppose (I&#x27;m 46). I have to admit that I am speechless. All the spots are gone after two weeks of zapping them twice a day. I would have done it even three times a day if I was willing to wake up at 6 am. There is absolutely no problem doing two and even three zaps on one spot - the device doesn&#x27;t have enough power to cause damage, but it definitely has power to remove those brown spots. And that, mr Justice, is worth the money since I&#x27;ve tried for years to get rid of those spots with all sorts of useless creams and serums ... nothing worked but this laser. I also noticed after a month or so that the skin on my chest is also smoother due to so much \\&quot;lasering\\&quot;, so it may be possible that it removes the wrinkles under the eyes as well if you try hard, but I found the redness it causes just not acceptable for my lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for the reviews that claim that the wrinkles disappeared in less than one month (some even after a few days!) please... that doesn&#x27;t make sense . it takes at least a month for the collagen to recover. What you see it&#x27;s just an inflammation... the area is swollen not wrinkle free. This doesn&#x27;t mean the product is not working - it may actually work on wrinkles as well, but there is no way you can see the effects right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am glad there is a fraxel laser available for home use.</li>
            <li> I hate the limited use of the product.. Palovia should have told me this first.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used this one time and I am already annoyed about the 25x limit per use..&lt;br /&gt; My friend and I wanted to share this device and now it is not possible.&lt;br /&gt;What if I want to use on another part of the body...&lt;br /&gt;I want to return.. very agitated..</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews of the PaloVia, I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive mine. However, after using it faithfully every day for 45 days I couldn&#x27;t  see a difference...if anything it has made my wrinkles around my eyes look worse :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 55 and did not expect a miracle, but for the price I paid for it, I  did expect to see minimal results. I&#x27;m sure it worked for some, but didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: if you buy this item on Amazon, it only carries a 30 day money back guarantee, but Amazon customer service was very kind and took it back after the 30 days as a one time courtesy.</li>
            <li> Oh how I wanted this to work, but after three months of using the product as directed I actually look older.  I think in the long run this does more harm than good.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Appears to be working so far! Would recommend it because its easy, quick, pain free (in my opinion anyway) and the texture of my skin appears improved so I look forward to using this product again and again.</li>
            <li> So I bought this about a month ago. I use it almost every day on the medium setting. My face is red for a couple of hours afterwards, so I use it in the evening. At first my skin definitely felt dry, but didn&#x27;t look horrible or anything like that. I can see a big difference now. I have no undereye circles anymore, and the lines around my mouth are practically non existent.   I use it all over my face and can see it working. I didn&#x27;t have super deep lines, this is more for preventing them from getting worse. It has actually worked better than a filler I had done around the mouth. I don&#x27;t know why others are not seeing results. FYI I have fair skin with some freckles and prone (most likely will get soon) rosacea. I&#x27;m not red anymore and it faded a brown spot under my eye so it&#x27;s almost gone. I have little problem with interruptions thus far so I&#x27;m a happy camper :) Maybe my collagen just rebuilds fast I don&#x27;t know but this works for me and I WILL NOT be returning it (unless it happens to break!). I&#x27;m going to decrease useage to a couple of times a week now.</li>
            <li> I can already see results, and it&#x27;s only being two days. Or maybe it&#x27;s the fact that I immediately scrubbed a slice of orange on the treated area, splashed my eyes with ice water to relieve the swelling and redness, or because I followed up with that deja vu eye gel everyone talks about. Will see, I still got 28 days and counting...I hope it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my caribbean complexion. I think I&#x27;ll take some before and after pictures for self comparison. Wish me luck.</li>
            <li> I have had my PaloVia for a year now.  I waited to write a review until I had tried it for a while.&lt;br /&gt; This thing DOES work.  It is better to start using it BEFORE you start getting really deep wrinkles.  I have found that it is helping to keep away the hollowness  &amp; dark circles that were once under my eyes .&lt;br /&gt;Make certain that you use it at night before you go to bed, because YES it WILL leave dark, red marks where you used it &amp; your skin may be a pit puffy.  You WILL need the 7-9 hours so that the marks will be gone before attempting to put on make-up.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t regret purchasing this.  It may seem a little pricey...but ...have you stopped  to calculate how much you are spending on skin creams every year...skin creams that do NOT deliver on their promises?  I do not use those creams anymore.  I only use a moisturizer.  That&#x27;s it.  Much better trade off.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference.  To note, they product will leave your skin red and swollen a bit.  It looks sort of like a sunburn.  No pain no gain.  The laser feels like little snapping rubberbands...no big deal.  The area may look worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> I bought this a month ago for my 35 th birthday. I use it all over my face. It does seem to smooth and tighten. I am graduating just now to the medium setting because it does initially cause redness and it is mildly painful. The red rectangle marks it leaves go away after a few hours though. I plan on using this as an alternative to a fractional laser treatment at the dermatologist. Looking at it that way,it is a good value in the long run. I don&#x27;t like the gel though,it seems to clog my pores do I use as little as possible,just to get a good contact with the skin. If you take the time to make sure you have steady contact with the skin,I don&#x27;t think there is a problem with interruptions. You have to take your time and ensure the blue light stays steadily lit.</li>
            <li> I used this product for several month. It did give me some results with the appearance of fine lines. Some of those lines completely disappeared. But I was not comfortable with the fact that I have to use it for my entire life to keep the result. I am under 40 and I think that it is not a good idea to use this laser for people in my age category. I decided to stop using the laser. After I completely stopped using the laser I started to notice horrible changes under my eyes. The fine lines returned and then started to be prominent wrinkles. And the pick point for such horrible appearance was after two month of stopping the regular usage of the laser. I was so upset that I decided to try this laser. I started to look for something that will help me to recover. I found that micro needling  and copper peptide cream may help. After more than half a year of needling and copper peptide treatments my under eye area seems to recover. If I knew about micro needle and copper peptide before I would never buy this laser. It seems that the laser melts the fat under skin. And after you stop a regular usage, all inflammations are gone and they do not create a volume any more. And additionally some of your fat under skin is also gone. This is why you may end-up with more wrinkles after stopping using laser. If you are considering buying this devise I don&#x27;t tell you don&#x27;t buy it. But keep in mind that you will have to use it forever to keep the result.  If you are under 40, I would recommend to use micro needle and copper peptide instead of this laser.&lt;br /&gt;And of course this devise is not for people under 30 who just start noticing some fine lines. It will not help to keep your under eye skin young for a long time, but will definitely bring some damage.</li>
            <li> Yes, Palovia absolutely worked for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it is not the most relaxing beauty treatment and it does leave the treated area red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on the 11&#x27;s and nsao-labial lines and it ws very effective there too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With summer coming I con&#x27;t want to be restricted about being in the sun so I am putting off further use until the fall and in the meantime getting decent results with a Red Baby Quasar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Palovia really REALLY does work on getting rid of pretty deep lines!</li>
            <li> Tried, don&#x27;t like product because clearly in order to get FDA approval for home use w/o doctor present, then had to dumb down machine so much (compared to professional machines used in Dermotologist offices) that this product is basically worthless:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It only laser burns about 1 cm sq, and you can only do limited number of those in a day.&lt;br /&gt;2) It uses much less intense laser energy compared to machine the doctor has. That&#x27;s a problem because machine is supposed to work by burning skin in grid of holes in certain degree and depth that fresh clean skin fills over the holes.&lt;br /&gt;3) At the doctor&#x27;s office (using totally different professional level machine) they track exactly what areas were done and how much laser burning. So you can an even regeneration of young skin. But you cannot really exercise that kind of control with this silly handheld low energy machine</li>
            <li> I have used the PaloVia laser since the beginning of February. I used it every day on the high setting for 30 days and then used it more than required (almost every day) during the maintenance phase the second month. No results. Returned the laser since it has a company 60 day money back guarantee. I re-bought the laser a month later since I read so many glowing reviews, and really wanted to make sure I gave this thing a fair shot. I didn&#x27;t understand why I didn&#x27;t see any difference at all since so many people were claiming they did. I figured I had nothing to lose since I&#x27;d just return it again if I did not see any changes. So, I started using it again at the end of May, all of June, and now most of July. Again, not one iota of change to any of my fine lines. I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles and I used the laser faithfully every day. I used it on my fine lines around my eyes and on my upper lip area to see if it would help the small vertical lines there. I used it every evening on my face and every morning on my stomach. I wanted to see if it would work on my stomach stretch marks. Nope, no such luck. Don&#x27;t believe all the reviews that are obviously by company hires to tout the product. First, collagen does take time to rebuild so can you really believe anyone saying they see results in a week or two? The great thing is that the ridiculous reviews claiming such great results can easily be disproved. If you are want to try it yourself, feel free. You have 60 days to return it and anyone with any sense will not keep something for $500 that does not work. Alas, my second one is going back tomorrow. I think six months is plenty of time for new collagen to grow and I guess mine didn&#x27;t want to grow. I&#x27;ll update if something magical happens in the next few months and my husband asks me what did I do to all of a sudden look so vibrant and young! The only comments I&#x27;ve received is \\&quot;What is wrong with your face, you have a bunch of red marks.\\&quot;  And FYI - the redness and dryness are a problem to hide. The red welts did not go away by morning for me and while makeup helped to hide them, they never went away completely since I used the laser every day. I tried many, many products to help in this area: aloe, morrocan oil, Curel extra dry healing lotion, arnica gel, etc. No matter what, it takes at least two full days after stopping using the laser for the redness to disappear.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes a while to see results.  Not one or two weeks, but a few months.  I&#x27;ve been using mine since mid-June 2011.  Thirty days - every evening - a couple of weeks off.  In between I use a good microdermabrasion exfolliant and/or my microdermabrasion machine.  While it IS painful (it feels like snapping rubber bands) on the highest setting, the little vertical lines that ran up from my lips have just about disappeared.  The fine lines around my eyes are almost gone too.  The deeper ones are still there, but less noticeable. Even the \\&quot;11\\&quot; lines in between my eyebrows have softened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand I&#x27;m not using the machine to &#x60;manufacturers&#x27; specifications&#x27; but I am very pleased with the results.  The redness/dryness is at times difficult to cover even with great makeup and moisturizers, but I feel in the long run the &#x60;down time&#x27; is so worth it.  It really is getting rid of fine lines, and at almost 53 years of age, I cannot ask for more from an in-home device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU PALOVIA!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 02-13-2014&lt;br /&gt;been using this on and off since I received in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;the lines under and around my eyes are almost non existent, as are the lines around my mouth.  it still works very well, few misfires (secret: use twice a day if you like! i sometimes do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yes, there is still some pain, there is still redness and puffiness after use, this goes away, and my skin is smooth. if I can keep using this machine and looking like I do I will be happy! love it!</li>
            <li> Because I had to travel, the time to return it expired so, I kept it. But, after 3 months, I see some improvement but not a big thing!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to doing expensive laser treatments.  What I don&#x27;t like about it is that it does leave red scaley patches where I use it on my face.  I am sure that this is what it does, but for  me, I don&#x27;t enjoy going around with red marks (especially rectangular-shaped).  I am very fair skinned so it is quite noticeable.</li>
            <li> I got this about two years ago, used a couple of times. I didn&#x27;t see effect since I didn&#x27;t keep using it. I put aside and traveleda lot so totally forget it. Recently I started to use it gain, for some reason it&#x27;s AWAYS interrupted and I cannot finished 25 times. I DO follow the instruction. After trying a couple of days, I realized it&#x27;s just the quality problem. I contacted seller for return, because it&#x27;s too old, it&#x27;s not returnable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The totally amount I used it is up to 8 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend hundreds bucks on this kind of crap.</li>
            <li> Have had it for about 6 months and now use it twice a week. There is definitely a difference. I put a bit of coconut oil on the skin afterwards and it helps with the redness, which is not so bad.</li>
            <li> The co promise to replace the broken (dysfunctional) item, but still not...Having problems to communicate with PaloVia.. Don&#x27;t know what to do..:(</li>
            <li> got my paloVia skin renewing laser at a fast shipment, love the way it gives resaults, Im a very happy customer and will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first Amazon review; I thought I need to write it. This stuff is not cheap (for my budget at least) and I want the other people to know what to expect.  I read tons of reviews regarding this product; not only on Amazon, but also on different beauty-related forums. Based on them I really thought that the following morning I would look like a monster. That&#x27;s why I decided to do the procedure Friday evening, so my face would have 2 days (till Monday) to recover. But actually it was fine. Right after the procedure the area under my eyes looked sunburned, but I didn&#x27;t have any marks not on my cheeks, not on my forehead. The redness around my eyes had completely gone by the following morning.  I&#x27;m 28 for now. My skin is not in the best shape, since I was visiting tanning salon twice a week for last eight years (yes, you do look attractive with your \\&quot;gorgeous tan\\&quot; but tanning does damage your skin a lot, unfortunately :-( ). But at the same time I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles. I have fine lines under my eyes (especially when I&#x27;m smiling), have \\&quot;smile lines\\&quot; - one on each side of my lips, and I have two 1/2 inch horizontal lines on my forehead. 25 shots are more then enough for what I have. But I wanted to let you know that the laser window is tiny (somewhat around 10mm x 5mm) and for those who has a lot of wrinkles, especially horizontal lines trough the forehead, 25 shots are really nothing. Good news is that you din&#x27;t need to use it just once a day, and 25 shots are available every 8 hours, so you could just finish treating your face in the morning.  I have read that the procedure is very painful. Well, maybe I&#x27;m too tolerate to the pain, but I don&#x27;t feel that way. I feel something weird, but it&#x27;s not pain. Have you ever done microniddeling? The derma roller is 10 times more painful, then this laser.  I have been using PaloVia just for two days, so it&#x27;s quite early to speak about any visible results. I does dry my skin a lot (I apply few moisturizers, but it doesn&#x27;t help). But I hope it worth it.  I will update 2 month later. I hope I will get some results.  P.S.: according to the instruction, you shouldn&#x27;t use laser &amp; tanning bed at the same time period, because you could end up with hyper-pigmentation under your eyes.    UPD September 8th, 2013: It has been two weeks since I started using my Palovia. As for now, I&#x27;m very happy. The first small wrinkles disappeared on the fourth day. After two weeks of using it fine lines around my eyes don&#x27;t exist any more. I used x15 mirrow to find then. None!!! Deep wrinkles running from the corners of eyes down to cheeks are still there, but much shorter. Those which were around 2cm are just 0.5cm. I hope they will disappear completely by the end of 30-days treatment period. I wrote before that by the morning the redness was gone. Well, it&#x27;s not like that any more. From day to day zone around your eyes looks worse and worse: more red and very puffy. I&#x27;m tired of people asking \\&quot;What happened to you? You didn&#x27;t have enough sleep? Did you oversleep? etc...\\&quot;  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;s see any progress on the smile lines around my mouth, but since this machine was made just for eye area, it&#x27;s Ok, I guess. And, for sure, this machine will not give you any face-lift - it&#x27;s not what it was made for. I will update by the end of 30-days period.    UPD September 22nd, 2013  It has been 30 days since I started using my Palovia! Wrinkles under my left eye disappeared, but under my right eye I still have a half of one wrinkle left. Why is that? Zones under my left eye looked exactly the same as zone under my right eye before the treatment and I treated them the same way. Hm... It&#x27;s weird. To be fare with you, I&#x27;m totally amazed and satisfied with the result. The sad thing is that I don&#x27;t see any improvements on the smile lines around my mouth. I know, that Palovia is just for eye zone, but I had some  hopes (or dreams). I decided to keep going with day-to-day treatment for 30 more days to delete thathalf of wrinkle I have left and I still hope to see improvements around my mouth.  Other good news is that I spent just 50% of treatment gel in 30 days which is pretty amazing since it&#x27;s not that cheap.  Happy with my results. I will update by the end of 60-days period.    UPS October 16th, 2014  I have not been using Palovia since April (I was tanning &amp; didn&#x27;t want to get brown spots - you cannot tan &amp; use the machine during the same period of time). I did get some sun damage since I was tanning a lot, an some fine lines with that (I didn&#x27;t take care of my face at all), but I&#x27;m happy to admit, that my face didn&#x27;t get to the point it was before Palovia treatments, I mean even after all the damage I&#x27;ve done to my face during last 6 months (by tanning a lot, not taking care of my skin and not using Palovia), it&#x27;s still 70% better than it was before I opened Palovia for myself. I consider it to be a great result.  I want to have 60 days Palovia-course in the nearest future to restore my skin after summer.    Overall, I do like Palovia and I think it worth buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year and the results are great. The bags/circles under my eyes are almost gone, and it also removed the dark spots on my skin from sun damage.  Right now the only problem I have is with the pre-treatment gel.  The bottle of PaloVia Pre-Treatment Gel that came with my original PaloVia unit is still half full, but I can&#x27;t get any more gel to come out of the bottle. The platform that pushes the gel up to the dispenser suction tube will not move any higher, no matter how may times the plunger is pushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions? I hate to pay $30 for a new bottle, when this bottle is still half full.</li>
            <li> So, I purchased the palovia about a month ago.  I first only used it around the eyes.  It made a huge difference. Very similar effects of Restyline filler I had done twice in 3 years.  I was left with a bump from too much filler under one eye.  Even that has improved and is not there anymore.  I now have been using it on my forehead.  this little machine is amazing.  The forehead lines are nearly gone.  I am suprised at the current price as i paid $302.00.  I gave only 4 stars because of the 25 zap limit and the small laser head BUT it still has worked wonders!</li>
            <li> This waste of money product was just that. Takes up space and does not do anything. After 3 months of stinging my face and watching my wife do the same.... She put it down and never used it again. If you would like to buy this one i will sell it for cheap. Seriously the wrong thing to buy.</li>
            <li> First of all, I will admit that I am a total cosmetics junkie. The newest eye cream? I&#x27;ve got to have it. Newest wrinkle cream? Same. Newest this, newest that? Yes and Yes.&lt;br /&gt;So when I heard about PaloVia, you guessed it, I had to have it. But, I was suspicious...I had had laser done professionally and found it really painful and the down time was pretty serious (my skin is pretty fair). And it sort-of worked, I just couldn&#x27;t bear going more than a few times. But with the PaloVia, I would have more control.&lt;br /&gt;So you would think I would start out gently, right? And go up slowly? Right? NO! Of course not. I started at the highest level, and---well, it was too high. It was not a pleasant sensation. In fact, I may be a total wimp, but at first, it hurt! But start slowly, like you are supposed to, and you DO get used to it, and once you work up to it it&#x27;s not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;Once I took my time and got up to the highest level(within a couple of weeks), I really got used to the sensation around my eyes (the upper lip? That one is a little worse...!) But my crow&#x27;s feet, honestly, were fading. This thing was actually working! I could hardly believe it. To be fair, my crow&#x27;s feet were not extremely deep, but I saw a VERY noticeable difference. It really works.&lt;br /&gt;The day after I use it the skin around my eyes is usually slightly red, and very dry, so I use a very moisturizing eye cream (like Creme Ancienne by Fresh) and that usually does it.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little annoying that the unit turns off after 25 pops, but I can see why they do that---probably for people like me. If they didn&#x27;t stop it somewhere, my whole head would just be a smoking stump.&lt;br /&gt;They have a great return policy, so try it! If it doesn&#x27;t work for you, send it back. But wow---it really has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old fair (Irish, German) woman who, since the age of 35 have been doing botox and fillers to maintain. One of my biggest complaints has been how the botox does not last long enough in the areas my doctor does to help minimize eye wrinkles. Overall my skin has some  (dark spots) I tend to get freckles, and have some skin damage from my 20&#x27;s, and mild adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a non smoker, wear sunscreen but you know ladies, those eye wrinkles pop up and really show your age. I have been using the Palovia laser since Oct 30th, and oh boy! I love it so far, I find it great even though I will not see complete results for a few more weeks yet, but I notice from the beginning use that that my eye serum really absorbs well when I apply it right after use. Also the minimal inflammation that does happen, which is temporary, and it actually makes me look better. I know the manufacturer recommends using it at night, which is great, I have used it in the morning before work and covered up the minimal redness that can happen with BB cream, and concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on the maximum setting and do one treatment every 24hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will write another review after the 30 days, but so fair it has been promising! I am please with my purchase so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the laser for 1 month.  I&#x27;ve had laser treatments at a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office in the past and it&#x27;s the same exact treatment.  The only difference is that the laser screen is smaller which means it doesn&#x27;t cover as much space during the treatment but it definitely works.  However, at this time I can&#x27;t really say that my wrinkles have dramatically diminished BUT I know that it&#x27;s going to take more time--but I&#x27;m getting up there in age too!  I&#x27;m a 53 year old woman &amp; I&#x27;ve thankfully been blessed with good skin, but I&#x27;m at the age where my wrinkles show more.  I took pictures the day that I started the treatments but I&#x27;m not going to compare anything for one more month...to give it a fair shot.  As I said, I&#x27;ve had this done at an office and paid a LOT more money than the price of this laser and they even told me it would take a couple of months to show results. Nordstrom&#x27;s sells the laser for $500.00 and I got mine for $350.00 on Amazon...that&#x27;s a HUGE difference so I&#x27;m especially happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I would change about the laser is to make it with a larger screen and so that you can use more than 25 \\&quot;zaps\\&quot; at a time because after 25 the laser shuts down for 8 hours.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s due to safety reasons so that people don&#x27;t overdo it because it does make your face red and basically feels like it&#x27;s slowly burning the top layer of skin away. I also wish you could make the laser work on the nose area because I&#x27;d like to shrink my pores (assuming it does).  BTW, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all...just little stings but nothing that makes you squirm unless you&#x27;re a sissy. haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited because I know my skin is eventually going to look much nicer as I can already tell a difference...just not full blown yet.  I&#x27;m THRILLED that Phillips has developed this technology so that we can use it at home.  Now we need other cool items like this to use at home because women buy this stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone out there know of other new technology for in-home use?</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a treat for myself, after hearing Dr Oz talk about it and doing research on the web. I was optimistic but not hopeful. Well, I tried it and within 7 days I saw a noticeable difference and 3 weeks later I have virtually no crows feet. I am almost 52, and do have very good skin. I was getting crows feet although they were noticeable they were not deep. Well, they are gone now. I had the laser set on the medium setting, but it made my skin look just a little bit sunburned (no pain and not that noticeable but I did not like it) so I use the laser on low, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I finish the first month, and to into twice weekly maintenance mode, then a girlfriend who has deep wrinkles is going to use it. We will report back on her results.</li>
            <li> This machine is doing what it says it will do.  After first treatment, I saw a difference which has continued.</li>
            <li> It kind of scared me. I didn&#x27;t feel it at all when I tested it on my arm, but then when I used it on my face, I thought I was going to knock myself out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t tell where I had done it, so I may gone over some spots. It left stamp marks. I didn&#x27;t want to damage my skin, so I returned it. No problem at all with the return. Got a credit right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this will work for others, but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> All the hype is true! Have had this product about three weeks. Using it at medium setting. Already seeing softer lines. A larger sun spot on my cheek has nearly disappeared which has pretty much paid for the product already! As a bonus, I believe I may have gotten the best price in the universe! :)</li>
            <li> I used it for a few weeks and my skin became slightly irritated, as the brochure said it woul, as skin sloughs off.  The problem is that I don&#x27;t see any difference yet even though I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have definately noticed some improvement with my crows feet. Over the years I have not taken very good care of my skin and I&#x27;m beginning to notice the repercussions.  The lines are still there but there is a noticeable improvement and I just started my third week. Theres is some redness in the area aroumd the eyes where the treatment is applied. my husband said i look like someone who just got punched in both eyes (not the black and blue look just the redness of coarse). I do my treatments in the morning and apply my makeup as usual. i cam still see a little redness theough the makeup but its usually faded enough by the time I get to work and no one has ever noticed it.  I&#x27;ve read that people use this on areas othe than just around the eyes with noticable improvements. Although this device is not approved for that I am still going to try. Ill be doing either my forehead or those lines that go from my nose to my mouth...eventually both will be done. So far I recommend this product. I don&#x27;t think it can erase every problem  but it does help. I wouldn&#x27;t  expect anything to magically produce a brand new set of skin for my face, although it would be nice to be able to start over knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old with mild wrinkles/creases under my eyes.  I do not have crow&#x27;s feet.  I went to a dermatologist who does Botox and lasering around the eyes and he thought that my wrinkling was not bad enough yet to have any procedures done.  So, I did some research and decided to try the Palovia. Here is a summary of my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation of Device/Side Effects:&lt;br /&gt;The device is easy to use and operate. Instructions are clear and the daily procedure takes only about 3-4 minutes a day.  The laser zaps can be painful at first, especially for the first week. There is a stinging, burning sensation, almost like when you are stung by a bee. However, you do get used to it pretty quickly and it really doesn&#x27;t hurt after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  instruction booklet that comes with the laser has a list of side effects that are common and side effects that are less common.  According to the booklet, most people get mild redness that is gone by the following morning and dryness.  Unfortunately, my under eyes were noticeably red and the redness did not go away until the end of the next day, when it was time to use the laser again.  So, my under eyes were continually red and I had to keep covering it up with makeup. In addition, my under eyes were very dry, which tended to enhance the wrinkling under my eyes and made it hard to apply concealer to cover the redness. Two uncommon side effects that I experienced were small bumps/swelling under my eyes and pinpoint bleeding (at times).  Using the laser every day did not allow enough time for these side effects to go away, so my eyes were looking pretty bad. But, I wanted to keep using the laser to see if I could get some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;After 30 days of daily use, I did see a small improvement in the under eye wrinkles that I was treating. They looked slightly less pronounced.  I then switched to the 2 times a week a schedule as recommended by the instruction booklet.  Unfortunately, I continued to have the redness, dryness, and small bumps.  I felt that these side effects outweighed the small improvements that I was seeing with my wrinkles.  Although I was starting to see some improvement with the creases/wrinkles that I was targeting, my under eye area was generally looking worse on a day to day basis because it was red, dry, and had strange little bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover,the instructions state that you will need to keep using the laser 2 times a week to continue seeing wrinkle improvement. If I were to do this, my under eyes would continually be red, dry, bumpy, etc. So, I ultimately decided to return the device.  Bottom Line: The improvement that I was seeing was not worth the cosmetic unsightliness caused by the side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****A Warning Regarding Returns for this Item*****&lt;br /&gt;The Palovia website states that \\&quot;If you decide you do not want to keep the PaloVia laser for any reason within 60 days of your purchase, simply return it to the location where you purchased it for a full refund.\\&quot;  Palovia.com claims that if you get it at an authorized retailer, that this is the return policy. Amazon is listed as an authorized retailer. So, when I saw the Palovia on Amazon at a good price, I thought what do I have to lose? However, you should be aware that Amazon does not generally appear to honor this policy.  The return window for my Palovia closed at 30 days, which is the usual return period for Amazon products.  I wrote to and called customer service and they did allow me to return my Palovia.  But, they basically said \\&quot;our return policy is 30 days but we will make a one time exception for you due to the confusion\\&quot;.  When I told the representative from Amazon what the Palovia website said he said that I should call Palovia about the 60 day guarantee.  However, Palovia tells you to return it to the retailer and that the retailer should honor the 60 day guarantee.  Ultimately, I was able to return it. But, it took some effort and I thought I would warn others about this.</li>
            <li> Too painful and causes very dry skin..did not see difference after using for 3 weeks.  Just redness and dry skin. Sent it back</li>
            <li> After reading the review on Amazon I was concerned about the one review regarding Fraxel and fat loss on the face.  This laser is a &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; version of Fraxel technology.  It does work.  The fine lines around my eyes are diminished.  I have had botox in the past and would say I currently don&#x27;t need it again (I am 51).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience the redness and dry skin side effects but I simply took a 2-3 day break and put EMU oil on the areas.  It cleared up quickly and I was able to attend functions with regular makeup.  Then I would go back to laser treatments.  I stopped at 30 days and am on the maintenance plan.  I am now trying it on the lines between eyebrows, and nasal folds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because people won&#x27;t follow the manufacturers guidelines and will overuse the device.  Check out realself.com for the ratings on Fraxel.  57% like it.  At least 30% experienced fat loss and are very disappointed with their Fraxel treatment.  I believe the manufacturer states 30 days consecutively and the a 2-3 day maintenance plan to prevent fat loss.  To go beyond the manufacturers guidelines may result in permanent changes over time that user will be disappointed.  Perhaps after a six month break you could do another 30 day treatment.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this laser more than a year ago,and I can really say that it works better than anything else to remove wrinkles and sun damage from the skin.All those bad reviews are because people don&#x60;t have enough patience,and expect results in no time,without thinking that it take 30 to 40 years for all that damage to show up .The results around the eyes are remarkable ,difference is so noticeable.It will  take more time on the face,since the skin is much ticker. The reason I&#x60;m writing this review is to say loud THIS WORKS.Good luck and be patient.</li>
            <li> I faithfully used this machine but the only result I received was skin redness that would not go away.  Sorry, I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004HCPZ0C PaloVia Skin Renewing Laser]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this item from Amazon because Palovia has a policy that you can get a full refund within 60 days of purchase price from authorized dealers.  I verified Amazon was an authorized dealer on Palovia&#x27;s website and went ahead and ordered.  I was still a little uncomfortable so I contacted Amazon.  Amazon&#x27;s reply was that they only honor their return policy.  I then contacted Palovia.  Long story short, AMAZON DOES NOT HONOR THE 60 DAY RETURN POLICY!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this and had mixed feelings. Mostly because I over-used it and kind of burned my face..thats why they have different strengths and only allow you 25 stamps, but I was using it twice daily on high every day. So I have decided to use it everyother day one time on high. I am also using the red LED vibrating derma roller, a LED red light therapy lamp and a Trinity Nu Face microcurrent system. I am VERY impressed with the Trinity. My skin is not very wrinkled or discolored, but I am in an attack mode to keep the wrinkles and sags at bay. I also use microdermabrasion occasionally and also bought some gel form skin peeling acids. Needless to say I am not using all these at once. I rotate them.&lt;br /&gt;  I think the led derma roller, PaloVia and Trinity are gonna be very helpful in aiding me to achieve my goals. I love Amazon. You have it all and everything I order arrives in a timely fashion and I am very pleased. Too bad you dont sell Restylane and Botox. I am a big do it yourselfer.</li>
            <li> I used the PaloVia faithfully and precisely as directed for one month. I don&#x27;t see any change in the areas treated: forehead and smile lines mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While a treatment takes little time, the flat treatment area doesn&#x27;t fit many areas of the face. I could find few flat places along the most prominent wrinkles around my eyes and this is the area claims are based upon. This is a significant problem with the technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. I tried the machine on medium first for a day or two and then went to the highest setting. The redness went away during the first week; afterwards, even after overnight, the redness remained and the skin became increasingly dry, supposedly as a new layer of skin is being uncovered. Covering this up with makeup became more and more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I had seen results, I&#x27;m not sure I would be willing to accept the side effects of the treatment. Perhaps if a person didn&#x27;t need to leave the house . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Gel lasts a long time; ease of use; short length of each treatment.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Side effects; shortcomings of the technology; questionable results.</li>
            <li> I have been using the PaloVia Skin Renewing Laser for over a year now.  I have to say that it has worked wonders for me.  I have recommended it to everyone.  My mother purchased it and a neighbor purchased it.  The neighbor returned it, and my mother only sporadically uses it, although I definately see a difference in her skin.  So, it would appear that in this instance the same device really can be a 5-star for one person and a 1-star for another.  The redness and dry skin are true.  I do the area around my eyes 1x per week.  I do it in the evening and will have redness and puffiness all day the next day.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t be as severe if I used a lower setting, but I use the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting for everything.  That works ok for me because I work from home one day per week, so I simply do it the evening before, have red eyes all day while working at home and am ready to go out in public the next day.  I can see how that would be a deal breaker for some people.  What are the benefits, then?  Well, I am 46 years old and have no lines, not even fine ones around my eyes.  I also don&#x27;t have the permanent dark circles that appear as we get older and cannot be gotten rid of using any cream out there, no matter what they say.  I have quit using fillers such as Restylane and Botox which I used religiously 2x/year every year from age 40 until I purchased the PaloVia.  I largely alleviate the dryness by heavily applying moisurizer around the eyes every day, but it is still dryer than if I had not used the laser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the PaloVia is only approved for use around the eyes, I use it on my entire face.  Again, I see a significant difference.  My nasal labial folds are insignificant (again, bye-bye Restylane and Botox) as a result of using the laser.  The drawback of using this device on the entire face, however, is that you only get 25 precious, precious zaps every 8 hours.  The laser window is a small area, so you can&#x27;t cover alot of ground in any particular session, so it works best to come up with a routine.  Monday - this area, Tuesday - this area, etc.  The redness on the rest of the face is not as significant or as long lasting as that which appears around the eyes.  As I type this, I just did an area on my neck which I expect will be red for about the next hour at which point it will fade to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try to use the PaloVia without the gel.  When I&#x27;ve tried that, I have had red marks on my face from the laser that lasted significantly longer than they would otherwise.  The gel actually lasts a pretty long time.  I use the PaloVia religiously 1-2 times daily and a single container of gel may last for ?6 months? ... I&#x27;m not certain, but it seems like forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that does drive me nuts is that you get 25 zaps every 8 hours.  If you don&#x27;t hold the PaloVia and your head completely still it will abort the zap, and no, you don&#x27;t get that zap back.  I can have a session in which 5 out of 25 of the zaps will abort and my family can hear me screaming in frustration.  1/2 of those times I can tell that I did something wrong....  moved my head, moved the Palovia... and some areas are just harder to get good contact due to the contours of the face.  It needs to be something that you are willing to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So&lt;br /&gt;minuses are: redness, dryness, aborted zaps, limited zaps&lt;br /&gt;pluses are:  the best home skin care product available, convenient, easy to use, exceptional price given what fillers, Botox, professional treatments cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Definitely see results, but it is painful, you really have to be able to bite the bullet so to speak.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that you can only get 25 TINY stamps in any 8 hr. period of time.  My sister and I pooled our money but 25 stamps are not enough for both of us.  We sent it back.  If you want to share it with anyone else in the family, you too may find the 25 stamp limit is an unhappy feature for you. They don&#x27;t tell you about this before you get it home.</li>
            <li> I have not come to a full conclusion after 30 days of use.  I used the high intensity level and used the treament around my eyes everyday for 30 days.  My skin is red, slightly swollen, dry, bumpy, and a few small pimples.  I understand this is normal but even layering make-up wont cover the redness.  I know I have a 30 money back gurantee.  I was hoping to use the product for 60 to really get an idea if it will make a difference, but if this is the normal condition of my skin using this product, this wont work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Botox and filler is a better choice and will prevent further wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great results with this device so far and have experienced no unexpected issues and I see progress with each treatment. I don&#x27;t have the crows feet so much as horizontal &#x27;crinkle&#x27; smile lines where the top of my cheek meets the orbit of my eye.  I don&#x27;t use the unit on any other part of my face or body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend to those that are thinking of purchasing this unit but are feeling some anxiety or reservations about it, that they first go to a dermatologist to get a consultation and at least one professional ProFractional treatment to see how it actually feels and how your skin responds to the treatment.  I&#x27;ve had professional Fraxcel and ProFractional sessions - they can hurt quite a bit (even though a topical anesthetic was applied to my skin a good 1/2 hr before the actual treatment) and each time my eyes were pretty swollen, a little bruised and crusty for 2-3 days afterwards. However, once I healed I had no issues with excessive dryness, hyperpigmentation or bumps that have been reported by other reviewers.  For me, the PaloVia is such a great alternative because even though I experience the same after effects as with the pro treatments, they&#x27;re so much milder - I don&#x27;t have hide in my house for days after a treatment.  That being said, the PaloVia can be uncomfortable - I use the high setting and it is no picnic, the rubber-band snapping analogy is spot on. But icing helps so much -  I cannot recommend enough that you ice your eyes right after treatment for a good 15 minutes, applying a slight pressure to discourage swelling, and it also helps the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone will respond the same to cosmetic treatments, be it the Palovia or anything else.  I myself have had my skin ruined with hyperpigmentation by hydroquinone, while friends of mine swear by it and have had no problems - hyperpigmentation is a risk with almost any invasive skin treatment and an adverse reaction is a risk that anyone undergoing treatmentslike should be prepared assume. If I had one criticism, I do think PaloVia should include some sort of caution in the literature that comes with the unit regarding possible adverse reactions. It&#x27;s easy to get the impression from the literature included with the unit that using PaloVia is worry-free and super easy to do, and that&#x27;s not necessarily the case.</li>
            <li> I use it as a min facial tool. I also bought NuFace Microcurrent Toner. They both are good. I want it has more variance speed choices.</li>
            <li> I got it and all I saw is discolaration around the area where I used. I suggest to  leave this to your dermatologist</li>
            <li> it works very well.  I have used it all over my face for nearly two years. My skin has improved significantly. Smoother, tighter with less visible pores. Also performs miracles on the occasional zit.  Hurts a tiny bit when i zap but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I was excited initially but then began to have red marks on my skin and the treatment was more painful each day. And I really do not see any results. Would not recommend for these reasons.</li>
            <li> I have had laser treatments done by a doctor, and yes - this is the same technology; HOWEVER, the marks made by the professional treatment went away after about 1 week (it&#x27;s been about 3weeks since I quit using the Palovia and the marks are just now going away).  I am glad that this laser works for some people - laser treatments at the medspa are very, very expensive.  For me, the redness is too much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, Amazon was wonderful about returning the product - they e-mailed me a pre-paid label for the return within a matter of minutes and they credited my charge card within a few days.</li>
            <li> Considering how EXPENSIVE this item is, the results are unimpressive. I&#x27;ve been using it just over 3 months and I can&#x27;t tell any big difference in the appearance of my wrinkles, fine or otherwise. I have very fair, oily skin and am in my late 30s. The laser leaves red marks that last several hours, but it has not made any permanent discoloration to my skin. I use it before I go to bed and the red is gone or barely noticeable when I wake up. Because it was so expensive I will continue to use as directed, but if I had it to do over I would not buy this item.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these hoping to use it on other ares of my face after reading so many good reviews, but I used it for maybe 4 months and finally gave up and now they are nothing but a thousand dollars worth of dust collectors.&lt;br /&gt;I think they actually make you look worse in the long run. I was hoping  in the beginning it was just the old skin drying up and I&#x27;d shed that. and have nice smooth skin underneath, but no such luck. My lines looked deeper and it took months before they went back to the original appearance. I was worried my skin was going to stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;And I didn&#x27;t think about it when I bought them, but you are then married to these and if they break you have to buy another which was not cheap. And now they have been discontinued so what will you do after it breaks?&lt;br /&gt;I should have thought this one out better but I got caught up in the hype on their Facebook page. I also tried a red light therapy unit and then an RF machine. None of it worked and I don&#x27;t like the shocks either you get with some of those devices. My eyes began flickering like a bad neon light was on after using the RF machine for a while and it scared the hell out of me. I was diligent with one of those too and it didn&#x27;t do much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am trying a Dermaroller as a last resort. At least it has some real science behind it, so we shall see, not to mention they are dirt cheap in comparison.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks.  I use it on the High setting.  I have noticed more discomfort as I use it.  It could be because the &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; skin is peeling away.  I have noticed the wrinkles are smoother.  I use it at night, then follow with an aloe vera moiturizer with lidocaine.  In the morning I use a dead sea peel to take away the dry skin.  It may take awhile but I do see some improvement.  I would give it more stars but it is still too early to tell.  It is worth a try considering the price of some  &amp;#34;anti aging&amp;#34; creams etc...</li>
            <li> This was a worthy purchase! I use it in conjunction with fraxel from derm. Works great under eyes. Still have lines but what do you want at 44years old! Lol After the 30days all the under eye crepiness was gone and lines were much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> After one month of daily use, I did not see any difference in the lines around my eyes. Very disappointing as I was very hopeful this product would improve appearance.</li>
            <li> I am almost a month in to my daily treatments.  I do see some improvement with the texture of the skin on my face and orbit areas, but really no dimishing of the eye wrinkles.  If your expectations are to use this product vs. treatment with an aesthetician, then you will be disappointed.  However, if  you want only minor improvements, then give this a try.</li>
            <li> I did a test patch on my arm on the highest level, got itchy welts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried it under my eyes on two consecutive nights on the lowest setting, was red and swollen for a few days afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin must too sensitive for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned it without hassel</li>
            <li> I am 28 y.o., and don&#x27;t tan/sunbath. I am very light complected (think Ann Hathaway). I am using this for lines underneath my eyes and between my brows. I have also  used it for crowsfeet, enlarged pores, and some tiny acne scars, but with less success. Anyway, here are some tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR PAIN AND REDNESS&lt;br /&gt;1. Take an aspirin beforehand. This will help with pain and swelling.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use ice afterward. This will also help with pain and swelling, not to mention it will decrease the appearance of redness.&lt;br /&gt;3. Instead of washing the gel that comes with the PaloVia off your face, leave it on overnight, or put on Vaseline instead if you&#x27;ve run out of gel.&lt;br /&gt;3. Start out using the lowest setting. You can gradually work your way up each week.&lt;br /&gt;4. Take a break from it on weekends or every few days to allow the redness to subside and allow the sandpaper-y texture from the PaloVia laser to naturally exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;5. Gradually, your skin will start to produce more collagen, and the redness won&#x27;t last as long as it did when you started.&lt;br /&gt;6. Also, the more collagen you have in your skin, the less pain you will feel, and vice versa. This is why it hurts worse around the eyes and wrinkles, because you have less collagen in those spots, than say, your chin, which naturally has more collagen.  Use the PaloVia, and it will help build up more collagen, and as you do that, the pain will gradually start to get easier.&lt;br /&gt;7. As for covering the redness, I used L&#x27;Oreal True Match Crayon Concealer, as it covers much better than liquid concealer (seriously, I will never go back to liquid concealer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THOUGHTS&lt;br /&gt;The laser WILL cause redness. It will be in the shape of a square, about 1 cm x .5 cm in size. By the next day the area of your skin that was red will feel like fine sand paper. When I follow the steps above, I can use this when I get home in the evening, and have little to no redness by the next morning, and apply concealer where I do. I personally don&#x27;t think the pain hurts as bad as a rubber band snapping your skin, like others have said. I have also read where some users have mentioned the after-pain is worse part, but the after-pain feels like...when you put lotion on your skin and it burns a little......except it only burns on the treated spots (which are small anyway, since you can only use 25 stamps in one session). IMHO I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad. If it were my entire face, that would be another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;I used the PaloVia for 1 month straight, and gradually scaled off after that. The PaloVia helped minimalize the mildly deep wrinkles between my brow and the lines on top of my cheekbones from smashing my face into my pillow at night (I sleep on my side). You can hardly see them now unless you are in the right lighting. I used it on some enlarged pores and 2 acne scars that I have, will little to no luck, but I may have needed to use it longer for pesky spots like those. If anyone out there is looking to get rid of enlarged pores, I recommend having a salicylic acid peel done (by a professional). Also, the PaloVia did not seem to work on any of my fine lines, but again, I may have needed to use the PaloVia for a longer period of time to get results for that. This machine does not appear to work for dark marks either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a year since I did a full month of the PaloVia, and though the wrinkles between my brows came back some, they still aren&#x27;t anywhere as noticeable as they once were. I think probably once a year I am going to have to use the PaloVia for maintenance on my wrinkles. Also, some of you may think you are seeing results, but it&#x27;s just the inflammation from the laser &#x27;puffing up\\&quot; your wrinkle, making it appear to be gone. You actually have to use it for a month or two to see some results. Some of you may have to use it even longer than that for results.r&#x27; as well as some medium-sized pores that had potential to eventually become large-sized pores (PS- I also used isopropyl alcohol afterwards to help it along). The medium sized pores shrunk and now look relatively small. Unfortunately, the cluster still looks the same, though not quite as deep. I suspect they don&#x27;t look as deep because of the dryness the PaloVia can cause, plus the use of the rubbing alcohol on my skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make a difference in my skin at all. I&#x27;m 57 and had high hopes it would smooth out some of the fine lines but it seems like they are worse.  would not recommend and I find it hard to believe it helped anyone</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this. it make small lines disappear.  It is a great product which does the same as a laser at the doctor&#x27;s office. Why spend more ?  Do this and you will see that this surpasses a doctor&#x27;s visit.</li>
            <li> Great results. My only issue is it leaves little brown marks, but it goes away quick. Do your eyes at night, so it isn&#x27;t as red in the morning. I have noticed a huge difference in my lids as well as under eyes looking tighter, firming the skin, and younger looking, I would buy it again hands down, and I use it almost every day (not just on my eyes!) Impressive, and a must!</li>
            <li> I am unable to give a review because i had to return it as it was not for all over the face i did not turn it on i put it back in the box &amp;returned it &amp; i am still waiting for a refund . Thank you RJ Bryan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50. I take good care of my looks and I am accustomed to Med Spa treatments. I wasn&#x27;t convinced this device would give me the same results but I was wrong. I&#x27;ve only used the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; settings. The medium setting leaves me reddened the next day. I have noticed all the fine lines were obliterated after 3 weeks. The deeper ones are softened by about 80%. The &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; look better using the PaloVia than using &amp;#34;botox&amp;#34; because the injectables freeze your expression - this looks much more natural. I&#x27;ve also used it on marionettes, smile lines and cheek bones. Great results. I did still fill marionettes with Radiesse because mine are so deep. I believe the PaloVia will reduce the amount of injectables I use over time and definitely pay for itself. If I have a complaint it&#x27;s the 25 &amp;#34;stamp&amp;#34; limit. But, I guess if that continues to annoy me, I&#x27;ll just buy a second unit.</li>
            <li> For some, battling wrinkles using a nifty home laser sounds like something out of a sci-fi flick, but the FDA recently approved just such a device. Lasers, once in the domain of speculative fiction, are now a universal tool in the arsenal of doctors and plastic surgeons.  While still in its infancy, the household laser category is expected to show tremendous growth in the coming years.  The PaloVia Skin Renewing Laser - the first FDA-cleared at-home laser clinically proven to reduce eye wrinkles- is in the front of the pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004LE1AX2 Raymax Low Level Laser Therapy unit - Excellent for Skin Care, Skin Rejuvenation, Acne, Scars, Skin Discoloration, Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Blemishes,etc.]][[ASIN:B002ZRQRFI Baby Quasar Photorejuvenation Light Therapy, Blue]][[ASIN:B004LDAYUI Raymax Professional Low Level Laser Therapy unit - Excellent for Skin Care, Skin Rejuvenation, Acne, Scars, Skin Discoloration, Fine Lines, Wrinkles, Blemishes,etc.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you age, your skin&#x27;s collagen and elastin break down faster than your body can re-erect them. The slowed restructure of these skin-tightening proteins causes your skin to thin, droop and lose elasticity--which often leads to winkles, furrows and fine lines. In fact, the number of epidermal cells decreases by 10% per decade, dividing more slowly as we. The effects of aging on the dermal layer are significant. Not only does the dermal layer thin, but also less collagen is produced, and the elastin fibers that provide elasticity wear out. These changes in the scaffolding of the skin cause the skin to wrinkle and sag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Although only cleared for plumping eye wrinkles and crow&#x27;s feet, I&#x27;ve seen drastic results on naso-labial skin droop (smile lines) and the area around the lips, using The PaloVia Skin Renewing Laser .  This stylish little laser rebuilds aging skin by passing a laser beam through thousands of microscopic areas in the dermis of your skin. The energy of the laser beam causes drooping collagen to plump up and rebuild, causing your skin to tighten as the new collagen is formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although not as strong as the lasers used by dermatologists and plastic surgeons, the results are still very good! Unfortunately, to make up for the strength, this home unit has to be used daily for one whole month (compared to just a couple office visits with a real laser). The only downside is that you only get to zap your wrinkles 25 times in an 8 hour period, so you might need to use it a few different times a day for wrinkles other than crow&#x27;s feet, but the ease of use and painless treatment is easy when watching TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this anti-aging device as a most effective no-downtime home technique to reduce fine lines and annoying skin imperfections. According to the instructions, after daily use for a month, you&#x27;ll see dramatic results, but give it three months to see the true outcome since that&#x27;s the minimum time it takes to build new collagen.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Non-invasive, clinically proven to be safe, easily used.&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Limited to only 25 zaps per 8 hour period. Must use daily for one month. Some redness, which will last a few hours to a whole day.</li>
            <li> Laser causes severe redness which for me lasts for up to two days after use.  In addition the treated areas around the eyes is severely  dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this device from QVC about a month ago and am returning this to buy on Amazon for a savings of $200.00!!!!!  If you are thinking of buying this, only buy on Amazon.  I have had fraxel laser, so I kinda knew what to expect, yes, it stings and burns afterwards, put ice on your face, and use medicine mamas sweet bee ointment.  Swelling goes down within an hour or two.  It does work, but you have to be patient.</li>
            <li> Three weeks into using the PaloVia and I see a marked improvement in the lines around my eyes, nasolabial folds and forehead lines. Yes, it makes my skin red...Yes, it hurts like a (can&#x27;t say it here) on the high setting...Yes, it requires use every day for the first month...But when I&#x27;ve used the mediaspa laser treatments for thousands of dollars, I had even more discomfort. This is, of course taking longer than a series of four pro treatments, but for the convenience and cost savings, I&#x27;m willing to compromise.&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price was by far the best I could find on the internet. So far I&#x27;m really happy with the laser. The redness is nothing I can&#x27;t cover with BB Cream and concealer. I&#x27;ve not experienced excessive dryness as others have mentioned. I use a heavy night cream, serums and top it all with DHC Oil. Also, I drink lots of water and am doing a good exfoliation once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect this to be as fast as a pro treatment...I don&#x27;t expect it to be painless...and I don&#x27;t expect this to make my skin flawless after a treatment. Ouch, temporary redness and a use over a long terms...that&#x27;s my expectation and I&#x27;m happy with results so far.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m adding this comment after a full month and two weeks into twice a week use....still going great and I can honestly say that there is real continuing improvement. The gel pump stopped working after it got about a third used, so I now use a q-tip to get the gel out for my treatment. Luckily, the top for the gel screws off.</li>
            <li> I see quite a bit of  improvement on my face especially the parenthesis gradually disappearing.  My family has also noticed the younger look.  I hope to continue to see improvements on the parenthesis around my mouth and lines near my eyes.  My only concern is that it did not come with a warranty.  If something happens and it stops working, will there be a problem with replacement issues.  How long is the warranty?  For the price of the Palovia, there should be some kind of guarantee that it is replaceable if it stops working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43, soon to be 44.  As an adult, I&#x27;ve been diligent to use sunscreen.  But over the last few years, it seems like everything is not looking the way I want it too.  I did tons of research before I took the plunge and bought this.  I&#x27;ve been using the PaloVia for almost 4 months and it works.  My under eye wrinkles are noticably reduced.  I was getting to the point where I cringed to wear concealor because it looked worse than whatever it was covering up.  Now I have zero issues with that.  I still have a few lines there but I think it took as much as 10 years off my eyes.  I have also had smile-line wrinkles that started developing in my mid-30s.  I&#x27;ve had filler done just under them to no avail.  While I realize you are only supposed to use it around your eyes, after reading about others using it on other areas, I gave it a try.  Those lines are now GONE.  I hated them - they looked like big cracks in my face.  Now they are no longer an issue.  I use Botox. I use fillers.  I will continue to do that.  I feel like this gave me back my appearance that natural aging was taking away.  I want to keep it that way.  But if I could only have the PaloVia OR the Botox / Fillers, I would choose the PaloVia.  It&#x27;s that good.  Now if I could only fix this neck waddle thing...</li>
