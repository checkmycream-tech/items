            <li>Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>im beginning to love this thing! ..</li>
            <li>I can now do my own nails just like the professionals.</li>
            <li>It is very strong and durable  </li>
            <li>just ok.</li>
            <li>Just that I don&#x27;t how to buy more sand bands for the drill.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature of this drill is that, unlike others I&#x27;ve tried, it does NOT overheat.</li>
            <li>it is just an ok product</li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve  known better not to purchase a cheap drill.</li>
            <li>could easily remove bits and when product switched on</li>
            <li>The product itself seems to have a strong battery.  </li>
            <li>, i have not had any problems at all working it, or putting the tips on, they stay on just fine for me ..</li>
            <li>it will work just fine for you, once you know how to use it the correct way.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re past that, it just works great!</li>
            <li>I say spend the extra money and get a really good one because this one doesn&#x27;t work well at all</li>
            <li>the first thing anyone would do when you get this drill set is insert the bit into the drill hole.. and the bits were not going in!</li>
            <li>First of all, There were no instructions on installing the bits to this nail drill which is VERY IMPORTANT for this particular drill..</li>
            <li>Blue Rose saved me hours of frustration.</li>
            <li>Just arrived today product would not even turn on watched info video on Amazon website in the reviews to learn how to change bits, very useful video straight forward easy to follow, but bits were not secure fitting</li>
            <li>My power cord shorted out the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>You have to bend the cord a certain way</li>
            <li>This did not work very well.  </li>
            <li>I got it in three days, really fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The first review I wrote was in error because I did not operate it properly.  </li>
            <li>Now that I do, I am pleased with the product, please remove the negative review.</li>
            <li>Will be sending back for refund, would have given a zero if applicable due to non working product on arrival and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I thought our household Dremel might have too much torque for my long natural nails.</li>
            <li>None of the bits fit the drill, complete waste of my money!</li>

            <li> The plug wiggles and doesn&#x27;t always come on</li>
            <li> just ok. I guess it does the job</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  It works for what need it. Just that I don&#x27;t how to buy more sand bands for the drill. Anybody knows by any chance?.</li>
            <li> This did not work very well.  Dander would not stay on the bit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s excellent for the price, works great &amp; shipped fast very happy ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> The only reason why I have 4 stars and not 5 is because, just like someone else had mentioned, putting the drill bits in is kinda difficult at first (in fact, I still don&#x27;t know how that happened). Once you&#x27;re past that, it just works great! My favorite feature of this drill is that, unlike others I&#x27;ve tried, it does NOT overheat. I am not a professional manicurist, so this is just for my personal use. Good price, good product. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, I guess. I ordered it because I thought our household Dremel might have too much torque for my long natural nails. I should have saved my money and used the Dremel. This unit overheats after a minute of use. After about 3 minutes of rest, it can work again for about 20 seconds. Really not worth the effort or time.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> The product itself seems to have a strong battery.  The biggest fall back is to strangely short adapter cord... At home I&#x27;m not always two feet away from the plug.  The makers of these plugs and iphone chargers must be the same people....</li>
            <li> It fell apart pulling it out the box. None of the bits fit the drill, complete waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Should have listened to the reviews. :/ My power cord shorted out the first time I used it. You have to bend the cord a certain way and it is just not useful at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> Just arrived today product would not even turn on watched info video on Amazon website in the reviews to learn how to change bits, very useful video straight forward easy to follow, but bits were not secure fitting could easily remove bits and when product switched on did not come on Will be sending back for refund, would have given a zero if applicable due to non working product on arrival and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Great product even for the price its awesome</li>
            <li> Perfect for touch-ups between the salon</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Broke within one hour of use. DON&#x27;T BUY!!</li>
            <li> Blue Rose saved me hours of frustration. After 45 minutes of trying to change bits I watched her tutorial video and BAM, it did the trick. Thank you!  I would suggest her video to anyone having problems with their drill before returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
            <li> I got it in three days, really fast. Plus it works really good. Two thumbs up</li>
            <li> I can now do my own nails just like the professionals. I save time and money.</li>
            <li> -I think this works fairly well. im beginning to love this thing! ..it files acrylic really good, i have not had any problems at all working it, or putting the tips on, they stay on just fine for me ..im thinking some people dont know how to properly use it!! watch the video in these comments/ reviews ... it will work just fine for you, once you know how to use it the correct way.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase! I just opened the box and set the drill I was going to use. When I plugged it in and turned it on it was a no go!  Should&#x27;ve  known better not to purchase a cheap drill.</li>
            <li> First of all, There were no instructions on installing the bits to this nail drill which is VERY IMPORTANT for this particular drill.. the first thing anyone would do when you get this drill set is insert the bit into the drill hole.. and the bits were not going in! which can lead to breaking or destroying something. After i searched online to find the correct way of installing the bits ( which was also tedious to do the  correct way) the drill worked once and when i tried switching to a different size bit, it didn&#x27;t want to release the bit i had in the drill. When i finally got it out, the drill will spin but stop the minute it touched the nail. i returned this drill kit the same day i received it and asked for a refund. Amazon did a good job refunding me and keeping me updated with the return/refund etc. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Excelent product for small jobs.</li>
            <li> The first review I wrote was in error because I did not operate it properly.  Now that I do, I am pleased with the product, please remove the negative review.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery. Great product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. The bits on this one doesn&#x27;t lock in tight. Length of cord is short, can&#x27;t do my nails when its plugged into the wall.</li>
            <li> Drill bits don&#x27;t hold they fall out not good I say spend the extra money and get a really good one because this one doesn&#x27;t work well at all</li>
            <li> This is a very great nail file!! It is very strong and durable  anyone telling you different is wrong..!</li>
            <li> Not very powerful, it&#x27;s just blah, even for the price it is just an ok product</li>
