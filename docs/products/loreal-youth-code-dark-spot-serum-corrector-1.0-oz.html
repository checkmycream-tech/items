            <li>/&gt;Update [8-2013]: Still a happy customer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start off by saying, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve never wrote a review about any product before, but I am so happy with this product, I had too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 days, &amp; have already seen amazing results!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;This is a really good product.</li>
            <li>A good price for a good product.</li>
            <li>but it has not done any good yet</li>
            <li>THIS WOULD DO SOME GOOD FOR FOR MY SUN SPOTS.</li>
            <li>My hope is that continued use will get me even better results!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>This product it&#x27;s just amazing ..</li>
            <li>I take very good care of my skin and am very disciplined in my routine.</li>
            <li>I am 17 years old, &amp; This product is GREAT!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see full results but it is a nice amount at a good price.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this product has helped more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I can&#x27;t wait to see if the day cream helps even more.</li>
            <li>The sent is fine, I&#x27;m not allergic to it, and it feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>Im glad to say its working.</li>
            <li>if using it as well would show better results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal products for years and have been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I discontinued using this serum and will not purchase any more.  </li>
            <li>I trusted this brand as I was a Biotherm user for many years.</li>
            <li>EPIC WIN.</li>
            <li>My skin was perfectly clear and happy without it.</li>
            <li>products, like Ambi, Proactiv and Murad, contain 2% of Hydroquinone, which is a strong pigment lightener and the highest allowed concentration by the FDA.</li>
            <li>Garnier seems to help others (Almost every Garnier product I&#x27;ve used has given me a migraine, the scent is just too strong-</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t seen a friend of mine for a couple of months and the first thing he asked was if I was wearing makeup, because my skin looked so much better, like it had a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Keeps the light spots invisible and the semi-medium one in check.</li>
            <li>Keeps the light spots invisible and the semi-medium one in check.</li>
            <li>I wish this had been available in my 20s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent portion is again, important, since it limits products to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it the the serum, or the accompanying YOUTH CODE SPF30 MOISTURIZER, so I tried them separately.</li>
            <li>product is light, absorbs quickly into my skin, and does not have an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>What really prompted me to get this serum was I just got over a huge breakout and there were fresh acne scars that I thought surely would fade by using this serum.</li>
            <li>like I wear a full face of makeup, but,</li>
            <li>Thankfully the purchase price was reasonable so while I feel suckered once more by these lackluster products</li>
            <li>Well, that may not be true - I didn&#x27;t try to bleach the cat with it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>If you have a history of reactions, always spot test but give it a good week to make sure the reactions aren&#x27;t latent (sometimes how much you&#x27;re using, factoring in frequency, can be part of the issue--so you may still be able to use the product but with less frequency but expect slower results).</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, any product with chemicals can and might cause a reaction, be it mild or not.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind, any product withchemicals can and might cause a reaction, be it mild or not.</li>
            <li>yes, lucky me.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell; so, the higher the concentration, the smellier it is though using a light fragranced moisturizer will help to mask it and the intensity of the smell does fade in a half hour</li>

            <li>The serum itself has a light reflecting component, which I assume is intended to instantly make the skin&#x27;s tone appear more even; however, it just made my skin look oily.</li>
            <li>pleased to say that I haven&#x27;t had to resort to even more expensive products, and boy am I glad I found Youth Code!</li>
            <li>serum is light-weight with a pearly white, liquid soap-like consistency that goes on smooth with no greasy residue and gives your skin a nice soft and somewhat moisturized feel.</li>
            <li>or if you apply a night cream after using Youth Code; but it brushes off easily with a soft towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face showed improvement of soft smooth skin when I first used it.</li>
            <li>If you have a history of reactions, always spot test but give it a good week to make sure the reactions aren&#x27;t latent (sometimes how much you&#x27;re using, factoring in frequency, can be part of the issue--so you may still be able to use the product but with less frequency but expect slower results).ur particular dark spots and/or hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>I have emailed L&#x27;Oreal to make them aware of this.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I&#x27;ve tried Clinique, even better clinical dark spot correcter, and saw light results after two months.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t forget to use ur sunscreen every morning ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for three days, and I&#x27;m sure this is the cause of my skin break outs.</li>
            <li>I have been makeup and lotion free trying to clear this up.  </li>
            <li>Some won&#x27;t find this combination effective, especially for more severe dark spot and/or hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>All in all, for me, Youth Code Dark Spot Corrector for the treatment of light but not-super-dark dark spots, happy and will keep using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>but I was hoping to find something with a little more kick!</li>
            <li>I STILL HAVE LARGE BLOTCHES.I USED THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>BUT, FOR A LARGE SUN SPOT (LIKE MINE)</li>
            <li>(10 bucks at your local Super WalMart!), [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>FYI, if you use too high a concentration of Hydroquinone (4% or higher), it can damage your skin.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried changing the amount that I apply, thinking that I was applying too much-</li>
            <li>Now it is looking much better.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but that did absolutely NOTHING after 2 months of use</li>
            <li>If you apply too much, it&#x27;ll &#x27;flake&#x27;, like the remnants of a mask you didn&#x27;t quite get off</li>
            <li>I apply Youth Code over my whole face every night.</li>
            <li>I apply Youth Code over my whole face every night.</li>
            <li>BUT HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN ANY REAL DIFFERENCE.I</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hut my wallet -too much.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to fade post acne hyperpigmentation, but I had no idea it would prevent future breakouts.</li>
            <li>Use it as directed, twice daily on clean skin.</li>
            <li>B003FSGRW4 CLINIQUE by Clinique: EVEN BETTER CLINICAL DARK SPOT CORRECTOR</li>
            <li>I used to have some dark spots from acne and after a month of using it, my face looks healthy and luminous..</li>
            <li>Also, if you&#x27;re darker skinned, using a product with Hydroquinone, which is a proven though perhaps less safe lightener, will lighten whatever areas you&#x27;re applying the product.</li>

            <li>I still moisturize after I put it on, morning (with a high SPF) and night, every day after I scrubbing my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and bought a high SPF moisturizer to use afterwards, and I&#x27;ve seen no change.</li>

            <li>However, I did try using Ambi&#x27;s NON-Hydroquinone product for those darker spots but first, I stopped using Youth Code over my whole face for two weeks before using BOTH at the same time.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if those more persistent spots will ever go away once and for all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, perhaps there&#x27;s something in the L&#x27;oreal that just meshes with my skin type better than the clinique.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to paying more for the Clinique Dark Spot Corrector.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problem skin since I was a teen (I&#x27;m in my early 30s now), and I had more dark spots than I care to think about.</li>
            <li>but then you&#x27;ll have a light spot instead of a dark one!</li>
            <li>but then you&#x27;ll have a light spot instead of a dark one!</li>
            <li>I REALLY wish I could take it back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks, and am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle according to directions and the only thing I noticed is that it burned my eyes.</li>
            <li>do the math, not worth the money even if it&#x27;s available at your local store].</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this product isn&#x27;t widely available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Excited tosay after many products on my very dark sun spots after 2 days they are very minimal!!!!!</li>
            <li>The only thing new to my regimen was this product.</li>
            <li>Which means, if you just put it on the dark spot on your forehead, it&#x27;ll lighten it all right</li>
            <li>Which means, if you just put it on the dark spot on your forehead, it&#x27;ll lighten it all right</li>
            <li>DO REALLY LIKE the LUMINESCENCE of the accompanying YOUTH CODE SPF 30 MOISTURIZER, BUT my SKIN ENDS UP LOOKING GROSS BECAUSE IT PEELS INTO VISIBLE WHITE PIECES.</li>
            <li>Mixing same-type brands over each other, from my experience and for those with fair or sensitive skin, can cause irritations, such as rash, redding (likely due to dryness) or an allergic reaction (or some other reaction) from the chemicals.</li>

            <li>/&gt;***UPDATE:  I&#x27;m still using this serum twice a day and am quite near finishing my second bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 27 year old african american woman with dark spots from both old and new acne scars.</li>
            <li>Like most, I have dark spots from either the sun or acne scars, past and present</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, and this didn&#x27;t irritate or make me break out in a rash like so many other products have in the past, OR, doesn&#x27;t react to whatever other product I&#x27;m using on my skin in conjunction to Youth Code.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll need to use a high SPF face moisturizer during the day to keep new dark spots from forming and those faded spots might come back if you discontinue using the corrector, Youth Code or some other product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wish I could bring this mess back. After coming across a promotional pack that sold this and the moisturizer, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I REALLY wish I could take it back. The sent is fine, I&#x27;m not allergic to it, and it feels nice on my skin. WHY WOULD I HATE THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH? IT PEELS, LEAVING PIECES OF IT ALL OVER YOUR SKIN AND HAIRLINE.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like I wear a full face of makeup, but, even if I did, this product SHOULD NOT DO THIS. I like to use my facial moisturizer on my face, neck, and chest. It peels on my neck and chest. at first I wasn&#x27;t sure if it the the serum, or the accompanying YOUTH CODE SPF30 MOISTURIZER, so I tried them separately. THEY BOTH PEEL. I&#x27;ve tried changing the amount that I apply, thinking that I was applying too much- still rolled into little, unattractive white pieces. Also, NOT CHANGE IN DARK SPOTS- NOPE NOTHING, and I&#x27;ve been USING IT FOR 6 WEEKS. UGH.&lt;br /&gt;I DO REALLY LIKE the LUMINESCENCE of the accompanying YOUTH CODE SPF 30 MOISTURIZER, BUT my SKIN ENDS UP LOOKING GROSS BECAUSE IT PEELS INTO VISIBLE WHITE PIECES.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;This is a really good product. I have dark brown skin and acne marks on my face. The dark marks are fading. My face showed improvement of soft smooth skin when I first used it. Now it is looking much better.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Like most, I have dark spots from either the sun or acne scars, past and present but these aren&#x27;t uber dark spots or hyper-pigmentation but spots that are a one to two shades darker than my natural skin tone. I was using [[ASIN:B0057RIM5G Garnier Clinical Dark Spot Corrector Skin Renew, 1.7 Ounce]] for 12 bucks but that did absolutely NOTHING after 2 months of use [Update 7/2012: I have a friend who&#x27;s been using this one for 3+ months, 3 1/2 tubes later--it sorta works, but VERY slowly...do the math, not worth the money even if it&#x27;s available at your local store].

After just 3 weeks, some of the not as dark spots are g-o-n-e. The darker spots---fading. I&#x27;m not sure if those more persistent spots will ever go away once and for all or if any OTC product can do that but I&#x27;ll take a faded dark spot any day over what it was. I no longer stare at those evil spots whenever I look in the mirror or have to cake on the makeup to hide it (and still feel like everyone can see it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is light-weight with a pearly white, liquid soap-like consistency that goes on smooth with no greasy residue and gives your skin a nice soft and somewhat moisturized feel. I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, and this didn&#x27;t irritate or make me break out in a rash like so many other products have in the past, OR, doesn&#x27;t react to whatever other product I&#x27;m using on my skin in conjunction to Youth Code. I still moisturize after I put it on, morning (with a high SPF) and night, every day after I scrubbing my face. There is a bit of a fragrance but it&#x27;s not bad and it&#x27;s not overpowering. If you apply too much, it&#x27;ll &#x27;flake&#x27;, like the remnants of a mask you didn&#x27;t quite get off or if you apply a night cream after using Youth Code; but it brushes off easily with a soft towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some products, like Ambi, Proactiv and Murad, contain 2% of Hydroquinone, which is a strong pigment lightener and the highest allowed concentration by the FDA. &amp;lt;&amp;lt;Read your labels carefully and spot test to ensure you don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction!&gt;&gt; Youth Code (as well as Philosophy &amp; Clinique, which uses different chemicals) doesn&#x27;t contain Hydroquinone. Instead, Youth Code uses a combination of Vitamin B3 (aka, niacin, which helps to regulate skin texture) and Pro-Cysteine (aka, Koprosteine, which is the actual ingredient to correct the dark spots &amp; hyper-pigmentation). Some won&#x27;t find this combination effective, especially for more severe dark spot and/or hyper-pigmentation. Hydroquinone can also reduce the intensity of scars, but only if the tissue damage isn&#x27;t deep and it&#x27;s only surface damage. FYI, if you use too high a concentration of Hydroquinone (4% or higher), it can damage your skin. In fact, higher concentrations of Hydroquinone is banned by the FDA (and speculated as a possible carcinogen) and several EU countries, so be careful about the concentration (and stick to products with 2% or less) if you find Youth Code ineffective for your particular dark spots and/or hyper-pigmentation. I know people who use products with Hydroquinone and it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell; so, the higher the concentration, the smellier it is though using a light fragranced moisturizer will help to mask it and the intensity of the smell does fade in a half hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need to use a high SPF face moisturizer during the day to keep new dark spots from forming and those faded spots might come back if you discontinue using the corrector, Youth Code or some other product. Also, if you&#x27;re darker skinned, using a product with Hydroquinone, which is a proven though perhaps less safe lightener, will lighten whatever areas you&#x27;re applying the product. Which means, if you just put it on the dark spot on your forehead, it&#x27;ll lighten it all right but then you&#x27;ll have a light spot instead of a dark one! All in all, for me, Youth Code Dark Spot Corrector for the treatment of light but not-super-dark dark spots, happy and will keep using!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update [8-2013]: Still a happy customer. Keeps the light spots invisible and the semi-medium one in check. I wouldn&#x27;t use dark spot remover brands or strengths at the same time unless you&#x27;re applying the product at specific areas and not applying one over the other. I apply Youth Code over my whole face every night. However, I did try using Ambi&#x27;s NON-Hydroquinone product for those darker spots but first, I stopped using Youth Code over my whole face for two weeks before using BOTH at the same time. I&#x27;d apply the Ambi on my harder to lighten spots and the youth code AROUND it. (That said, for me, Ambi&#x27;s non-Hydroquinone product was a dud.) Mixing same-type brands over each other, from my experience and for those with fair or sensitive skin, can cause irritations, such as rash, redding (likely due to dryness) or an allergic reaction (or some other reaction) from the chemicals. Spot test on the back of your hand or the inside of your wrist. Keep in mind, any product with chemicals can and might cause a reaction, be it mild or not. Never assume. Some reactions can be immediate, and others not. If you have a history of reactions, always spot test but give it a good week to make sure the reactions aren&#x27;t latent (sometimes how much you&#x27;re using, factoring in frequency, can be part of the issue--so you may still be able to use the product but with less frequency but expect slower results).ur particular dark spots and/or hyper-pigmentation.

            <li> All of L&#x27;Oreal products are very good.  This one is no exception.  A good price for a good product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This serum gave me an allergic reaction. I have red itchy bumps all over my face. The only thing new to my regimen was this product. I had to see my dr because Benadryl was not doing anything for me and my employer did not want me to return until I seen a dr and was cleared to return. I had to be prescribed a steroid Prednisone and Cetririzine hydrochloride. I&#x27;m on day 3 and hoping it goes away in a week. I have emailed L&#x27;Oreal to make them aware of this. I have yet to hear from them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product isn&#x27;t widely available on Amazon. It is in my local Rite Aid and doesn&#x27;t seem to be going anywhere. I hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued, because this serum saved my face. I&#x27;ve had problem skin since I was a teen (I&#x27;m in my early 30s now), and I had more dark spots than I care to think about. My skin always looked bad, even when I wasn&#x27;t broken out, because of all the dark spots. After using this 2x a day for about a week, they were so faded I was a believer. After a month, the only dark spots left were the very dark ones which were relatively new, and even they had shrunken in size. I&#x27;m still using this product, and break outs are no longer a problem. I finally don&#x27;t have to worry about covering up marks on my skin. I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE:  I&#x27;m still using this serum twice a day and am quite near finishing my second bottle. After years of trying to cover up breakouts, I haven&#x27;t had a single one in months (not even around *that* time of the month). I originally bought this to fade post acne hyperpigmentation, but I had no idea it would prevent future breakouts. I wish this had been available in my 20s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an experiment, I also started using it on my chest, where I sometimes have random spots from my sports bra, and where I always seemed to have a reddish tone from years of too much sun. My chest is now even-toned, and the redness is all but gone. I can wear a low-cut t-shirt without a care in the world, and I can go out without makeup on my face. EPIC WIN.</li>
            <li> I have hyper pigmentation spots around my mouth and trying this product to see if it works but it has not done any good yet and it&#x27;s been almost 1 month.Still waiting patiently to see some results.</li>
            <li> I jus bought this a week ago due to my obsession with popping pimples causing scarring. I bought palmers fade cream until i read it can cause cancer , then threw it away. I bought new line of loreal desperate to take away my acne scars. Im glad to say its working. I reccommend !!!</li>
            <li> HAD MY HOPES THAT THIS BEING A L&#x27;OREAL PRODUCT THIS WOULD DO SOME GOOD FOR FOR MY SUN SPOTS. WELL ALAS IT DID NOT.THE WAY THEY HAD HYPED IT THIS PRODUCT WOULD HELP YOUR COMPLEXION TO BE BLOTCH FREE.SORRY FOLKS. I STILL HAVE LARGE BLOTCHES.I USED THE PRODUCT AS DIRECTED AND FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME BUT HAVEN&#x27;T SEEN ANY REAL DIFFERENCE.I AM NOT SAYING THE L&#x27;OREAL YOUTH CODE WOULD NOT WORK FOR YOU BUT, FOR ME IT DID NOT WORK. IF YOU HAVE A FEW LITTLE SPOTS MAYBE IT WOULD WORK BUT, FOR A LARGE SUN SPOT (LIKE MINE) IT WON&#x27;T.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;ve tried Clinique, even better clinical dark spot correcter, and saw light results after two months. I&#x27;ve tried a few other things (Daggett&amp;Ramsdell, peels...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks, and am pleasantly surprised. My dark spots are lighter, smaller... it&#x27;s very nice. I&#x27;m not sure, perhaps there&#x27;s something in the L&#x27;oreal that just meshes with my skin type better than the clinique. The $20 price tag at Walgreens is preferable to $50 for Clinique as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products works differently for people. Some people saw a lot of improvement with Clinique. Garnier seems to help others (Almost every Garnier product I&#x27;ve used has given me a migraine, the scent is just too strong- so I didn&#x27;t even try that one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is light, absorbs quickly into my skin, and does not have an overpowering scent. The scent portion is again, important, since it limits products to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $20, I&#x27;d say give it a go. Use it as directed, twice daily on clean skin. I don&#x27;t have the Dark Spot correcting moisturizer, I use either Derma E or Burt&#x27;s Bees, (Or Skin Appetit with SPF 15 if I&#x27;m going out) so I have no idea if using it as well would show better results. I&#x27;ll leave that to another reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/27 edit- I have gone through one container and just bought a second yesterday. I hadn&#x27;t seen a friend of mine for a couple of months and the first thing he asked was if I was wearing makeup, because my skin looked so much better, like it had a healthy glow. I still have spots, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but they are smaller and lighter, and my overall skintone looks improved. My hope is that continued use will get me even better results! I also grabbed the Youth Code Day Cream to use with it now, as my Rite-Aid had L&#x27;Oreal products buy one get one 1/2 off, and will update in a month or so if there&#x27;s any added improvement with the moisturizer. Honestly, this product has helped more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and I can&#x27;t wait to see if the day cream helps even more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying, \\&quot;I&#x27;ve never wrote a review about any product before, but I am so happy with this product, I had too. I am 17 years old, &amp; This product is GREAT! I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 days, &amp; have already seen amazing results! I had scars all across my forehead; they weren&#x27;t severe, but they still looked terrible, and now I can see them fading away day by day. I encourage everyone to use this along with the L&#x27;oreal Youth Code Dark Spot Corrector SPF30. This product is amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 27 year old african american woman with dark spots from both old and new acne scars. I have used Ambi and it worked a little but I was hoping to find something with a little more kick! I decided to try Youth Code Dark Spot Corrector because it uses  Vitamin B3 and Pro-Cysteine instead of Hydroquinone, which the FDA only allows 2%. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and bought a high SPF moisturizer to use afterwards, and I&#x27;ve seen no change. What really prompted me to get this serum was I just got over a huge breakout and there were fresh acne scars that I thought surely would fade by using this serum. Nope, still there. I&#x27;ll keep using until it&#x27;s gone, but if I don&#x27;t see a change, needless to say, I won&#x27;t buy it again. Kinda disappointed but willing to keep going til it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> This product it&#x27;s just amazing .. I used to have some dark spots from acne and after a month of using it, my face looks healthy and luminous.. I totally recomend it. Tip: don&#x27;t forget to use ur sunscreen every morning ;)</li>
            <li> Excited tosay after many products on my very dark sun spots after 2 days they are very minimal!!!!! It&#x27;s a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> One very important thing not mentioned in the reviews I&#x27;ve read but wished I had known prior to purchasing, is that this product leaves an annoying and weird residue on the skin. I  find that as I dab it, a flaky residue appears and I have to brush it off my face. In addition to this, I am still waiting for the product to work and lighten the dark spots. Thankfully the purchase price was reasonable so while I feel suckered once more by these lackluster products It didn&#x27;t hut my wallet -too much.</li>
            <li> I broke out immediately after using this. My skin was perfectly clear and happy without it. I&#x27;ve only had it for three days, and I&#x27;m sure this is the cause of my skin break outs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me  I got blackheads all over my face  even my eyelids  going to use it on my hands to see if that helps the dark spots..if not  i sure won&#x27;t order it again....never in my life had blackheads before....</li>
            <li> I bought this product three months ago and have used it twice daily.  After thirteen weeks, my dark spots haven&#x27;t faded at all.  I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal products for years and have been satisfied.  This time my money has been completely wasted.</li>
            <li> I have a few sun spots on my face that I was hoping this product would address. I used the product as directed for about 4-6 weeks and saw no difference whatsoever. The serum itself has a light reflecting component, which I assume is intended to instantly make the skin&#x27;s tone appear more even; however, it just made my skin look oily. I finished the tube, but I will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to see full results but it is a nice amount at a good price.  You don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li> I am 65 and just noticed dark spots this spring.  I researched and decided to give L&#x27;Oreal Youth Code Dark Spot Serum a try.  I have never had acne problems or any breakouts...yes, lucky me.  I took &#x27;before&#x27; pictures to compare to my face after one bottle of serum.  After only two weeks of use, my face is broken out so badly I am considering calling a dermatologist.  My face looks like mosquitos attacked.  I have been makeup and lotion free trying to clear this up.  So far, I just have angry looking skin.  I discontinued using this serum and will not purchase any more.  I haven&#x27;t read any other concerns like this, so it may just be me.  However, because of this, I can not recommend.  I also noticed no fading of spots after the two weeks; but perhaps that wasn&#x27;t long enough for results.</li>
            <li> Well, that may not be true - I didn&#x27;t try to bleach the cat with it.  But what it doesn&#x27;t do is correct dark spots.  I used the whole bottle according to directions and the only thing I noticed is that it burned my eyes.</li>
            <li> I began using this product on a Thursday. By the following Tuesday morning, I had a rash all over my face. It looks like very small bumps densely concentrated over every part of my skin&#x27;s surface where I applied the product. My skin feels tight, almost like a wind burn, and is very sensitive to the heat. I went to the doctor and he suggested I take Benadryl. I took it as he advised and it didn&#x27;t clear up hardly at all. I went back to see the doctor and he gave me an oral steroid. It is slowly going away finally, but only after unwanted hardship and added expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a reaction like this to any skin care product. I take very good care of my skin and am very disciplined in my routine. In an attempt to save money in these hard economic times, I decided to try a drugstore brand for my serum and purchased this product. I trusted this brand as I was a Biotherm user for many years. Following the terrible result, I searched product reviews and it seems many other users have had a similar reaction. There is only one bad one so far on Amazon, but a broader search online reveals many stories like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know not everyone has the same reactions to products. I don&#x27;t like the odds though. In subsequent conversations with friends about it, almost everyone I talked to knew someone who had the same experience with \\&quot;a L&#x27;Oréal anti-aging product\\&quot;. Why risk it? I&#x27;ll go back to paying more for the Clinique Dark Spot Corrector.</li>
