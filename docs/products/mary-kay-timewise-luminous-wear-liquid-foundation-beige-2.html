            <li> Yes it is expensive, but think about how much money you spend on concerlers, foundations/powders, illuminaters, something that really hydrates all day?!  </li>
            <li> Being that it is a Mary Kay product I was hoping for a high quality product, but I am not thrilled.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I have to say out there to all the other men....</li>
            <li> Be aware that this product is difficult to get out of fabric!</li>
            <li> I have a Mary Kay representative, but she has trouble getting things to me when I want them.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;Buying it through Amazon was even less expensive than through a MK consultant</li>
            <li> A lot less expensive online.</li>
            <li> it smells weird,</li>
            <li> I use this as my base coat to cover rosacea</li>

            <li> I have used Mary Kay Timewise makeup for years.  It&#x27;s quite lovely.  Leaves my skin glowing and soft-looking.</li>
            <li> Another product that made my girlfriend very happy. I like these products alot and recommend it to any one out there</li>
            <li> As always, Mary Kay never disappoints.&lt;br /&gt;This make up is so light that you almost cant tell you are wearing make up.&lt;br /&gt;Buying it through Amazon was even less expensive than through a MK consultant</li>
            <li> use every day.  love it</li>
            <li> my wife loves these things.  She loves sticking it to her over-priced Mary-K rep.  Save some money and get it here.  But don&#x27;t tell your rep.</li>
            <li> The luminous wear foundation doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes or age spots.  It&#x27;s too runny and shiny.  Does not blend very well</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife as a replacement of the same product and it saved me a trip to the mall or store. That&#x27;s all I have to say out there to all the other men.... Happy wife happy life brother..</li>
            <li> I use this as my base coat to cover rosacea</li>
            <li> Very good coverage.  Stays on all day.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  Washes off easily with soap and water.  Good color too.</li>
            <li> Received as expected, happy with the company that sent it and the product.</li>

            <li> Being that it is a Mary Kay product I was hoping for a high quality product, but I am not thrilled.  It is an okay foundation, but it does not illuminate and is just like any ordinary foundation (except to me it smells weird, kinda like paint thinner).  I decided to go to an ULTA beauty store and try out different products (they have testers on almost everything so you know what your buying and if you really like it).  I finally found the perfect foundation for me... Stila beauty line is amazing!  There&#x27;s no point in descibing how great it is, you just have to try it for yourself.  Great thing, you can find Stila cosmetic products at major retail stores like Macy&#x27;s and such, and should be able to get a sample.  Yes it is expensive, but think about how much money you spend on concerlers, foundations/powders, illuminaters, something that really hydrates all day?!  It is so worth the money and I will never go back to $10 foundations .. that are probably doing more damage to my face than good.  Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> I have a Mary Kay representative, but she has trouble getting things to me when I want them. This is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> I love mary kay products  .  I normally get from my mk girl but I saw it here n thats all I could get at the time so I was satisfied as usual with the quality of the product and the price .  can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> The order came quickly and the makeup is flawless. Exactly what I was looking for. A lot less expensive online.</li>
