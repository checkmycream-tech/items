            <li>The design of the product fits in hand very nicely.</li>
            <li>If you want a nice trimmer that is waterproof, rechargable, and cuts very good, then plan on spending about twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Sure, this isn&#x27;t the greatest trimmer ever.</li>
            <li>Happy customer! :)</li>
            <li>okay, but not the best I have used.</li>
            <li>Nice product!</li>
            <li>it is good to take on trips around the world.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t worry I cleaned it really good)</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I trust Panasonic and have always had good luck with their consumer electronics.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer seems to be well made, has good battery life and seems to be fairly durable.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size to fit in hand.  </li>
            <li>Considering the price, the build quality is excellent and it runs smooth</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good back-up to keep on hand</li>
            <li>Owned the ER240 for 8 yrs, and loved it.</li>
            <li>I thought the features and reviews on this one looked good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>It is a good value, arrived on time and meets my needs.</li>
            <li>Good product otherwise.</li>
            <li>Great waterproof trimmer comfortable works great</li>
            <li>Good buy, great features (maneuvrability), easy to clean, GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it for my intended use.</li>
            <li>For years I have had its predecessor and was very satisfied but the rechargeable battery gave up.</li>
            <li>Nice product, good value at $12.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I will probably be ordering more to send to him!</li>
            <li>But it is very light and good for travel.</li>
            <li>Works great, smooth and close if you take your time with each stroke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a nose hair trimmer that i really liked until it died-</li>
            <li>The built in guard is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I liked the Remington but the rechargeable battery was losing its ability to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>I liked it from the start and after six weeks of use</li>
            <li>I found a length I liked (#3) and the guide does not slip from that setting.  </li>
            <li>sometimes can be a good thing as more convience too</li>
            <li>Nice and convenient though.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product.  </li>
            <li>Its not that good on the \\&quot;short\\&quot; trim but otherwise OK.</li>
            <li>The idea is nice -</li>
            <li>Fully submersible is a nice feature so it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>I really liked the look and feel of this trimmer, and it seems well made.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have no wall warts or stands or wires.  </li>
            <li>Definite pluses are its portability (perfect for travel), size, battery operated and being waterproof makes it unique in its features, also priced very fairly.  </li>
            <li>Good power, easy to use, but the trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim evenly.</li>
            <li>Very strong</li>
            <li>Take off the clipper head and very easy to trim neck and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rare thing to get quality at a great price.</li>
            <li>i love panasonic products and own a bunch of them from tvs to shavers.</li>
            <li>best i have used so far.</li>
            <li>Fast / Cheap / Perfect</li>
            <li>So I am very pleased that Panasonic continues to produce this fine product line.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is great for the price and performance,I like it very much.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice, all-in-one trimmer that has two distinct advantages over many others.</li>
            <li>it feels good in the hand, cuts easily and cleans easily, too.</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine after that!</li>
            <li>Infact cuts the beard very smoothly.</li>
            <li>My first success was a panasonic travel shaver which has been my best shaver ever.  </li>
            <li>, for what it is, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>There are better models out there in this price range that are rechargable, but aren&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly used for precision jobs like to trim my neckline and sideburns now as I do the beard trimming with a hair clipper without the guides set to the highest setting, which trims my beard in under 2 minutes compared to 10 with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>the edger works better than my razor to trim my sideburns, believe it or not.</li>
            <li>I have used it for weeks and love it.</li>
            <li>Lay the trimmer with the top, or switch-side, on the bottom, and with the cage pointing toward you.  </li>
            <li>I like this built-in guide better.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see amongst the offerings that Panasonic had an affordable beard/mustache trimmer with the features I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It seems to be sufficiently waterproof to shave in the shower, and being able to use rechargeable/replaceable batteries is good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I need to purchase one for her husbands Christmas stocking since he agrees it works better than his Braun</li>
            <li>there are much better choices.</li>
            <li>But with many shavers that have built in batteries - the battery goes</li>
            <li>For the price I don&#x27;t see how it could have done better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I wish there were a more intermediate setting for a close, but not guard-free close shave.</li>
            <li>I broke it when dropped to wash room floor, cheap product and quality!</li>
            <li>okay for a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>10x more passings to get a trimmed beard.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>But it works better then</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have plenty of AAA batteries...</li>
            <li>I have been trimming my beard and mustache with scissors and a razor for many years and decided to try out a trimmer.  </li>
            <li>And even more reluctant to have one that would run on either 120v or 220.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish I had paid more attention to the reviews.  </li>
            <li>But I cannot recommend this trimmer if your beard is longer, and has gray in it, like the one the Most Interesting Man in the World wears in the TV commercials.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with this machine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many beard trimmers over the years.  </li>
            <li>And the length selection is better for hair on your head not beards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they made the increments more appropriate for regular beards then this would be an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I am sure the scissors you have laying around your apartment would do a better job at trimming than this.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill!</li>
            <li>For the price and quality, I was well satisfied.</li>
            <li>But I do love the results...  </li>
            <li>Love the built in length adjuster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several battery-powered trimmers, and this is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>I have a $25 Wahl, and it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>but it could be better.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot better than this.</li>
            <li>This is not a quality product, but it works OK.</li>
            <li>, it is battery powered instead of rechargable (most on the market are rechargable</li>
            <li>A lot more.  </li>
            <li>Thought the range of settings would be greater.</li>
            <li>I own several Panasonic devices and they are all really good, so I figured this would be good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good product, and being battery operated</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still $13.51 as I write this, which is pretty good for the quality.</li>
            <li>It was a very good product lasting for many years and costing about 5 bucks.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;ll be able to travel with it easily.</li>
            <li>Uses AAA batteries, easily found in most countries.</li>
            <li>Most important, no worries about charging it when we travel over seas.</li>
            <li>I find that lighter/smaller makes it a lot more precise when trimming the lenght of my mustache over my lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t have cost much more for a cheap plastic holder for the unit to be included--as Wahl does--but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY GOOD PRODUCT&lt;</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s had the original one for many, many, many years and we more than got our money&#x27;s worth out of it.  </li>
            <li>the bright side, I really like how light and compact it is, and the ergonomic design is easy to hold and maneuver while trimming.</li>
            <li>The body is ergonomically sculpted and is really easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li>But in my experience, a Panasonic beard trimmer will easily outlast a Remington.  </li>
            <li>The battery compartment, which holds two AAA batteries, is easily opened, but well sealed.</li>
            <li>It is easily removable for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used similar Panasonic when traveling for more than 13 years to trim my beard which still works great.</li>
            <li>The guide is easily removable and I use it that way to trim the edge of my mustache.  </li>
            <li>Takes triple A batteries which we have laying around, and is easily washed off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Batteries are easy to install and no need to travel with a charger.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The guide slips out of position too easily, and can cause a haircutting accident.</li>
            <li>As for the precision of the trimming adpect, it has an automatic guide attached that makes it extremely easy to get the length you want</li>
            <li>I had the remington trimmer years, still going strong, 9 bucks.</li>
            <li>- the trimmer has a good feel and the removable guide is high quality and is finished well.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is very mild tempered-its not noisy and it works well on the fine points.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t \\&quot;dial up\\&quot; the distance of the cage from the surface of the face as easily and precisely.  </li>
            <li>Battery powered and just fine to trim our Chow Chow.</li>
            <li>It did the job just fine.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER2403 is nicely designed and fits well in my large hand.</li>
            <li>This description is entirely accurate.    </li>
            <li>This product was a huge dissapointment for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and am happy to report that nothing has changed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and am happy to report that nothing has changed.</li>
            <li>so it will probably work great on those with thinner facial hair.     </li>
            <li>Works great and has power to spare with only its 2@ AAA batt.</li>
            <li>I went cheap, and was I blown away by this product..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s underpowered and cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for trimming beards, mustaches, necks ect.</li>
            <li>This works great as a beard/moustache/other short hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>The difference between the shortest trimmer position and no-guard is huge, you&#x27;re either shaving with no guard and getting pretty close, or leaving a pretty good length of stubble.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard fit and trim as never before.</li>
            <li>I am primarily writing to emphasize these two points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Uses batteries, light weight, one piece --</li>
            <li>What can you expect from a cheap trimmer?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Good, cheap.</li>
            <li>I know what you are thinking, the trimmer was cheap, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>The size aids detailed work around mouth to snazz up the goatee and keep the shaggy homeless look at bay.</li>
            <li>This is great if you suffer from low dexterity like I do.  </li>
            <li>Works great with the guard off, but needs multiple passes to get the job done with the guard on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing they put cheap crappy blades on it.  </li>
            <li>I would not want this as my primary trimmer for use at home.</li>
            <li>Does not work as good as my old Remington...</li>
            <li>Paired with rechargeable batteries its very economical.</li>
            <li>The blades are still sharp and cut great, it&#x27;s still easy to clean, waterproof, still a little underpowered, and still works perfectly, albeit it still doesn&#x27;t cut that well.</li>
            <li>The blades are still sharp and cut great, it&#x27;s still easy to clean, waterproof, still a little underpowered, and still works perfectly, albeit it still doesn&#x27;t cut that well.</li>
            <li>, I can no longer find an AC outlet that&#x27;s conveniently located or even accessible.  </li>
            <li>This is the best small, portable trimmer I&#x27;ve found yet</li>
            <li>I originally rated this trimmer at 5 stars (see review below).  </li>
            <li>ER2403K seemed like a great option as it featured almost all the same things I loved about the ER224S but takes regular batteries.</li>
            <li>PANASONIC SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL DESIGN.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t come with a holder or a case, so I kept the original plastic packing material and place</li>
            <li>it would be nice to get a new one.</li>
            <li>Clean cuts without having to worry about charging.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a breeze.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull all the time, about 1 out of 5 strokes, but when it does it isn&#x27;t a clean pull</li>
            <li>I was always a fan of Panasonic having being entertained since the late 1990&#x27;s with their Technics receiver which always did and still does deliver excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Time will tell, but If initial performance continues, this is a good value.</li>
            <li>The only thing it&#x27;s good for is edge trimming (without the adjustable trimmer attached).</li>
            <li>But for touchups, its good enough</li>
            <li>If stubble is how you like your beard, this ER2403K trimmer will probably be a good buy for you, especially for travel.</li>
            <li>Not use full for the &amp;#34;scruff&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I abdolutely love this product based on the fact that it shaves very close (I use it for my head)</li>
            <li>and it hurts more than if you just pulled the hair straight out.  </li>
            <li>previously reviewed, this is a good product -- but lacks a setting that trims as close as most guys like.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Lately have been using Panasonics, and this is a good example of how to keep updates better than the previous incarnations.&lt;br /&gt;The fact you can change the batteries</li>
            <li>I much prefer my older one that had many more adjustments and did not need the oil.  </li>
            <li>As with other Panasonic consumer products, it&#x27;s a good quality device; a bit plasticly, but strong.</li>
            <li>I think these two things lead to the issues folks are complaining about with it leaving beards uneven or taking many passes to work well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good unit.</li>
            <li>Item arrived on time and was packed adequately.  </li>
            <li>It is very compact, which is great for travel, but the head is smaller than I like for use at home.</li>
            <li>Good item for the price and not complicated with numerous attachments.</li>
            <li>the back up is pretty good aswell</li>
            <li>It runs on 2 AAA batteries located under a pretty unique battery door.</li>
            <li>, this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>So far this little fella has been great!</li>
            <li>I gave it an extra star because it&#x27;s proven to be a good product (typical Panasonic, my shelf stereo is over 11 years old and works as good as the day I bought it, even after falling off my dresser!</li>
            <li>I gave it an extra star because it&#x27;s proven to be a good product (typical Panasonic, my shelf stereo is over 11 years old and works as good as the day I bought it, even after falling off my dresser!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another issue is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to be that powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never reinstalled fresh batteries, so that may be the problem (though I had no intimation of their losing power).  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a nice unit for the bearded and mustsachioed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different trimmers and this one is okay to good.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for and this was worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>Does not feel cheap - feels heavy in a good way.</li>
            <li>It was effective, and needed relatively low quantity of passings through my beard to get it trimmed.</li>
            <li>I would have spent more money on a better trimmer if I&#x27;d known this was going to be sub-par.</li>
            <li>And the guidecomb is more stable that the one on my old trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to completely buy into the correlation money quality.</li>
            <li>It looks like something worth 99-cents.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than my previous trimmer and the biggest difference is that the new Pansasonic trimmer blade is much narrower --- better for mustache trimming, but not as good for the beard since it requires many more strokes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having good success so far with panasonic trimmers in general.</li>
            <li>The on/off switch is located at the top under the cutter head assembly and is nice and big, making it easy to manipulate when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li>AND its priced right.</li>
            <li>And the price was right.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove head (flip it back with your thumb then snap fit to re-attach) to brush away hair, rinse under running water and oil.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li>I own a cordless Panasonic ER-224 which works fine for my beard, but the charging cord was misplaced and this inexpensive battery-powered Panasonic model was bought as a stopgap until the cord was found.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t judge it worth more than ten at the time, but I&#x27;d have no hesitations paying 20 for another just like it.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has no cord and is not rechargeable, but I wish it was larger and more powerful.</li>
            <li>Being water-proof is also a big plus and makes it really easy to clean    </li>
            <li>This thing is not only great for travel but regular use as well.</li>
            <li>THIS ONE IS NOT AS GOOD BECAUSE IT DOES NOT TRIM AS SHORT AS THE OLD ONE.  </li>
            <li>However, even if the guide were calibrated to a good set of length options, the trimmer would still be really only useful as a comb, because the blade barely cuts anything.  </li>
            <li>It was far better than advertised, simple easy to use.</li>
            <li>I actually ended up taking the guide and running it on a sander to shave off some of the top to get it to cut shorter.</li>
            <li>Finally, it serves as a reminder that \\&quot;progress\\&quot; (rechargeable batteries) is fraught with many paradoxes, contradictions,</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok for facial hair</li>
            <li>Am pleased with the price and will be back.</li>
            <li>I love not having to keep track of multiple attachments.</li>
            <li>The trimmer delivered exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I like that I can use my rechargeable batteries and they lasted for 30-60 minutes before they needed to be recharged, but overall, I had better things to do than going over and over my beard with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this for me to replace one, from a different manufacturer, that I owned and enjoyed for years.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered a slightly higher end Remmington.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works really well as of now!</li>
            <li>you can find better at same price.</li>
            <li>This is OK but its not up to Panasonic standard.</li>
            <li>Nice product, Small easy to use and doesn&#x27;t consume much battery</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this one a shot since my last trimmer just died and the reviews on this were fairly positive for the most part.  </li>
            <li>The final product was much more uniform and clean looking with the old set.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my needs .this is my second purchase and they last a long time.bought</li>
            <li>So, this is great unless you like to have very short hair, in which case you&#x27;ll have to use it with the guard off, which is much harder to get an even length with.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my very, very old Wahl trimmer which was becoming problematic in its old age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The batteries seem to drain pretty fast.</li>
            <li>If i use the unit i will buy more batteries , i will need them since it takes 3 times as long to trim.</li>
            <li>This is true, but easily fixed with some sandpaper applied to the plastic guard.</li>
            <li>particular love how there is only one attachment but</li>
            <li>I read the reviews of many trimmers and selected this one based on the decent reviews and low price ($10).  </li>
            <li>The moveable length guide is far superior to other trimmers&#x27; multiple attachments, which are flimsy and easily lost.</li>
            <li>( as in planned obsolencence-this may be one of the few good things I learned in high sch</li>
            <li>I put fresh new batteries to trim</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as the chargeable kinds, and you need to keep putting in new batteries periodically.  </li>
            <li>Easily adjustable for my needs and quiet.</li>
            <li>Very sharp blades and easy to clean, just rinse.</li>
            <li>it should last a good long while!</li>
            <li>had it for a short time and love it, so far!</li>
            <li>Nice little trimmer, but doesn&#x27;t work that well in the shower.</li>
            <li>No broken parts, no dents or dings</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Moreover, this battery-operated shaver was so cheap [no longer, however] I could throw away the registration/warranty card without a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t cut much of anything.  </li>
            <li>Very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because is fully functional and compact,waterproof and comes with all accesories.</li>
            <li>so you have to throw the whole thing</li>
            <li>Portable trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t know why,it didn&#x27;t really bother my pets.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea with this product however the comb design doesn&#x27;t quite get under and lift the hairs to be cut very well.</li>
            <li>If you had a thicker beard, I&#x27;d wonder if it could really tackle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works very well and is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I have to make a whole bunch of passes to get the hair even-ish though, and it doesn&#x27;t get everything.  </li>
            <li>By the cheap price, at $13.99, I got what I paid for.... a white elephant.</li>
            <li>The distance between each of the 5 adjustable trimmer lengths is too much, but it is manageable in a pinch.</li>
            <li>and I dislike it so much</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It works, and would probably work well if you had super fine hair, but for most normal people it&#x27;s going to result in a frustrating grooming</li>
            <li>crappy item that got broke pretty quickly beside when it was working initially</li>
            <li>Size is good in the hand, and batteries mean I can carry this while traveling with the batteries OUT, so it doesn&#x27;t turn on accidentally.</li>
            <li>Not bad but a little cheaply made</li>
            <li>and i was struck by many bits of sharp plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I travel every day/other day and still have the original one I bought several months ago.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was originally designed for larger size batteries.</li>
            <li>I would clean them regularly, but I am hesitant to wash them out because again, not water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>The comb encases the head so no worries of nicks and the trimmer is a nice  small convenient size.</li>
            <li>Put new batteries in &amp; it wouldn&#x27;t even cut my husbands beard!</li>
            <li>My son went to Africa for 27 months with the peace corps and he can&#x27;t live without his ranch!</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I kept a really, really short beard, this would work better, but at the middle setting, I have to go over and over and over and over my beard to get an even trim.</li>
            <li>ONLY drawback to this is it doesn&#x27;t have a tremendous amount of power</li>
            <li>nice but suitable for bear more; it&#x27;ll be difficult to use for head, as the blade is very small.</li>
            <li>but the plastic is high quality</li>
            <li>You need to keep your fades high, and you need to keep them tight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite practical and cost effective, and arguably matches up to a more expensive trimmer!.</li>
            <li>Other than that it absolutely does the job, is light and does not need charging.</li>
            <li>You would be surprised how many of these ate in the stores for up to 100.00 that you can&#x27;t even get wet!</li>
            <li>It comes with a small brush so you can do that very easily.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what kinds of outlets I would have access to, so this little guy did the trick.</li>
            <li>Sharp, watertight, easy to change the batteries.</li>
            <li>will keep this unit because I really value the replaceable batteries, and it is adequate for my limited mustache work.  </li>
            <li>as they come (of course, if your beard is made of Golden Fleece or gun-barrel metal, it may, as some have claimed, fall short of discharging its owner&#x27;s assignment in flying colors--in that case, try a corded electric).  </li>
            <li>I had to put it on the lowest setting and it still left the hair 1/2 inch long in most spots...</li>
            <li>Too many products have built in batteries, which diminish over time leading to tech waste and landfill sadness (plus the charging area looks cluttered and</li>
            <li>It uses AAA size batteries, however trying to install them and figuring out which way they go can be a little bit of a problem, because the little picture molded in the plastic is hard to see, and they don&#x27;t fit perfectly, the batteries wobble a bit.</li>
            <li>it is probably not a good trimmer for those who want a strong trimmer or have a full beard to trim.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is VERY EASY to CLEAN - just rinse it under the tap, dry it with a towel, and store it with the blade facing down until next time&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>for how I like my mustache length, but I&#x27;ll be trimming it far more often because I can&#x27;t get it a little closer.  </li>
            <li>a new model has been ordered.</li>
            <li>For that reason, my priority was to get a new unit that had replaceable batteries, which is how I ended up with</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement for my mb20 remington that i have used for years and paid $9 new.</li>
            <li>Second, it uses replaceable batteries, rather than rechargeables, so if the batteries are empty you just slip in new ones, rather than waiting an hour or more for it to charge.</li>
            <li>I have used it for the first time today and find it very small and light compared to the Norelco and with much finer blade teeth.</li>
            <li>May not be for very frequent users.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s compact, astonishingly quiet and very very</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m accustomed to, and gets significantly bogged down by a thick beard, but it&#x27;s great to be able to trim in the shower since I can never seem to get all the hair-dust out of my counter grout nomatter</li>
            <li>other great advantage being its wet and dry as well</li>
            <li>first impressions were mixed.</li>
            <li>However, this trimmer is significantly inferior to every other beard trimmer I have ever owned (including Philips, Remington, and Wahl models).  </li>
            <li>Just purchased this second exact moustache trimmer for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  </li>
            <li>the old one we can take with us when we travel and the new one we&#x27;ll keep at home.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is mandatory after use due to lack of vacuum feature...a nice extra</li>
            <li>It also has self-sharpening stainless steel blades that Panasonic says will last for about 5 years under normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I was expecting a lot, but unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>Somehow, it misses half the hairs, so you have to keep going over the same area many times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly very durable and stays where you set it, but it&#x27;s made in such a way that I don&#x27;t think the hair can always get in there easily, and it clogs with hair fairly easily, especially if the hair is wet.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, I use this without the guard most of the time and deal with the fact that it trims a little too close for my taste.</li>
            <li>Once in a great while it will pull a bit before cutting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Panasonic ER224S, but when the battery finally have up the ghost (after 2 years of regular use) and I came back to Amazon to purchase a replacement I thought I would check out my options.&lt;br</li>
            <li>trim hair evenly or completely</li>
            <li>trim hair evenly or completely</li>
            <li>i completely submersed the shave in water and it still works like a champ.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to say as far as longevity is concerned</li>
            <li>I like the comb so far because it helps to minimize mistakes.  </li>
            <li>Overall you get what you pay for, an inexpensive shaver that gets the job done, and has everything you really need in a self contained unit.</li>
            <li>I can use it in the shower, directly under the water and all.</li>
            <li>Anyway it is portable enough for trip, do NOT expect too much.</li>
            <li>Sits next to the bathroom sink ready to go.</li>
            <li>Needed to replace my old trimmer which needed to be plugged into the wall to recharge.</li>
            <li>Shipment arrived 2 days early.</li>
            <li>Not perfectly clear at first glance.</li>
            <li>I hate it when companies rework and ruin perfectly wonderful products.</li>
            <li>I kind of just give up when I get tired of trying to make it do what I want, which is make</li>
            <li>I see the other reviews are very positive -- perhaps it works better for more closely trimmed beards or maybe I just got a bad unit.</li>
            <li>(I have yet to enter a store when there wasn&#x27;t a 2 for 1 deal on at least one brand of battery), easily procured, and so cheap that the problem I&#x27;m having is less one of running out of batteries than out of drawer space to accommodate all of the batteries acquired because of these never-ending</li>
            <li>Small easy to use.</li>
            <li>Batteries died down quickly in it.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no mess</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry and its trimming action is smooth and even.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;[I paid ten bucks for this in June 2010 and it looks exactly the same today.  </li>
            <li>and I know I&#x27;m not the first to say this) is that the shortest setting isn&#x27;t really short enough for me.  </li>
            <li>my older Norelco trimmer finally broke in a manner that was unfixable prompting me to look for a replacement.</li>
            <li>Recommend high output rechargeable NiMh such as Eneloop, etc.  </li>
            <li>Also, it feels as light as a toothbrush in the hand--ideal for touch-up trims with the cage removed--and takes up no more room on \\&quot;my\\&quot; shelf in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>The only negative is putting a drop of oil on the blade - not difficult, not annoying, just an extra 30 seconds when I am trying to get out the door in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Really like this trimmer because it&#x27;s accurate and powerful as I have very thick black hair.</li>
            <li>This new model is very similar</li>
            <li>buying a new ER224S now, and I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li>had read reviews about low power and also how you couldn&#x27;t get a very close trim unless you took the guard totally off.  </li>
            <li>My last beard trimmer&#x27;s &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting left the stubble much shorter.</li>
            <li>After at least 5-7 sessions - it&#x27;s still going strong, so assume I have a while before the batteries run</li>
            <li>The blades were either not sharp or not alined, though pulling was not a problem.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a particularly dense beard, but I like to keep it about 3/4 inch long.</li>
            <li>(Maybe other owners have a trimmer more clearly marked than mine, which has the same model number but was half of the current price.)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Machine has great features but it cuts badly.</li>
            <li>If you just barely squeeze it there, it moves with ease.</li>
            <li>So far seems to be solidly built.  </li>
            <li>Of course it falls far short of plug-in trimmers, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers!</li>
            <li>The result looked worse and more ragged than if I&#x27;d not bothered trimming.    </li>
            <li>I can use my own rechargeable batteries and don&#x27;t have to worry about plugs or replacing silly chargers and rechargeable units</li>
            <li>\\&quot;specials.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the cost of batteries is not sufficiently exorbitant to make up for the \\&quot;cost\\&quot; in space, frustration, and even direct expenditures (for the higher cost of the gadget itself--that constant \\&quot;trickle\\&quot; of electricity due to all of the rechargeable units throughout the house).  </li>
            <li>It is a very good trimmer, but it runs on AAA batteries, so don&#x27;t expect to cut you hair with it (at least, not perfectly)</li>
            <li>They are much quieter, with less vibration, and batteries last far longer.  </li>
            <li>Go directly to  Panasonic corporate site, Consumer Products, and zoom in on the illustration for battery positioning on the proper instruction page.  </li>
            <li>only issue is you have to be careful on with the setting, it can slip and then you&#x27;re shaving at a 1 setting and you may as well shave your whole beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little larger than most trimmers I&#x27;ve used, and it doesn&#x27;t trim quite as well as I think it should (low power, less precision).  </li>
            <li>Beard shavers by Panasonic use a much better engine than those by other brands (e.g. Wahl), at least in my experience.  </li>
            <li>However, the guide is pretty durable and clicks into each adjustment firmly and didn&#x27;t move on me when I was trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am speaking from the first few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I took another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to sand down the guard and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>First, it can be used wet or day, which means at the very least you can rinse off the head when you&#x27;re finished rather than going at it with a brush and making more mess.</li>
            <li>My previous trimmer could do much shorter with the guard on.    </li>
            <li>At present, the trimmer is dead for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why Panasonic felt the need to make the newer model less powerful, but definitely a huge fail on their part.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as my other battery-operated Remington, but it does the job, weighs less and is easier to hold, and the price was basically a &amp;#34;Throw&#x27;-away&amp;#34; rate.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> The Panasonic brand is consistently great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worlds greatest trimmer</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job and allows me to use rechargeable batteries.  </li>
            <li> Excellent value for money.</li>
            <li> but now I can wash it because its dry/wet which is great!</li>
            <li> Works perfect as description.</li>

            <li> Works great!!</li>
            <li> Definitely great for travel!</li>
            <li> I like the flexibility of not having to dedicate a bathroom outlet to keeping one charged, so it&#x27;s the best option for me.</li>
            <li> This one works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent for the money.</li>
            <li> Perfect if you need a battery operated adjustable trimmer.  </li>

            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> for the price, great product.</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming my goatee in the shower.</li>
            <li> I think this beard trimmer would be great if you have finer hair on your face.  </li>
            <li> Worked great while traveling overseas.  </li>
            <li> great on an Eneloop LSD AA batteries which means it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>

            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> It is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> The adjustable piece is removable and great for trimming neck hair.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has and always will be  inexpensive, great products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wet/dry and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> Great for traveling and camping.</li>
            <li> GREAT product for the money</li>
            <li> Will be great for travel - batteries are easier than AC adapters when traveling.</li>
            <li> The built-in trimmer head is very nice.</li>
            <li> The design of the product fits in hand very nicely.</li>
            <li> If you want a nice trimmer that is waterproof, rechargable, and cuts very good, then plan on spending about twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Sure, this isn&#x27;t the greatest trimmer ever.</li>
            <li> Happy customer! :)</li>
            <li> okay, but not the best I have used.</li>
            <li> Nice product!</li>
            <li> it is good to take on trips around the world.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t worry I cleaned it really good)</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I trust Panasonic and have always had good luck with their consumer electronics.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer seems to be well made, has good battery life and seems to be fairly durable.  </li>
            <li> Perfect size to fit in hand.  </li>
            <li> Considering the price, the build quality is excellent and it runs smooth</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s a good back-up to keep on hand</li>
            <li> Owned the ER240 for 8 yrs, and loved it.</li>
            <li> I thought the features and reviews on this one looked good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is a good value, arrived on time and meets my needs.</li>
            <li> Good product otherwise.</li>
            <li> Great waterproof trimmer comfortable works great</li>
            <li> Good buy, great features (maneuvrability), easy to clean, GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it for my intended use.</li>
            <li> For years I have had its predecessor and was very satisfied but the rechargeable battery gave up.</li>
            <li> Nice product, good value at $12.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I will probably be ordering more to send to him!</li>
            <li> But it is very light and good for travel.</li>
            <li> Works great, smooth and close if you take your time with each stroke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a nose hair trimmer that i really liked until it died-</li>
            <li> The built in guard is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I liked the Remington but the rechargeable battery was losing its ability to hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> I liked it from the start and after six weeks of use</li>
            <li> I found a length I liked (#3) and the guide does not slip from that setting.  </li>
            <li> sometimes can be a good thing as more convience too</li>
            <li> Nice and convenient though.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product.  </li>
            <li> Its not that good on the \\&quot;short\\&quot; trim but otherwise OK.</li>
            <li> The idea is nice -</li>
            <li> Fully submersible is a nice feature so it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> I really liked the look and feel of this trimmer, and it seems well made.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have no wall warts or stands or wires.  </li>
            <li> Definite pluses are its portability (perfect for travel), size, battery operated and being waterproof makes it unique in its features, also priced very fairly.  </li>
            <li> Good power, easy to use, but the trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim evenly.</li>
            <li> Very strong</li>
            <li> Take off the clipper head and very easy to trim neck and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rare thing to get quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> i love panasonic products and own a bunch of them from tvs to shavers.</li>
            <li> best i have used so far.</li>
            <li> Fast / Cheap / Perfect</li>
            <li> So I am very pleased that Panasonic continues to produce this fine product line.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is great for the price and performance,I like it very much.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, all-in-one trimmer that has two distinct advantages over many others.</li>
            <li> it feels good in the hand, cuts easily and cleans easily, too.</li>
            <li> and it worked just fine after that!</li>
            <li> Infact cuts the beard very smoothly.</li>
            <li> My first success was a panasonic travel shaver which has been my best shaver ever.  </li>
            <li> , for what it is, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> There are better models out there in this price range that are rechargable, but aren&#x27;t waterproof.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly used for precision jobs like to trim my neckline and sideburns now as I do the beard trimming with a hair clipper without the guides set to the highest setting, which trims my beard in under 2 minutes compared to 10 with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> the edger works better than my razor to trim my sideburns, believe it or not.</li>
            <li> I have used it for weeks and love it.</li>
            <li> Lay the trimmer with the top, or switch-side, on the bottom, and with the cage pointing toward you.  </li>
            <li> I like this built-in guide better.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see amongst the offerings that Panasonic had an affordable beard/mustache trimmer with the features I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It seems to be sufficiently waterproof to shave in the shower, and being able to use rechargeable/replaceable batteries is good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I need to purchase one for her husbands Christmas stocking since he agrees it works better than his Braun</li>
            <li> there are much better choices.</li>
            <li> But with many shavers that have built in batteries - the battery goes</li>
            <li> For the price I don&#x27;t see how it could have done better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I wish there were a more intermediate setting for a close, but not guard-free close shave.</li>
            <li> I broke it when dropped to wash room floor, cheap product and quality!</li>
            <li> okay for a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> 10x more passings to get a trimmed beard.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> But it works better then</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have plenty of AAA batteries...</li>
            <li> I have been trimming my beard and mustache with scissors and a razor for many years and decided to try out a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> And even more reluctant to have one that would run on either 120v or 220.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish I had paid more attention to the reviews.  </li>
            <li> But I cannot recommend this trimmer if your beard is longer, and has gray in it, like the one the Most Interesting Man in the World wears in the TV commercials.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with this machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many beard trimmers over the years.  </li>
            <li> And the length selection is better for hair on your head not beards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they made the increments more appropriate for regular beards then this would be an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I am sure the scissors you have laying around your apartment would do a better job at trimming than this.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill!</li>
            <li> For the price and quality, I was well satisfied.</li>
            <li> But I do love the results...  </li>
            <li> Love the built in length adjuster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several battery-powered trimmers, and this is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li> I have a $25 Wahl, and it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> but it could be better.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot better than this.</li>
            <li> This is not a quality product, but it works OK.</li>
            <li> , it is battery powered instead of rechargable (most on the market are rechargable</li>
            <li> A lot more.  </li>
            <li> Thought the range of settings would be greater.</li>
            <li> I own several Panasonic devices and they are all really good, so I figured this would be good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, and being battery operated</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still $13.51 as I write this, which is pretty good for the quality.</li>
            <li> It was a very good product lasting for many years and costing about 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;ll be able to travel with it easily.</li>
            <li> Uses AAA batteries, easily found in most countries.</li>
            <li> Most important, no worries about charging it when we travel over seas.</li>
            <li> I find that lighter/smaller makes it a lot more precise when trimming the lenght of my mustache over my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t have cost much more for a cheap plastic holder for the unit to be included--as Wahl does--but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY GOOD PRODUCT&lt;</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had the original one for many, many, many years and we more than got our money&#x27;s worth out of it.  </li>
            <li> the bright side, I really like how light and compact it is, and the ergonomic design is easy to hold and maneuver while trimming.</li>
            <li> The body is ergonomically sculpted and is really easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li> But in my experience, a Panasonic beard trimmer will easily outlast a Remington.  </li>
            <li> The battery compartment, which holds two AAA batteries, is easily opened, but well sealed.</li>
            <li> It is easily removable for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar Panasonic when traveling for more than 13 years to trim my beard which still works great.</li>
            <li> The guide is easily removable and I use it that way to trim the edge of my mustache.  </li>
            <li> Takes triple A batteries which we have laying around, and is easily washed off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Batteries are easy to install and no need to travel with a charger.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The guide slips out of position too easily, and can cause a haircutting accident.</li>
            <li> As for the precision of the trimming adpect, it has an automatic guide attached that makes it extremely easy to get the length you want</li>
            <li> I had the remington trimmer years, still going strong, 9 bucks.</li>
            <li> - the trimmer has a good feel and the removable guide is high quality and is finished well.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is very mild tempered-its not noisy and it works well on the fine points.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t \\&quot;dial up\\&quot; the distance of the cage from the surface of the face as easily and precisely.  </li>
            <li> Battery powered and just fine to trim our Chow Chow.</li>
            <li> It did the job just fine.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER2403 is nicely designed and fits well in my large hand.</li>
            <li> This description is entirely accurate.    </li>
            <li> This product was a huge dissapointment for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and am happy to report that nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and am happy to report that nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> so it will probably work great on those with thinner facial hair.     </li>
            <li> Works great and has power to spare with only its 2@ AAA batt.</li>
            <li> I went cheap, and was I blown away by this product..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s underpowered and cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for trimming beards, mustaches, necks ect.</li>
            <li> This works great as a beard/moustache/other short hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> The difference between the shortest trimmer position and no-guard is huge, you&#x27;re either shaving with no guard and getting pretty close, or leaving a pretty good length of stubble.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard fit and trim as never before.</li>
            <li> I am primarily writing to emphasize these two points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Uses batteries, light weight, one piece --</li>
            <li> What can you expect from a cheap trimmer?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Good, cheap.</li>
            <li> I know what you are thinking, the trimmer was cheap, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The size aids detailed work around mouth to snazz up the goatee and keep the shaggy homeless look at bay.</li>
            <li> This is great if you suffer from low dexterity like I do.  </li>
            <li> Works great with the guard off, but needs multiple passes to get the job done with the guard on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing they put cheap crappy blades on it.  </li>
            <li> I would not want this as my primary trimmer for use at home.</li>
            <li> Does not work as good as my old Remington...</li>
            <li> Paired with rechargeable batteries its very economical.</li>
            <li> The blades are still sharp and cut great, it&#x27;s still easy to clean, waterproof, still a little underpowered, and still works perfectly, albeit it still doesn&#x27;t cut that well.</li>

            <li> , I can no longer find an AC outlet that&#x27;s conveniently located or even accessible.  </li>
            <li> This is the best small, portable trimmer I&#x27;ve found yet</li>
            <li> I originally rated this trimmer at 5 stars (see review below).  </li>
            <li> ER2403K seemed like a great option as it featured almost all the same things I loved about the ER224S but takes regular batteries.</li>
            <li> PANASONIC SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL DESIGN.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t come with a holder or a case, so I kept the original plastic packing material and place</li>
            <li> it would be nice to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Clean cuts without having to worry about charging.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull all the time, about 1 out of 5 strokes, but when it does it isn&#x27;t a clean pull</li>
            <li> I was always a fan of Panasonic having being entertained since the late 1990&#x27;s with their Technics receiver which always did and still does deliver excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Time will tell, but If initial performance continues, this is a good value.</li>
            <li> The only thing it&#x27;s good for is edge trimming (without the adjustable trimmer attached).</li>
            <li> But for touchups, its good enough</li>
            <li> If stubble is how you like your beard, this ER2403K trimmer will probably be a good buy for you, especially for travel.</li>
            <li> Not use full for the &amp;#34;scruff&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I abdolutely love this product based on the fact that it shaves very close (I use it for my head)</li>
            <li> and it hurts more than if you just pulled the hair straight out.  </li>
            <li> previously reviewed, this is a good product -- but lacks a setting that trims as close as most guys like.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Lately have been using Panasonics, and this is a good example of how to keep updates better than the previous incarnations.&lt;br /&gt;The fact you can change the batteries</li>
            <li> I much prefer my older one that had many more adjustments and did not need the oil.  </li>
            <li> As with other Panasonic consumer products, it&#x27;s a good quality device; a bit plasticly, but strong.</li>
            <li> I think these two things lead to the issues folks are complaining about with it leaving beards uneven or taking many passes to work well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good unit.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was packed adequately.  </li>
            <li> It is very compact, which is great for travel, but the head is smaller than I like for use at home.</li>
            <li> Good item for the price and not complicated with numerous attachments.</li>
            <li> the back up is pretty good aswell</li>
            <li> It runs on 2 AAA batteries located under a pretty unique battery door.</li>
            <li> , this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> So far this little fella has been great!</li>
            <li> I gave it an extra star because it&#x27;s proven to be a good product (typical Panasonic, my shelf stereo is over 11 years old and works as good as the day I bought it, even after falling off my dresser!</li>

            <li> /&gt;Another issue is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to be that powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reinstalled fresh batteries, so that may be the problem (though I had no intimation of their losing power).  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a nice unit for the bearded and mustsachioed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different trimmers and this one is okay to good.  </li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and this was worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> Does not feel cheap - feels heavy in a good way.</li>
            <li> It was effective, and needed relatively low quantity of passings through my beard to get it trimmed.</li>
            <li> I would have spent more money on a better trimmer if I&#x27;d known this was going to be sub-par.</li>
            <li> And the guidecomb is more stable that the one on my old trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> Worth buying.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to completely buy into the correlation money quality.</li>
            <li> It looks like something worth 99-cents.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than my previous trimmer and the biggest difference is that the new Pansasonic trimmer blade is much narrower --- better for mustache trimming, but not as good for the beard since it requires many more strokes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having good success so far with panasonic trimmers in general.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is located at the top under the cutter head assembly and is nice and big, making it easy to manipulate when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> AND its priced right.</li>
            <li> And the price was right.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove head (flip it back with your thumb then snap fit to re-attach) to brush away hair, rinse under running water and oil.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> I own a cordless Panasonic ER-224 which works fine for my beard, but the charging cord was misplaced and this inexpensive battery-powered Panasonic model was bought as a stopgap until the cord was found.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t judge it worth more than ten at the time, but I&#x27;d have no hesitations paying 20 for another just like it.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has no cord and is not rechargeable, but I wish it was larger and more powerful.</li>
            <li> Being water-proof is also a big plus and makes it really easy to clean    </li>
            <li> This thing is not only great for travel but regular use as well.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE IS NOT AS GOOD BECAUSE IT DOES NOT TRIM AS SHORT AS THE OLD ONE.  </li>
            <li> However, even if the guide were calibrated to a good set of length options, the trimmer would still be really only useful as a comb, because the blade barely cuts anything.  </li>
            <li> It was far better than advertised, simple easy to use.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up taking the guide and running it on a sander to shave off some of the top to get it to cut shorter.</li>
            <li> Finally, it serves as a reminder that \\&quot;progress\\&quot; (rechargeable batteries) is fraught with many paradoxes, contradictions,</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok for facial hair</li>
            <li> Am pleased with the price and will be back.</li>
            <li> I love not having to keep track of multiple attachments.</li>
            <li> The trimmer delivered exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I like that I can use my rechargeable batteries and they lasted for 30-60 minutes before they needed to be recharged, but overall, I had better things to do than going over and over my beard with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me to replace one, from a different manufacturer, that I owned and enjoyed for years.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered a slightly higher end Remmington.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works really well as of now!</li>
            <li> you can find better at same price.</li>
            <li> This is OK but its not up to Panasonic standard.</li>
            <li> Nice product, Small easy to use and doesn&#x27;t consume much battery</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this one a shot since my last trimmer just died and the reviews on this were fairly positive for the most part.  </li>
            <li> The final product was much more uniform and clean looking with the old set.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs .this is my second purchase and they last a long time.bought</li>
            <li> So, this is great unless you like to have very short hair, in which case you&#x27;ll have to use it with the guard off, which is much harder to get an even length with.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my very, very old Wahl trimmer which was becoming problematic in its old age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The batteries seem to drain pretty fast.</li>
            <li> If i use the unit i will buy more batteries , i will need them since it takes 3 times as long to trim.</li>
            <li> This is true, but easily fixed with some sandpaper applied to the plastic guard.</li>
            <li> particular love how there is only one attachment but</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of many trimmers and selected this one based on the decent reviews and low price ($10).  </li>
            <li> The moveable length guide is far superior to other trimmers&#x27; multiple attachments, which are flimsy and easily lost.</li>
            <li> ( as in planned obsolencence-this may be one of the few good things I learned in high sch</li>
            <li> I put fresh new batteries to trim</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as the chargeable kinds, and you need to keep putting in new batteries periodically.  </li>
            <li> Easily adjustable for my needs and quiet.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades and easy to clean, just rinse.</li>
            <li> it should last a good long while!</li>
            <li> had it for a short time and love it, so far!</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmer, but doesn&#x27;t work that well in the shower.</li>
            <li> No broken parts, no dents or dings</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Moreover, this battery-operated shaver was so cheap [no longer, however] I could throw away the registration/warranty card without a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t cut much of anything.  </li>
            <li> Very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because is fully functional and compact,waterproof and comes with all accesories.</li>
            <li> so you have to throw the whole thing</li>
            <li> Portable trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t know why,it didn&#x27;t really bother my pets.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea with this product however the comb design doesn&#x27;t quite get under and lift the hairs to be cut very well.</li>
            <li> If you had a thicker beard, I&#x27;d wonder if it could really tackle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works very well and is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I have to make a whole bunch of passes to get the hair even-ish though, and it doesn&#x27;t get everything.  </li>
            <li> By the cheap price, at $13.99, I got what I paid for.... a white elephant.</li>
            <li> The distance between each of the 5 adjustable trimmer lengths is too much, but it is manageable in a pinch.</li>
            <li> and I dislike it so much</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It works, and would probably work well if you had super fine hair, but for most normal people it&#x27;s going to result in a frustrating grooming</li>
            <li> crappy item that got broke pretty quickly beside when it was working initially</li>
            <li> Size is good in the hand, and batteries mean I can carry this while traveling with the batteries OUT, so it doesn&#x27;t turn on accidentally.</li>
            <li> Not bad but a little cheaply made</li>
            <li> and i was struck by many bits of sharp plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I travel every day/other day and still have the original one I bought several months ago.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was originally designed for larger size batteries.</li>
            <li> I would clean them regularly, but I am hesitant to wash them out because again, not water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The comb encases the head so no worries of nicks and the trimmer is a nice  small convenient size.</li>
            <li> Put new batteries in &amp; it wouldn&#x27;t even cut my husbands beard!</li>
            <li> My son went to Africa for 27 months with the peace corps and he can&#x27;t live without his ranch!</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I kept a really, really short beard, this would work better, but at the middle setting, I have to go over and over and over and over my beard to get an even trim.</li>
            <li> ONLY drawback to this is it doesn&#x27;t have a tremendous amount of power</li>
            <li> nice but suitable for bear more; it&#x27;ll be difficult to use for head, as the blade is very small.</li>
            <li> but the plastic is high quality</li>
            <li> You need to keep your fades high, and you need to keep them tight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite practical and cost effective, and arguably matches up to a more expensive trimmer!.</li>
            <li> Other than that it absolutely does the job, is light and does not need charging.</li>
            <li> You would be surprised how many of these ate in the stores for up to 100.00 that you can&#x27;t even get wet!</li>
            <li> It comes with a small brush so you can do that very easily.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what kinds of outlets I would have access to, so this little guy did the trick.</li>
            <li> Sharp, watertight, easy to change the batteries.</li>
            <li> will keep this unit because I really value the replaceable batteries, and it is adequate for my limited mustache work.  </li>
            <li> as they come (of course, if your beard is made of Golden Fleece or gun-barrel metal, it may, as some have claimed, fall short of discharging its owner&#x27;s assignment in flying colors--in that case, try a corded electric).  </li>
            <li> I had to put it on the lowest setting and it still left the hair 1/2 inch long in most spots...</li>
            <li> Too many products have built in batteries, which diminish over time leading to tech waste and landfill sadness (plus the charging area looks cluttered and</li>
            <li> It uses AAA size batteries, however trying to install them and figuring out which way they go can be a little bit of a problem, because the little picture molded in the plastic is hard to see, and they don&#x27;t fit perfectly, the batteries wobble a bit.</li>
            <li> it is probably not a good trimmer for those who want a strong trimmer or have a full beard to trim.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is VERY EASY to CLEAN - just rinse it under the tap, dry it with a towel, and store it with the blade facing down until next time&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> for how I like my mustache length, but I&#x27;ll be trimming it far more often because I can&#x27;t get it a little closer.  </li>
            <li> a new model has been ordered.</li>
            <li> For that reason, my priority was to get a new unit that had replaceable batteries, which is how I ended up with</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my mb20 remington that i have used for years and paid $9 new.</li>
            <li> Second, it uses replaceable batteries, rather than rechargeables, so if the batteries are empty you just slip in new ones, rather than waiting an hour or more for it to charge.</li>
            <li> I have used it for the first time today and find it very small and light compared to the Norelco and with much finer blade teeth.</li>
            <li> May not be for very frequent users.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s compact, astonishingly quiet and very very</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m accustomed to, and gets significantly bogged down by a thick beard, but it&#x27;s great to be able to trim in the shower since I can never seem to get all the hair-dust out of my counter grout nomatter</li>
            <li> other great advantage being its wet and dry as well</li>
            <li> first impressions were mixed.</li>
            <li> However, this trimmer is significantly inferior to every other beard trimmer I have ever owned (including Philips, Remington, and Wahl models).  </li>
            <li> Just purchased this second exact moustache trimmer for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  </li>
            <li> the old one we can take with us when we travel and the new one we&#x27;ll keep at home.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is mandatory after use due to lack of vacuum feature...a nice extra</li>
            <li> It also has self-sharpening stainless steel blades that Panasonic says will last for about 5 years under normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I was expecting a lot, but unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> Somehow, it misses half the hairs, so you have to keep going over the same area many times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly very durable and stays where you set it, but it&#x27;s made in such a way that I don&#x27;t think the hair can always get in there easily, and it clogs with hair fairly easily, especially if the hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, I use this without the guard most of the time and deal with the fact that it trims a little too close for my taste.</li>
            <li> Once in a great while it will pull a bit before cutting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Panasonic ER224S, but when the battery finally have up the ghost (after 2 years of regular use) and I came back to Amazon to purchase a replacement I thought I would check out my options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> trim hair evenly or completely</li>
            <li> trim hair evenly or completely</li>
            <li> i completely submersed the shave in water and it still works like a champ.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to say as far as longevity is concerned</li>
            <li> I like the comb so far because it helps to minimize mistakes.  </li>
            <li> Overall you get what you pay for, an inexpensive shaver that gets the job done, and has everything you really need in a self contained unit.</li>
            <li> I can use it in the shower, directly under the water and all.</li>
            <li> Anyway it is portable enough for trip, do NOT expect too much.</li>
            <li> Sits next to the bathroom sink ready to go.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace my old trimmer which needed to be plugged into the wall to recharge.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived 2 days early.</li>
            <li> Not perfectly clear at first glance.</li>
            <li> I hate it when companies rework and ruin perfectly wonderful products.</li>
            <li> I kind of just give up when I get tired of trying to make it do what I want, which is make</li>
            <li> I see the other reviews are very positive -- perhaps it works better for more closely trimmed beards or maybe I just got a bad unit.</li>
            <li> (I have yet to enter a store when there wasn&#x27;t a 2 for 1 deal on at least one brand of battery), easily procured, and so cheap that the problem I&#x27;m having is less one of running out of batteries than out of drawer space to accommodate all of the batteries acquired because of these never-ending</li>
            <li> Small easy to use.</li>
            <li> Batteries died down quickly in it.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no mess</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry and its trimming action is smooth and even.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;[I paid ten bucks for this in June 2010 and it looks exactly the same today.  </li>
            <li> and I know I&#x27;m not the first to say this) is that the shortest setting isn&#x27;t really short enough for me.  </li>
            <li> my older Norelco trimmer finally broke in a manner that was unfixable prompting me to look for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Recommend high output rechargeable NiMh such as Eneloop, etc.  </li>
            <li> Also, it feels as light as a toothbrush in the hand--ideal for touch-up trims with the cage removed--and takes up no more room on \\&quot;my\\&quot; shelf in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The only negative is putting a drop of oil on the blade - not difficult, not annoying, just an extra 30 seconds when I am trying to get out the door in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Really like this trimmer because it&#x27;s accurate and powerful as I have very thick black hair.</li>
            <li> This new model is very similar</li>
            <li> buying a new ER224S now, and I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> had read reviews about low power and also how you couldn&#x27;t get a very close trim unless you took the guard totally off.  </li>
            <li> My last beard trimmer&#x27;s &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting left the stubble much shorter.</li>
            <li> After at least 5-7 sessions - it&#x27;s still going strong, so assume I have a while before the batteries run</li>
            <li> The blades were either not sharp or not alined, though pulling was not a problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a particularly dense beard, but I like to keep it about 3/4 inch long.</li>
            <li> (Maybe other owners have a trimmer more clearly marked than mine, which has the same model number but was half of the current price.)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Machine has great features but it cuts badly.</li>
            <li> If you just barely squeeze it there, it moves with ease.</li>
            <li> So far seems to be solidly built.  </li>
            <li> Of course it falls far short of plug-in trimmers, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers!</li>
            <li> The result looked worse and more ragged than if I&#x27;d not bothered trimming.    </li>
            <li> I can use my own rechargeable batteries and don&#x27;t have to worry about plugs or replacing silly chargers and rechargeable units</li>
            <li> \\&quot;specials.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the cost of batteries is not sufficiently exorbitant to make up for the \\&quot;cost\\&quot; in space, frustration, and even direct expenditures (for the higher cost of the gadget itself--that constant \\&quot;trickle\\&quot; of electricity due to all of the rechargeable units throughout the house).  </li>
            <li> It is a very good trimmer, but it runs on AAA batteries, so don&#x27;t expect to cut you hair with it (at least, not perfectly)</li>
            <li> They are much quieter, with less vibration, and batteries last far longer.  </li>
            <li> Go directly to  Panasonic corporate site, Consumer Products, and zoom in on the illustration for battery positioning on the proper instruction page.  </li>
            <li> only issue is you have to be careful on with the setting, it can slip and then you&#x27;re shaving at a 1 setting and you may as well shave your whole beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little larger than most trimmers I&#x27;ve used, and it doesn&#x27;t trim quite as well as I think it should (low power, less precision).  </li>
            <li> Beard shavers by Panasonic use a much better engine than those by other brands (e.g. Wahl), at least in my experience.  </li>
            <li> However, the guide is pretty durable and clicks into each adjustment firmly and didn&#x27;t move on me when I was trimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am speaking from the first few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I took another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to sand down the guard and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> First, it can be used wet or day, which means at the very least you can rinse off the head when you&#x27;re finished rather than going at it with a brush and making more mess.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer could do much shorter with the guard on.    </li>
            <li> At present, the trimmer is dead for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Panasonic felt the need to make the newer model less powerful, but definitely a huge fail on their part.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my other battery-operated Remington, but it does the job, weighs less and is easier to hold, and the price was basically a &amp;#34;Throw&#x27;-away&amp;#34; rate.  </li>
            <li> A major factor in my decision to buy was the power by dry cells.  </li>
            <li> Usually the positive end of the battery does not meet with the the flexible, \\&quot;springy\\&quot; end in the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> So... it basically works, but it takes way too much time and effort compared to the several other trimmers I have owned previously.</li>
            <li> Reliable and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The guide&#x27;s settings range from bushy axe-murderer on the short end to Rip Van Winkle at the longest setting (i.e. it&#x27;s way too long for my beard, even at the shortest setting).  </li>
            <li> Also when placed in the lowest trim height, the beard is left quite long.</li>
            <li> My only drawback is that the overall process seems to take a bit longer due to it being a little less powerful</li>
            <li> For the price, if you don&#x27;t mind the poor cutting performance, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> For the price, if you don&#x27;t mind the poor cutting performance, it&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> It tried, and after 10 minutes there was less hair on my face, but my wife was always surprised when I told her that I just trimmed my beard.  </li>
            <li> I dropped it in the toilet once</li>
            <li> From this perspective, the left-side battery is placed with the positive (+) end pointing furthest away from you; the right-side battery must have the negative (-) end pointing furthest away from you.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little soft when trimming.</li>
            <li> and it runs on the battery power for quite a long time before the batteries need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> or you can remove it), and (2) that it goes quite long (up to about 3/4&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> how long I scrub.</li>
            <li> just bought some Enloop AAA rechargables and then as long as the trimmer doesn&#x27;t fall apart</li>
            <li> The lowest adjustable comb number is also ridiculously long leaving you no alternative but looking like you lost a battle with a weed-wacker.</li>
            <li> It can be used with water and the blades have really long life.  </li>
            <li> Pulls occasionally, but not much.</li>
            <li> The shortest setting is rather long.</li>
            <li> and I did only half of my face and batteries got low and dint work</li>
            <li> Low speed motor typical of battery trimmers was only part of the problem.</li>
            <li> This ended up being a waste of money for me, because unlike its wonderful predecessor that I bought years ago (whose blades are a bit dull at this point), Panasonic unfortunately went and reworked this product, and it&#x27;s useless to me because it doesn&#x27;t trim my goatee nearly closely enough.</li>
            <li> The original trimmer I had was a \\&quot;Shaveman\\&quot;, which has become extremely difficult to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, sharp, and is sealed to prevent water from getting in.  </li>
            <li> for the power, it does feel pretty weak with the two AAA batteries.  </li>
            <li> piece of junk, tried it once had to buy an other brand  that actually trims hair, DONT NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> If you push on it just a little harder, the guide snaps loose from the locking tabs, and oops, there goes a unexpected chunk of hair.</li>
            <li> The trimmer still worked, but the blades were moving slow and didn&#x27;t have enough power to completely cut the hairs so it would grab and pull them on occasion</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the shortest setting (without taking the guard off) isn&#x27;t short enough.</li>
            <li> it is not worth the low cost.</li>
            <li> The attachment adjusts up and down so that there is just one that does different lengths.</li>
            <li> That keeps the trimmer compact and lighteright, and it will trim body hair and beards just fine, but my thick whiskers made it bogg down, which is hard on batteries.</li>
            <li> The door is actually a cover on the bottom half of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I found that I could trim a section for about 60 seconds and it would only cut about half the hairs.</li>
            <li> The 2403 can be used, Panasonic claims, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> and I like its matte black design, size, and the ability to use rechargeable AA batteries rather than a built in Li-on or NiMh battery that will inevitably die after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had my previous pair of clippers (same brand) for 10 years before it died, and I never had to do that.  </li>
            <li> If it is to be your main beard trimmer, I would recommend a more expensive model, something with smaller distances between the cutting lengths.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CAUTION: when using without the black plastic spacer (so that the metal cutting area is exposed), be sure to PUSH the handle away from you, do not pull towards you.</li>
            <li> decent quality, but poor performance due to under-powered motor or too short trimmer blade.</li>
            <li> This one uses batteries and hums away, cutting smoothly.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is made entirely of ABS plastic, and I have dropped this a few times and it is durable.</li>
            <li> Call me a traditionalist, but I&#x27;ve never tried wet and probably won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but at this price point not to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this after using a Remington MB200 for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> If this one goes dead, simply replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> If you use them in a moist environment, the batteries will get wet and corrode.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you&#x27;re careful, it&#x27;s a winner, waterproof and no cord or charger you use AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> These battery trimmers should be better in the long run because they have no battery unit to wear out and cause the trimmer to be worthless-</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s very little difference in the settings (1 through 5) related to the amount of hair removed.</li>
            <li> You should be aware, however, that this piece of machinery is relatively tiny, less than an inch wide at the cutting end.  </li>
            <li> As other people have described, it skips a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> Something that was always hit and miss with the Norelco due to it&#x27;s size and weight.</li>
            <li> other patches were even longer.  </li>
            <li> Hair trimmer can be used anywhere, since it has batteries, cutters are sharp.</li>
            <li> Almost all the other trimmers I checked out also require oiling so this appears to be part of the deal.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer blades are sharp, and cut well.</li>
            <li> (No more running out of juice mid hair trim because I forgot to plug it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this is due to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d agree with some of the other comments.</li>
            <li> Panasonic produces AbFab TVs and other appliances.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and if you forget to plug it...), and it is extremely lightweight and ergonomic.</li>
            <li> It gives a very uneven \\&quot;cut\\&quot;,  and, it snagged several times.    </li>
            <li> A very uneven variable trim from the start as i found myself having to go over the same spot again and again.</li>
            <li> It trims pretty well, however it has a major problem with the Hair Cutting Guide not locking solidly in place, because the plastic tabs fail to hold it properly.</li>
            <li> The blades get dull quick, and if you have thick hair, you need to do at least 10 passes to trim hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was small, lightweight, ergonomic, had 5 cutting adjustments, and was completely waterproof (you can immerse it, unlike some of the more expensive comparable models).</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few times a month for the past 4 months all on the same charge.</li>
            <li> The down side is that choices are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just pushes the hair down</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time Googling for the manual for this or any other instruction manual--they&#x27;re</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the blade isn&#x27;t very sharp, or what, but in order to get the hair cut, I have to hold it out taut perpendicular to the skin as I run the clippers over it.  </li>
            <li> Squeeze the 2 sides of the lower half while simultaneously pushing forward with your thumbs, thus disclosing the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review: less than a year</li>
            <li> this is the 2nd panasonic item i&#x27;ve bought with nearly customer-proof, dang dangerous packaging.</li>
            <li> The blade guard has 5 positions and is attached to the trimmer, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about storing a bunch of those black plastic length guards.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut thick or long hair.</li>
            <li> it was sealed TIGHTLY and the plastic was quite brittle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably stick with this despite the poor cutting because of simplicity (not tons of attachements to lose or chargers to keep track of or batteries that will go bad) and the waterproof feature, which makes it easy to clean.    </li>
            <li> and I had a lot of trouble with previous trimmers that had built-in batteries since the batteries would no longer hold a charge at some point.  </li>
            <li> It also came with a little bottle of oil for  lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It would have been a 5 star for me if the trimming on scale 1 was a little closer</li>
            <li> I had a battery-operated Vidal Sassoon beard trimmer that just got louder and louder and started snagging my beard while I trimmed it, so I tossed it aside in favor of this little</li>
            <li> That position is just a little longer than stubble.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is due to batteries or just how it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li> It is small, about 6 inches long and less than 2 inches thick.</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last too long on a set of batteries, especially since it takes longer to get the job done due to the poor cutting.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until it was set to the next-to-shortest position that it began to cut, but then it was cutting my beard much closer than I wanted.</li>
            <li> a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Without its guard, it does cut close and uneven - makes you look like you forgot to shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trim my beard too often, and didn&#x27;t want to hassle with recharcables or find them dead after a month of not using it.  </li>
            <li> I had two with rechargeable, internal batteries that failed after the 2nd or third charge and became useless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pretty good product, and being battery operated it is good to take on trips around the world.</li>
            <li> Low cost, water proof, uses two regular AAA batteries, comes with blade oil.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Nice product, good value at $12. The Panasonic brand is consistently great!</li>
            <li> I put fresh new batteries to trim and I did only half of my face and batteries got low and dint work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor.</li>
            <li> This is battery operated. Not perfectly clear at first glance. It&#x27;s not as powerful as the chargeable kinds, and you need to keep putting in new batteries periodically.  Especially if you use only occasionally, it works well.  May not be for very frequent users.</li>
            <li> I bought this online 2 years ago when I decided to start growing a beard. I bought this because it was small, lightweight, ergonomic, had 5 cutting adjustments, and was completely waterproof (you can immerse it, unlike some of the more expensive comparable models). Plus, it&#x27;s a Panasonic. I own several Panasonic devices and they are all really good, so I figured this would be good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions were mixed. It is small, about 6 inches long and less than 2 inches thick. The body is ergonomically sculpted and is really easy to hold and manipulate. It&#x27;s also comfortable in my hand. I have only dropped this 3 times that I can remember. It has a removable sliding cutting guard that has 5 height adjustments, from (roughly) 1/8 inch to 1/2 inch. The on/off switch is located at the top under the cutter head assembly and is nice and big, making it easy to manipulate when your hands are wet. It runs on 2 AAA batteries located under a pretty unique battery door. The door is actually a cover on the bottom half of the trimmer. You pull it off to access the batteries and just push it back on when finished. It has a rubber O ring seal to keep water out. It also has self-sharpening stainless steel blades that Panasonic says will last for about 5 years under normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I was expecting a lot, but unfortunately I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it. I wanted to trim my beard very short, like stubble-length, but even on the lowest setting, it wasn&#x27;t short enough. I actually ended up taking the guide and running it on a sander to shave off some of the top to get it to cut shorter. Also, the trimmer guide is terrible. It doesn&#x27;t line up or \\&quot;guide\\&quot; the hairs into the blades, it sort of pushes them around or moves them off to the sides away from the blades. Some get through and get cut, but it seems like a lot of them are missed and I have to go back over the same spot over and over to get the stragglers. However, the guide is pretty durable and clicks into each adjustment firmly and didn&#x27;t move on me when I was trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem to be that powerful. It runs on 2 AAA batteries for 3 volts. That keeps the trimmer compact and lighteright, and it will trim body hair and beards just fine, but my thick whiskers made it bogg down, which is hard on batteries. Speaking of batteries, you will be replacing them about every 2 hours of run time depending on what you are trimming. I did a big overhaul on my beard this morning after letting it grow for a month. It took me 45 minutes to cut it down to size because of the poor cutter guide design, and it went through one set of batteries. The trimmer still worked, but the blades were moving slow and didn&#x27;t have enough power to completely cut the hairs so it would grab and pull them on occasion (ouch). I wonder why Panasonic didn&#x27;t make this rechargable? If you want to make this rechargable, go buy some rechargable AAA batteries and a charger. You will get longer run time and save money over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, I really like how light and compact it is, and the ergonomic design is easy to hold and maneuver while trimming. It is also waterproof so I can take it in the shower without it getting waterlogged. I dropped it in the toilet once (don&#x27;t worry I cleaned it really good) and it worked just fine after that! The trimmer is made entirely of ABS plastic, and I have dropped this a few times and it is durable. No broken parts, no dents or dings either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also easy to clean. The blade assembly is like a cartridge that can be removed and cleaned inside. It comes with a small brush so you can do that very easily. There are also drain holes that let you run water through the internal mechanism to flush any hairs out. It also came with a little bottle of oil for  lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic quality&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;Compact&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;Completely waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t trim hair evenly or completely&lt;br /&gt;Poorly designed cutting guide&lt;br /&gt;A little underpowered&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t trim to stubble length&lt;br /&gt;AAA batteries don&#x27;t last long&lt;br /&gt;Not rechargable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for what it is, it&#x27;s okay. It trims and that&#x27;s about it. For the price, if you don&#x27;t mind the poor cutting performance, it&#x27;s very good. There are better models out there in this price range that are rechargable, but aren&#x27;t waterproof. If you want a nice trimmer that is waterproof, rechargable, and cuts very good, then plan on spending about twice as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONG-TERM UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now and am happy to report that nothing has changed. The blades are still sharp and cut great, it&#x27;s still easy to clean, waterproof, still a little underpowered, and still works perfectly, albeit it still doesn&#x27;t cut that well. It&#x27;s mostly used for precision jobs like to trim my neckline and sideburns now as I do the beard trimming with a hair clipper without the guides set to the highest setting, which trims my beard in under 2 minutes compared to 10 with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still hesitantly recommend it though. I gave it an extra star because it&#x27;s proven to be a good product (typical Panasonic, my shelf stereo is over 11 years old and works as good as the day I bought it, even after falling off my dresser! Our Panasonic vacuum lasted almost 9 years before we replaced it) and has served me well, but I can&#x27;t get around the annoying cutting guide.letely waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t trim hair evenly or completely&lt;br /&gt;Poorly designed cutting guide&lt;br /&gt;A little underpowered&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t trim to stubble length&lt;br /&gt;AAA batteries don&#x27;t last long&lt;br /&gt;Not rechargable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for what it is, it&#x27;s okay.

Our Panasonic vacuum lasted almost 9 years before we replaced it) and has served me well, but I can&#x27;t get around the annoying cutting guide.</li>
            <li> i needed a trimmer and it had to be waterproof because that is how my last one died. for the price, great product. the edger works better than my razor to trim my sideburns, believe it or not. i completely submersed the shave in water and it still works like a champ. highly recommend! i&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a year and am just writing this review. i haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product and if i decide to purchase an electric razor one day it&#x27;s gonna be a panasonic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worlds greatest trimmer but it serves its purpose. I have very thick facial hair so it will probably work great on those with thinner facial hair.     I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Works great and has power to spare with only its 2@ AAA batt. AND its priced right.</li>
            <li> Sure, this isn&#x27;t the greatest trimmer ever. I would not buy this for at home use. But it is very light and good for travel. Most important, no worries about charging it when we travel over seas. I am very pleased with it for my intended use.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s just fine.  I much prefer my older one that had many more adjustments and did not need the oil.  This one has 5 height adjustments.</li>
            <li> Fast / Cheap / Perfect</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a particularly dense beard, but I like to keep it about 3/4 inch long. I found that I could trim a section for about 60 seconds and it would only cut about half the hairs. The result looked worse and more ragged than if I&#x27;d not bothered trimming.    I see the other reviews are very positive -- perhaps it works better for more closely trimmed beards or maybe I just got a bad unit.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic comes as advertised. I have used it for weeks and love it. No problems. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Very strong and it runs on the battery power for quite a long time before the batteries need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Great waterproof trimmer comfortable works great</li>
            <li> The original trimmer I had was a \\&quot;Shaveman\\&quot;, which has become extremely difficult to find. It was a very good product lasting for many years and costing about 5 bucks. This ER2403K 5 trimmer is as close as I could get to that \\&quot;shaveman\\&quot;. So far it&#x27;s working well. It&#x27;s too soon to say as far as longevity is concerned but it seems durable enough to last a while. Definite pluses are its portability (perfect for travel), size, battery operated and being waterproof makes it unique in its features, also priced very fairly.  It would have been a 5 star for me if the trimming on scale 1 was a little closer but overall I give it a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> {Discovered 11/13/11: Proper insertion of the batteries is not indicated on my trimmer even though insertion is counter-intuitive.  Don&#x27;t waste time Googling for the manual for this or any other instruction manual--they&#x27;re all \\&quot;for-profit\\&quot; scams.  Go directly to  Panasonic corporate site, Consumer Products, and zoom in on the illustration for battery positioning on the proper instruction page.  Usually the positive end of the battery does not meet with the the flexible, \\&quot;springy\\&quot; end in the battery compartment.  That is not the case here.  Proceed as follows:  1.  Lay the trimmer with the top, or switch-side, on the bottom, and with the cage pointing toward you.  2. Squeeze the 2 sides of the lower half while simultaneously pushing forward with your thumbs, thus disclosing the battery compartment. 3. From this perspective, the left-side battery is placed with the positive (+) end pointing furthest away from you; the right-side battery must have the negative (-) end pointing furthest away from you.  (Maybe other owners have a trimmer more clearly marked than mine, which has the same model number but was half of the current price.)]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[I paid ten bucks for this in June 2010 and it looks exactly the same today.  I didn&#x27;t judge it worth more than ten at the time, but I&#x27;d have no hesitations paying 20 for another just like it.  No frills, no recharging, no water-proofing, no micro-settings with ball bearing controls--but it&#x27;s as handy-dandy as they come (of course, if your beard is made of Golden Fleece or gun-barrel metal, it may, as some have claimed, fall short of discharging its owner&#x27;s assignment in flying colors--in that case, try a corded electric).  At present, the trimmer is dead for the first time.  I&#x27;ve never reinstalled fresh batteries, so that may be the problem (though I had no intimation of their losing power).  Or it could be a broken connection or switch.  Regardless, no complaints.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: less than a year, the price on this very basic Panasonic trimmer has gone up 40%, which requires me to remove a star from my rating.  You should be aware, however, that this piece of machinery is relatively tiny, less than an inch wide at the cutting end.  But in my experience, a Panasonic beard trimmer will easily outlast a Remington.  Also, it feels as light as a toothbrush in the hand--ideal for touch-up trims with the cage removed--and takes up no more room on \\&quot;my\\&quot; shelf in the bathroom. Finally, it serves as a reminder that \\&quot;progress\\&quot; (rechargeable batteries) is fraught with many paradoxes, contradictions, problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to rechargeable cameras, MP3 players, GPS units, phones, notebook computers, etc., I can no longer find an AC outlet that&#x27;s conveniently located or even accessible.  And unless you keep the gadget plugged in at all times, you know you can count on its losing its charge when you need it most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution?  Batteries.  They&#x27;re the leading \\&quot;loss leaders\\&quot; at mass chain stores like Walgreen&#x27;s (I have yet to enter a store when there wasn&#x27;t a 2 for 1 deal on at least one brand of battery), easily procured, and so cheap that the problem I&#x27;m having is less one of running out of batteries than out of drawer space to accommodate all of the batteries acquired because of these never-ending \\&quot;specials.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the cost of batteries is not sufficiently exorbitant to make up for the \\&quot;cost\\&quot; in space, frustration, and even direct expenditures (for the higher cost of the gadget itself--that constant \\&quot;trickle\\&quot; of electricity due to all of the rechargeable units throughout the house).  Moreover, this battery-operated shaver was so cheap [no longer, however] I could throw away the registration/warranty card without a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one deficiency compared to the Remington rechargeable: you can&#x27;t \\&quot;dial up\\&quot; the distance of the cage from the surface of the face as easily and precisely.  Otherwise, the \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; column overwhelms the \\&quot;Con\\&quot; ledger when comparing this shaver to any of the rechargeable units.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Does an excellent job and allows me to use rechargeable batteries.  Very good investment</li>
            <li> As other people have described, it skips a lot of hair. Perhaps if I kept a really, really short beard, this would work better, but at the middle setting, I have to go over and over and over and over my beard to get an even trim. So... it basically works, but it takes way too much time and effort compared to the several other trimmers I have owned previously. I like that it has no cord and is not rechargeable, but I wish it was larger and more powerful.</li>
            <li> I had a battery-operated Vidal Sassoon beard trimmer that just got louder and louder and started snagging my beard while I trimmed it, so I tossed it aside in favor of this little Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s compact, astonishingly quiet and very very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint (and I know I&#x27;m not the first to say this) is that the shortest setting isn&#x27;t really short enough for me.  But I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry and its trimming action is smooth and even.  Excellent value for money.</li>
            <li> I went cheap, and was I blown away by this product.. It was far better than advertised, simple easy to use. It&#x27;s a rare thing to get quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> I had one of these before and unfortunately lent it to someone and never got it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works like a charm. Reliable and long lasting. This is the only beard trimmer for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer wrote that the shortest setting isn&#x27;t very short. This is true, but easily fixed with some sandpaper applied to the plastic guard.</li>
            <li> Works great, smooth and close if you take your time with each stroke.</li>
            <li> Not bad but a little cheaply made and it takes a while to trim beard.</li>
            <li> This is an awful product.    I bought it because I trust Panasonic and have always had good luck with their consumer electronics.  However, this trimmer is significantly inferior to every other beard trimmer I have ever owned (including Philips, Remington, and Wahl models).  The guide&#x27;s settings range from bushy axe-murderer on the short end to Rip Van Winkle at the longest setting (i.e. it&#x27;s way too long for my beard, even at the shortest setting).  However, even if the guide were calibrated to a good set of length options, the trimmer would still be really only useful as a comb, because the blade barely cuts anything.  Before buying I remember reading that another shopper described the experience as trying to cut your beard with an egg beater.  This description is entirely accurate.    Save your money and get a trimmer from Philips or another brand.  Panasonic, stick to TVs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having good success so far with panasonic trimmers in general. My first success was a panasonic travel shaver which has been my best shaver ever.  I&#x27;ve had a nose hair trimmer that i really liked until it died- a new model has been ordered. This trimmer is very mild tempered-its not noisy and it works well on the fine points. I like the comb so far because it helps to minimize mistakes.  These battery trimmers should be better in the long run because they have no battery unit to wear out and cause the trimmer to be worthless- so its a \\&quot;green\\&quot; way to shave. Some of the non-battery trimmers and shavers will simply stop working when the permanently installed battery unit wears out .( as in planned obsolencence-this may be one of the few good things I learned in high sch</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming my goatee in the shower. It is water proof and the guide does come off. I have been using it a few times a month for the past 4 months all on the same charge.</li>
            <li> Battery powered and just fine to trim our Chow Chow. We use it to keep him trimmed and looking neat between grooming. Its quiet too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my very, very old Wahl trimmer which was becoming problematic in its old age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Panasonic ER2403 is nicely designed and fits well in my large hand. The battery compartment, which holds two AAA batteries, is easily opened, but well sealed. The built-in trimmer head is very nice. On my Wahl, the trimmer guide was a separate part and had to be installed for each use. I like this built-in guide better. It is easily removable for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The shortest trim setting is 1/8th inch, which will probably not please those people who want to look like they didn&#x27;t shave for a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The 2403 can be used, Panasonic claims, wet or dry. Call me a traditionalist, but I&#x27;ve never tried wet and probably won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The compact, sleek design lends itself to packing for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, this is a nice unit for the bearded and mustsachioed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry</li>
            <li> This product is a piece of crap. Avoid!&lt;br /&gt;The motor is very weak even with fully charged batteries. I use Eneloop rechargeable batteries that I charge with my Powerex charger-analyzer.&lt;br /&gt;The blade design is very bad such that it will not cut at all when it wears out. Comb is too narrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy a battery powered trimmer again. The power is simply not there. Replaced this with similarly priced Wahl 79300-400 trimmer and the difference is night and day.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the price and I wanted to opt out of a rechargable shaver, because I am replacing a rechargable shaver in which the batteries went bad. It seems to have trouble cutting my facial hair compared to my previous Conair kit. But it seems well built otherwise, I like that it is waterproof.     It doesn&#x27;t last too long on a set of batteries, especially since it takes longer to get the job done due to the poor cutting. I&#x27;ll probably stick with this despite the poor cutting because of simplicity (not tons of attachements to lose or chargers to keep track of or batteries that will go bad) and the waterproof feature, which makes it easy to clean.    Overall you get what you pay for, an inexpensive shaver that gets the job done, and has everything you really need in a self contained unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar Panasonic when traveling for more than 13 years to trim my beard which still works great. This new model is very similar but now I can wash it because its dry/wet which is great! I like it !</li>
            <li> I trim my mustache once every 2-3 weeks... my older Norelco trimmer finally broke in a manner that was unfixable prompting me to look for a replacement. I was always a fan of Panasonic having being entertained since the late 1990&#x27;s with their Technics receiver which always did and still does deliver excellent quality. I was pleased to see amongst the offerings that Panasonic had an affordable beard/mustache trimmer with the features I was looking for. I have used it for the first time today and find it very small and light compared to the Norelco and with much finer blade teeth. I find that lighter/smaller makes it a lot more precise when trimming the lenght of my mustache over my lips. Something that was always hit and miss with the Norelco due to it&#x27;s size and weight. The Panasonic is VERY EASY to CLEAN - just rinse it under the tap, dry it with a towel, and store it with the blade facing down until next time&#x27;s use. Good buy, great features (maneuvrability), easy to clean, GREAT PRICE!</li>
            <li> Works perfect as description. Not too power for regular hair but it&#x27;s ok for facial hair</li>
            <li> This is a superb travel trimmer!  It takes longer to use, but it&#x27;s compact and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particular love how there is only one attachment but that it&#x27;s (1) adjustable (5 lengths / or you can remove it), and (2) that it goes quite long (up to about 3/4&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignore other reviewers who say it&#x27;s hard to adjust the length -- they&#x27;ve failed to notice the little pinch points that you&#x27;re supposed to (barely) squeeze, to unlock the position so that you can adjust it.  If you just barely squeeze it there, it moves with ease.</li>
            <li> This trimmer seems to be well made, has good battery life and seems to be fairly durable.  It seems to be sufficiently waterproof to shave in the shower, and being able to use rechargeable/replaceable batteries is good.&lt;br /&gt;I think its biggest problem is the guard.  It&#x27;s certainly very durable and stays where you set it, but it&#x27;s made in such a way that I don&#x27;t think the hair can always get in there easily, and it clogs with hair fairly easily, especially if the hair is wet.  I think these two things lead to the issues folks are complaining about with it leaving beards uneven or taking many passes to work well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good unit.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great for the price and performance,I like it very much.You don&#x27;t have a bunch of attachments to keep up with and I am always on the go don&#x27;t have time to hunt for the attachments.Am pleased with the price and will be back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different trimmers and this one is okay to good.  It&#x27;s a little larger than most trimmers I&#x27;ve used, and it doesn&#x27;t trim quite as well as I think it should (low power, less precision).  The built in guard is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer between hair cuts for neck hairs I trim my daughter has used it to trim her husbands mustache now I need to purchase one for her husbands Christmas stocking since he agrees it works better than his Braun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming my beard with the same pair of electric clippers that I use on my hair, and got this because it&#x27;s battery powered, lighter, and goes to a shorter minimum length. It&#x27;s obviously not as strong as the wall-powered clippers I&#x27;m accustomed to, and gets significantly bogged down by a thick beard, but it&#x27;s great to be able to trim in the shower since I can never seem to get all the hair-dust out of my counter grout nomatter how long I scrub. It&#x27;s still $13.51 as I write this, which is pretty good for the quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it uses regular AAA batteries and I had a lot of trouble with previous trimmers that had built-in batteries since the batteries would no longer hold a charge at some point.  Now I can just use rechargable AAA batteries.    Being water-proof is also a big plus and makes it really easy to clean    The only downside is that it is lacking in power and doesn&#x27;t work that well on my curly beard.</li>
            <li> Works great!! I can use it in the shower, directly under the water and all. Love it!</li>
            <li> crappy item that got broke pretty quickly beside when it was working initially it was very slow and weak. I would never recommended</li>
            <li> i love panasonic products and own a bunch of them from tvs to shavers. sadly this beard trimmer is a piece of junk. it&#x27;s underpowered and cheaply constructed. the trimmer adjustment is basically non functional so there&#x27;s very little difference in the settings (1 through 5) related to the amount of hair removed. a waste of money. there are much better choices. sorry panasonic. go back to the drawing board on this one.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for trimming beards, mustaches, necks ect. The attachment adjusts up and down so that there is just one that does different lengths. I love not having to keep track of multiple attachments. Paired with rechargeable batteries its very economical.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Put new batteries in &amp; it wouldn&#x27;t even cut my husbands beard!</li>
            <li> This product was a huge dissapointment for me.  It just doesn&#x27;t cut much of anything.  I had to put it on the lowest setting and it still left the hair 1/2 inch long in most spots... other patches were even longer.  It gives a very uneven \\&quot;cut\\&quot;,  and, it snagged several times.    It&#x27;s not even usable for me, I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic beard trimmer is an excellent buy and works great.  Perfect size to fit in hand.  Very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and this was worth every cent.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, the build quality is excellent and it runs smooth and it comes with a oil and brush for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The other great advantage being its wet and dry as well</li>
            <li> I really like this product because is fully functional and compact,waterproof and comes with all accesories. I recomend to use with rechargable AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> Does not feel cheap - feels heavy in a good way. I actually like that it doesn&#x27;t have a rechargeable battery - something like a trimmer - hopefully will last 10 years, or forever? But with many shavers that have built in batteries - the battery goes so you have to throw the whole thing away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought some Enloop AAA rechargables and then as long as the trimmer doesn&#x27;t fall apart it should last a good long while!</li>
            <li> No customer service with a product that does not work. UNBELIEVABLE I was told to go to manufacturer for a credit rather than the seller that I paid. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> howdy y&#x27;all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the actual item does it&#x27;s job well. i would rate it a 3 on it&#x27;s own. it feels good in the hand, cuts easily and cleans easily, too. i don&#x27;t trim very short, so that hasn&#x27;t been a problem for me like it has been for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the reason i rated this item at ONE is cuz the blister pack had NO indication of how to open it. it was sealed TIGHTLY and the plastic was quite brittle. i finally took a knife and the package out in the yard and sliced it open. the plastic shattered when the cut neared one edge and i was struck by many bits of sharp plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t recommend anyone buying this item while the blister pack remains so remarkably dangerous to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i presume they hoped any shoplifters would be covered in blood ... but they forgot to account for actual buyers. [*sigh ...*]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take care,&lt;br /&gt;lee&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps- this is the 2nd panasonic item i&#x27;ve bought with nearly customer-proof, dang dangerous packaging. they need to rethink their packaging.&lt;br /&gt;-lee</li>
            <li> I am speaking from the first few weeks of use. The trimmer delivered exactly what I was looking for. I can use my own rechargeable batteries and don&#x27;t have to worry about plugs or replacing silly chargers and rechargeable units I can&#x27;t replace. It works as promised and simplifies things for me in the bathroom. Plus I&#x27;ll be able to travel with it easily. For the price I don&#x27;t see how it could have done better.</li>
            <li> So far this little fella has been great! Clean cuts without having to worry about charging. Definitely great for travel!</li>
            <li> I think this beard trimmer would be great if you have finer hair on your face.  I have one of those thick bear like beards and this beard trimmer just could not cut it.  It tried, and after 10 minutes there was less hair on my face, but my wife was always surprised when I told her that I just trimmed my beard.  I like that I can use my rechargeable batteries and they lasted for 30-60 minutes before they needed to be recharged, but overall, I had better things to do than going over and over my beard with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This works great as a beard/moustache/other short hair trimmer. Sharp, watertight, easy to change the batteries. My only complaint is that the shortest setting (without taking the guard off) isn&#x27;t short enough. My previous trimmer could do much shorter with the guard on.    So, this is great unless you like to have very short hair, in which case you&#x27;ll have to use it with the guard off, which is much harder to get an even length with.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific body trimmer to use with rechargeable batteries.  Too many products have built in batteries, which diminish over time leading to tech waste and landfill sadness (plus the charging area looks cluttered and messy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAUTION: when using without the black plastic spacer (so that the metal cutting area is exposed), be sure to PUSH the handle away from you, do not pull towards you.</li>
            <li> Hair trimmer can be used anywhere, since it has batteries, cutters are sharp. I use it to cut hair, not just for beards. Love it.</li>
            <li> Worked great while traveling overseas.  Wasn&#x27;t sure what kinds of outlets I would have access to, so this little guy did the trick.</li>
            <li> Portable trimmer works very well.  Without its guard, it does cut close and uneven - makes you look like you forgot to shave. Plenty of power wiith 2 AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer at this price</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically because it uses regular batters and not rechargables.  I don&#x27;t trim my beard too often, and didn&#x27;t want to hassle with recharcables or find them dead after a month of not using it.  It&#x27;s quiet, sharp, and is sealed to prevent water from getting in.  Thumbs up for a simple and inexpensive trimmer.</li>
            <li> This ended up being a waste of money for me, because unlike its wonderful predecessor that I bought years ago (whose blades are a bit dull at this point), Panasonic unfortunately went and reworked this product, and it&#x27;s useless to me because it doesn&#x27;t trim my goatee nearly closely enough. I hate it when companies rework and ruin perfectly wonderful products.</li>
            <li> Battery-operated trimmers are hard to find. I like the flexibility of not having to dedicate a bathroom outlet to keeping one charged, so it&#x27;s the best option for me. The down side is that choices are limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As previously reviewed, this is a good product -- but lacks a setting that trims as close as most guys like. I took another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion to sand down the guard and it worked really well. My only drawback is that the overall process seems to take a bit longer due to it being a little less powerful (AAA vs. AA) and having a smaller cutting span than my previous trimmer. Still, it&#x27;s a good back-up to keep on hand and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best small, portable trimmer I&#x27;ve found yet and I like its matte black design, size, and the ability to use rechargeable AA batteries rather than a built in Li-on or NiMh battery that will inevitably die after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest complaint? The difference between the shortest trimmer position and no-guard is huge, you&#x27;re either shaving with no guard and getting pretty close, or leaving a pretty good length of stubble. I wish there were a more intermediate setting for a close, but not guard-free close shave. The longer guard lengths are tough to use because of the small width of the trimmer. Ultimately, I use this without the guard most of the time and deal with the fact that it trims a little too close for my taste.</li>
            <li> decent quality, but poor performance due to under-powered motor or too short trimmer blade. Anyway it is portable enough for trip, do NOT expect too much. I broke it when dropped to wash room floor, cheap product and quality! I would recommend ER224s over this model.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY GOOD PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> This thing is not only great for travel but regular use as well. I just bought my second one to keep at the house. I travel every day/other day and still have the original one I bought several months ago.</li>
            <li> Batteries died down quickly in it.Doesn&#x27;t snag any hair like crazy like some other shavers.I got this to shave some small animals because when I got them the fur on them was very dirty and matted.It states on the package that it shouldn&#x27;t be used on animals,I wish the seller would post that in the product description.Though I don&#x27;t know why,it didn&#x27;t really bother my pets.I&#x27;ve been using it to shave my legs and stuff works okay for a beard trimmer.The design of the product fits in hand very nicely.It is lightweight....</li>
            <li> Owned the ER240 for 8 yrs, and loved it. It was powered by two AA batteries. I don&#x27;t know why Panasonic felt the need to make the newer model less powerful, but definitely a huge fail on their part.</li>
            <li> Good power, easy to use, but the trimmer doesn&#x27;t trim evenly. It&#x27;s hard to find a replaceable battery trimmer that meets my need.</li>
            <li> For years I have had its predecessor and was very satisfied but the rechargeable battery gave up. This is a poor design with the comb being too narrow; the tines in the cutter parts will not cut a regular beard, you need to go at least 5 times through and it still leaves uncut longer hair. The lowest adjustable comb number is also ridiculously long leaving you no alternative but looking like you lost a battle with a weed-wacker. It looks like this trimmer was designed to extract money out of children piggy bank at Christmas or Father&#x27;s Day. Do not bother to buy.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea with this product however the comb design doesn&#x27;t quite get under and lift the hairs to be cut very well.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard fit and trim as never before.</li>
            <li> Narrowness makes it slow.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and was packed adequately.  Trimmer performs as advertised.  Replaceable batteries a plus. ... Recommend high output rechargeable NiMh such as Eneloop, etc.  So far seems to be solidly built.  Cleaning is mandatory after use due to lack of vacuum feature...a nice extra but at this price point not to be expected.  Time will tell, but If initial performance continues, this is a good value.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the blade isn&#x27;t very sharp, or what, but in order to get the hair cut, I have to hold it out taut perpendicular to the skin as I run the clippers over it.  I had my previous pair of clippers (same brand) for 10 years before it died, and I never had to do that.  The final product was much more uniform and clean looking with the old set.  Sadly, I couldn&#x27;t find that model anymore, so I went with this one.  Poor choice.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this after using a Remington MB200 for the last few years.  I liked the Remington but the rechargeable battery was losing its ability to hold a charge.  For that reason, my priority was to get a new unit that had replaceable batteries, which is how I ended up with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read reviews about low power and also how you couldn&#x27;t get a very close trim unless you took the guard totally off.  I am primarily writing to emphasize these two points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read that it didn&#x27;t get a close trim with the guard, I assumed people were trying to get a close shave.  Not at all.  The number one setting on this (the closest trim) leaves my mustache longer than the number two setting on my Remington.  It is o.k. for how I like my mustache length, but I&#x27;ll be trimming it far more often because I can&#x27;t get it a little closer.  I can see why this would be a problem for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the power, it does feel pretty weak with the two AAA batteries.  I only have a mustache to deal with and it is not great, but it is o.k.  If you had a thicker beard, I&#x27;d wonder if it could really tackle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this unit because I really value the replaceable batteries, and it is adequate for my limited mustache work.  I&#x27;d think twice if I had a heaver beard I was trying to shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a rechargeable Philips beard trimmer before this Panasonic one. It did the job just fine. It was effective, and needed relatively low quantity of passings through my beard to get it trimmed. This Panasonic one, on the contrary, needs, I would say, 10x more passings to get a trimmed beard. Also when placed in the lowest trim height, the beard is left quite long. Bottom line, it is lacking trimming power to the extent of being frustrating.</li>
            <li> Easy to remove head (flip it back with your thumb then snap fit to re-attach) to brush away hair, rinse under running water and oil.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on an Eneloop LSD AA batteries which means it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li> nice but suitable for bear more; it&#x27;ll be difficult to use for head, as the blade is very small.</li>
            <li> I love this one. Work great for the prize. I like it because i don&#x27;t have to carry 15 different pieces with it when I travel and works on a battery so I can use it worldwide.</li>
            <li> Beard shavers by Panasonic use a much better engine than those by other brands (e.g. Wahl), at least in my experience.  They are much quieter, with less vibration, and batteries last far longer.  So I am very pleased that Panasonic continues to produce this fine product line.  Been using them for decades.</li>
            <li> But it works better then my corded one... Just make sure you have plenty of AAA batteries... Small and compact and works well</li>
            <li> Works very well and is very inexpensive. Would recommend to anyone with a beard , goatee, or mustache. Should include batteries</li>
            <li> Update a year later:  I originally rated this trimmer at 5 stars (see review below).  It died after a year and is not fixable so the rating is lowered to 2 stars.  I have been trimming my beard and mustache with scissors and a razor for many years and decided to try out a trimmer.  I read the reviews of many trimmers and selected this one based on the decent reviews and low price ($10).  I figured if I did not like it the cost of my education would be small.  I liked it from the start and after six weeks of use I still like it.  It is indeed made of plastic but the plastic is high quality - the trimmer has a good feel and the removable guide is high quality and is finished well.  I found a length I liked (#3) and the guide does not slip from that setting.  The guide is easily removable and I use it that way to trim the edge of my mustache.  Once in a great while it will pull a bit before cutting.  The only negative is putting a drop of oil on the blade - not difficult, not annoying, just an extra 30 seconds when I am trying to get out the door in the morning.  Almost all the other trimmers I checked out also require oiling so this appears to be part of the deal.  Uses batteries, light weight, one piece -- no wires, no charger, and no zillions of pieces.  All in all, a five star product.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought this product</li>
            <li> Small easy to use. Battery operated sometimes can be a good thing as more convience too</li>
            <li> Really like this trimmer because it&#x27;s accurate and powerful as I have very thick black hair. Very sharp blades and easy to clean, just rinse.</li>
            <li> Granted, my beard is tough so take this with a grain of salt. I like the fact that it runs on batteries. I had two with rechargeable, internal batteries that failed after the 2nd or third charge and became useless. If this one goes dead, simply replace the batteries. The clipper head is adjustable and I find the #2 to my liking since I keep my beard short. Take off the clipper head and very easy to trim neck and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY drawback to this is it doesn&#x27;t have a tremendous amount of power and I have to go over my beard slowly with it. It&#x27;ll cut, just have to take your time. For others, this may not be an issue. Like I said, my beard is tough. Nice and convenient though. Sits next to the bathroom sink ready to go. Don&#x27;t have to plug it in or anything else, just pick it up, trim and go.</li>
            <li> What can you expect from a cheap trimmer?  I guess it kinda trims hair.  I have to make a whole bunch of passes to get the hair even-ish though, and it doesn&#x27;t get everything.  I kind of just give up when I get tired of trying to make it do what I want, which is make my hair one even length.  I would have spent more money on a better trimmer if I&#x27;d known this was going to be sub-par.</li>
            <li> Very poor, not a good evan cut it skips a lot , have to go over a lot just to get  my beard evan. Don&#x27;t spend your money here!</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t do the job at all for the beard/moustache. I trim mine to about 1/4&amp;#34; every 1 to 2 weeks. After several attempts, extra time and effort each time, this thing leave me with a beard that looks like I was run over by a weed whacker. The only thing it&#x27;s good for is edge trimming (without the adjustable trimmer attached). I&#x27;ve had several beard trimmers over the years. The NiCad battery on my current gave out. I thought the features and reviews on this one looked good. By the cheap price, at $13.99, I got what I paid for.... a white elephant.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me to replace one, from a different manufacturer, that I owned and enjoyed for years.  I travel a lot - often outside the US.  I was reluctant to purchase a beard trimmer that required hauling a recharging gizmo around.  And even more reluctant to have one that would run on either 120v or 220.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After weeks of searching in online and in malls -- including an electronics mall in Singapore, we finally found this battery operated trimmer.  It works great.  I was worried that it would be under powered but the two AAA batteries do the job.  Clean up is a breeze.  And the guidecomb is more stable that the one on my old trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I hope it lasts for years.</li>
            <li> Very good product without nay cord.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs .this is my second purchase and they last a long time.bought another one as I thought after using g it for over 6 years it would be nice to get a new one.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It can be used with water and the blades have really long life.  Does work that well if you want to keep the hair longer i.e. above 10mm</li>
            <li> Found the size and type of trimmer I was looking to replace. This one works great! No problems! Happy customer! :)</li>
            <li> Hi have been using bear trimmers for 40 years...&lt;br /&gt;Lately have been using Panasonics, and this is a good example of how to keep updates better than the previous incarnations.&lt;br /&gt;The fact you can change the batteries is a double plus (I was stuck with a model that does not do that) and the fact that is water resistant it is another plus.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second one as a reserve, just in case.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the money.</li>
            <li> Works well. Pulls occasionally, but not much. Cuts evenly - I do not use a guard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite practical and cost effective, and arguably matches up to a more expensive trimmer!. I&#x27;m happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Wish I had paid more attention to the reviews.  It does not shave close at all on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> okay, but not the best I have used. The distance between each of the 5 adjustable trimmer lengths is too much, but it is manageable in a pinch. Size is good in the hand, and batteries mean I can carry this while traveling with the batteries OUT, so it doesn&#x27;t turn on accidentally. Trimmer blades are sharp, and cut well. Ergonomics are very good. I took off one star because of the space between the cutting lengths. Would recommend it to any traveler. If it is to be your main beard trimmer, I would recommend a more expensive model, something with smaller distances between the cutting lengths.</li>
            <li> it is probably not a good trimmer for those who want a strong trimmer or have a full beard to trim. But for touchups, its good enough</li>
            <li> Needed to replace my old trimmer which needed to be plugged into the wall to recharge. This one uses batteries and hums away, cutting smoothly. It is smaller than my previous trimmer and the biggest difference is that the new Pansasonic trimmer blade is much narrower --- better for mustache trimming, but not as good for the beard since it requires many more strokes. Good item for the price and not complicated with numerous attachments.</li>
            <li> Not a very effective trimmer. i have thick beard hair and i have to go over it 4 or 5 times with this to get an even trim. super annoying</li>
            <li> I own a cordless Panasonic ER-224 which works fine for my beard, but the charging cord was misplaced and this inexpensive battery-powered Panasonic model was bought as a stopgap until the cord was found.  I hadn&#x27;t trimmed my somewhat grizzled salt-and-pepper beard for about three weeks when the package arrived.  The trimmer has five height settings. With the longest, next-to-longest, and middle settings, I might as well have been using it without even turning it on. It simply didn&#x27;t cut. Not even when I moved it very slowly.  It wasn&#x27;t until it was set to the next-to-shortest position that it began to cut, but then it was cutting my beard much closer than I wanted. That position is just a little longer than stubble.  If stubble is how you like your beard, this ER2403K trimmer will probably be a good buy for you, especially for travel. But I cannot recommend this trimmer if your beard is longer, and has gray in it, like the one the Most Interesting Man in the World wears in the TV commercials.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, all-in-one trimmer that has two distinct advantages over many others. First, it can be used wet or day, which means at the very least you can rinse off the head when you&#x27;re finished rather than going at it with a brush and making more mess. Second, it uses replaceable batteries, rather than rechargeables, so if the batteries are empty you just slip in new ones, rather than waiting an hour or more for it to charge. The last one I had like this was rechargeable, and the NICAD batteries eventually died, and could not be replaced. The moveable length guide is far superior to other trimmers&#x27; multiple attachments, which are flimsy and easily lost. And the price was right. I am totally satisfied with this machine.</li>
            <li> It would not cut evenly. Somehow, it misses half the hairs, so you have to keep going over the same area many times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good,better then the one before and this one should last longer.</li>
            <li> Bought to use when travelling. Not pleased with performance.Very difficult to adjust the cutting length to the desired number. 5 position comb piece is hard to move one number at a time. Not reccomended.&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY HAL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many beard trimmers over the years.  I thought I would give this one a shot since my last trimmer just died and the reviews on this were fairly positive for the most part.  However, I&#x27;ve found that the motor is way underpowered when compared to any trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used this model a month now and I dislike it so much I just ordered a slightly higher end Remmington.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Panasonic ER224S, but when the battery finally have up the ghost (after 2 years of regular use) and I came back to Amazon to purchase a replacement I thought I would check out my options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ER2403K seemed like a great option as it featured almost all the same things I loved about the ER224S but takes regular batteries. (No more running out of juice mid hair trim because I forgot to plug it in!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the downside, it just doesn&#x27;t have the juice to get the job done. Where the ER224S takes one pass, the ER2403K takes 5. It works, and would probably work well if you had super fine hair, but for most normal people it&#x27;s going to result in a frustrating grooming experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying a new ER224S now, and I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a replacement for one I got at a retail store. It is a good value, arrived on time and meets my needs. It is battery operated.</li>
            <li> I just bought the trimmer from Panasonic, so I can&#x27;t say anything about the battery life.  The trimmer works really well as of now!</li>
            <li> Yes!! My son went to Africa for 27 months with the peace corps and he can&#x27;t live without his ranch! I will probably be ordering more to send to him!</li>
            <li> Boa maquina de cortar cabelo, resistente a água . porém com o pente de corte um pouco estreito . .</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic ER2403K Wet/Dry Hair and Beard Trimmer, to replace the one, which I left in Australia when I was there for vacation. It is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> 2 things I notice. The batteries seem to drain pretty fast. And the length selection is better for hair on your head not beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they made the increments more appropriate for regular beards then this would be an excellent product.</li>
            <li> piece of junk, tried it once had to buy an other brand  that actually trims hair, DONT NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> No power, but I kept it.  I&#x27;ll use it till it breaks.</li>
            <li> Bought for beard and body grooming in the shower.  It delivers.  Takes triple A batteries which we have laying around, and is easily washed off in the shower.  After at least 5-7 sessions - it&#x27;s still going strong, so assume I have a while before the batteries run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good, cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product.  Perfect if you need a battery operated adjustable trimmer.  The adjustable piece is removable and great for trimming neck hair.</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing i habe ever bought</li>
            <li> Panasonic has and always will be  inexpensive, great products. It&#x27;s wet/dry and does a great job. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> My Husband uses this one when on the road and loves it.</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t go in the stupid shaver to be cut. It just pushes the hair down</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t trim at all. The blade passes over hair, but nothing happens. I didn&#x27;t give up after on try. Tried it multiple times. Always unsuccessful. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I am sure the scissors you have laying around your apartment would do a better job at trimming than this.</li>
            <li> I HAVE AN EARLIER MODEL OF THIS TIMMER WHICH FINALLY STOPPED WORKING AFTER YEARS OF USE.  THIS ONE IS NOT AS GOOD BECAUSE IT DOES NOT TRIM AS SHORT AS THE OLD ONE.  PANASONIC SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL DESIGN.</li>
            <li> Not the best trimmer. Would work well for thing might beards. But not for me.</li>
            <li> Does not work as good as my old Remington...</li>
            <li> I wanted a travel size trimmer which uses batteries (I don&#x27;t want anything else in my life to charge!) This fit the bill! Easily adjustable for my needs and quiet. Uses AAA batteries, easily found in most countries. I have not used the trimmer \\&quot;wet\\&quot;, but don&#x27;t foresee any problems.  For the price and quality, I was well satisfied. Shipment arrived 2 days early.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for my beard or mustache myself.  But I do love the results...  it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love the built in length adjuster.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as my other battery-operated Remington, but it does the job, weighs less and is easier to hold, and the price was basically a &amp;#34;Throw&#x27;-away&amp;#34; rate.  I&#x27;d buy it again--especially for traveling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend buying these clippers because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is not water resistant. If you use them in a moist environment, the batteries will get wet and corrode.&lt;br /&gt;2. It clogs up with hair. The blades will stop moving and the propelling motor won&#x27;t even spin. I&#x27;m guessing this is due to water damage and hair clogging it up. I would clean them regularly, but I am hesitant to wash them out because again, not water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;3. They don&#x27;t cut very short. The shortest setting is rather long. Not use full for the &amp;#34;scruff&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;4. They don&#x27;t cut thick or long hair. Can&#x27;t use them to keep the head trimmed.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Infact cuts the beard very smoothly. best i have used so far. Uses AAA size battery. the back up is pretty good aswell</li>
            <li> Machine has great features but it cuts badly. it is not worth the low cost. you can find better at same price.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time. Batteries are easy to install and no need to travel with a charger. Excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several battery-powered trimmers, and this is the best of the bunch. Of course it falls far short of plug-in trimmers, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers! Great for traveling and camping.</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmer, but doesn&#x27;t work that well in the shower.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this second exact moustache trimmer for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  He&#x27;s had the original one for many, many, many years and we more than got our money&#x27;s worth out of it.  So I bought him another one...the old one we can take with us when we travel and the new one we&#x27;ll keep at home.  It&#x27;s great for trimming ear hairs and his eyebrows too!  Great buy...don&#x27;t miss this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d agree with some of the other comments. Its not that good on the \\&quot;short\\&quot; trim but otherwise OK. It wouldn&#x27;t have cost much more for a cheap plastic holder for the unit to be included--as Wahl does--but it wasn&#x27;t. Panasonic produces AbFab TVs and other appliances. This is OK but its not up to Panasonic standard.</li>
            <li> Have had this 1.5 years and it works well. Has five trim settings, usually use #4 setting.  Use it with my moustache, sideburns, trim around ears, and trim head hair which reduces frequency of going for a $25 haircut.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> Like the fact that there are no cords to deal with.  Also, I like the removable, adjustable guard.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.  Nice product!</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use.  Pop in two triple-A batteries and it&#x27;s ready to go.  No hassles with charging or cords or charging stands.  The blade guard has 5 positions and is attached to the trimmer, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about storing a bunch of those black plastic length guards.  I have a tough beard and it got the job done.  I&#x27;m deducting one star because it doesn&#x27;t come with batteries.  Panasonic cheaped out there.  Other than that, this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Regretted this purchase. The idea is nice - The comb encases the head so no worries of nicks and the trimmer is a nice  small convenient size. BUT... they just don&#x27;t work. You have to run over the hair multiple times to get it to cut. Seems like it is the comb that is going over the hair instead of allowing it to pass through to the blade. Poor design and quality is cheap.</li>
            <li> It is a very good trimmer, but it runs on AAA batteries, so don&#x27;t expect to cut you hair with it (at least, not perfectly) As with other Panasonic consumer products, it&#x27;s a good quality device; a bit plasticly, but strong. And the price is perfect for what you get. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> There is a problem in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are neglecting their fades. You need to keep your fades high, and you need to keep them tight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upgrade your fade game. Get this and a proper electric hair cutter. I recommend Andis Fademaster, although I have never used it myself. I have a $25 Wahl, and it&#x27;s OK but it could be better. Also get one of those single blade razors that look dangerous and a set of replacement razor blades for it. Then get yourself the self cut system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all of that, your fade game will be upgraded. Godspeed.</li>
            <li> Bought it because of the price to replace one that quit working of a different brand that I can no longer find. Anyway my search continues.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my mb20 remington that i have used for years and paid $9 new. I was skeptical of panasonic since my purchase of the er224 all in one trimmer. I broke the plastic head after 3 uses, later to find out the trimmer was guaranteed to break within 25 trimmings or a panasonic employee would come to your home, take the unit as you were obviously doing something wrong. I thought i would give panasonic another chance as it is a stoic name in personal care. I received the 2403 unpacked, installed batteries and started to trim. A very uneven variable trim from the start as i found myself having to go over the same spot again and again. Low speed motor typical of battery trimmers was only part of the problem. The blades were either not sharp or not alined, though pulling was not a problem.If i use the unit i will buy more batteries , i will need them since it takes 3 times as long to trim.I know what you are thinking, the trimmer was cheap, you get what you pay for. I have never been able to completely buy into the correlation money quality. I had the remington trimmer years, still going strong, 9 bucks.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot better than this. The guide slips out of position too easily, and can cause a haircutting accident. If you use this to trim eyebrows, mustache, and sideburns, you wouldn’t want a big chunk of hair removed by mistake. You might end up going to work feeling embarrassed looking like that. It trims pretty well, however it has a major problem with the Hair Cutting Guide not locking solidly in place, because the plastic tabs fail to hold it properly. If you push on it just a little harder, the guide snaps loose from the locking tabs, and oops, there goes a unexpected chunk of hair. It uses AAA size batteries, however trying to install them and figuring out which way they go can be a little bit of a problem, because the little picture molded in the plastic is hard to see, and they don&#x27;t fit perfectly, the batteries wobble a bit. Maybe it was originally designed for larger size batteries. It looks like something worth 99-cents. It doesn’t come with a holder or a case, so I kept the original plastic packing material and place that on a shelf for storage. This is not a quality product, but it works OK.</li>
            <li> Guard is poorly designed and flimsy. Does not click properly into the different notches</li>
            <li> I use rechargeable batteries with this- works well. The size aids detailed work around mouth to snazz up the goatee and keep the shaggy homeless look at bay.</li>
            <li> Feels a little soft when trimming. I am not sure if it is due to batteries or just how it&#x27;s made. Other than that it absolutely does the job, is light and does not need charging. Price is excellent.</li>
            <li> Unit seems well constructed and does job as claimed.&lt;br /&gt;Only had it for a short time and love it, so far!</li>
            <li> I abdolutely love this product based on the fact that it shaves very close (I use it for my head), I can use it in the shower so there&#x27;s no mess, it is battery powered instead of rechargable (most on the market are rechargable and if you forget to plug it...), and it is extremely lightweight and ergonomic. This is great if you suffer from low dexterity like I do.  You would be surprised how many of these ate in the stores for up to 100.00 that you can&#x27;t even get wet! What&#x27;s the point in that? As for the precision of the trimming adpect, it has an automatic guide attached that makes it extremely easy to get the length you want and you don&#x27;t have to fumble with 10 attachments.</li>
            <li> Does not cut very good</li>
            <li> GREAT product for the money it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is you have to be careful on with the setting, it can slip and then you&#x27;re shaving at a 1 setting and you may as well shave your whole beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re careful, it&#x27;s a winner, waterproof and no cord or charger you use AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> Nice product, Small easy to use and doesn&#x27;t consume much battery</li>
            <li> My last beard trimmer&#x27;s &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting left the stubble much shorter. Good product otherwise. Like that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great with the guard off, but needs multiple passes to get the job done with the guard on. Fully submersible is a nice feature so it can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> The blades get dull quick, and if you have thick hair, you need to do at least 10 passes to trim hair.</li>
            <li> I really liked the look and feel of this trimmer, and it seems well made.  A major factor in my decision to buy was the power by dry cells.  It&#x27;s nice to have no wall warts or stands or wires.  Unfortunately it pulls some hairs instead of clipping them.  I didn&#x27;t want to experiment enough to figure out why, but it will do it when trimming the beard or with the cutters on your face where you do the edge.  It doesn&#x27;t pull all the time, about 1 out of 5 strokes, but when it does it isn&#x27;t a clean pull and it hurts more than if you just pulled the hair straight out.  A lot more.  Enough to throw this product out.  I&#x27;m guessing they put cheap crappy blades on it.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> Will be great for travel - batteries are easier than AC adapters when traveling. It is very compact, which is great for travel, but the head is smaller than I like for use at home. I would not want this as my primary trimmer for use at home.</li>
            <li> Thought the range of settings would be greater.</li>
