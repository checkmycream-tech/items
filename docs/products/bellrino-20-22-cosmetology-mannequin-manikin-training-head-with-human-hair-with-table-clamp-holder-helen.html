            <li>and it&#x27;s still looking good!</li>
            <li>but otherwise it was good to practice on!</li>
            <li>but we removed it from the package and it appears to be a great head.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it is great.</li>
            <li>Great length to practice up duo&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>omg happy</li>
            <li>Great mannequin for practicing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good simulation and works well.</li>
            <li>good price, just as ordered</li>
            <li>Her hair was good quality but not that good of quality</li>
            <li>loved it couse my eldest loved it,she went nuts</li>
            <li>and it is still in good condition</li>
            <li>Good quality, bought for my teenager so she can practice hair styles, it holds up very good to hot curling over and over.</li>
            <li>Nice to practice on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seems suitable for practicing braids &amp; updos or haircuts.</li>
            <li>But for my daughter to just play in the hair and start styling on her own, its okay.</li>
            <li>hair is nice and the bracket is okay (made of plastic and the clamp does not hold well</li>
            <li>The Hair Is Smooth And Easy To Work With, Great Product.</li>
            <li>Ok not a lot hair , would be really nice more dense.</li>
            <li>Helen is fantastic!</li>
            <li>but she made me feel better about the situation since she is going to fix it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you just want a mannequin to practice on at home, this is ok.  </li>
            <li>If you want a mannequin to practice on and show off your work, look for something better.</li>
            <li>- the plastic head seems to not grip well as they have a curve in handle that transferred to the connection of the bracket).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Helen&amp;#34; is very spooky with her eyes also - lol @ me.</li>
            <li>, did exactly what she needed at a good price</li>
            <li>I loved the stand &amp; the mannequin, however after the first shampoo the hair matted up.</li>
            <li>Great for a child to practice braids and new hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Great for practicing or for a young boy/girl to play with.</li>
            <li>But I did not get the most important part of the clamp which is the stick that holds the mannequin head.</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s still a great buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has great communication and replies back</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t give you clean parting for your style.</li>
            <li>I thought it looked good enough for that and for the price if it didn&#x27;t, nothing was lost.  </li>
            <li>but if you buy it to simply practice braiding or styling then it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>..need a full haired doll head to practice at school.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I need an economical solution for a business application and this mannequin head did the trick.  </li>
            <li>To be more clear, I received the clamp.</li>
            <li>picture looks COMPLETELY different than the product I received, however, I contacted Shannon and she has been the most understanding and helpful person</li>
            <li>Thanks Shannon!</li>
            <li>Good for a beginner, would not recommend for actual class unless specialty is short hair.</li>
            <li>My daughters a student and this worked very well for her</li>
            <li>she really wanted head she could play around w/hairstyles.</li>
            <li>And It Works Really</li>
            <li>very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair takes bleach and color very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipper.</li>

            <li>Description gives you high hopes than what you really get.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife who is really into braiding, she uses it to practice new styles that she picks up off of youtube and then figures out how to do them on herself.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend her.</li>
            <li>She was so excited until she tried to blow dry her hair.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even as long or as full as demonstrated in the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, it takes color nicely.  </li>
            <li>But I gave it two stars because her hair is soft!</li>
            <li>The mannequin had pretty thing hair and the last couple inches were stragly</li>
            <li>But costs less than most human hair mannequins</li>

            <li>I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter who loves to &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; with hair.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my 10 year old daughter who loves to play with hair.</li>
            <li>Head is sort of small, sheds easily and Doesnt fall naturally in the front.</li>
            <li>This is very unfortunate and I would be fine with everything else if I were able to make use of the mannequin I have purchased.</li>
            <li>i myself a amateur in doing hair throughly enjoy practicing on her.</li>
            <li>Hair wasn&#x27;t really what I expected.</li>
            <li>Jt wont fit in the stand because the hole at the bottom is sooo small!</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and managable but it is not true to length and there is a two(2) inch bald spot in the back of the head right above the nape area</li>

            <li> Also, the hair isn&#x27;t as long as pictured.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it two stars is due to the fact that the package came in one day instead of the two day shipping I paid for.  </li>
            <li> There is some layering upon arrival so unable to do a true 0 degree cut for school.  </li>
            <li> Good Mannequin, but the hair is very thin (not a full head) and it sheds a ridiculous amount.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is NOT 20-22 inches long!!!</li>
            <li> The hair was NOT real and it melted.</li>
            <li> The hair is a bit shorter than I expected</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected for price.</li>
            <li> Not nice enough for display or for senior photo opportunity.</li>
            <li> The head is a little small and very layered and thin on the bottom like a shag.</li>
            <li> One eyebrown is up and the other is going down!</li>
            <li> It was a little bit below my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The clamp leaves a little to be desired.</li>
            <li> yes with all cosmetology manikins there is dead, sterilized lice that you&#x27;ll wanna wash out.</li>
            <li> and you can get a few cuts out of it as well.</li>
            <li> The only think she has to be wary of is that the braid can&#x27;t be too tight else</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product, when I was parting in center of the head, I saw some of the places missing hair</li>
            <li> The hair is uneven and its hard to use it as I intended to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed at first</li>
            <li> THE HEAD IS TOO SMALL FOR PARTINGS AND ROLLING.</li>
            <li> A LOT OF THE TASKS WE ARE ASKED TO PERFORM HELEN&#x27;S HEAD IS SO SMALL</li>
            <li> Bought for a student and has been found to be hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S HARD TO DO IN A TIMELY MANNER.</li>
            <li> Her head is small!</li>
            <li> The holder is crappy and small!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; is very small and it feels like I am a Witch doctor working on a shrunken head.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Once the hair was washed, it tangled so bad I feel like sending it back.  </li>
            <li> Sorry :\</li>
            <li> The hair is very thin and not as long all over the head as it should be...pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> The hair is really thin at the bottom...</li>
            <li> Not great for practicing up dos.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I used the wrong techniques</li>
            <li> creepy + split</li>
            <li> ,me i think they are creepy but not as creepy as the ones with the makeup their kinda walking deadish.</li>
            <li> After that, we were afraid to use anything on it &amp; returned it.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I basically ordered her to learn to french braid so I could comb my granddaughters hair.  The hair is uneven and its hard to use it as I intended to.  I have order a longer, same length hair one.</li>
            <li> The head is a little small and very layered and thin on the bottom like a shag. But it will work for the reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> Her head is small! The holder is crappy and small! Her hair is NOT 20-22 inches long!!! But I gave it two stars because her hair is soft!</li>
            <li> It does not look anything like it does in the photo! The hair is orange! Not brown! One eyebrown is up and the other is going down! The lips are smeared! Jt wont fit in the stand because the hole at the bottom is sooo small! Id give it 2 stars...... Sorry :\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems suitable for practicing braids &amp; updos or haircuts. I have yet to color it.</li>
            <li> Good Mannequin, but the hair is very thin (not a full head) and it sheds a ridiculous amount.  But for my daughter to just play in the hair and start styling on her own, its okay.</li>
            <li> Head is sort of small, sheds easily and Doesnt fall naturally in the front. But costs less than most human hair mannequins</li>
            <li> Received just in time for my daughters birthday and she loves it!</li>
            <li> I need an economical solution for a business application and this mannequin head did the trick.  It&#x27;s a good simulation and works well.</li>
            <li> My daughters a student and this worked very well for her, did exactly what she needed at a good price</li>
            <li> Helen is fantastic! i myself a amateur in doing hair throughly enjoy practicing on her. the stand is compatible with my preferred surface. I highly recommend her.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas present.  She was so excited until she tried to blow dry her hair.  Even on the low heat setting, the chin &amp; cheek area started to melt.  After that, we were afraid to use anything on it &amp; returned it.  Also, the hair isn&#x27;t as long as pictured.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this mannequin. it was the best gift ever. she plays with this mannequin none stop day and night</li>
            <li> The hair was NOT real and it melted. It wasn&#x27;t even as long or as full as demonstrated in the picture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve curled her hair several times already and it&#x27;s still looking good! The hair is a bit shorter than I expected but overall it&#x27;s still a great buy.</li>
            <li> Actual length was misleading.  Bought for a student and has been found to be hard to work with.  Good for a beginner, would not recommend for actual class unless specialty is short hair.</li>
            <li> Ok not a lot hair , would be really nice more dense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, it takes color nicely.  I recommend this product to all cosmetologist who are in training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From EH Co</li>
            <li> Description gives you high hopes than what you really get. Hair wasn&#x27;t really what I expected. Next will just buy from Burnax.</li>
            <li> Got for my nieces birthday bc she really wanted head she could play around w/hairstyles. The hair is slightly shorter than I expected; and head slightly smaller; but she really enjoys using it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but we removed it from the package and it appears to be a great head. Compareable to others bought in stores.</li>
            <li> I loved the stand &amp; the mannequin, however after the first shampoo the hair matted up. Perhaps I used the wrong techniques</li>
            <li> I Ordered This Doll Head For My Classes Im Taking And It Works Really Well. The Hair Is Smooth And Easy To Work With, Great Product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife who is really into braiding, she uses it to practice new styles that she picks up off of youtube and then figures out how to do them on herself. The only think she has to be wary of is that the braid can&#x27;t be too tight else the hair will either come out or break.</li>
            <li> she is on the 18-20 inch range. yes with all cosmetology manikins there is dead, sterilized lice that you&#x27;ll wanna wash out. Great for practicing or for a young boy/girl to play with.</li>
            <li> creepy + split ends &#x3D; bad review</li>
            <li> It was a little bit below my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;The picture looks COMPLETELY different than the product I received, however, I contacted Shannon and she has been the most understanding and helpful person I&#x27;ve bought from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said that I would have to send it back and she exchange it.&lt;br /&gt;That is the type of seller I will buy from.&lt;br /&gt;She has great communication and replies back very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed at first but she made me feel better about the situation since she is going to fix it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome! Thanks Shannon!</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and managable but it is not true to length and there is a two(2) inch bald spot in the back of the head right above the nape area</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it two stars is due to the fact that the package came in one day instead of the two day shipping I paid for.  The Mannequin head looks like a cousin of the one depicted in the photo.  When I got the package, I received everything but the mannequin holder!  To be more clear, I received the clamp. But I did not get the most important part of the clamp which is the stick that holds the mannequin head. :((( This is very unfortunate and I would be fine with everything else if I were able to make use of the mannequin I have purchased.</li>
            <li> There is some layering upon arrival so unable to do a true 0 degree cut for school.  Hair takes bleach and color very well.  Would definitely buy again.  Fast shipper. The stand was a bonus.</li>
            <li> The hair is really thin at the bottom...but otherwise it is great. Bought it for my 10 year old daughter to use as a toy.</li>
            <li> I CHOSE HELEN BECAUSE OF HER HAIR LENGTH AND TO TAKE WITH ME TO STATEBOARD. HOWEVER MY INSTRUCTOR HATES HER. THE HEAD IS TOO SMALL FOR PARTINGS AND ROLLING. A LOT OF THE TASKS WE ARE ASKED TO PERFORM HELEN&#x27;S HEAD IS SO SMALL IT&#x27;S HARD TO DO IN A TIMELY MANNER.</li>
            <li> I thought the hair is longer but won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter who loves to &amp;#34;mess&amp;#34; with hair.  I thought it looked good enough for that and for the price if it didn&#x27;t, nothing was lost.  It is a Christmas gift so don&#x27;t know how she will like it yet.</li>
            <li> Great for a child to practice braids and new hairstyles. The clamp leaves a little to be desired. It will not open wide enough to get over any beveled edges.</li>
            <li> Nice to practice on. Not nice enough for display or for senior photo opportunity. If you just want a mannequin to practice on at home, this is ok.  If you want a mannequin to practice on and show off your work, look for something better.</li>
            <li> The mannequin had pretty thing hair and the last couple inches were stragly but otherwise it was good to practice on!</li>
            <li> good price, just as ordered</li>
            <li> Great length to practice up duo&#x27;s on and you can get a few cuts out of it as well.</li>
            <li> Her hair was good quality but not that good of quality but if you buy it to simply practice braiding or styling then it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> loved it couse my eldest loved it,she went nuts omg happy,me i think they are creepy but not as creepy as the ones with the makeup their kinda walking deadish. with that said it was a birthday present the hair is still thier an no lice it clamped well and my baby has been playing with hair and lovin it.i would buy another if i needed too.</li>
            <li> Once the hair was washed, it tangled so bad I feel like sending it back.  If I didnt think I had to pay for shipping, I would return it.</li>
            <li> IT WAS A GIFT AND SHE LOVED IT JUST WHAT SHE NEEDED!!! WE DID KRIS KRINGLE AT WORK AND I KNOW SHE LIKES TO PLAY IN HER HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality, bought for my teenager so she can practice hair styles, it holds up very good to hot curling over and over. Had for 6 months and it is still in good condition</li>
            <li> Great mannequin for practicing</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Hair ends &amp;#34;ratty&amp;#34;. Not at all what I expected for price. Not great for practicing up dos. Hairline not accurate/real life either.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product, when I was parting in center of the head, I saw some of the places missing hair and it doesn&#x27;t give you clean parting for your style. Hair are keep breaking and hair too short of the length. It is chepo product.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; is very small and it feels like I am a Witch doctor working on a shrunken head.&lt;br /&gt;The hair is nice and the bracket is okay (made of plastic and the clamp does not hold well - the plastic head seems to not grip well as they have a curve in handle that transferred to the connection of the bracket).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Helen&amp;#34; is very spooky with her eyes also - lol @ me.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 10 year old daughter who loves to play with hair. She loves this mannequin head.</li>
            <li> The hair is very thin and not as long all over the head as it should be...pretty disappointing. ..need a full haired doll head to practice at school. ..I guess I will have to make due...can&#x27;t afford another</li>
            <li> Her hair is not all one length.  It is  layered which is not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Will order again.</li>
