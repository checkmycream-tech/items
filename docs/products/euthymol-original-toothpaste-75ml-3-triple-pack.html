            <li>still the best.</li>
            <li>The best.</li>
            <li>No mint and does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon, for making Christmas especially BRILLIANT for our daughter-in-law!!</li>
            <li>I have it a try and have loved it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Which sounds great, but...</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste</li>
            <li>, I have been either buying it on my way through a UK airport, or having it shipped: three tubes being one year&#x27;s supply (and a bit more!!)</li>
            <li>good delivery from the UK.  </li>
            <li>Great transaction..  Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Good clean feeling and no aftertaste.</li>
            <li>Sodium hydroxide (also known as lye) is used most in the chemical and paper/pulp industries, and induces alkalinity.  </li>
            <li>I love the antiseptic taste, and I use it with another type of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste, very natural and makes your mouth feel scrubbed clean.</li>
            <li>The real toothpaste !!!!.</li>
            <li>Keeps my mouth feeling clean!</li>
            <li>An alkaline state is good for your mouth, as it is acidity which produces much tooth decay, but I don&#x27;t know about my comfort level with using lye</li>
            <li>Huge fan of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste it leaves you feeling like you just left the dentist!</li>
            <li>Wikipedia&#x27;s article on sodium silicate will make your head spin with the number of industrial uses it has (including Magic Rocks and setting dyes requiring a high pH).  </li>
            <li>So, my first thought was to check Amazon and VOILA!  </li>
            <li>If a commenter would direct me, I&#x27;d be glad for the info about thymol or the oils in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when she opened one of her Christmas presents and found 3 tubes, she was thrilled and pronounced it &amp;#34;BRILLIANT&amp;#34;, which is the highest complement one can receive, apparently ;-)  </li>
            <li>But as an adult, I was able to rediscover the excellence of the results of this toothpaste, and, it not being marketed in Canada</li>
            <li>exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but then the stellar said that I would have had to pay the shipping</li>
            <li>good stuff - feels like a dentist cleaning - much cheaper and less</li>
            <li>Indeed, the tube itself touts the product as \\&quot;a scientific dental preparation\\&quot; and claims it has \\&quot;a special blend of antiseptic ingredients and essential oils to help keep your teeth and gums clean and healthy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The name is a twist on thymol, which is an extract from the herb thyme which offers this special cleansing.  </li>
            <li>but my gums had become super sensitive to temperature, food and weather.</li>
            <li>Both price and shipping were very competitive for this product.</li>
            <li>Euthymol really does freshen the mouth.</li>
            <li>Love it, and the pink color, and the taste!</li>
            <li>I am so glad to hear it will remain available and when sources in NYC dried up at several pharmacies</li>
            <li>began using this product this week, and I will come back and update this after some more regular use.  </li>
            <li>, I think that it was unfair of me having to pay for the shipping, but this surely will not happen again and I will make sure that I pass on the word</li>
            <li>I am convinced that this is what dentists use when I go for a cleaning, this toothpaste made my teeth super white</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not seeing thymol or essential oils labelled clearly here, and I rather doubt sodium lauryl sulfate was in the original recipe.  </li>
            <li>My father always used Euthymol toothpaste, but as a child, it tasted odd - not minty and sweet!</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my gums aren&#x27;t as sensitive and my teeth do appear whiter.</li>
            <li>This pink paste is strong (not offensively so) and tastes a lot like a pink Canada mint (which I adore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In general I like this product ðŸ˜Š.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what was going on but my gums had become super sensitive to temperature, food and weather. I saw a YouTube video on improved guns and whitening of teeth where the person was using this toothpaste. I have it a try and have loved it! I have noticed that my gums aren&#x27;t as sensitive and my teeth do appear whiter. Overall this has been an all around oral improvement.</li>
            <li> exactly as described.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get out of the spearmint toothpaste rut, here&#x27;s your ticket.  This pink paste is strong (not offensively so) and tastes a lot like a pink Canada mint (which I adore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this product this week, and I will come back and update this after some more regular use.  For now, I want to add that I was attracted to this toothpaste for its \\&quot;anticeptic qualities\\&quot;.  The name is a twist on thymol, which is an extract from the herb thyme which offers this special cleansing.  Indeed, the tube itself touts the product as \\&quot;a scientific dental preparation\\&quot; and claims it has \\&quot;a special blend of antiseptic ingredients and essential oils to help keep your teeth and gums clean and healthy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which sounds great, but... the ingredients listed are : Dicalcium phosphate, aqua, sorbitol, glycerin, aroma, sodium lauryl sulfate, titanium dioxide, sodium silicate, carrageenan, cellulose gum, sodium saccherine, simethicone, CI45430, +/- sodium hydroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no chemist, but I&#x27;m not seeing thymol or essential oils labelled clearly here, and I rather doubt sodium lauryl sulfate was in the original recipe.  If a commenter would direct me, I&#x27;d be glad for the info about thymol or the oils in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did look up dicalcium phosphate (an anti-tartar ingredient) and titanium dioxide (white powder found to produce genetic damage in mice, and also considered possibly carcinogenic to humans per the IARC).  Wikipedia&#x27;s article on sodium silicate will make your head spin with the number of industrial uses it has (including Magic Rocks and setting dyes requiring a high pH).  Carrageenan keeps the ingredients from separating.  Cellulose gum is a thickener.  Simethicone (which you may recall from gas and bloating aid ads) reduces gas in the tummy, but is also an anti-foaming agent.  No clue what CI45430 is.  Sodium hydroxide (also known as lye) is used most in the chemical and paper/pulp industries, and induces alkalinity.  An alkaline state is good for your mouth, as it is acidity which produces much tooth decay, but I don&#x27;t know about my comfort level with using lye regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish the tube and see if there&#x27;s anything outstanding about its performance, but if not, I will probably walk away from this toothpaste, being unable to see the anticeptic qualities, or the thymol, and being uneasy about the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great transaction..  Love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My wife has used EUTHYMOL for the last 15 years.  She is not about to switch.  I am so glad to hear it will remain available and when sources in NYC dried up at several pharmacies the ONLINE purchase was a blessing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Euthymol for 50+ years...still the best. This package arrived well wrapped and on time...would use again without hesitation</li>
            <li> To saler he put two items only and I make complain .... I don&#x27;t know maybe he forget to put the 3rd one. In general I like this product ðŸ˜Š.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of this toothpaste. Keeps my mouth feeling clean! Love it, and the pink color, and the taste! Like peppermint! Yum!</li>
            <li> The best. Shipping was slow</li>
            <li> The real toothpaste !!!!. A daily use of euthymol all the bacterial,  freshens your breath.  It is a herbal germs destroying preparation.</li>
            <li> We grew up using Euthymol Toothpaste. I always pick some up when visiting home in the UK. But now I can order some whenever I run out. Both price and shipping were very competitive for this product.</li>
            <li> Used the product for years. Nothing like it. No mint and does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> Works well. Tastes like Teaberry gum. Good clean feeling and no aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I was mislead by the word triple pack so when I was expecting 6 tube of tooth past I got 3 for $24.00  so I thought of returning same but then the stellar said that I would have had to pay the shipping, I think that it was unfair of me having to pay for the shipping, but this surely will not happen again and I will make sure that I pass on the word</li>
            <li> Our daughter-in-law is from the U.K. and she was distraught when she heard that this toothpaste would no longer be made.  Also, she was having difficulty finding it at all.  So, my first thought was to check Amazon and VOILA!  Needless to say, when she opened one of her Christmas presents and found 3 tubes, she was thrilled and pronounced it &amp;#34;BRILLIANT&amp;#34;, which is the highest complement one can receive, apparently ;-)  Thank you, Amazon, for making Christmas especially BRILLIANT for our daughter-in-law!!</li>
