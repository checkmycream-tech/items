            <li>When applied correctly, the results are astonishing.  </li>
            <li>The price is much more palatable on the auto-ship, and they work with you to change that if needed.  </li>

            <li>Used it for a long time and love it !!!!!</li>
            <li>I tried it every way possible and rarely could get it perfect to do what it is meant to do.  </li>
            <li>the easy way.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Really smooths out fine lines.</li>
            <li>A little does a great job.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>For the price I couldn&#x27;t justify keeping it, as I didn&#x27;t have the time to invest each day in getting it right.</li>
            <li>I am on my second jar of the 7 Minute Lift, and I really find it to improve the look of the fine wrinkles around my eyes, which is where I primarily use it.</li>
            <li>but it is not uncomfortable.</li>

            <li>I use it only for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be in public without using first!</li>
            <li>First, this product does work to tighten the under eye area and other areas with small wrinkles like the frown line.&lt;br /&gt;However, using this product with good results takes a bit of practice.  </li>
            <li>my wet fingertips to smooth it on, or else a smaller eyeshadow brush.  </li>
            <li>Too much leaves the area chalky white with white powdery flakes.</li>
            <li>Too little does nothing, too much leaves a white flakey film on your face.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product really leaves up to its name. it really is a 7 minute face lift. I won&#x27;t be in public without using first!</li>
            <li> Best product ever :)  :)  :)</li>
            <li> Lasts about 8 hrs. Takes practice to blend well otherwise you&#x27;ll get white hazing. But all in all it works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product once you get the hang of it. Really smooths out fine lines.</li>
            <li> I am on my second jar of the 7 Minute Lift, and I really find it to improve the look of the fine wrinkles around my eyes, which is where I primarily use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works fantastic. Will order more!!!</li>
            <li> First, this product does work to tighten the under eye area and other areas with small wrinkles like the frown line.&lt;br /&gt;However, using this product with good results takes a bit of practice.  Too little gives little change.  Too much leaves the area chalky white with white powdery flakes. When dried it feels like the old fashioned egg white mask- you can feel the tightness but it is not uncomfortable. You have to \\&quot;play\\&quot; with it a bit and try it both under and over makeup.  Be patient and practice applying the correct coverage for your face.  When applied correctly, the results are astonishing.  At my hair salon, I asked about the product and the makeup stylist applied it under one eye.  I am 72 and have bags under my eyes.  The difference was so great that my husband thought that the untreated eye was swollen.  I hope that it stays on the market for a long time.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE VERY EVASIVE ABOUT THE QUANTITY BEING SOLD---ALMOST DECEPTIVE.  I FOUND THE PRODUCT IDENTICAL TO A CHEAPER PRODUCT SOLD IN A LARGER QUANTITY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product around my eyes for several years.  Especially at night, since I sleep on my side it helps prevent that &amp;#34;slept on my face&amp;#34; look in the morning. The price is much more palatable on the auto-ship, and they work with you to change that if needed.  I have NO complaints about this product, it works every time.  Just be sure to follow the directions and wait 7 minutes after application before moving your facial muscles.  I do not use the large brush enclosed with the product, but rather my wet fingertips to smooth it on, or else a smaller eyeshadow brush.  I&#x27;ve never used it full-face or on my neck.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it only for special occasions. It&#x27;s pricey, but it works. I would not consider this an every day product. It does dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Love the results ..easy to use..</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I would recommend it for anyone who like to rid themselves of wrinkles, dark circles under the eyes, or crows feet ....the easy way.  The effects last all day and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the Dr. Oz show and was quite impressed w/ the results.  This is my second order of this product and I think it&#x27;s an answer to prayer.  I primerely use it when I&#x27;m going out in public.  I think Athena 7 Minute Lift stands up %100 to what it says it will do.</li>
