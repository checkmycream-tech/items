            <li>This stuff works really good in my hair</li>
            <li>Its really good when your going to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>good product for extensions</li>
            <li>Is More!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very easy to rack the product through your hair and detangle if needed.</li>
            <li>I love the coconut smell as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair is 100% better since i have started using this</li>
            <li>it helps your hair be more shinny and silky..</li>
            <li>Each day I use it, my hair continues to grow more healthy and</li>
            <li>But honestly I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>i saw changes on it the first day..!!</li>
            <li>Well, I first decided that I need to get some sort of product to help my hair become healthy again.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a significant reduction in shed hairs when I combed the product through.</li>
            <li>I looked it up on the internet,  read some good reviews on it and went to walgreens to buy it the same day.</li>
            <li>a sweet coconut</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t full strands though.</li>
            <li>make my hair manageable and leaves it with a nice soft smell.</li>
            <li>It took forever to come but it was worth the wait</li>
            <li>This is not the right product for those who do not like the smell of coconuts.  </li>
            <li>If I put any more than ONE TINY drop in the palm of my hands, my hair looks greasy after I apply it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my first time using this.</li>
            <li>but I would recommend this to everyone particularly curly girls!</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>But dying my hair so often was really taking its toll on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise</li>
            <li>The texture of this product is very slippery</li>
            <li>It has alot of slip and you don&#x27;t need that much of it at all.</li>
            <li>Then you gently lather the serum onto the ends of your damp hair.</li>
            <li>I use this mostly from the middle to the ends, so that I still have body near the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have long, layered frizzy, fine hair.</li>
            <li>If you use too much your hair can easily become very oily and weighed down.</li>
            <li>I used it as a hot oil treatment first and it left my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, nor does it mat down my hair - and my hair is fine.  </li>
            <li>The bottle it comes in is clear with the brand (Organix) and the type of hair it is supposed to be put on (Anti-Breakage).</li>
            <li>, wow this stuff</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have dyed my hair for a lot of years.  </li>
            <li>The bottle has a nozzle that can be opened and closed by twisting it to the right.</li>
            <li>I apply to freshly washed/conditioned hair on wash days; and I also apply every other day as a sealant when I moisturize.</li>
            <li>I have thick long and wavy hair with frezz due to heat damage but when I use this it leaves it in great looking condition and feels soft too.</li>
            <li>if not better results from this this as well as more product!(CD&#x27;s is only 1oz.</li>
            <li>I can only put it on wet hair right out of the shower</li>
            <li>After applying when wet my hair seems much stronger</li>
            <li>This has left it&#x27;s mark, but with this nourishing Coconut Milk Serum my hair feels like it did when I was 20 years old and a virgin to hair products.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest that it helped my hair grow by breaking less, but, after dying it, it does make it feel a little more manageable.</li>
            <li>Split ends, dryness, tons of breakage, and my hair was becoming weak.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that such a small amount would allow me to comb out my long hair so easily.  </li>
            <li>, when I took the towel of my head my hair was soft, and very shiny, and seemed less damaged!</li>
            <li>First I washed and dried it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> does help dry hair ends and shine</li>
            <li> Wash your hair, towel dry, place one squirt in palm of hand and scrunch it into the ends of your hair and all over.  </li>

            <li> but I went to a few stores to get different hair products</li>

            <li> My hair does seem to be healthier after using this every other day (4 pumps); however, I must wash it out, otherwise it gives my hair an oily look.  </li>

            <li> They&#x27;re a waste of time and money to me</li>
            <li> Just place a small amount, LESS than a dime size dot, in the palm of your hands, rub your hands together, then rub your hands through your towled dried hair, concentrating on the damaged areas.  </li>
            <li> Since adding this to my routine I have noticed few broken hairs on the floor and sink, in fact the only way my hair will break is if I put stress on a weak point on a strand and literally snap it off myself.</li>
            <li> Because I color my hair at least once a month,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was especially happy with the detail in packaging...</li>
            <li> Works well for hair breakage, as stated.  Also, it untangles my hair after washing so I don&#x27;t need to use a conditioner.  I use this mostly from the middle to the ends, so that I still have body near the scalp.  It is not greasy, nor does it mat down my hair - and my hair is fine.  Smells fabulous.  I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel oily...even when used sparingly.</li>
            <li> Coconut Milk Serum by Organix, wow this stuff it amazing! Well, I first decided that I need to get some sort of product to help my hair become healthy again. Because I color my hair at least once a month, ( I know, that&#x27;s way to soon to dye your hair, but I just can&#x27;t decide what color I like best, I haven&#x27;t found a color that looks good on me yet).  But dying my hair so often was really taking its toll on my hair.  Split ends, dryness, tons of breakage, and my hair was becoming weak. So I decided to take a brake from dying my hair and give it time to rest.  I told my friend about my situation, and she recommended this product to help witmy hair problem. I looked it up on the internet,  read some good reviews on it and went to walgreens to buy it the same day. That night I used it on my hair after I got out of the shower, I used 1 pump and massaged it through the ends of my hair, then wrapped it up in a towel to let it air dry.  Much to my surprise, when I took the towel of my head my hair was soft, and very shiny, and seemed less damaged! Amazing!  What I learned with this product is Less Is More! You only need a tiny drop in the palm of your hand, and thay tiny drop coats the entire ends of your hair without making it greasy or oily. I think anymore than that will make your hair oily. And it gave my hair the perfect amount of volume!  This product it truly amazing!</li>
            <li> Loving this to go along with shampoo&lt;br /&gt;and conditioner... Smells great and&lt;br /&gt;really does help dry hair ends and shine</li>
            <li> If I put any more than ONE TINY drop in the palm of my hands, my hair looks greasy after I apply it. I can only put it on wet hair right out of the shower or I also have the same problem. I can&#x27;t attest that it helped my hair grow by breaking less, but, after dying it, it does make it feel a little more manageable.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after running out of my monoi oil serum from Carol&#x27;s Daughter. The Carol&#x27;s Daughter one is $30 but I got this at my local Bi-Lo for around $7.99. I feel like a fool for paying $30 for something when I could get the same if not better results from this this as well as more product!(CD&#x27;s is only 1oz. while this is 4oz.) I used it as a hot oil treatment first and it left my hair so soft! I decided to try it as a leave-in on my hair. The texture of this product is very slippery so when you put it on your hair it&#x27;s very easy to rack the product through your hair and detangle if needed. It has alot of slip and you don&#x27;t need that much of it at all. If you use too much your hair can easily become very oily and weighed down. And don&#x27;t get me started on the smell. It is awesome! If you&#x27;ve ever smelled the shea moisture coconut and hibiscus line, this scent is very similar; a sweet coconut scent.&lt;br /&gt;This product is another surprise to me from the Organix line. I still don&#x27;t like their shampoos and conditioners. They&#x27;re a waste of time and money to me but I would recommend this to everyone particularly curly girls!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about one month now and I have to say it does what it says it will do. I apply to freshly washed/conditioned hair on wash days; and I also apply every other day as a sealant when I moisturize. Since adding this to my routine I have noticed few broken hairs on the floor and sink, in fact the only way my hair will break is if I put stress on a weak point on a strand and literally snap it off myself. After applying when wet my hair seems much stronger and I noticed a significant reduction in shed hairs when I combed the product through. Great strengthening product to have in the arsenal for those on a HHJ looking to retain length.</li>
            <li> Intially I was given a bottle of this. I used the bottle up, and was so happy to have found it on Amazon. Don&#x27;t over apply it.  Just place a small amount, LESS than a dime size dot, in the palm of your hands, rub your hands together, then rub your hands through your towled dried hair, concentrating on the damaged areas.  I was amazed that such a small amount would allow me to comb out my long hair so easily.  And my hair did not feel greasy.  I love the coconut smell as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle will last months even if you use it every day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good in my hair but I went to a few stores to get different hair products and I found out that this product is cheaper in some stores</li>
            <li> It took forever to come but it was worth the wait my hair is 100% better since i have started using this</li>
            <li> My hair does seem to be healthier after using this every other day (4 pumps); however, I must wash it out, otherwise it gives my hair an oily look.  I have long, layered frizzy, fine hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my first time using this. I use to buy it at walmwrt but they stopped selling it so I bought it here. Its really good when your going to straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> great product..it helps your hair be more shinny and silky..it protects your hair from breaking i saw changes on it the first day..!!</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever tried for a leave in, nourishing serum.  I am 60 years old and have dyed my hair for a lot of years.  This has left it&#x27;s mark, but with this nourishing Coconut Milk Serum my hair feels like it did when I was 20 years old and a virgin to hair products.  Wash your hair, towel dry, place one squirt in palm of hand and scrunch it into the ends of your hair and all over.  Blow dry and you will never use anything else again.</li>
            <li> Organix Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Hair Repair Serum&lt;br /&gt;One morning about a month ago, I was doing my hair.  First I washed and dried it. Then I brushed and straightened it. When I was done, I glanced down at my shirt. I had hair all over my shirt! It wasn&#x27;t full strands though. I had many broken off ends of hair sticking to my shirt! How gross! The next day, I went exploring. I went to Wal-Mart. In the hygiene aisle, I found Organix Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Hair Repair Serum. I have used it every night on my damp hair after showering. Each day I use it, my hair continues to grow more healthy and strong!&lt;br /&gt;Organix Coconut Milk Anti-Breakage Hair Repair Serum comes in a 4oz. bottle. The bottle it comes in is clear with the brand (Organix) and the type of hair it is supposed to be put on (Anti-Breakage). The bottle has a nozzle that can be opened and closed by twisting it to the right. To apply the serum to you damp/towel dried hair, you push down the nozzle and out comes the serum. Then you rub the serum between the palms of your hands. Then you gently lather the serum onto the ends of your damp hair. The only down side to this product is that it is a little pricey. The price ranges from $5 to $10 depending on where you purchase this product and what type you get.  But honestly I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for anyone who has hair and needs it repaired! This is not the right product for those who do not like the smell of coconuts.  It is a great product though! And it smells delightfully of coconut milk!</li>
            <li> good product for extensions</li>
            <li> Great buy this stuff make my hair manageable and leaves it with a nice soft smell.I have thick long and wavy hair with frezz due to heat damage but when I use this it leaves it in great looking condition and feels soft too.</li>
            <li> This serum is getting well with my hair and the other products of organix .. Ofcourse with the coconut oil shampoo and condition.. Thankx 😁</li>
