    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is one of the best.</li>
            <li>it is great!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best!!!!</li>
            <li>This is virtually the best hand cream I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found it on line!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best I have found.</li>
            <li>this is a must have in my handbag - it&#x27;s the perfect hand cream with a suble grapefruit scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best.</li>
            <li>its a good size to carry in your purse or a carry on suitcase on a flight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The product is excellent as my wife is bed ridden and this hand cream keeps her hands soft as shehas to use her hands to move herself around in the bed.</li>
            <li>Shopping with Amazon is a better experience.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better  for ur hands</li>
            <li>They look and feel soooo much better when I use it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Protective Hand Cream is the best hand cream I have found to moisturize and repair my dry hands.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t ask for anything more from my hand cream!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, although if you don&#x27;t like the citrusy fragrance, you should probably stay away from it (which would be a shame, really, because this product does a lot more than what it claims to do, and that is not found in a lot of products).The best part about this cream is probably that your hands feel soft even if you have exposed them to water more than once shortly AFTER applying this cream.</li>
            <li>worth the money, order 2-1 in the car &amp; 1 in your purse!</li>
            <li>A discounted, unfunctional product sold at full price.</li>
            <li>Best part is it definitely DOES last 18 hours, as described!</li>
            <li>( I don&#x27;t even want to write it here), when it should have a fresh orange scent.</li>
            <li>I use it as a hand cream and a foot cream, and it has been successful in lightening slight skin discolorations as well!   </li>
            <li>and my hands are much improved!</li>
            <li>The 18 hr cream on the other hand, is amazing.   </li>
            <li>It normally has a very pleasant scent and is very effective on my eczema, but I was disappointed as these came after obviously sitting on a shelf for much longer than they should have.</li>
            <li>Like many people, my cuticles get very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>this product really makes a difference on you hands.</li>
            <li>Very happy/</li>
            <li>fact, my girlfriend says my hands look much younger&lt;</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t want to take your nail oil, take this lotion &amp; use instead, its rich enough for your nails/toes!  </li>
            <li>It made my hands perspire slightly, and I can not stand it for more than 5 minutes -</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product and Amazon.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is very hard to find in most grocery stores, drug stores or super stores.</li>
            <li>Since tree years ago i really feel my hands so protective from the outside demage.</li>
            <li>It also is not greasy, and a big plus is not having to use much.</li>
            <li>Since tree years ago I really feel my hands so protective from the outside damage.</li>
            <li>This product came with a taped over crack in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;It was never meant for a tube, it is very thick and would do better in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Since tree years ago i really feel my hands so protective from the outside demage. It is one of the best.</li>
            <li> have used this lotion on &amp; off for quite a while now.  it is great!  its a good size to carry in your purse or a carry on suitcase on a flight.  if you don&#x27;t want to take your nail oil, take this lotion &amp; use instead, its rich enough for your nails/toes!  worth the money, order 2-1 in the car &amp; 1 in your purse!</li>
            <li> I have used the Sally Hansen 18 hr protective hand creme as well as the Sally Hansen Miracle Cure for severely dry hands.    The Miracle cure did not work any miracles for me, except leave my slightly irritated at the feel of the cream. It made my hands perspire slightly, and I can not stand it for more than 5 minutes - I end up washing my hands immediately. It didn&#x27;t work for me.    The 18 hr cream on the other hand, is amazing.   I use it as a hand cream and a foot cream, and it has been successful in lightening slight skin discolorations as well!   It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all, although if you don&#x27;t like the citrusy fragrance, you should probably stay away from it (which would be a shame, really, because this product does a lot more than what it claims to do, and that is not found in a lot of products).The best part about this cream is probably that your hands feel soft even if you have exposed them to water more than once shortly AFTER applying this cream.

            <li> this product really makes a difference on you hands. they look and feel different. Very happy/</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife. At one time I could get it from CVS. Shopping with Amazon is a better experience. The product is excellent as my wife is bed ridden and this hand cream keeps her hands soft as shehas to use her hands to move herself around in the bed. Highly recommend the product and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I work in a restaurant.  The bleach water eats my skin to bleeding.  This is the only product that works. It&#x27;s the best!!!!</li>
            <li> This product came with a taped over crack in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;It was never meant for a tube, it is very thick and would do better in a jar.&lt;br /&gt;I finally had to cut the tube open and use it.  And I&#x27;m just using to use&lt;br /&gt;it up.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better  for ur hands</li>
            <li> I have always loves Sally Hansen hand creams</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and knew what to expect. It normally has a very pleasant scent and is very effective on my eczema, but I was disappointed as these came after obviously sitting on a shelf for much longer than they should have. I purchased four and all four came with the same discounted labels (for obvious reasons). A discounted, unfunctional product sold at full price. I would buy this product if found on a local store shelf in a heartbeat, but I would not purchase it online again.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and my hands are horrible from all of the&lt;br /&gt;washing. This is the one cream that I can use in my pocket&lt;br /&gt;at work or over night at home and my hands are much&lt;br /&gt;smoother and my fingers have fewer splits.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, my girlfriend says my hands look much younger&lt;br /&gt;after using this cream.</li>
            <li> This is virtually the best hand cream I have ever tried. Best part is it definitely DOES last 18 hours, as described!</li>
            <li> Like many people, my cuticles get very dry in the winter. They start to rip &amp; bleed.  Sally Hansen 18 hour Protective Hand Cream is the best hand cream I have found to moisturize and repair my dry hands. I apply it after I shower in the morning and again before I go to bed and my hands are much improved! They look and feel soooo much better when I use it. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find in most grocery stores, drug stores or super stores. I am so happy I found it on line!</li>
            <li> I adore this product, but unfortunately this purchase was a disaster!!! the product stinks with gasoline and smth much worse ( I don&#x27;t even want to write it here), when it should have a fresh orange scent. I am very disappointed. why sell such awful stuff???? I was going to give one to my sister but had to throw both away. It was money waist !!! why aren&#x27;t you guys checking what you sell??? I gave 1 star because of scheduled delivery. That&#x27;s it. It was awful !!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the longest lasting hand cream I&#x27;ve ever used and I love it. It&#x27;s not too greasy and has a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best I have found. I am in water a LOT and find this lasts through several washings. It also is not greasy, and a big plus is not having to use much.</li>
            <li> I saw a friend of mine using this and when I tried it, it removed some dark marks over my knuckles in a short space of time.  I would recommend it for all genders and ages.  This is a fantastic product.  Girls keep in in your grab bag, guys in the glove compartment before you go out on a date.</li>
            <li> this is a must have in my handbag - it&#x27;s the perfect hand cream with a suble grapefruit scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Since tree years ago I really feel my hands so protective from the outside damage. It is one of the best.</li>
