    <ol>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for pre shave.</li>
            <li>Superb product when used in combination with a quality shaving product.</li>
            <li>Especially good if you use DE or injector razors.</li>
            <li>Not the best, but still a good pre-shave product to use.</li>
            <li>A really pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>good size for travel.</li>
            <li>Great smell, nice beard prep.</li>
            <li>I had to use too much of it to be effective</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually impressed with Taylor products, however, not so much with this pre-shave gel.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is made from very high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a question of whether you&#x27;d like this or the oil type better.</li>
            <li>I think there are others out there that do a better job</li>
            <li>years ago, they are almost never a problem any more.</li>
            <li>I found that using this alone isn&#x27;t any better than using the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>Love their pre-shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but there are better pre-shave products by Taylor available.</li>
            <li>Honestly I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in using this product versus using a hot towel to soften my whiskers.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but is lost completely after you are done shaving, even if your shaving cream is unscented.</li>
            <li>No problems with the transaction, everything went smooth and arrived on schedule.  </li>
            <li>The more I use Taylor of Old Bond Street products, the more I like them.</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;re sure-enough moving it in the right direction!</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth, soothing shave, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Taylor of Old Bond Street products.</li>
            <li>If you have money to burn then yes, buy TOB right now.</li>
            <li>This is the first pre-shave gel I used.</li>
            <li>Just taking a tiny bit from the inside of the top of the lid is sufficient to cover your face.  </li>
            <li>The product feels a bit too liquid, so I probably applied more than I needed to prior to shaving.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to pre-shave oils, as both the feel and performance are slightly better than a gel (or this gel).</li>
            <li>**).</li>
            <li>However, my advice is not to try it even one-time because what happens if you REALLY like it!</li>
            <li>Since I first reviewed this product (Taylor Herbal Pre-shave)</li>
            <li>First I agree with the positive reviews regarding the performance and &#x27;feel&#x27; of this pre-shave gel{</li>
            <li>If you are new to wet shaving, a good pre shave can really make a difference.  </li>
            <li>However, when I apply the Proraso first and then apply the Taylor of Old Bond Street Pre-Shave Gel on top of that, I get a noticeably, if only marginally smoother shave.</li>
            <li>I think I was expecting a pot as large as Taylor&#x27;s shaving creams, but this smaller pot (about 2\\&quot; in diameter) is just fine:</li>
            <li>This gel is nice in that it&#x27;s easy to apply compared to the Proraso varieties I have (Crema Pre Barba and Creme Avant Rasage) which seem a bit too thick, and the Truefitt &amp; Hill, which is more of an oil and seems easier to simply mix into my shave soap/cream for extra slickness.</li>
            <li>I never know how much is too much or</li>
            <li>I have used Glessato, Musgo Real, King of Shaves.  </li>
            <li>really produce a lot of oil, so I can handle industrial strength purell alcohol</li>
            <li>Subtle, pleasant scent, too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still one-star because $12.50 is still too high for 30 ml.</li>
            <li>Most pre shaves are heavier and will clog razors (especially cartridge or disposable), but this is light and very slick.  </li>
            <li>This is far better than pre-shave oil if you use a shave brush, because the oil can mess up the badger hair in your brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely sure it would be worth the extra money for most, but if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re struggling with razor burn, you might want to consider giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>B0082BYLS6 Proraso Pre Post Shave Cream, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 100 ml, New Formulation.]]that</li>
            <li>This gel does wonders to decrease irritation in individuals with sensitive skin, and makes for an all around smoother shave.  </li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m a fan of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and aftershaves, I figured I&#x27;d give the pre-shave gel a try.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a subtle scent that will easily dissipate once a shaving cream/soap and then aftershave is applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but certainly not great.</li>
            <li>I am kinda new to shaving with a double edge razor and notice quite a big difference using this product I don&#x27;t think I will shave with out it ever again.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much at all, just a little finger dollup.</li>
            <li>This stuff is every bit as effective as an oil pre-shave at lubricating my skin for a smoother, closer, and less irritating shave--but without all the stickiness and, well, OILINESS.</li>
            <li>how much is too little</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard for me to say whether or not pre-shaves are really necessary when shaving after a hot shower with a sharp double edge (or straight), but I still like to use them.</li>

            <li> the price has come down quite a bit: On Amazon prime it&#x27;s now $12.50 for the same small amount (30 ml or two tablespoons of product), rather than the $25.00 +</li>

            <li> Only thing negative I would have to say about this product</li>

            <li> less than a week??</li>
            <li> It dose not get gooey or messy like pre shave oil&#x27;s do.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s already a small container to begin with.</li>
            <li> Embarrassingly small amount.</li>

            <li> You also get a small amount in the tub, so I felt</li>
            <li> Try instead Corn Husker&#x27;s Hand Lotion... no joke... check its list of ingredients against G.F. Trumper&#x27;s Skin Food at a small fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> that it previously was, which was absurd.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but one little jar lasts about 4 months shaving 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> Just apply a thin layer to your face before soaping with your shave brush.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this from Signature Value, fulfilled by Amazon. I&#x27;ve used it before and it&#x27;s good. Not the best, but still a good pre-shave product to use. My issue is with the amount that came. It was probably 60% empty. I&#x27;ve used this stuff before so I know that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s supposed to be shipped. I&#x27;m not sure what happened here, but I sent it back. It&#x27;s such a small container/amount as it is for the price ($17.50), but to get less than half of the amount of product you&#x27;re supposed to?.. ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!</li>
            <li> Good product. A little goes a long way, which partially justifies the price. It&#x27;s just a question of whether you&#x27;d like this or the oil type better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is every bit as effective as an oil pre-shave at lubricating my skin for a smoother, closer, and less irritating shave--but without all the stickiness and, well, OILINESS. No soap needed to wash my hands of the excess either, just rinse with water. Subtle, pleasant scent, too. I think I was expecting a pot as large as Taylor&#x27;s shaving creams, but this smaller pot (about 2\\&quot; in diameter) is just fine: good size for travel. The more I use Taylor of Old Bond Street products, the more I like them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for over five years and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It provides a smooth, soothing shave, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for pre shave.</li>
            <li> This is the first pre-shave gel I used. It&#x27;s ok but certainly not great. I had to use too much of it to be effective and it&#x27;s already a small container to begin with. I think there are others out there that do a better job e.g. Proraso White Pre-Shave.</li>
            <li> Superb product when used in combination with a quality shaving product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Taylor of Old Bond Street products. I used to get a lot of ingrown hairs in my neck area. Since I started using this pre-shave gel ~4 years ago, they are almost never a problem any more. This is far better than pre-shave oil if you use a shave brush, because the oil can mess up the badger hair in your brush. It is expensive, but one little jar lasts about 4 months shaving 2-3 times per week. You don&#x27;t need very much at all, just a little finger dollup. It smells great and is made from very high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Embarrassingly small amount. I literally thought it was a joke for the amount paid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing a lot of irritation from shaving, so I bought this hoping that it would help. I found that using this alone isn&#x27;t any better than using the [[ASIN:B0082BYLS6 Proraso Pre Post Shave Cream, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 100 ml, New Formulation.]]that I have been using up until now. However, when I apply the Proraso first and then apply the Taylor of Old Bond Street Pre-Shave Gel on top of that, I get a noticeably, if only marginally smoother shave. I&#x27;m not entirely sure it would be worth the extra money for most, but if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re struggling with razor burn, you might want to consider giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> I am kinda new to shaving with a double edge razor and notice quite a big difference using this product I don&#x27;t think I will shave with out it ever again. It dose not get gooey or messy like pre shave oil&#x27;s do. Only thing negative I would have to say about this product is I never know how much is too much or how much is too little it is hard to tell if I have enough.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. It&#x27;s not terrible, but there are better pre-shave products by Taylor available. It&#x27;s much easier to get pre shave gels and oils out of tubes and bottles than scooping it out of this small tub.</li>
            <li> Love their pre-shave.</li>
            <li> I have used Glessato, Musgo Real, King of Shaves.  Most pre shaves are heavier and will clog razors (especially cartridge or disposable), but this is light and very slick.  Highly recommended.  Especially good if you use DE or injector razors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to say whether or not pre-shaves are really necessary when shaving after a hot shower with a sharp double edge (or straight), but I still like to use them. This gel is nice in that it&#x27;s easy to apply compared to the Proraso varieties I have (Crema Pre Barba and Creme Avant Rasage) which seem a bit too thick, and the Truefitt &amp; Hill, which is more of an oil and seems easier to simply mix into my shave soap/cream for extra slickness. It&#x27;s a subtle scent that will easily dissipate once a shaving cream/soap and then aftershave is applied.</li>
            <li> This gel definitely makes my face \\&quot;slicker\\&quot; for shaving, but it doesn&#x27;t soften my whiskers or reduce irritation.  I don&#x27;t notice any improvement when using with my double edge razor.  Everybody&#x27;s face is different, but I can&#x27;t recommend this product...and doubly so because of the high price and small amount.</li>
            <li> After shaving for 20+ years without the benefit of a pre-shave product I got this out of curiosity. My beard is not particularly fine or coarse and I use a Merkur Futur with feather blades. Honestly I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in using this product versus using a hot towel to soften my whiskers. The scent is pleasant but is lost completely after you are done shaving, even if your shaving cream is unscented. If you have an issue with ingrown hairs or have an especially coarse beard this product might be for you but for the vast majority of guys out there a cheaper alternative exists.</li>
            <li> Great smell, nice beard prep. I would probably buy it again. I like the gel property but it&#x27;s a small amount.</li>
            <li> Although this gel is pricey, you get what you pay for.  If you are new to wet shaving, a good pre shave can really make a difference.  This is a small container, but it goes a LONG way.  Just taking a tiny bit from the inside of the top of the lid is sufficient to cover your face.  This gel does wonders to decrease irritation in individuals with sensitive skin, and makes for an all around smoother shave.  Just apply a thin layer to your face before soaping with your shave brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually impressed with Taylor products, however, not so much with this pre-shave gel. It looks like jello and doesn&#x27;t last beyond one pass. You also get a small amount in the tub, so I felt like perhaps I wasted my money. Bottom line is that I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this pre-shave.</li>
            <li> A really pleasant scent. I have acne issues and this stuff seems to alleviate acne issue combined with this as a post shave -&gt; purell [[ASIN:B004ZS9LO4 Purell 9031-06 Alcohol Formulation Sanitizing Wipes, 175-Count (6 Cartons per Case)]] and witch hazel [[ASIN:B001BR97A0 Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera 12 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really produce a lot of oil, so I can handle industrial strength purell alcohol wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid like 19 and some change back in the summer, it is now 25 and some change.  I&#x27;ll pass for now.</li>
            <li> No problems with the transaction, everything went smooth and arrived on schedule.  Because I&#x27;m a fan of Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving creams and aftershaves, I figured I&#x27;d give the pre-shave gel a try.  I can&#x27;t say the price justifies the product.  The product feels a bit too liquid, so I probably applied more than I needed to prior to shaving.  But this is because I didn&#x27;t *feel* I had a sufficient layer.  I&#x27;m going back to pre-shave oils, as both the feel and performance are slightly better than a gel (or this gel).</li>
            <li> Terrible.  All of the scent was gone.  Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> First I agree with the positive reviews regarding the performance and &#x27;feel&#x27; of this pre-shave gel{*****). Unfortunately, I also agree with the negative reviews regarding the high price and small amount of this stuff you receive{*}. If you shave everyday you could go through a jar of TOB pre-shave in... what?... less than a week?? Maybe you could get an entire week out of it, but, there are four weeks in a month: $100+ a month just on pre-shave gel?!??! If you have money to burn then yes, buy TOB right now. However, my advice is not to try it even one-time because what happens if you REALLY like it! What are you going to do then? Try instead Corn Husker&#x27;s Hand Lotion... no joke... check its list of ingredients against G.F. Trumper&#x27;s Skin Food at a small fraction of the price. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ UPDATE: Since I first reviewed this product (Taylor Herbal Pre-shave) the price has come down quite a bit: On Amazon prime it&#x27;s now $12.50 for the same small amount (30 ml or two tablespoons of product), rather than the $25.00 + that it previously was, which was absurd. However, it&#x27;s still one-star because $12.50 is still too high for 30 ml. But they&#x27;re sure-enough moving it in the right direction!</li>
