            <li>For a whitening toothpaste I was pretty impressed and would say this one was the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>But this toothpaste is perfect flavor and texture and it really whitens!!!!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve been used this product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, its a good brand of tooth paste.</li>
            <li>The flavor is really charming.</li>
            <li>This along with a good toothbrush would remove all the surface stains I had in a matter of days.  </li>
            <li>But when I  used it, I found the function is good.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>My teeth are prone to staining, and can become exceptionally yellowed in between teeth and the edges where teeth meet.</li>
            <li>and it is the perfect combination for clean and healthy teeth!</li>
            <li>good product and will buy again for sure!  </li>
            <li>Great product that works as advertised :-)</li>

            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>As the title suggests, I had very good results with this toothpaste - most importantly that it delivered on it&#x27;s promise to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>The results were amazing...</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, I can feel good condition after using that.</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t great-- a more chemical note than most toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried, but that&#x27;s understandable.</li>
            <li>Honestly?</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used in my whole life it really keeps my teeth sooo clean also my breath also it taste good :D</li>
            <li>This lives up to what it claims and that is just awesome in today&#x27;s over praised self promotion world we live in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and honestly notice a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth!</li>
            <li>The flavor is great and this product is well worth the price for me.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really good, they&#x27;re glassy smooth and my teeth aren&#x27;t tan anymore -they</li>
            <li>Good toothpaste, i personally did not notice a tremendous difference but a family member is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident that the dingy &amp;#34;coffee teeth&amp;#34</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Pick up the mouth rinse as a companion product for better results.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It whitens ok.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>My sister and her family uses this toothpaste alone and they love it.  </li>
            <li>Its toothpaste, it tastes ok, it cleans teeth, and it might help whitening.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I love Crest products and this is another on my list.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I believe one or more ingredient caused a problem</li>
            <li>Ok now that I quit use.</li>
            <li>Okay, so there&#x27;s no Helen Keller in this toothpaste</li>
            <li>I found that whitening toothpastes were safe.</li>
            <li>This tooth paste works great, and makes my mouth feel super clean after every wash.</li>
            <li>Unless you have perfect teeth, I personally think glamorous costs more than a tube of tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>It does help, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Plus this toothpaste leaves your breath very fresh and minty and it lasts!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: Decent priced, great taste, but no noticeable results</li>
            <li>It brightens teeth and gives you a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel very clean and refreshes my mouth.</li>
            <li>It leaves your mouth feeling very clean and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>I agree with another review that I seem to brush longer with this toothpaste, because it stays pretty foamy and lasts a good while in your mouth.</li>
            <li>It does cause some sensitivity at first if you are not used to harsher toothpastes but after about 3 days, I was good to go.  </li>
            <li>I already have a pretty good sonic toothbrush and not a lot of staining</li>
            <li>I am impressed and it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li>I have been using this along with my first box of Crest whitestrips and I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a sensitive mouth, though, I think it&#x27;s a great toothpaste.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not saying my teeth are bright white (heck no, ;-( I smoke on and off and I drink coffee) but I AM saying I notice a brighter smile and it tastes great.  </li>
            <li>We both agree that the flavor and texture is great and makes our teeth feel super clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind it removes surface stains, you won&#x27;t get super bright bright teeth, just a clean smile, which is worth the money.</li>
            <li>It foams alright and the application is easy.  </li>
            <li>and I think the toothpaste ended up being too strong for my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I get complements all the time on how white and beautiful my teeth are...</li>
            <li>It tastes great and leaves my teeth feeling very smooth, clean and white.  </li>
            <li>the taste is fine.  </li>
            <li>Really great toothpaste that actually works!!!</li>
            <li>and they work, but they don&#x27;t work great, especially at whitening.  </li>
            <li>But it is cheap,  </li>
            <li>This tooth paste gets your teeth white and tastes great.  </li>
            <li>What a great product, and relatively inexpensive, too!</li>
            <li>and don&#x27;t forget the Torani syrups, sugar free, of course.</li>
            <li>overall great product.</li>
            <li>I used this for 2 weeks now and already i see a good 35% more white teeth compared to how i was a month ago.</li>
            <li>Will keep monitoring the progress but so far so good</li>
            <li>Just started using it, so I havent really noticed the whitening, but love the clean feel!</li>
            <li>- THAT would probably help the most ;-)</li>
            <li>This toothpast make my mouth fee unbelievably clean and fresh!  </li>
            <li>It continues whiten my teeth, and my mouth feels extremely clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>She was right!  </li>
            <li>Brush twice a day and floss, that&#x27;ll have you on the right path to a healthier mouth!</li>
            <li>: I love the clean feeling afterwards, the flavor is minty but not too much.  </li>
            <li>Now 10 days later, no sensitivity, no gum pain, just nice white teeth and a happy customer.  </li>
            <li>the trick is to brush with a good tooth brush maybe a Oral-B Pulsar 3d White toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So, I really don&#x27;t need to be more glamorous than I already am, but I tried this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The taste takes a little getting used to, its very strong, but overall, excellent product.</li>
            <li>I will always and forever be devoted to Colgate when it comes to feeling clean and fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m currently pregnant</li>
            <li>A really effective stain remover (I am a daily coffee drinker) and it left a pleasant, tingly mint feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>My wife and I noticed the first morning how clean our mouths felt after a night of sleep.</li>
            <li>I have neglected the color of my teeth for a few years and was ready for a dentist&#x27;s whitening when I thought about researching a good whitening toothpaste and better toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It worth the money.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste has a fresh after taste which will even fight through coffee breath afterwards.  </li>
            <li>noticeably whitened up after 3 days&#x27; worth of use, 2x&#x27;s a day,</li>
            <li>I saw no results on the whitening front, so it&#x27;s in no way worth it for me.</li>
            <li>You will have fresh breath, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>As far as whitening though, Crest does a better job.</li>
            <li>The Vivid whitens pretty well, but this is even better.</li>
            <li>After first use, I felt a mild soreness in my gums and tongue, but those went away.</li>
            <li>yea right, jus another toothpaste on the market, i use it for 2 months now</li>
            <li>notice a difference right away.....</li>
            <li>It works and I love my white smile.  </li>
            <li>This product works fine, but favorite still is still the [[ASIN:B004VGSVHS Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Radiant Mint Toothpaste Twin Pack, 11.6-Ounce]].</li>
            <li>This has to be the most incredible product of the last decade at least!</li>
            <li>, I have a new smile!</li>
            <li>This stuff actually does work, unlike most whitening toothpastes out there.</li>
            <li>Actually this is the first top toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li>And it whitened my teeth noticibly within the first time using this product.</li>
            <li>and i hope to get them even more white.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should do.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste worked really well!</li>
            <li>pretty whites.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Decent toothpaste yet doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to whiten my teeth on its own to warrant its high price and smaller packaging.</li>
            <li>Even the first time you use it it noticeably gets whiter, but by the end of one week, my teeth are really white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>those little vertical lines on your top lip!</li>
            <li>I know it costs a little more than others, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this toothpaste because I have been satisfied with other crest whitening products and because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a huge change and definitely not on par with bleaching them</li>
            <li>really does work.</li>
            <li>Really helps improve the look of your teeth...</li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I have used other whitening toothpastes that have worked much better for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m OCD about brushing my teeth and usually brush them for 2 and a half minutes, and so far this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I love this Crest 3d White Glamorous White Teeth Whitening Vibrant Mint Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>After about a week, my teeth were not only more white but also felt the way they do after a tooth polishing at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>think most of the toothpastes that have whitening as a list of many features are useless for whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main reason I purchases was because I also bought whitestrips and just wanted to try everything they had.</li>
            <li>Taste is decent too, doesnt gag me at all.</li>
            <li>Price is way too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But wow, this product really does work in days.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive and it cleans my teeth and mouth very well.</li>
            <li>But for how white it makes my teeth, its worth switching over.</li>
            <li>Seemed to have brightened my smile- costs the same as I found in the stores.</li>
            <li>Normally I would just bleach my teeth</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference but after about two weeks or so my teeth were definitely brighter.</li>
            <li>After going through the first toothpaste tube, I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it took the brown and yellow away right away and lightened the stains about 2 shades.</li>
            <li>Finally I can smile without feeling self conscious about my teeth!.  </li>
            <li>so if I were you, I&#x27;d buy a smaller tube to try out (if available) before purchasing a bigger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have a very sensitive mouth</li>
            <li>I also like a more gritty texture which may be due to baking soda or something.</li>
            <li>The Vivid burns your mouth and this doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li>the first time I brushed!  </li>
            <li>Even whitens better than the gentle white strips, without being too harsh.</li>
            <li>Based on all of the positive reviews I decided to give this a try and not only does it work, but it doesn&#x27;t cause any tooth sensitivity for me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell any difference from any other toothpase aside from that, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to using white strips which are expensive and hurt your gums and give you sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>So in saying that, I have been using natural toothpastes for a while</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive teeth, I have difficulty with tooth whitening products.  </li>
            <li>Now I just need to finish up all the old toothpaste in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smoke or drink soft drinks.</li>
            <li>In almost exactly 4 days of night and morning brushing, I had my sparkly white chopper back.  </li>
            <li>It means that it does in fact do what it sets out to which is why you bought it, and who am I to notice the other subtle changes in my dental health - good or bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great toothpaste</li>
            <li>Cheap and quick results without expensive whitening treatments.</li>
            <li>Overall, this just seems like a normal toothpaste to me</li>
            <li>I have braces so it is hard to keep my teeth white without able to use whitening strips.</li>
            <li>Crest 3d White Luxe Glamorous White Vibrant Mint Flavor Whitening...</li>
            <li>Its been a struggle to keep my teeth white as I\\&quot;m getting older and drink coffee daily.  </li>
            <li>After buying all the 3d White items and trying them out seperately and together, I&#x27;m convinced all you really need are the white strips and stick with your regular floss, brush, mouthwash and toothpaste</li>
            <li>My teeth are way too sensitive for the crest white strips</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not \\&quot;appliance white\\&quot;, but a natural white that I like.</li>
            <li>Have used Crest Products since I was old enough to brush, encouraged by my parents.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Crest Vivid 3D White, but once I tried this I never looked back.</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every other whitening toothpaste on the market, and could never tell wether or not they really worked.</li>
            <li>though since I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste along with other products I can&#x27;t really tell which of these did the job (i think all 3 of them</li>
            <li>Not sure what to expect when buying this, but figured it was worth a shot.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> The results were amazing...</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, I can feel good condition after using that.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t great-- a more chemical note than most toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried, but that&#x27;s understandable.</li>
            <li> Honestly?</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used in my whole life it really keeps my teeth sooo clean also my breath also it taste good :D</li>
            <li> This lives up to what it claims and that is just awesome in today&#x27;s over praised self promotion world we live in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and honestly notice a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth!</li>
            <li> The flavor is great and this product is well worth the price for me.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really good, they&#x27;re glassy smooth and my teeth aren&#x27;t tan anymore -they</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste, i personally did not notice a tremendous difference but a family member is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I feel more confident that the dingy &amp;#34;coffee teeth&amp;#34</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Pick up the mouth rinse as a companion product for better results.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It whitens ok.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> My sister and her family uses this toothpaste alone and they love it.  </li>
            <li> Its toothpaste, it tastes ok, it cleans teeth, and it might help whitening.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I love Crest products and this is another on my list.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li> and I believe one or more ingredient caused a problem</li>
            <li> Ok now that I quit use.</li>
            <li> Okay, so there&#x27;s no Helen Keller in this toothpaste</li>
            <li> I found that whitening toothpastes were safe.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste works great, and makes my mouth feel super clean after every wash.</li>
            <li> Unless you have perfect teeth, I personally think glamorous costs more than a tube of tooth paste.  </li>
            <li> It does help, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Plus this toothpaste leaves your breath very fresh and minty and it lasts!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: Decent priced, great taste, but no noticeable results</li>
            <li> It brightens teeth and gives you a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel very clean and refreshes my mouth.</li>
            <li> It leaves your mouth feeling very clean and it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I agree with another review that I seem to brush longer with this toothpaste, because it stays pretty foamy and lasts a good while in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It does cause some sensitivity at first if you are not used to harsher toothpastes but after about 3 days, I was good to go.  </li>
            <li> I already have a pretty good sonic toothbrush and not a lot of staining</li>
            <li> I am impressed and it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with my first box of Crest whitestrips and I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a sensitive mouth, though, I think it&#x27;s a great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not saying my teeth are bright white (heck no, ;-( I smoke on and off and I drink coffee) but I AM saying I notice a brighter smile and it tastes great.  </li>
            <li> We both agree that the flavor and texture is great and makes our teeth feel super clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind it removes surface stains, you won&#x27;t get super bright bright teeth, just a clean smile, which is worth the money.</li>
            <li> It foams alright and the application is easy.  </li>
            <li> and I think the toothpaste ended up being too strong for my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I get complements all the time on how white and beautiful my teeth are...</li>
            <li> It tastes great and leaves my teeth feeling very smooth, clean and white.  </li>
            <li> the taste is fine.  </li>
            <li> Really great toothpaste that actually works!!!</li>
            <li> and they work, but they don&#x27;t work great, especially at whitening.  </li>
            <li> But it is cheap,  </li>
            <li> This tooth paste gets your teeth white and tastes great.  </li>
            <li> What a great product, and relatively inexpensive, too!</li>
            <li> and don&#x27;t forget the Torani syrups, sugar free, of course.</li>
            <li> overall great product.</li>
            <li> I used this for 2 weeks now and already i see a good 35% more white teeth compared to how i was a month ago.</li>
            <li> Will keep monitoring the progress but so far so good</li>
            <li> Just started using it, so I havent really noticed the whitening, but love the clean feel!</li>
            <li> - THAT would probably help the most ;-)</li>
            <li> This toothpast make my mouth fee unbelievably clean and fresh!  </li>
            <li> It continues whiten my teeth, and my mouth feels extremely clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> She was right!  </li>
            <li> Brush twice a day and floss, that&#x27;ll have you on the right path to a healthier mouth!</li>
            <li> : I love the clean feeling afterwards, the flavor is minty but not too much.  </li>
            <li> Now 10 days later, no sensitivity, no gum pain, just nice white teeth and a happy customer.  </li>
            <li> the trick is to brush with a good tooth brush maybe a Oral-B Pulsar 3d White toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So, I really don&#x27;t need to be more glamorous than I already am, but I tried this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> The taste takes a little getting used to, its very strong, but overall, excellent product.</li>
            <li> I will always and forever be devoted to Colgate when it comes to feeling clean and fresh after brushing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m currently pregnant</li>
            <li> A really effective stain remover (I am a daily coffee drinker) and it left a pleasant, tingly mint feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> My wife and I noticed the first morning how clean our mouths felt after a night of sleep.</li>
            <li> I have neglected the color of my teeth for a few years and was ready for a dentist&#x27;s whitening when I thought about researching a good whitening toothpaste and better toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It worth the money.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a fresh after taste which will even fight through coffee breath afterwards.  </li>
            <li> noticeably whitened up after 3 days&#x27; worth of use, 2x&#x27;s a day,</li>
            <li> I saw no results on the whitening front, so it&#x27;s in no way worth it for me.</li>
            <li> You will have fresh breath, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> As far as whitening though, Crest does a better job.</li>
            <li> The Vivid whitens pretty well, but this is even better.</li>
            <li> After first use, I felt a mild soreness in my gums and tongue, but those went away.</li>
            <li> yea right, jus another toothpaste on the market, i use it for 2 months now</li>
            <li> notice a difference right away.....</li>
            <li> It works and I love my white smile.  </li>
            <li> This product works fine, but favorite still is still the [[ASIN:B004VGSVHS Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Radiant Mint Toothpaste Twin Pack, 11.6-Ounce]].</li>
            <li> This has to be the most incredible product of the last decade at least!</li>
            <li> , I have a new smile!</li>
            <li> This stuff actually does work, unlike most whitening toothpastes out there.</li>
            <li> Actually this is the first top toothpaste I have ever used.</li>
            <li> And it whitened my teeth noticibly within the first time using this product.</li>
            <li> and i hope to get them even more white.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should do.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste worked really well!</li>
            <li> pretty whites.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Decent toothpaste yet doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to whiten my teeth on its own to warrant its high price and smaller packaging.</li>
            <li> Even the first time you use it it noticeably gets whiter, but by the end of one week, my teeth are really white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> those little vertical lines on your top lip!</li>
            <li> I know it costs a little more than others, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this toothpaste because I have been satisfied with other crest whitening products and because of all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a huge change and definitely not on par with bleaching them</li>
            <li> really does work.</li>
            <li> Really helps improve the look of your teeth...</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I have used other whitening toothpastes that have worked much better for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OCD about brushing my teeth and usually brush them for 2 and a half minutes, and so far this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love this Crest 3d White Glamorous White Teeth Whitening Vibrant Mint Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> After about a week, my teeth were not only more white but also felt the way they do after a tooth polishing at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> think most of the toothpastes that have whitening as a list of many features are useless for whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchases was because I also bought whitestrips and just wanted to try everything they had.</li>
            <li> Taste is decent too, doesnt gag me at all.</li>
            <li> Price is way too high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> But wow, this product really does work in days.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive and it cleans my teeth and mouth very well.</li>
            <li> But for how white it makes my teeth, its worth switching over.</li>
            <li> Seemed to have brightened my smile- costs the same as I found in the stores.</li>
            <li> Normally I would just bleach my teeth</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference but after about two weeks or so my teeth were definitely brighter.</li>
            <li> After going through the first toothpaste tube, I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it took the brown and yellow away right away and lightened the stains about 2 shades.</li>
            <li> Finally I can smile without feeling self conscious about my teeth!.  </li>
            <li> so if I were you, I&#x27;d buy a smaller tube to try out (if available) before purchasing a bigger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have a very sensitive mouth</li>
            <li> I also like a more gritty texture which may be due to baking soda or something.</li>
            <li> The Vivid burns your mouth and this doesn&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> the first time I brushed!  </li>
            <li> Even whitens better than the gentle white strips, without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> Based on all of the positive reviews I decided to give this a try and not only does it work, but it doesn&#x27;t cause any tooth sensitivity for me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference from any other toothpase aside from that, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to using white strips which are expensive and hurt your gums and give you sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> So in saying that, I have been using natural toothpastes for a while</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive teeth, I have difficulty with tooth whitening products.  </li>
            <li> Now I just need to finish up all the old toothpaste in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smoke or drink soft drinks.</li>
            <li> In almost exactly 4 days of night and morning brushing, I had my sparkly white chopper back.  </li>
            <li> It means that it does in fact do what it sets out to which is why you bought it, and who am I to notice the other subtle changes in my dental health - good or bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great toothpaste</li>
            <li> Cheap and quick results without expensive whitening treatments.</li>
            <li> Overall, this just seems like a normal toothpaste to me</li>
            <li> I have braces so it is hard to keep my teeth white without able to use whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Crest 3d White Luxe Glamorous White Vibrant Mint Flavor Whitening...</li>
            <li> Its been a struggle to keep my teeth white as I\\&quot;m getting older and drink coffee daily.  </li>
            <li> After buying all the 3d White items and trying them out seperately and together, I&#x27;m convinced all you really need are the white strips and stick with your regular floss, brush, mouthwash and toothpaste</li>
            <li> My teeth are way too sensitive for the crest white strips</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not \\&quot;appliance white\\&quot;, but a natural white that I like.</li>
            <li> Have used Crest Products since I was old enough to brush, encouraged by my parents.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Crest Vivid 3D White, but once I tried this I never looked back.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every other whitening toothpaste on the market, and could never tell wether or not they really worked.</li>
            <li> though since I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste along with other products I can&#x27;t really tell which of these did the job (i think all 3 of them</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect when buying this, but figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> (All of Crest&#x27;s other toothpastes as far as I know contain it)</li>
            <li> previously tried the Crest 3D Vivid White toothpaste and that worked over 1-2 weeks as advertised.  </li>
            <li> He suggested I could drink coffee through a straw, but apparently he never noticed that straw drinking encourages (NO, CAUSES)</li>
            <li> It was really annoying, because I take really good care of my teeth (brush/floss regularly), and to have brownish choppers was bothersome to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried white strips and various other products.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts really long time.</li>
            <li> I drink asian green and brown teas everyday at work, so my teeth aren&#x27;t very white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot like the whitening strips, but I like using this product to keep my teeth white after I have used the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I like how my teeth and mouth feels after I brush my teet and the feeling lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Glamorous White is seriously the only commercially made toothpaste that I could find that doesn&#x27;t contain this ingredient.</li>
            <li> Other toothpastes never motivate me to brush a long time.</li>
            <li> My teeth were starting to look a little dinghy and it was bugging me so after reading up</li>
            <li> This definitely did whiten my teeth a little.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t see a reason to use any other toothpaste moving forward.  </li>
            <li> A week ago I noticed my teeth had an extreme amount of plaque and discoloration.</li>
            <li> it matches my other</li>
            <li> dont miss the tooth-buzzing sensitivity of other whiteners at all, as this toothpaste causes no pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li> No more wasting money on white strips.</li>
            <li> Something i find with alot of other tooth pastes.</li>
            <li> I had used several others in the past with little to no results</li>
            <li> so I was pretty ill with breathing issues for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The paste itself is good, but the taste is god awful.</li>
            <li> Down side is</li>
            <li> Considering how expensive and annoying the strips are, this toothpaste is a great alternative.  </li>
            <li> I consider myself a little bit of a connoisseur.  </li>
            <li> Not too minty, a little medicinal...</li>
            <li> My teeth weren&#x27;t terrible but they needed some whitening for sure!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and a few others, hoping to improve the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> but I did not see any improvements or any changes with it&#x27;s claim of getting couple shades whiter in a few days.</li>
            <li> now, you won&#x27;t see results until a few weeks of using the product, so be patient.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, this product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see a noticable difference in a few days.</li>
            <li> I began getting raw places inside my mouth.  </li>
            <li> When I stopped using the toothpaste, the raw places healed.  </li>
            <li> Its a little hard to judge their &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; claims but I tend to judge any of those claims with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of Crest products and teeth whitening toothpaste in the past but this one didn&#x27;t surprise or &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me with it&#x27;s results.</li>
            <li> After about the seventh use, my teeth were strangely sensitive for 12 hours, as if I was biting into something cold even when I wasn&#x27;t eating or chewing on anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the word glamorous to describe the product the ad uses.  </li>
            <li> Nothing bad about this toothpaste at all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, though it is a little bit expensive than other.</li>
            <li> Really weird taste.</li>
            <li> I ordered wrong product.</li>
            <li> Sucralose &#x3D; Fake Sugar (Splenda).</li>
            <li> I was wrong...</li>
            <li> Not only was he charging $500 but the worst part?</li>
            <li> (bad joke, I know)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff actually does work, unlike most whitening toothpastes out there. Even whitens better than the gentle white strips, without being too harsh. The taste takes a little getting used to, its very strong, but overall, excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love this Crest 3d White Glamorous White Teeth Whitening Vibrant Mint Toothpaste.  I use the crest white strips every 6 months and use this toothpaste daily.  I get compliments on my teeth daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and a few others, hoping to improve the whiteness of my teeth. Just by using this product alone, I cannot tell a difference. And I&#x27;ve been used this product before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, its a good brand of tooth paste. I like the smell, and the taste... Its toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of Crest products and teeth whitening toothpaste in the past but this one didn&#x27;t surprise or &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; me with it&#x27;s results. It tastes great but I did not see any improvements or any changes with it&#x27;s claim of getting couple shades whiter in a few days. It looks like the reviews are quite mixed so if I were you, I&#x27;d buy a smaller tube to try out (if available) before purchasing a bigger one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Decent priced, great taste, but no noticeable results</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this toothpaste because I have been satisfied with other crest whitening products and because of all of the positive reviews. I was disappointed. I have used this product twice a day for over a month now and have not noticed any effect. Also, the toothpaste leaves a filmy, bleachy residue on my hands and mouth. I have used other whitening toothpastes that have worked much better for me. Overall, this just seems like a normal toothpaste to me and I would not recommend buying it for its whitening effects.</li>
            <li> it is one of the best I have ever used&lt;br /&gt;use it twice a day and you will get and maintain you white teeth</li>
            <li> Decent toothpaste yet doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything to whiten my teeth on its own to warrant its high price and smaller packaging. After buying all the 3d White items and trying them out seperately and together, I&#x27;m convinced all you really need are the white strips and stick with your regular floss, brush, mouthwash and toothpaste</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to using white strips which are expensive and hurt your gums and give you sensitive teeth. I did notice my teeth get whiter but they aren&#x27;t as white as white white white as white gets. However this tooth paste does work but don&#x27;t expect a $1000+ Dentist office whitening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and honestly notice a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth! I feel more confident that the dingy &amp;#34;coffee teeth&amp;#34; look is fading and I&#x27;m getting a pearly grin back again. I have zero complaints.</li>
            <li> Actually this is the first top toothpaste I have ever used. The flavor is really charming. What&#x27;s more, I can feel good condition after using that. The fragrance lasts really long time. I would like to subscribe it in the future!</li>
            <li> I am picky with toothpaste flavors and textures. I only like peppermint flavors, no fakey mint/bubblegum, or spearmint. I also like a more gritty texture which may be due to baking soda or something. But this toothpaste is perfect flavor and texture and it really whitens!!!! I had some yellowing  on my lower teeth and it is already whiter after last night. Brushed again this morning and even brighter! I agree with another review that I seem to brush longer with this toothpaste, because it stays pretty foamy and lasts a good while in your mouth. Really great toothpaste that actually works!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to getting canker sores and I read several times to avoid toothpastes that contain sodium lauryl sulfate. Glamorous White is seriously the only commercially made toothpaste that I could find that doesn&#x27;t contain this ingredient. (All of Crest&#x27;s other toothpastes as far as I know contain it) That being said, I haven&#x27;t had a canker sore since I started using this toothpaste. The flavor is great and this product is well worth the price for me. Please don&#x27;t ever discontinue this, Crest and P&amp;G!</li>
            <li> Loved the toothpaste and the service is excellent</li>
            <li> Crest 3d White Luxe Glamorous White Vibrant Mint Flavor Whitening...really does work. I am impressed and it&#x27;s money well spent. Thank you.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, I drink a lot of coffee and tea... a lot!  I don&#x27;t smoke but again, I drink A LOT of coffee.  I consider myself a little bit of a connoisseur.  So in saying that, I have been using natural toothpastes for a while and they work, but they don&#x27;t work great, especially at whitening.  I have neglected the color of my teeth for a few years and was ready for a dentist&#x27;s whitening when I thought about researching a good whitening toothpaste and better toothbrush.  My dentist recommended Glamorous White by Crest 3D Luxe and the companion rinse.  This along with a good toothbrush would remove all the surface stains I had in a matter of days.  She was right!  I literally could not believe my eyes.  In almost exactly 4 days of night and morning brushing, I had my sparkly white chopper back.  My caps were back to their gleaming white and the teeth matched.  The paste is a gel/paste combo that is a tad gritty but the taste is fine.  Not too minty, a little medicinal... It foams alright and the application is easy.  It does cause some sensitivity at first if you are not used to harsher toothpastes but after about 3 days, I was good to go.  Now 10 days later, no sensitivity, no gum pain, just nice white teeth and a happy customer.  Pick up the mouth rinse as a companion product for better results.</li>
            <li> I smoked for over 25 years and drink coffee daily- this toothpaste has done a great job of whitening my teeth and reducing the stains.  It tastes good and leaves my teeth feeling great.</li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive teeth, I have difficulty with tooth whitening products.  Based on all of the positive reviews I decided to give this a try and not only does it work, but it doesn&#x27;t cause any tooth sensitivity for me.  After about a week, my teeth were not only more white but also felt the way they do after a tooth polishing at the dentist.  Great product that works as advertised :-)</li>
            <li> Started using this and I absolutely love it. Makes my teeth feel very clean and refreshes my mouth. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with my first box of Crest whitestrips and I am very pleased with the results, I have a new smile! Plus this toothpaste leaves your breath very fresh and minty and it lasts! I love it!</li>
            <li> My teeth are prone to staining, and can become exceptionally yellowed in between teeth and the edges where teeth meet. I have tried almost every other whitening toothpaste on the market, and could never tell wether or not they really worked. This toothpaste is amazing. It REMOVED all the stains in my mouth in 5 nights. It continues whiten my teeth, and my mouth feels extremely clean after brushing. Also, I have had no increase in sensitivity. I know it costs a little more than others, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. You will not regret buying this.</li>
            <li> I drink asian green and brown teas everyday at work, so my teeth aren&#x27;t very white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most of the toothpastes that have whitening as a list of many features are useless for whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously tried the Crest 3D Vivid White toothpaste and that worked over 1-2 weeks as advertised.  But wow, this product really does work in days.  Even the first time you use it it noticeably gets whiter, but by the end of one week, my teeth are really white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course with any product that actually works well, it&#x27;s never the product on sale at Target or Walmart.  So with Amazon Prime I can stock up at the low end of retail pricing.  Considering how expensive and annoying the strips are, this toothpaste is a great alternative.  And I don&#x27;t see a reason to use any other toothpaste moving forward.  Now I just need to finish up all the old toothpaste in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this expensive compared to most regular toothpastes?  Yes, definitely.  But for how white it makes my teeth, its worth switching over.</li>
            <li> Crest 3d luxe glamorous white.....yea right, jus another toothpaste on the market, i use it for 2 months now and i see no difference ....the same like colgate, aquafresh sensodyne ...you name it...all the same..</li>
            <li> the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used in my whole life it really keeps my teeth sooo clean also my breath also it taste good :D</li>
            <li> Really weird taste. The paste itself is good, but the taste is god awful. Don&#x27;t know if I would buy this flavor again.</li>
            <li> As the title suggests, I had very good results with this toothpaste - most importantly that it delivered on it&#x27;s promise to whiten my teeth. I can&#x27;t tell any difference from any other toothpase aside from that, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing. It means that it does in fact do what it sets out to which is why you bought it, and who am I to notice the other subtle changes in my dental health - good or bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great toothpaste and I&#x27;ve reordered an even bigger tube recently.</li>
            <li> I had braces for 3.5 years and just took them off today. There was a stain where I had the brackets removed. I bought this on a whim at Target for $3.45. And it whitened my teeth noticibly within the first time using this product. I use this toothpaste with a battery operated toothbrush for the best results.</li>
            <li> It worth the money. I purchased four tubes. For me and my family.Our teeth weren&#x27;t very yellow, but it has whitened them. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I used this for 2 weeks now and already i see a good 35% more white teeth compared to how i was a month ago. Im blown away and i hope to get them even more white. the trick is to brush with a good tooth brush maybe a Oral-B Pulsar 3d White toothbrush. I brush twice a day and i see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy Crest 3D White Whitestrips. I ordered wrong product. But it is cheap,  I  didn&#x27;t to return it. But when I  used it, I found the function is good. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> They are correct to name it Glamorous White Teeth... It works and I love my white smile.  I get complements all the time on how white and beautiful my teeth are... Thank you.</li>
            <li> Seemed to have brightened my smile- costs the same as I found in the stores. I will buy this stuff again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste, it noticeably whitens.  Does exactly what it should do.  Didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive at all.  Used whitening strips after I had been using the toothpaste, and my teeth looked great!</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste, i personally did not notice a tremendous difference but a family member is very happy with the results. Will keep monitoring the progress but so far so good</li>
            <li> This toothpaste has a fresh after taste which will even fight through coffee breath afterwards.  It whitens ok.  Price is way too high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this toothpaste. Your teeth will be to. It brightens teeth and gives you a nice clean feeling.</li>
            <li> notice a difference right away.....soon as you use it actually.  good product and will buy again for sure!  love it</li>
            <li> I use this toothpaste along with a whitening pre-wash AND Arm and Hammer whitening booster.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a change of color (whiter), though since I&#x27;ve used this toothpaste along with other products I can&#x27;t really tell which of these did the job (i think all 3 of them combined).&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste alone: I love the clean feeling afterwards, the flavor is minty but not too much.  My sister and her family uses this toothpaste alone and they love it.  Really helps improve the look of your teeth...now, you won&#x27;t see results until a few weeks of using the product, so be patient.</li>
            <li> Its a little hard to judge their &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; claims but I tend to judge any of those claims with a grain of salt. Its toothpaste, it tastes ok, it cleans teeth, and it might help whitening.  The main reason I purchases was because I also bought whitestrips and just wanted to try everything they had.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  It tastes great and leaves my teeth feeling very smooth, clean and white.  It contains xylitol, which my dentist says is very good for the gums, too!!  Use it along with the glamorous white mouth rinse and it is the perfect combination for clean and healthy teeth!</li>
            <li> I purchase a lot of things on line, and when getting whitening strips saw this and just got it.  I love Crest products and this is another on my list.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste contains SUCRALOSE in it. Sucralose &#x3D; Fake Sugar (Splenda). WHYYYY in the world would toothpaste need Sucralose in it?! This and the Colgate Optic White have Sucralose and I do not understand why.</li>
            <li> I have braces so it is hard to keep my teeth white without able to use whitening strips. I use this tooth paste every time I finish eating. And it has been keeping my teeth from getting food stains. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> My teeth are way too sensitive for the crest white strips so I was looking for an alternative way to whiten my teeth. This toothpaste worked really well! I definitely have whiter teeth now and no pain from sensitivity!</li>
            <li> Excellent product&lt;br /&gt;My friends like it&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for my friends and family&lt;br /&gt;It reach in time&lt;br /&gt;Will I will order again</li>
            <li> This tooth paste gets your teeth white and tastes great.  The only drawback is the sensitivity that always follows whitening.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  I purchased it after reading the Amazon reviews.  It works great and I have already purchased this a second time.  I highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I do like this toothpaste but I have a very sensitive mouth and I think the toothpaste ended up being too strong for my mouth.  I began getting raw places inside my mouth.  When I stopped using the toothpaste, the raw places healed.  If you don&#x27;t have a sensitive mouth, though, I think it&#x27;s a great toothpaste.</li>
            <li> A week ago I noticed my teeth had an extreme amount of plaque and discoloration. It was really annoying, because I take really good care of my teeth (brush/floss regularly), and to have brownish choppers was bothersome to me. I saw this at a drug store &amp; figured I&#x27;d give it a try. My teeth feel really good, they&#x27;re glassy smooth and my teeth aren&#x27;t tan anymore -they noticeably whitened up after 3 days&#x27; worth of use, 2x&#x27;s a day, no joke. They&#x27;re not \\&quot;appliance white\\&quot;, but a natural white that I like. I&#x27;d say it took the brown and yellow away right away and lightened the stains about 2 shades. I have a cap on my front tooth that&#x27;s fairly white and it stood out -now it matches my other teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont miss the tooth-buzzing sensitivity of other whiteners at all, as this toothpaste causes no pain or discomfort. What a great product, and relatively inexpensive, too! And what a relief not to have to use white strips!!!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is absolutely fantastic!  I could see a difference after just two uses.  Now that I have been using it twice a day for almost a week, there is definitely noticeable whitening.  I also am using the rinse as well.  I highly recommend this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Tried it out for a week. The taste isn&#x27;t great-- a more chemical note than most toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried, but that&#x27;s understandable. After first use, I felt a mild soreness in my gums and tongue, but those went away. After about the seventh use, my teeth were strangely sensitive for 12 hours, as if I was biting into something cold even when I wasn&#x27;t eating or chewing on anything. I discontinued use for 2 days, then tried it again and the same ache returned. I saw no results on the whitening front, so it&#x27;s in no way worth it for me. Can&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> Used it 2 or 3 times a day... results in 2 weeks. Cheap and quick results without expensive whitening treatments. Its also a continued course so will always keep your teeth whiter.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This does work.  I noticed a difference in only a couple of days.  Down side is I have allergies and I believe one or more ingredient caused a problem so I was pretty ill with breathing issues for a few days.  Ok now that I quit use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smoke or drink soft drinks. I thought I would see whiter teeth but I don&#x27;t see a difference. After a few weeks, this product did nothing for me. You will have fresh breath, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I was dubious as to whether this toothpaste would do what it says it will do. Not that I don&#x27;t trust Procter &amp; Gamble--they have great products--but because come on, it&#x27;s a toothpaste! I was wrong...it actually does take a lot of surface stains off and brighten your choppers. I don&#x27;t know why or how, nor do I care. It works and I don&#x27;t have to sit with those ghastly strips on my teeth or a tray of goo...good price on Amazon, too!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of whitening toothpastes and none have given me instant results as this one. I have been using it for two weeks now and my teeth are a shade whiter. I love it! I like how my teeth and mouth feels after I brush my teet and the feeling lasts for a very long time. It doesn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive and it cleans my teeth and mouth very well. I highly recomend this toothpaste. I will definitely be repurhcasing this again. Brush twice a day and floss, that&#x27;ll have you on the right path to a healthier mouth!</li>
            <li> Okay, so there&#x27;s no Helen Keller in this toothpaste (bad joke, I know) but I do think it helps, I&#x27;m not saying my teeth are bright white (heck no, ;-( I smoke on and off and I drink coffee) but I AM saying I notice a brighter smile and it tastes great.  Honestly? I&#x27;ve had yellowish teeth and nails since I was a teenager so maybe it&#x27;s just heredity.  And....I know I need to change my diet - THAT would probably help the most ;-)</li>
            <li> This product works fine, but favorite still is still the [[ASIN:B004VGSVHS Crest 3D White Vivid Fluoride Anticavity Radiant Mint Toothpaste Twin Pack, 11.6-Ounce]]. It just gives teeth that extra oomph in the whitening department.</li>
            <li> I got this after reading the wonderful reviews. Normally I would just bleach my teeth but I&#x27;m currently pregnant and so bleach is out. My teeth were starting to look a little dinghy and it was bugging me so after reading up I found that whitening toothpastes were safe. I had used several others in the past with little to no results so I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot. I already have a pretty good sonic toothbrush and not a lot of staining so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. At first I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference but after about two weeks or so my teeth were definitely brighter. It wasn&#x27;t a huge change and definitely not on par with bleaching them however they were quite a bit brighter. For a whitening toothpaste I was pretty impressed and would say this one was the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is exactly what I was looking for! My teeth appear whiter and it is so incredibly minty. I love it!</li>
            <li> I will always and forever be devoted to Colgate when it comes to feeling clean and fresh after brushing. As far as whitening though, Crest does a better job. I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because it didn&#x27;t whiten to the level I was expecting, but I do see a difference.</li>
            <li> It actually works! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I can say that my teeth are noticeably whiter! Beyond happy and thrilled that I got to skip the whitening strips this time! My teeth weren&#x27;t terrible but they needed some whitening for sure!</li>
            <li> This definitely did whiten my teeth a little. Not a whole lot like the whitening strips, but I like using this product to keep my teeth white after I have used the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I noticed a difference after using it a short time.  I plan on trying their whitening strips next.</li>
            <li> This lives up to what it claims and that is just awesome in today&#x27;s over praised self promotion world we live in. My wife and I noticed the first morning how clean our mouths felt after a night of sleep. After two days i started noticed my surface stains to disappear. Also, I found myself brushing a lot longer using this product. Other toothpastes never motivate me to brush a long time. After going through the first toothpaste tube, I have no regrets. I ordered 6 and gave some to my parents and parents in law. Just keep in mind it removes surface stains, you won&#x27;t get super bright bright teeth, just a clean smile, which is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product one week. It&#x27;s amazing. My teeth are whiter already, and with no sensitivity!!!!! I will be telling everyone I know about it. And it is way cheaper the dentist fees!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste. Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Whiten using Crest Pro Stripes, and can use this product too keep them pearly white. Didn&#x27;t think there was a big difference in the 80%, and 90%, but there is.  Have used Crest Products since I was old enough to brush, encouraged by my parents. No cavities, all these years later. (mileage, rolled back by this writer). But, it&#x27;s been close to 40 years, and I&#x27;m told,\\&quot;I&#x27;ve got those toothpaste pretty whites.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Never thought I would take the time to write a review on toothpaste.  Its been a struggle to keep my teeth white as I\\&quot;m getting older and drink coffee daily.  I&#x27;ve tried white strips and various other products.  After a few days with this toothpaste my teeth are already whiter and feel much cleaner.  This is the best toothpaste ever.  No more wasting money on white strips.</li>
            <li> I purchased two tubes; one for me and one for my mother. We both agree that the flavor and texture is great and makes our teeth feel super clean and fresh. Our teeth weren&#x27;t very yellow to begin with, but it has whitened our teeth. Great product!</li>
            <li> I went to my dentist to inquire about a tooth whitening treatment.(60th birthday gift to myself). Not only was he charging $500 but the worst part? NO COFFEE for 3 weeks! UGH, NO! He suggested I could drink coffee through a straw, but apparently he never noticed that straw drinking encourages (NO, CAUSES) those little vertical lines on your top lip! Look in the mirror and sip through a straw, you&#x27;ll see. No thanks. So, I really don&#x27;t need to be more glamorous than I already am, but I tried this toothpaste. Yes, it works. You can&#x27;t use it once and expect 3D results. Use it every day, twice a day if you can. You&#x27;ll see a noticable difference in a few days. Keep using it and keep drinking coffee! and don&#x27;t forget the Torani syrups, sugar free, of course. [[ASIN:B001E5E2RC Torani Sugar-Free Syrup, Vanilla, 25.4-Ounce PET Bottles (Pack of 3)]].</li>
            <li> Good product. A really effective stain remover (I am a daily coffee drinker) and it left a pleasant, tingly mint feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothpast make my mouth fee unbelievably clean and fresh!  Love it!  Just started using it, so I havent really noticed the whitening, but love the clean feel!</li>
            <li> This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used, for whitening and for just cleaning. It leaves your mouth feeling very clean and it doesn&#x27;t burn. I&#x27;m OCD about brushing my teeth and usually brush them for 2 and a half minutes, and so far this is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve used. I used to use the Crest Vivid 3D White, but once I tried this I never looked back. The Vivid burns your mouth and this doesn&#x27;t at all. The Vivid whitens pretty well, but this is even better. You will definitely notice the difference within days. Nothing bad about this toothpaste at all, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to expect when buying this, but figured it was worth a shot. This tooth paste works great, and makes my mouth feel super clean after every wash. Taste is decent too, doesnt gag me at all. Something i find with alot of other tooth pastes. overall great product.</li>
            <li> Why not have whiter teeth!  I&#x27;m not sure about the word glamorous to describe the product the ad uses.  Unless you have perfect teeth, I personally think glamorous costs more than a tube of tooth paste.  It does help, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Finally I can smile without feeling self conscious about my teeth!.  The results were amazing...the first time I brushed!  Oh baby, where have you been hiding all my life!  This has to be the most incredible product of the last decade at least!</li>
            <li> The ad might be overact, but it still works. I recommend it, though it is a little bit expensive than other.</li>
