            <li>However, all together it is a very good product.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t quite give the best results we&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>It is great</li>

            <li>Amazing lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m, so far, very happy about it.</li>
            <li>Must have and worth the price as it makes her happy.</li>
            <li>So far this is the best line I have found to help treat my daughter&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>All was good and acceptable the cream is excellent for what I need because mi daughter have a little irritation</li>
            <li>Dr. Recomended an works great ,very high quality.</li>
            <li>Note that even with these creams, we still have to turn to steroids to control more severe flare-ups, maybe once</li>
            <li>product is better than many we have used, and if it were recommended for more than one use per day, maybe our results would have been better.</li>
            <li>I called the company and found out they were not making it any more</li>
            <li>The love the way Lipkar Baume makes my skin feel...soft and supple.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have cracked skin any more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>so glad I did for after just one week of using this product</li>
            <li>Thank you so much to the manufacturers for this great product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lipikar Baume has 4 times as much Shea Butter (20%) compared to Toleraine Riche (5%) but costs about a quarter, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>We were finally recommended this one and it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li>My thinking is that this is by design, and is intended to form a protective barrier so skin can better heal.    </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This la Roche-Posay Lipikar is magic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Good to use in hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is the best I&#x27;ve found for dry skin and itching.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever found to help my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Lipikar Baume AP is chock full of Shea Butter (20%!)</li>
            <li>All my life I have tried so many moisturizers and creams even those special ones made specifically for eczema even getting special vegan lotions at farmers markets.</li>
            <li>Used it post-op, fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li>My baby skinn gets so smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>Keep your skin and your childrens&#x27; skin free from dryness.</li>
            <li>Plus, it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>and Glycerin (the second and third ingredients listed on the tube), both of which are excellent moisturizers and are kind to skin.    </li>
            <li>This lotion leaves your skin silky smooth and can be used on both children and adults.  </li>
            <li>I was told this is a great lotion for dry skin by my plastic surgeon.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good thing because it means the tube will last</li>
            <li>This sweet lotion is the answer.  </li>
            <li>This balm is the most effective at relieving the itch and protecting the dry skin areas.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing absorption and sense of moisture even on the most dry and scaly patches of skin.</li>
            <li>I mean nothing works as good as this!!!</li>
            <li>It has no scent and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t one of those I&#x27;m pregnant</li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema, mild one.</li>
            <li>On freshly showered, towel dried skin, the Lipikar Baume AP spreads smoothly and covers evenly, with a pleasant texture that is rich and unctuous.</li>
            <li>THE GOOD STUFF FOR DRY TROUBLED/REACTIVE SKIN  </li>
            <li>The thing is I only use it twice a day morning and night and the smallest amount is all you need, I use it all over my face and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until now -- apart from class 4 prescription topical steroids, which we really want to minimize the use of on our baby -- we have achieved the best results with a combination of [[ASIN:B0067JF8CI Neosporin Eczema Essentials Daily Moisturizing Cream]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have something for her face since we can&#x27;t use her Rx lotions above her neck.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for dry skin highly recomeded</li>
            <li>I put it on right after the shower</li>
            <li>After trying it, I&#x27;m happy to say it works as well, if not better than the Vichy.</li>
            <li>As my skin became drier and more sensitive over those years, I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers -- from Vanicream, Aveeno, Neutrogenia, CeraVe, and Keys Care.  </li>
            <li>I would describe it best as a &#x27;power moisturizer&#x27; perfect for rescuing extremely dry, troubled skin, or for maintaining suppleness and preventing dryness in dry-to-slightly dry skin.</li>
            <li>hello thank you very much get everything right</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECCOMMEND!!</li>
            <li>After using this it seemed to have cleared up pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is more akin to a creamy ointment than a traditional lotion.</li>
            <li>and I apply some on my first opportunity.</li>
            <li>Never failed me!&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used and keeps the skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>First day, no problem.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this is by far my favorite product.</li>
            <li>I feel as though I have new skin!!</li>
            <li>The price is very high though, for someone of my income.</li>
            <li>so he doesn&#x27;t prefer using this lotion much :</li>
            <li>I tried a whole list of stuff to stop the shooting pain but nothing seemed to worked.  </li>
            <li>My wife is allergic to a LOT of things and can&#x27;t really use lotions/creams.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my ultra-dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To my surprise, after several days of using the Medline Remedy Skin Repair Cream, the redness and irritation were significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>No difference from when I use a regular cheap lotion, did nothing new for me..</li>
            <li>With this excellent product, which I use daily, no more rough spots.</li>
            <li>So we came in with high hopes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>cream for older skin and sensitive babys skin</li>
            <li>I look like I have 20 year old skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately I found that La Roche-Posay Toleraine worked the best (especially the thicker Toleraine Riche version), yet it is only sold in a 1.35oz tube and is expensive.  </li>
            <li>Neem oil also contains natural steroids, which also freaked us out a bit.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried several lotions for eczema and super dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel silky and smooth, eliminating any dry or rough patches, without making it feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Second day, right after I applied this, the red areas stung and got really red again.</li>
            <li>We heard about this product from friends who said that this cream, combined with a topical steroid, helped their baby&#x27;s eczema -- so much, in fact, that the eczema didn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>received the other cream first, [</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey but  worth every penny.</li>
            <li>boy started showing signs of moderate to severe eczema at about 7 months, and is now one year old.</li>
            <li>I do have to be careful how much I apply because it is thicker than Toleraine (which has a lot of water that evaporates)</li>
            <li>bought this especially for a 2 year old with skin irritation problems.</li>
            <li>I had some really red areas from over-exuberant deep-tissue massages that then developed into a continual irritated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Lipikar line has always soothed and moisturized my angry skin and never triggered any reactions of it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>The product contains neem oil, which we later learned is mildly toxic and which some say is not appropriate for pediatric use.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old son has really dry itchy skin and this has been the only lotion that has worked for him!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Dr. Recomended an works great ,very high quality.</li>
            <li> Lipikar works wonders with dry, itchy skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for close to 2 years now and plan to continue!</li>
            <li> Used it post-op, fabulous stuff. For anyone .</li>
            <li> one of the best moisturizers for atopic skins in the market</li>
            <li> We heard about this product from friends who said that this cream, combined with a topical steroid, helped their baby&#x27;s eczema -- so much, in fact, that the eczema didn&#x27;t come back. So we came in with high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our boy started showing signs of moderate to severe eczema at about 7 months, and is now one year old. We have tried just about everything, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seemed to help a bit, but it did not eliminate itching as our boy kept scratching constantly. It moisturizes the skin when applied immediately after a lukewarm bath, but only for a short time. The use of the product is recommended only once a day, which it looks like is not enough for our son. We had to use other products to keep his skin from drying out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now -- apart from class 4 prescription topical steroids, which we really want to minimize the use of on our baby -- we have achieved the best results with a combination of [[ASIN:B0067JF8CI Neosporin Eczema Essentials Daily Moisturizing Cream]], [[ASIN:B004YBWX4C CJ&#x27;s BUTTer Plus]] and [[ASIN:B000GZNGPK California Baby calming cream]]. Unfortunately we had to stop using CJ&#x27;s BUTTer Plus. The product contains neem oil, which we later learned is mildly toxic and which some say is not appropriate for pediatric use. Neem oil also contains natural steroids, which also freaked us out a bit. So we switched to [[ASIN:B005NB3K2G CJ&#x27;s BUTTer]] (without the \\&quot;Plus\\&quot;), but it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well. Note that even with these creams, we still have to turn to steroids to control more severe flare-ups, maybe once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is better than many we have used, and if it were recommended for more than one use per day, maybe our results would have been better. We have heard from people we know and trust that it worked for them. It just doesn&#x27;t quite give the best results we&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> I have very dry flaky skin. I used their Vichy product for years which worked wonders. The last time I tried to find it I couldn&#x27;t. I called the company and found out they were not making it any more so they recommended Lipikar as a replacement. After trying it, I&#x27;m happy to say it works as well, if not better than the Vichy. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and highly recommend it!!! I shopped it and found the best price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The love the way Lipkar Baume makes my skin feel...soft and supple. I put it on right after the shower and it&#x27;s moisturizing effect lasts all day long. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried several lotions for eczema and super dry skin.  This balm is the most effective at relieving the itch and protecting the dry skin areas.  It is a bit expensive, but its worth the relief it brings.  It has no scent and absorbs quickly.  No greasy after feeling. I&#x27;ll be buying this again, especially for the upcoming winter.</li>
            <li> I was told this is a great lotion for dry skin by my plastic surgeon.  That was back in September of 2010 and I have been using it every day ever since.  It makes my skin soft and supple.  I also use it on my feet and I don&#x27;t have cracked skin any more.  It doesn&#x27;t contain parabin which is a plus for me too.</li>
            <li> In the past I had rough dry skin especilly around my elbows and feet. With this excellent product, which I use daily, no more rough spots. Thanx La Roche-Posay.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin highly recomeded</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever found to help my very dry skin.  That&#x27;s due to plenty of shea butter, plus that &#x27;je ne sais quoi&#x27; the French add to their beauty products.</li>
            <li> I had a baby and had stretch marks.. Gained 70+ lbs!! It wasn&#x27;t one of those I&#x27;m pregnant so I can eat whatever I want kinda deals either. It just happened. After I had him my skin was so dry and stretch marks all over! This lotion has repaired my skin! I look like I have 20 year old skin! LOVE IT! HIGHLY RECCOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> My son has pretty bad eczema. After using this it seemed to have cleared up pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it seems to be stinging my son a lot so he doesn&#x27;t prefer using this lotion much :/&lt;br /&gt;So we try to alternate between horse oil (baayu) and this.</li>
            <li> I am a 67 year old lady (soon to be 68) have had trouble for over 15 years with the T section of my face and forehead, dry red itchy flaky skin, nothing would make it go, tried everything  steroid creams from the doctor so had given up then found this product and thought I have nothing to lose so glad I did for after just one week of using this product the difference is amazing. The thing is I only use it twice a day morning and night and the smallest amount is all you need, I use it all over my face and the results are amazing. Thank you so much to the manufacturers for this great product</li>
            <li> We used it on our baby girl because of some rashes due to the poor quality of the water. And it works perfectly. Hypoallergenic, so no need to worry about anything.</li>
            <li> The skin on my cheeks has been very dry every since I took Accutane as a teenager 15 years ago.  As my skin became drier and more sensitive over those years, I&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers -- from Vanicream, Aveeno, Neutrogenia, CeraVe, and Keys Care.  Three years ago I started having Rosacea-related redness and breakouts on my cheek.  Some of the moisturizers I tried seemed to make my rosacea worse, and that&#x27;s partly how I discovered La Roche-Posay products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I found that La Roche-Posay Toleraine worked the best (especially the thicker Toleraine Riche version), yet it is only sold in a 1.35oz tube and is expensive.  I was almost resigned to going through two $25 tubes of Toleraine per month when I discovered this cream at a drugstore in Whistler, Canada.  My cheeks and nose were irritated from the wind and cold and this cream instantly calmed the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipikar Baume has 4 times as much Shea Butter (20%) compared to Toleraine Riche (5%) but costs about a quarter, so it&#x27;s a great value. I do have to be careful how much I apply because it is thicker than Toleraine (which has a lot of water that evaporates) so I need to use less than I did with Toleraine.  That&#x27;s a good thing because it means the tube will last even longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the Lipikar Lait, and while I like the lighter version and the pump bottle, the fragrance in the Lait version is something I&#x27;d rather avoid applying around my nose where I&#x27;ll smell it for hours.  So I&#x27;ll probably use the Lait version as a body moisturizer and use the Lipikar Baume for my cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my extremely dry skin.  The lotion is very rich and feels great on my skin.  The price is very high though, for someone of my income.</li>
            <li> bought this especially for a 2 year old with skin irritation problems. It is great&lt;br /&gt;great cream for older skin and sensitive babys skin</li>
            <li> Excellent product for dry and sensitive skin. This is my second bottle. Though it is pricy, I may continue using it.</li>
            <li> baby has eczema, but this is the superest lotion to destroy the eczema.  I believe its greenvilles water, but no matter!!! This sweet lotion is the answer.  BAM, eczema gone.</li>
            <li> I SAW NO IMPROVEMENT IN MY GRANDDAUGHTER&#x27;S SKIN.</li>
            <li> Great body lotion.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else but this lotion. My skin feels like a babies butt. It&#x27;s a little pricey but  worth every penny.</li>
            <li> All was good and acceptable the cream is excellent for what I need because mi daughter have a little irritation</li>
            <li> Excellent!!!  My baby skinn gets so smooth after using it. If you have abbany with ezcema you got try this one.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema, mild one. Good thing for her we have this.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad we can&#x27;t get it directly in Indonesia</li>
            <li> This is a must during the hard winter months! Keep your skin and your childrens&#x27; skin free from dryness. Moisturizes, non-greasy and awesome!</li>
            <li> Our son has had eczema for 2 years, we&#x27;ve tried every possible cream in vain. We were finally recommended this one and it&#x27;s GREAT! Plus, it is paraben free. My son&#x27;s skin has improved a LOT since using it. I&#x27;m, so far, very happy about it.</li>
            <li> No difference from when I use a regular cheap lotion, did nothing new for me..Not worth the money for me, bec it did not provide extra moisturizing or softening of my skin. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> PACKAGING  The bottle and lid are standard fare for squeeze-bottle lotions. It can stand upright on it&#x27;s cap, which is helpful in crowded medicine chests.    MOISTURIZATION &amp; TEXTURE  For those unfamiliar with the La Roche-Posay Lipikar line, the Baume AP is the heavy-duty moisturizer of the bunch. I would describe it best as a &#x27;power moisturizer&#x27; perfect for rescuing extremely dry, troubled skin, or for maintaining suppleness and preventing dryness in dry-to-slightly dry skin. On freshly showered, towel dried skin, the Lipikar Baume AP spreads smoothly and covers evenly, with a pleasant texture that is rich and unctuous. This is more akin to a creamy ointment than a traditional lotion. Given its richness and concentration, absorption can take a while, and it can leave a bit of a surface layer of product on the skin. My thinking is that this is by design, and is intended to form a protective barrier so skin can better heal.    THE GOOD STUFF FOR DRY TROUBLED/REACTIVE SKIN  The Lipikar line is targeted for folks with dry, troubled or reactive skin. I don&#x27;t personally have a skin condition such as psoriasis or eczema, but I do have pretty bad skin allergies, and frequently suffer from contact dermatitis and hives. The Lipikar line has always soothed and moisturized my angry skin and never triggered any reactions of it&#x27;s own. Lipikar Baume AP is chock full of Shea Butter (20%!) and Glycerin (the second and third ingredients listed on the tube), both of which are excellent moisturizers and are kind to skin.    RECOMMENDATION  Recommended for purchase: Yes</li>
            <li> My wife uses this all the time. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Bought 3, they were sent and sold new as promised, and as I have received in the past from local spa</li>
            <li> Several years ago I had a breast reduction.  A year later I was diagnosed with breast cancer and went through chemo and radiation.  Once the radiation treatments were done, I started getting shooting pains in my breast.  I tried a whole list of stuff to stop the shooting pain but nothing seemed to worked.  My plastic surgeon recommended this product, stating the pain was caused from a lack of moisture to the radiated area.  Other creams just did not soak deep enough into the skin to relieve the pain...but this product did!!!  I&#x27;ve used it every day since, after my morning shower. If I miss a day, I can feel the shooting pain starting and I apply some on my first opportunity.</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  Makes my skin feel silky and smooth, eliminating any dry or rough patches, without making it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Awesome for after sun. Never failed me!&lt;br /&gt;Good for the body skin. Face care, I would pick a different one</li>
            <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve found for dry skin and itching. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> hello thank you very much get everything right</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it on my very dry feet, body and face. However, when I use it on my face, I encounter clogged pores which resulted in pimples. However, all together it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful hand and body cream. I&#x27;ve always used and keeps the skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old son has really dry itchy skin and this has been the only lotion that has worked for him!</li>
            <li> This la Roche-Posay Lipikar is magic.  As soon as my cousin used it, all the scratching was away.  Good to use in hot weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to all people who suffers from scratching, rash or other.</li>
            <li> Good product, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My wife is allergic to a LOT of things and can&#x27;t really use lotions/creams.  Her skin get dry and she SWEARS by this stuff.  It is, apparently, amazing.  I buy this online for her as treat whenever she runs out.  Must have and worth the price as it makes her happy.</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves your skin silky smooth and can be used on both children and adults.  This was recommended by my dermatologist for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps my ultra-dry skin!&lt;br /&gt;I order it regularly so i don&#x27;t run out - best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion. So far this is the best line I have found to help treat my daughter&#x27;s eczema. Within just a few sausage was almost completely clear. It&#x27;s nice to have something for her face since we can&#x27;t use her Rx lotions above her neck.</li>
            <li> Amazing absorption and sense of moisture even on the most dry and scaly patches of skin. I have sensitive skin and this is by far my favorite product.</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema. All my life I have tried so many moisturizers and creams even those special ones made specifically for eczema even getting special vegan lotions at farmers markets. Nothing and I mean nothing works as good as this!!! I feel as though I have new skin!! Absolutely amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Has helped relieve itching that nothing else did!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!!</li>
            <li> After dealing with a breakout of eczema or something similar on one side of my neck, and being unable to get in to see the dermatologist, I bought this balm and another cream from Amazon to try to get the itchiness, dry skin and redness to go away. I had some really red areas from over-exuberant deep-tissue massages that then developed into a continual irritated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the other cream first, [[ASIN:B001D0NAZ8 Remedy Skin Repair Cream 4 oz]], and used that on my itchy dry skin and on the red areas. To my surprise, after several days of using the Medline Remedy Skin Repair Cream, the redness and irritation were significantly reduced. The itchiness and the scaly area became normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then received this La Roche-Posay Body Balm, and applied it to the same area. First day, no problem. Second day, right after I applied this, the red areas stung and got really red again. Now I feel like I&#x27;m at square one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this balm that is so irritating, but needless to say, I&#x27;m switching to the Medline Remedy Skin Repair Cream and discontinuing using this balm. I&#x27;m disappointed because I was hoping this would work well and not irritate, based on all the glowing reviews. But at least I found another thing that seems to work...</li>
            <li> Good moisturing hand cream.</li>
