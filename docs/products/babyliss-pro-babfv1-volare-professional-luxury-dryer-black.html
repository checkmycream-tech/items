            <li>I liked the look.</li>
            <li>I used my sister&#x27;s dryer like this and immediately went home and purchased my own.  </li>
            <li>My clients are more appreciative of their amazing blowouts that have them in and out with silky voluminous hair rather than in my chair all day just blowdrying.</li>
            <li>and I love, love it!  </li>
            <li>Well,  I ran across the powerful Volare with its great reviews.</li>
            <li>It is, by far, the best hair instrument I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This is, by far, THE BEST HAIR DRYER, I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>This is by far THE BEST hairdryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I have medium length very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used the turbo power dryers which are better than most, but this babyliss  Volare is by far the best for time conscious stylists who demand the best.  </li>
            <li>Have to work quickly, because this dryer gets with it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing product , I blow dry my hair and style it in 13 mins, it&#x27;s just perfect for my life style and met my satisfaction</li>
            <li>Love the &#x27;blast&#x27; button.  </li>
            <li>I am a stylist and many stylists I work with have this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about it is the length of the cord...</li>
            <li>the better</li>
            <li>but my chi rockect was much better.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Dries really fast and works great.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top quality dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I still love my BabyBlissPro.</li>
            <li>As a result, I straighten my hair much more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to get many years with this one purchase.</li>
            <li>However, I returned the dryer to Amazon and the second dryer was perfect.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I do still love Chi&#x27;s straightening irons though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Time will tell if this is better for my hair.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>My hair looks much better after using this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Plus it gave me much more volume too.  </li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I feel it seals in the cuticle better</li>
            <li>Best purchase ive made in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey but worth it!!  </li>
            <li>This is the best investment I have made in a LONG time!  </li>
            <li>it looked new and felt great.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to pay that much money when I loved the one I had.</li>
            <li>most importantly does not harm your hair as dry very quickly !!!!!!</li>
            <li>And i had a great hair day, soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>i went online right away and purchased my own.  </li>
            <li>Love it, and worth the money!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Mine is still going strong since July 2012.</li>
            <li>This is hands down, the greatest blowdryer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>We love itnits super strong everyone in the house</li>
            <li>Hair dryer is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>we&#x27;re all so used to heat styling, but it makes your hair look 20 times healthier and still drys really quickly!</li>
            <li>Nice, strong, very well packaged, warrenty for 4 years</li>
            <li>Very hot and can straighten the hair with perfection!</li>
            <li>I guess that depends on how important your hair is to you.</li>
            <li>This actually seemed to improve the condition of my hair and once used with a roll brush is seriously awesome for straight, smooth hair -</li>
            <li>so he said i can blow my hair myself for free and when i picked up his blow dryer</li>
            <li>Since I get my hair done free of charge, I didn&#x27;t have an issue with this request.  </li>
            <li>Right from the get go, my hair had a lot more volume</li>
            <li>Very worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful and I will continue to use it but probably won&#x27;t buy it online again.</li>
            <li>very powerful, lots of air, versatile settings.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful.</li>
            <li>Ever since I got the Babyliss Pro Volare Dryer, my hair takes TWENTY MINUTES, from start to finish, to dry straight and beautifully!  </li>
            <li>For me, I&#x27;m happy with it and as long as it lasts me another 10 years</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>This dryer is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>For the first time in fifteen years, I am able to wash my hair in the morning, before I leave for work.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny!beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>, it is well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I am a Professional Stylist and I need amazing appliances to go along with my amazing Aveda Products, for my Amazing long list of Clients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dries my hair quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to spend this much on a dryer then you should probably upgrade from the $2 shampoo :)</li>
            <li>I waited a year to buy this dryer because I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend this much.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy, comfortable, stylish, and</li>
            <li>It also has 6 settings, plus a button that super charges whatever setting you are using.</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>So I have a basic Revlon dryer that I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with.</li>
            <li>It got great reviews and it was small, light, and not too pricey.</li>
            <li>Though to be fair, I style my hair as I dry it.</li>
            <li>Love it so far!</li>
            <li>I was convinced that the cheap basic models were better than tourmaline, ionic, etc, etc, hyped models.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-it isn&#x27;t as powerful as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It has 3 heat settings, one of which is cool, then a medium heat and a hot heat.</li>
            <li>But are these improvements worth the $120 price difference?</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>did not give it 5 stars, because it is almost too powerful.</li>
            <li>This is totally worth the pricetag.  </li>
            <li>os fighting for it because we all have longhair and this machine is powerful.</li>
            <li>so its so worth the investment</li>
            <li>powerful, used it blow pine needles on my deck, blows dust bunnies in my computer away.</li>
            <li>I have to say though, if I had to replace it every 6 months, it would be worth it for me.  </li>
            <li>I love that the cord is long and pliable and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
            <li>I used it once and gave it away, its still 5 stars, but the power of it hurt my right ear which had been ruptured years ago.</li>
            <li>Nice long power cord.  </li>
            <li>30 years later I have found a product that makes it EASY!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t possibly say enough great things about my Babyliss.  </li>
            <li>There are several settings on this that makes it really great for different styling.  </li>
            <li>I know this is a high priced dryer, and I&#x27;ve read many reviews claiming that it&#x27;s powerful Ferrari motor cuts drying time in half, leaving your hair smoother, with more shine and volume.</li>
            <li>I love that the Volare dries it quickly, gives me added volume, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>If you have long hair or are using a diffuser, this will probably work great and dry your hair quickly</li>
            <li>I would have to bend way over to use them if the plug I was using wasn&#x27;t higher up (like by the bathroom sink).  </li>
            <li>first used a Babyliss when a bunch of us girls went out of town for the weekend.  </li>
            <li>the real question is, is this dryer worth the money?</li>
            <li>was so hot</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think it got as hot as I was used to, but then again, maybe that&#x27;s why my hair was fried.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Babyliss Pro and just used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>and I was just noticing that it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as it use to.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth, frizz-free and soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I like this blow dryer, however I did like my last dyer better</li>
            <li>It is really unlike me to indulge in a purchase like this, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this dryer was in my stylists salon.</li>
            <li>However, I love the power and different settings of this dryer.</li>
            <li>Cuts my drying time down  tremendously!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was the same model that she had, but this one seems to be pretty much the top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot leave it on its more powerful setting for too long or my hair becomes very tangled.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s super powerful and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>completely frizz free, also my hair is super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I now can spend more time on my cuts or conversing rather than those long gone days of blow drying.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on a dang hair dryer, but after my Chi one went out like 3 times I decided to get this one b/c</li>
            <li>Really moves air and dries hair fast!  </li>
            <li>My mom used it shortly after I got it &amp; loved it so much too, that I had to order a 2nd one for her!!  </li>
            <li>I have long straight healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have had to pick out large chunks of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and short, so I probably don&#x27;t need this much hair dryer; however, I&#x27;m in the process of letting my hair grow.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I dried my hair in this omg, so amazing, record time.</li>
            <li>You can totally tell the difference in the motor, the sound is much deeper.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think much of it until it started coming apart</li>
            <li>Also I have an absolute ton of hair</li>
            <li>The weight of the dryer hasn&#x27;t been that much of an issue either, so I am probably going to keep it.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had it for about a year, and I use it almost as much as she does.  </li>
            <li>but I really think they should have sent me another one.</li>
            <li>Wish I hadn&#x27;t paid so much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, I received this shipment before Amazon even notified me of the shipment.  </li>
            <li>So far, it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>We bought this product for our very picky sister-in-law.  </li>
            <li>There is an identical model now available in red (Model BABFRV1).</li>
            <li>It dries my hair incredibly fast and makes it straight without frizziness.  </li>
            <li>I would really like to rate it a 4.5.</li>
            <li>According to the product dimensions, the Volare was not only smaller but lighter than the Nano Titanium I now own.</li>
            <li>It also works GREAT Dry when my hair is a little greasy, or I have been around smokers.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful, with a fairly narrow stream of strong air without being abrasive.</li>
            <li>It works great, fast, even on my thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very high quality, doubt i&#x27;ll ever need a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had pretty short hair most of my life, so just about any hairdryer would get it dry.</li>
            <li>I knew it was time for a new one!</li>
            <li>My hair drying routine has been cut in half, maybe more.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has a lot of settings, more specifically that it does not get too hot to use on a pet or small child if need be.</li>
            <li>Also hair is left soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>As for the physical dryer it doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t get very hot for several minutes.</li>
            <li>but the high heat leaves it a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li>I also like my hair dryer to be warm, not hot, so it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and with the power this has, it definitely does.</li>
            <li>My ten year old supercenter dryer was significantly louder.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous when I purchased this, being it was a bit more than I am used to spending on a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>It had minimized blow drying, makes hair less frizzy and overall just love using it!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work normally.</li>
            <li>and I was also able to master using the round brush while drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I just make sure to brush my hair a few times during drying ...</li>
            <li>the pretty curls!)This dryer gets it dry, shiney, and straight in NO TIME!</li>
            <li>The only issue is the buttons are right under where you hold the dryer, so sometimes they get pushed by mistake.  </li>
            <li>As for shipping, packaging, etc, mine does appear to be brand new and included the two attachments (one 70mm for making waves and one 60mm for straightening).</li>
            <li>Had been looking for a new one, and decided to make the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, even though the box has absolutely NOTHING to do with the quality of the dryer, it definitely has a wow factor when you first open the box!  </li>
            <li>A few months ago while we were on vacation, my husband used it and he couldn&#x27;t say enough nice things about it.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how quickly it took me to dry my hair with this dryer vs any of the others.  </li>
            <li>im surprised it didnt catch fire!</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package, I could tell it was sleeker and smaller than the Nano</li>
            <li>naturally curly and frizzy - this thing does the trick!</li>
            <li>But WOW!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but it does do all of those things, and is the most powerful dryer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>The first one for me and the second to my mother.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap, but is seems well made, and performs as advertised, giving you salon results at home, in half the time.</li>
            <li>It dried very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is powerful but doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.  </li>
            <li>Only downfall about it is that it&#x27;s so powerful if your not careful it will tangle your hair</li>
            <li>Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a dryer.  </li>
            <li>After much Internet searching I decided on this one which I bought from Amazon last week.</li>
            <li>Use a brush with natural bristles.</li>
            <li>old one.  </li>
            <li>This is not a big problem for me, but the unit does not heat up as much when it is on a lower blower setting.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and have owned a lot of hair dryers in my day..........</li>
            <li>It has a turbo button for extra fast air.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>and this dryer has too much force, even on the low setting, to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit on the heavy side and also louder than my T3 Light.</li>
            <li>My stylist (a close friend of mine) was running behind one day, and asked if I minded drying my own hair while she put some color on another client.  </li>
            <li>Much better than some of the other more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>This dryer dries my hair in less than 10 minutes on low heat, so that I can still enjoy that soft shine without the frizz!  </li>
            <li>I think the hot setting is a little too much heat for my hair.</li>
            <li>As the other reviewers said, this dryer is powerful.</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer, it&#x27;s quiet and speeds up dryer to half the time!!</li>
            <li>I only use the high heat when my hair is still pretty wet.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to resorting to high heat to dry your hair, and your hair is normal in texture (i.e., some wave, not particularly dry or oily)</li>
            <li>It is extremely powerful and has cut my drying time in half</li>
            <li>the last thing you do, leave it in a microfiber towel or something similar until ready.</li>
            <li>It is quite powerful, and dries hair in about half of the time of her (our?)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Beyond satisfied to say the least!</li>
            <li>My only problem was that the first dryer I received had a European plug and could not be used in an American outlet without an adapter !</li>
            <li>Everything about it indicates there were no corners cut on the quality, the power cord is thick and long, the dryer is loud but not any more than the 1875 W consumer dryer that I had.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair, and I usually have to use the high heat setting in order to not have to stand there for nearly half an hour or more</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, a couple of months later my old dryer died.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely lighter than my old hair dryer, my arms don&#x27;t wear out like they did</li>
            <li>Oh, also, I am very slim (not a whole lot of muscles)</li>
            <li>Before this I had a newer high end drier but it took 45 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my hair dry so fast on low heat!  </li>
            <li>It normally would take me 30 mins to get my hair dry, then another 30 mins to use hair iron to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blow like a tornado, but dries my hair MUCH faster than any other dryer I have had.  </li>
            <li>I got tired of replacing my hair dryer every year or so and decided to invest in a more &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; (hopefully longer lasting) item.  </li>
            <li>The item which was sent was not a Volare and was a Portofino 6600 which is available on amazon and multiple other sites for less than this price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the dryer a few times but these are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s quiet for how powerful it is.</li>
            <li>Naturally since my hair is longer it takes longer to dry, but It turns out my hair is thicker than I thought too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut drying time in half and my hair is really benefitting.  </li>
            <li>I also have super thick hair</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a blow dryer that is tough, dry time faster than my CHI and that will hold up for many drys....</li>
            <li>That is not optimal for me, because it takes a little longer for me to paddle brush it straight.</li>

            <li> I liked the look.</li>
            <li> I used my sister&#x27;s dryer like this and immediately went home and purchased my own.  </li>
            <li> My clients are more appreciative of their amazing blowouts that have them in and out with silky voluminous hair rather than in my chair all day just blowdrying.</li>
            <li> and I love, love it!  </li>
            <li> Well,  I ran across the powerful Volare with its great reviews.</li>
            <li> It is, by far, the best hair instrument I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This is, by far, THE BEST HAIR DRYER, I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST hairdryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have medium length very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used the turbo power dryers which are better than most, but this babyliss  Volare is by far the best for time conscious stylists who demand the best.  </li>
            <li> Have to work quickly, because this dryer gets with it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing product , I blow dry my hair and style it in 13 mins, it&#x27;s just perfect for my life style and met my satisfaction</li>
            <li> Love the &#x27;blast&#x27; button.  </li>
            <li> I am a stylist and many stylists I work with have this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about it is the length of the cord...</li>
            <li> the better</li>
            <li> but my chi rockect was much better.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Dries really fast and works great.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top quality dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I still love my BabyBlissPro.</li>
            <li> As a result, I straighten my hair much more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to get many years with this one purchase.</li>
            <li> However, I returned the dryer to Amazon and the second dryer was perfect.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I do still love Chi&#x27;s straightening irons though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Time will tell if this is better for my hair.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> My hair looks much better after using this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Plus it gave me much more volume too.  </li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I feel it seals in the cuticle better</li>
            <li> Best purchase ive made in a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey but worth it!!  </li>
            <li> This is the best investment I have made in a LONG time!  </li>
            <li> it looked new and felt great.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to pay that much money when I loved the one I had.</li>
            <li> most importantly does not harm your hair as dry very quickly !!!!!!</li>
            <li> And i had a great hair day, soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> i went online right away and purchased my own.  </li>
            <li> Love it, and worth the money!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Mine is still going strong since July 2012.</li>
            <li> This is hands down, the greatest blowdryer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> We love itnits super strong everyone in the house</li>
            <li> Hair dryer is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;re all so used to heat styling, but it makes your hair look 20 times healthier and still drys really quickly!</li>
            <li> Nice, strong, very well packaged, warrenty for 4 years</li>
            <li> Very hot and can straighten the hair with perfection!</li>
            <li> I guess that depends on how important your hair is to you.</li>
            <li> This actually seemed to improve the condition of my hair and once used with a roll brush is seriously awesome for straight, smooth hair -</li>
            <li> so he said i can blow my hair myself for free and when i picked up his blow dryer</li>
            <li> Since I get my hair done free of charge, I didn&#x27;t have an issue with this request.  </li>
            <li> Right from the get go, my hair had a lot more volume</li>
            <li> Very worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful and I will continue to use it but probably won&#x27;t buy it online again.</li>
            <li> very powerful, lots of air, versatile settings.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful.</li>
            <li> Ever since I got the Babyliss Pro Volare Dryer, my hair takes TWENTY MINUTES, from start to finish, to dry straight and beautifully!  </li>
            <li> For me, I&#x27;m happy with it and as long as it lasts me another 10 years</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> This dryer is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> For the first time in fifteen years, I am able to wash my hair in the morning, before I leave for work.  </li>
            <li> worth every penny!beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> , it is well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am a Professional Stylist and I need amazing appliances to go along with my amazing Aveda Products, for my Amazing long list of Clients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dries my hair quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to spend this much on a dryer then you should probably upgrade from the $2 shampoo :)</li>
            <li> I waited a year to buy this dryer because I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend this much.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy, comfortable, stylish, and</li>
            <li> It also has 6 settings, plus a button that super charges whatever setting you are using.</li>
            <li> super</li>
            <li> So I have a basic Revlon dryer that I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with.</li>
            <li> It got great reviews and it was small, light, and not too pricey.</li>
            <li> Though to be fair, I style my hair as I dry it.</li>
            <li> Love it so far!</li>
            <li> I was convinced that the cheap basic models were better than tourmaline, ionic, etc, etc, hyped models.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-it isn&#x27;t as powerful as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It has 3 heat settings, one of which is cool, then a medium heat and a hot heat.</li>
            <li> But are these improvements worth the $120 price difference?</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> did not give it 5 stars, because it is almost too powerful.</li>
            <li> This is totally worth the pricetag.  </li>
            <li> os fighting for it because we all have longhair and this machine is powerful.</li>
            <li> so its so worth the investment</li>
            <li> powerful, used it blow pine needles on my deck, blows dust bunnies in my computer away.</li>
            <li> I have to say though, if I had to replace it every 6 months, it would be worth it for me.  </li>
            <li> I love that the cord is long and pliable and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily.</li>
            <li> I used it once and gave it away, its still 5 stars, but the power of it hurt my right ear which had been ruptured years ago.</li>
            <li> Nice long power cord.  </li>
            <li> 30 years later I have found a product that makes it EASY!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t possibly say enough great things about my Babyliss.  </li>
            <li> There are several settings on this that makes it really great for different styling.  </li>
            <li> I know this is a high priced dryer, and I&#x27;ve read many reviews claiming that it&#x27;s powerful Ferrari motor cuts drying time in half, leaving your hair smoother, with more shine and volume.</li>
            <li> I love that the Volare dries it quickly, gives me added volume, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair or are using a diffuser, this will probably work great and dry your hair quickly</li>
            <li> I would have to bend way over to use them if the plug I was using wasn&#x27;t higher up (like by the bathroom sink).  </li>
            <li> first used a Babyliss when a bunch of us girls went out of town for the weekend.  </li>
            <li> the real question is, is this dryer worth the money?</li>
            <li> was so hot</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think it got as hot as I was used to, but then again, maybe that&#x27;s why my hair was fried.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Babyliss Pro and just used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> and I was just noticing that it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as it use to.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth, frizz-free and soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I like this blow dryer, however I did like my last dyer better</li>
            <li> It is really unlike me to indulge in a purchase like this, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this dryer was in my stylists salon.</li>
            <li> However, I love the power and different settings of this dryer.</li>
            <li> Cuts my drying time down  tremendously!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was the same model that she had, but this one seems to be pretty much the top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot leave it on its more powerful setting for too long or my hair becomes very tangled.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s super powerful and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> completely frizz free, also my hair is super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I now can spend more time on my cuts or conversing rather than those long gone days of blow drying.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on a dang hair dryer, but after my Chi one went out like 3 times I decided to get this one b/c</li>
            <li> Really moves air and dries hair fast!  </li>
            <li> My mom used it shortly after I got it &amp; loved it so much too, that I had to order a 2nd one for her!!  </li>
            <li> I have long straight healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have had to pick out large chunks of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and short, so I probably don&#x27;t need this much hair dryer; however, I&#x27;m in the process of letting my hair grow.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I dried my hair in this omg, so amazing, record time.</li>
            <li> You can totally tell the difference in the motor, the sound is much deeper.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think much of it until it started coming apart</li>
            <li> Also I have an absolute ton of hair</li>
            <li> The weight of the dryer hasn&#x27;t been that much of an issue either, so I am probably going to keep it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had it for about a year, and I use it almost as much as she does.  </li>
            <li> but I really think they should have sent me another one.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t paid so much.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, I received this shipment before Amazon even notified me of the shipment.  </li>
            <li> So far, it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> We bought this product for our very picky sister-in-law.  </li>
            <li> There is an identical model now available in red (Model BABFRV1).</li>
            <li> It dries my hair incredibly fast and makes it straight without frizziness.  </li>
            <li> I would really like to rate it a 4.5.</li>
            <li> According to the product dimensions, the Volare was not only smaller but lighter than the Nano Titanium I now own.</li>
            <li> It also works GREAT Dry when my hair is a little greasy, or I have been around smokers.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful, with a fairly narrow stream of strong air without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> It works great, fast, even on my thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very high quality, doubt i&#x27;ll ever need a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had pretty short hair most of my life, so just about any hairdryer would get it dry.</li>
            <li> I knew it was time for a new one!</li>
            <li> My hair drying routine has been cut in half, maybe more.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has a lot of settings, more specifically that it does not get too hot to use on a pet or small child if need be.</li>
            <li> Also hair is left soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> As for the physical dryer it doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t get very hot for several minutes.</li>
            <li> but the high heat leaves it a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li> I also like my hair dryer to be warm, not hot, so it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and with the power this has, it definitely does.</li>
            <li> My ten year old supercenter dryer was significantly louder.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when I purchased this, being it was a bit more than I am used to spending on a hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> It had minimized blow drying, makes hair less frizzy and overall just love using it!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work normally.</li>
            <li> and I was also able to master using the round brush while drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I just make sure to brush my hair a few times during drying ...</li>
            <li> the pretty curls!)This dryer gets it dry, shiney, and straight in NO TIME!</li>
            <li> The only issue is the buttons are right under where you hold the dryer, so sometimes they get pushed by mistake.  </li>
            <li> As for shipping, packaging, etc, mine does appear to be brand new and included the two attachments (one 70mm for making waves and one 60mm for straightening).</li>
            <li> Had been looking for a new one, and decided to make the investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, even though the box has absolutely NOTHING to do with the quality of the dryer, it definitely has a wow factor when you first open the box!  </li>
            <li> A few months ago while we were on vacation, my husband used it and he couldn&#x27;t say enough nice things about it.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how quickly it took me to dry my hair with this dryer vs any of the others.  </li>
            <li> im surprised it didnt catch fire!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, I could tell it was sleeker and smaller than the Nano</li>
            <li> naturally curly and frizzy - this thing does the trick!</li>
            <li> But WOW!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but it does do all of those things, and is the most powerful dryer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> The first one for me and the second to my mother.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t cheap, but is seems well made, and performs as advertised, giving you salon results at home, in half the time.</li>
            <li> It dried very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is powerful but doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.  </li>
            <li> Only downfall about it is that it&#x27;s so powerful if your not careful it will tangle your hair</li>
            <li> Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a dryer.  </li>
            <li> After much Internet searching I decided on this one which I bought from Amazon last week.</li>
            <li> Use a brush with natural bristles.</li>
            <li> old one.  </li>
            <li> This is not a big problem for me, but the unit does not heat up as much when it is on a lower blower setting.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and have owned a lot of hair dryers in my day..........</li>
            <li> It has a turbo button for extra fast air.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> and this dryer has too much force, even on the low setting, to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit on the heavy side and also louder than my T3 Light.</li>
            <li> My stylist (a close friend of mine) was running behind one day, and asked if I minded drying my own hair while she put some color on another client.  </li>
            <li> Much better than some of the other more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> This dryer dries my hair in less than 10 minutes on low heat, so that I can still enjoy that soft shine without the frizz!  </li>
            <li> I think the hot setting is a little too much heat for my hair.</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers said, this dryer is powerful.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer, it&#x27;s quiet and speeds up dryer to half the time!!</li>
            <li> I only use the high heat when my hair is still pretty wet.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to resorting to high heat to dry your hair, and your hair is normal in texture (i.e., some wave, not particularly dry or oily)</li>
            <li> It is extremely powerful and has cut my drying time in half</li>
            <li> the last thing you do, leave it in a microfiber towel or something similar until ready.</li>
            <li> It is quite powerful, and dries hair in about half of the time of her (our?)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Beyond satisfied to say the least!</li>
            <li> My only problem was that the first dryer I received had a European plug and could not be used in an American outlet without an adapter !</li>
            <li> Everything about it indicates there were no corners cut on the quality, the power cord is thick and long, the dryer is loud but not any more than the 1875 W consumer dryer that I had.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, and I usually have to use the high heat setting in order to not have to stand there for nearly half an hour or more</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, a couple of months later my old dryer died.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely lighter than my old hair dryer, my arms don&#x27;t wear out like they did</li>
            <li> Oh, also, I am very slim (not a whole lot of muscles)</li>
            <li> Before this I had a newer high end drier but it took 45 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had my hair dry so fast on low heat!  </li>
            <li> It normally would take me 30 mins to get my hair dry, then another 30 mins to use hair iron to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blow like a tornado, but dries my hair MUCH faster than any other dryer I have had.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of replacing my hair dryer every year or so and decided to invest in a more &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; (hopefully longer lasting) item.  </li>
            <li> The item which was sent was not a Volare and was a Portofino 6600 which is available on amazon and multiple other sites for less than this price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the dryer a few times but these are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s quiet for how powerful it is.</li>
            <li> Naturally since my hair is longer it takes longer to dry, but It turns out my hair is thicker than I thought too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut drying time in half and my hair is really benefitting.  </li>
            <li> I also have super thick hair</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a blow dryer that is tough, dry time faster than my CHI and that will hold up for many drys....</li>
            <li> That is not optimal for me, because it takes a little longer for me to paddle brush it straight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as quickly as my T3 but isn&#x27;t far behind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the same supercenter blow dryer for the last ten years, but up until about 2 years ago I didn&#x27;t blow dry my hair daily.</li>
            <li> She really likes the results she gets from it and dries her hair quicker than the ordinary dryer you buy a your local stores.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy, but it dries your hair so fast, that you won&#x27;t have to hold it as long......</li>
            <li> I use aveda shampoo and conditioner and a flat iron from the salon</li>
            <li> I have thick but fine, slightly curly hair that usually looks like a broom when I blow dry it straight.  </li>
            <li> If I am going to pay this much for a hairdryer then it should at least be the one I actually selected.  </li>
            <li> slightly big and harder to hold sometimes if you werking on the back of your head.</li>
            <li> Though with my old dryer my hair would still be a little damp in some areas.</li>
            <li> But this dryer was clearly the missing piece.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wait as long as I did to buy this hair dryer!!!!1</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t holding long.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it takes me a long time to get it completely dry.</li>
            <li> There is a 4 Year Limited warranty from the manufacterer, and a long, 2.8 meter power cord with a built-in safety breaker.</li>
            <li> I just hope i can wait that long to get it!</li>
            <li> My last dryer was a Chi, but I opted not to purchase another Chi due to declining reviews.</li>
            <li> Not loud!</li>
            <li> But I must say that my hair has never been softer and healthier than after I dry my hair with the babyliss pro.</li>
            <li> but my hair still always seemed dry and frizzled.</li>
            <li> Used to take me close to an hour to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> not a chore to wash and dry my hair...</li>
            <li> I needed a blow dryer that would actually dry my hair instead of wasting my time</li>
            <li> With this dryer, my hair is dry in 15-20 minutes AND it is smoooooth, shiny, and manageable.  </li>
            <li> i blow dry my hair so mcuh</li>
            <li> getting my hair dry...</li>
            <li> I also still needed to blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and quite thick, and it drys so much faster with this than with other dryers.</li>
            <li> NOW i can dry my hair in about 15 mins and there is NO NEED FOR HAIR IRON!</li>
            <li> Hair drying time is definitely cut in half.  </li>
            <li> But I have short hair that I blow dry with a round brush</li>
            <li> The weight of a dryer is important to me because I sometimes have issues with my wrists and holding a heavy hairdryer can be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> I do it one section at a time with a big round brush.</li>
            <li> I only used it for a few minutes every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Only con is that its heavy,  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that takes a while to dry, especially when i straighten it.  </li>
            <li> The seller wouldn&#x27;t take it back since it was past the return window</li>
            <li> It seems weird at first bc</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife to replace her other Babyliss that I dropped on the tiles in the bathroom and broke.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I prefer this dryer over the T3 and others I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I hardly even have to flat iron after I dry my hair with this thing.</li>
            <li> My long, thick, wavy hair used to take an hour to blow dry and straighten (often times, also requiring the use of a straightening iron).  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair that takes a long time to dry, make this investment!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and naturally wavy hair ...</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and this blow dryer helps with shine and smoothing it out!</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waist and its highlighted.  </li>
            <li> This dryer has literally cut down my blow drying time in half.</li>
            <li> Blow dries in half the time, and results in less frizz.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s faster, lighter and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause the damage that my previous dryer did.</li>
            <li> The less you have to use the hair dryer</li>
            <li> It is smoother and slikier, less fly-aways.</li>
            <li> It has cut my during time in half.</li>
            <li> it cut my drying time in half.  </li>
            <li> You can expect to cut hair drying time in half.</li>
            <li> so I could try to find a dryer with less force.</li>
            <li> There is a difference in the way my hair feels after using this dryer vs other dryers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m down to 15 minutes!</li>
            <li> It dried my hair</li>
            <li> Had dryer sent next day air because my dryer broke.was sent a broken dryer that wouldnt turn on and started smoking.the dryer</li>
            <li> For $180 I expected at least a year.</li>
            <li> I  have wavy-frizzy hair and a round ceramic brush</li>
            <li> and I do not find it heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I choose five stars because it dried the hair quicker and the hair was silkier.  </li>
            <li> It is not a light hair dryer</li>
            <li> Cuts during time in half!</li>
            <li> Cut my drying/styling time and frustration in half!  </li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair (to my bum) and it usually takes me at least an hour; at the least.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is refurbished or what</li>
            <li> it blows serious air but one previous reviewer commented that they thought they could use it to blow leaves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> For the past 8 months I have been letting it grow</li>
            <li> I have hated drying my hair ever since I was old enough to do it myself.</li>
            <li> The last two dryers I had I hated because the cords were so short (one was retractable and one was not).  </li>
            <li> have med length, thick, kinky curly hair (not</li>
            <li> No more straightening iron required!</li>
            <li> I have very difficult thick, course, wavy hair that has always been a chore to dry and style.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s false advertising.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong buying this.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expensive and there are questions about the safety of the chemicals used.  </li>
            <li> Wow--I am skeptical, but who would believe a hairdryer could make a difference?!  </li>
            <li> There are six speed/temperature combinations and a cold shot button as well!</li>
            <li> i hate to write reviews, but this one i thought i should share.</li>

            <li> Not heavy, comfortable, stylish, and most importantly does not harm your hair as dry very quickly !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow, what a dryer.  I&#x27;ve used this only once, at someone else&#x27;s house. And thank goodness i did. Let me first say, I will pay up fora quality product, but I&#x27;ve never been impressed by a hair dryer. I was convinced that the cheap basic models were better than tourmaline, ionic, etc, etc, hyped models.  So I have a basic Revlon dryer that I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with. Until today. I used this and instantly knew I had to have it. It is powerful, with a fairly narrow stream of strong air without being abrasive. And i had a great hair day, soft and bouncy.  I also like my hair dryer to be warm, not hot, so it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and with the power this has, it definitely does. So, this is going on my xmas list.  I just hope i can wait that long to get it!</li>
            <li> I have very difficult thick, course, wavy hair that has always been a chore to dry and style. But I must say that my hair has never been softer and healthier than after I dry my hair with the babyliss pro. I use aveda shampoo and conditioner and a flat iron from the salon but my hair still always seemed dry and frizzled. But this dryer was clearly the missing piece. I hardly even have to flat iron after I dry my hair with this thing. It is extremely powerful and has cut my drying time in half and my hair feels awesome after. I recommend. Very worth the money.</li>
            <li> Blow dries in half the time, and results in less frizz.  Smooths.  Love the &#x27;blast&#x27; button.  Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer is light and easy to use.  The only issue is the buttons are right under where you hold the dryer, so sometimes they get pushed by mistake.  Hair drying time is definitely cut in half.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am a stylist and many stylists I work with have this blow dryer. Ive used one for months before I bought this one When I received the blow dryer it looked new and felt great. Then when I began using it the turbo button went in and out and wouldn&#x27;t work like the babyliss volares I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;m not sure if this is refurbished or what but it doesn&#x27;t work normally. It&#x27;s very powerful and I will continue to use it but probably won&#x27;t buy it online again.</li>
            <li> I used it once and gave it away, its still 5 stars, but the power of it hurt my right ear which had been ruptured years ago. The performance was great, but I just couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I got tired of replacing my hair dryer every year or so and decided to invest in a more &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; (hopefully longer lasting) item.  First of all, even though the box has absolutely NOTHING to do with the quality of the dryer, it definitely has a wow factor when you first open the box!  Right from the get go, my hair had a lot more volume and I was also able to master using the round brush while drying my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t blow like a tornado, but dries my hair MUCH faster than any other dryer I have had.  One of my favorite things about it is the length of the cord...you have plenty of it!  The last two dryers I had I hated because the cords were so short (one was retractable and one was not).  I would have to bend way over to use them if the plug I was using wasn&#x27;t higher up (like by the bathroom sink).  The last dryer I had wasn&#x27;t even retractable and the cord on it was also way too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used a Babyliss when a bunch of us girls went out of town for the weekend.  Instead of all of us bringing a hairdryer, one friend volunteered to bring hers.  It was a Babyliss and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference in it and the one I had at home!  I decided that when my blow dryer died, I was going to invest in this brand.  Lo and behold, a couple of months later my old dryer died.  I don&#x27;t know if this was the same model that she had, but this one seems to be pretty much the top of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...the take away from all of my rambling?  I love it!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer, it&#x27;s quiet and speeds up dryer to half the time!! It&#x27;s very high quality, doubt i&#x27;ll ever need a new one.</li>
            <li> This is hands down, the greatest blowdryer I have ever owned! Everything else just pales in comparison. Awesome, amazing, bazzing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the same supercenter blow dryer for the last ten years, but up until about 2 years ago I didn&#x27;t blow dry my hair daily. It dried my hair and I didn&#x27;t think much of it until it started coming apart, then when I had to wrap a hair tie around it to keep it together I knew it was time for a new one! I decided since I only buy a hair dryer once every 10 years I could splurge. Also I have an absolute ton of hair and I feel like it takes me a long time to get it completely dry. I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair is showing signs of damage from everything I put it through. I started asking every stylist I know about hair dryers and just about everyone recommended Babyliss. After much Internet searching I decided on this one which I bought from Amazon last week. As for shipping, packaging, etc, mine does appear to be brand new and included the two attachments (one 70mm for making waves and one 60mm for straightening). Also it came two days after I ordered (Isn&#x27;t Amazon Prime awesome?!).&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve only used the dryer a few times but these are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s quiet for how powerful it is. My ten year old supercenter dryer was significantly louder. However it is still a hair dryer, it&#x27;s not whisper quiet.&lt;br /&gt;-it isn&#x27;t as powerful as I was expecting. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it blows serious air but one previous reviewer commented that they thought they could use it to blow leaves, I disagree.&lt;br /&gt;-6 speed/heat settings. This is somewhat misleading. It has 3 heat settings, one of which is cool, then a medium heat and a hot heat. Then it has 2 fan settings. The last setting is a turbo button.&lt;br /&gt;-Weight. It is definitely lighter than my old hair dryer, my arms don&#x27;t wear out like they did before.&lt;br /&gt;-Heat. I&#x27;ve settled on what I call the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; heat setting. I think the hot setting is a little too much heat for my hair. As for the physical dryer it doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot when I&#x27;m blow drying my hair. Handy as I don&#x27;t have to wait to put it away.&lt;br /&gt;-Speed. I can&#x27;t say that I dried my hair in this omg, so amazing, record time. Was it faster than before? Yes. But earth shattering faster? Not really. Though to be fair, I style my hair as I dry it. I do it one section at a time with a big round brush. It takes me about 15 minutes to do this. Though with my old dryer my hair would still be a little damp in some areas. In the 15 minutes with this dryer my hair is fully dried.&lt;br /&gt;-Frizz, or lack of. I am impressed how this dryer leaves my hair completely frizz free, also my hair is super soft and shiny. It looks very healthy. You could say that it looks like I left the salon in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;So the real question is, is this dryer worth the money? I&#x27;m sorry but I can&#x27;t give you a 100% answer. Yes, it&#x27;s faster, lighter and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause the damage that my previous dryer did. But are these improvements worth the $120 price difference? I&#x27;m not sure. I guess that depends on how important your hair is to you. For me, I&#x27;m happy with it and as long as it lasts me another 10 years then it was a perfect purchase.&lt;br /&gt;And just some tips: make blow drying your hair the last thing you do, leave it in a microfiber towel or something similar until ready. The less you have to use the hair dryer the better it is for your hair. Also try to use the lower heat setting. Use a brush with natural bristles. And use good products to start with! If you&#x27;re going to spend this much on a dryer then you should probably upgrade from the $2 shampoo :)</li>
            <li> Had dryer sent next day air because my dryer broke.was sent a broken dryer that wouldnt turn on and started smoking.the dryer was so hot im surprised it didnt catch fire!</li>
            <li> I am a Professional Stylist and I need amazing appliances to go along with my amazing Aveda Products, for my Amazing long list of Clients. This dryer has literally cut down my blow drying time in half. My clients are more appreciative of their amazing blowouts that have them in and out with silky voluminous hair rather than in my chair all day just blowdrying. I now can spend more time on my cuts or conversing rather than those long gone days of blow drying. The price was unbeatable. Everyone at the Salon has this dryer, and has paid literally double what came out of my pocket. I&#x27;m Beyond satisfied to say the least! Great Power! Appreciative and Thankful!</li>
            <li> Nice, strong, very well packaged, warrenty for 4 years but my chi rockect was much better. I think it is the distribution of heat.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  Excellent buy.  Much better than some of the other more expensive brands.  Dries really fast and works great.</li>
            <li> The item which was sent was not a Volare and was a Portofino 6600 which is available on amazon and multiple other sites for less than this price.  This folks was a bait and switch!  If I am going to pay this much for a hairdryer then it should at least be the one I actually selected.  This was listed as from Northeast beauty on my invoice.</li>
            <li> very powerful, lots of air, versatile settings. Great hair dryer</li>
            <li> Last year I bought the Babyliss Pro 2000 Watt Nano Titanium dryer. It got great reviews and it was small, light, and not too pricey. I loved it. A few months ago while we were on vacation, my husband used it and he couldn&#x27;t say enough nice things about it. I decided to give it to him and buy me another one like it. Well,  I ran across the powerful Volare with its great reviews. I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to pay that much money when I loved the one I had. The weight of a dryer is important to me because I sometimes have issues with my wrists and holding a heavy hairdryer can be uncomfortable. According to the product dimensions, the Volare was not only smaller but lighter than the Nano Titanium I now own. I decided to buy it. When I first opened the package, I could tell it was sleeker and smaller than the Nano. I liked the look. When I lifted it out, I could tell immediately that it was heavier than the one I already had. I decided to give it a try anyway. As the other reviewers said, this dryer is powerful. My hair is fine and short, so I probably don&#x27;t need this much hair dryer; however, I&#x27;m in the process of letting my hair grow. The weight of the dryer hasn&#x27;t been that much of an issue either, so I am probably going to keep it. I gave it a 4 because of the weight and price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product dimensions: Volare ( 3 x 8.2 x 8.5 ) this was smaller than the Nano Titanium ( 9.2 x 3 x 10 )  WEIGHT: Volare ( it says 1 pounds but it is heavier than )  Nano Titanium (1.8 pounds )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve had pretty short hair most of my life, so just about any hairdryer would get it dry. For the past 8 months I have been letting it grow and now I have a different perspective on hairdryers. Naturally since my hair is longer it takes longer to dry, but It turns out my hair is thicker than I thought too. I love that the Volare dries it quickly, gives me added volume, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I love that the cord is long and pliable and doesn&#x27;t tangle easily. It is definitely worth the price. I&#x27;m now giving it 5 stars!m now giving it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have hated drying my hair ever since I was old enough to do it myself. 30 years later I have found a product that makes it EASY! It normally would take me 30 mins to get my hair dry, then another 30 mins to use hair iron to straighten my hair. I wish I would have found this dryer YEARS ago! NOW i can dry my hair in about 15 mins and there is NO NEED FOR HAIR IRON! I just use iron for touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have med length, thick, kinky curly hair (not the pretty curls!)This dryer gets it dry, shiney, and straight in NO TIME! BEST purchase EVER!!!!</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top quality dryer.  It is pricey but worth it!!  There is a difference in the way my hair feels after using this dryer vs other dryers I have used in the past.  It is smoother and slikier, less fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Purchased this hair drier as a gift for my wife.  I&#x27;m impressed, and so is she. We&#x27;ve had it for about a year, and I use it almost as much as she does.  It is quite powerful, and dries hair in about half of the time of her (our?) old one.  In one year of ownership, there have been no issues to report.</li>
            <li> Loved it but it only worked for 5 months. For $180 I expected at least a year. The seller wouldn&#x27;t take it back since it was past the return window but I really think they should have sent me another one. I only used it for a few minutes every 2-3 days. It dried very quickly. Wish I hadn&#x27;t paid so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 years and I still love my BabyBlissPro. It works great, fast, even on my thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair dyer. It has cut my during time in half. As a result, I straighten my hair much more often.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, I received this shipment before Amazon even notified me of the shipment.  Excellent seller, WONDERFUL product!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a blow dryer that is tough, dry time faster than my CHI and that will hold up for many drys....this is the one you will need.  You can totally tell the difference in the motor, the sound is much deeper.  I&#x27;m hoping to get many years with this one purchase.</li>
            <li> I just upgraded to this from a Chi that I had for years and this blows it out of the water. If you have thick hair that takes a long time to dry, make this investment! You won&#x27;t regret it! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Cuts my drying time down  tremendously!!! Very powerful and awesome for professionals my clients walk out with beautiful smooth hair!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS dryer!!! Used to take me close to an hour to dry my hair. Now I&#x27;m down to 15 minutes! not a chore to wash and dry my hair...now it&#x27;s a breeze. WELL WORTH EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> This dryer was recommended by my beautician and is made in Italy with a Ferrari motor. [Wish I could drive it !].  I  have wavy-frizzy hair and a round ceramic brush and this dryer allows me to style my hair and look like it was done in a salon.  My only problem was that the first dryer I received had a European plug and could not be used in an American outlet without an adapter ! However, I returned the dryer to Amazon and the second dryer was perfect. In fact, I bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much on a dang hair dryer, but after my Chi one went out like 3 times I decided to get this one b/c my boyfriend (no judging) had one and he loved it.  At first I didn&#x27;t think it got as hot as I was used to, but then again, maybe that&#x27;s why my hair was fried.  This actually seemed to improve the condition of my hair and once used with a roll brush is seriously awesome for straight, smooth hair - and I have the thickest mane a person could ever ask for, naturally curly and frizzy - this thing does the trick! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Really moves air and dries hair fast!  Nice long power cord.  This hair dryer is pricey, but I used my AMEX points to purchase!</li>
            <li> For some reason it causes my hair to knot up a lot while it is drying it. Have had to pick out large chunks of hair. Never had that happen before. Also doesn&#x27;t get very hot for several minutes. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I waited a year to buy this dryer because I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend this much.  I now have had it for a month and I love, love it!  My daughter comes and steals it every chance she gets!  So far, it was worth the wait.  I like the longer nozzle.  It is a bit heavy, but it dries your hair so fast, that you won&#x27;t have to hold it as long......</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waist and its highlighted.  Before this I had a newer high end drier but it took 45 minutes to dry my hair and I thought it may be damaging my hair some.  I bought the Babyliss Pro and just used it for the first time.  My hair is shiny and it only took 30 minutes on the cooler setting.  Love it so far!</li>
            <li> Best blowdryer on the market!  Very hot and can straighten the hair with perfection! Cuts during time in half!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is phenomenal! My hair is long and quite thick, and it drys so much faster with this than with other dryers. If you&#x27;re used to resorting to high heat to dry your hair, and your hair is normal in texture (i.e., some wave, not particularly dry or oily) I recommend using the middle heat setting with the highest air flow setting. It seems weird at first bc we&#x27;re all so used to heat styling, but it makes your hair look 20 times healthier and still drys really quickly! I only use the high heat when my hair is still pretty wet. Love this hair dryer! Best investment I&#x27;ve made in my hair since my sultra bombshell curling iron :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for awhile now and I was just noticing that it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as it use to.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair dryer. I did a lot of research prior to buying. I am used to having pro hair dryers. My last dryer was a Chi, but I opted not to purchase another Chi due to declining reviews. I do still love Chi&#x27;s straightening irons though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this dryer a 4 star review, because it is good and sturdy dryer with a 4 year warranty. It also has 6 settings, plus a button that super charges whatever setting you are using. You could almost blow leaves with this thing - it is that powerful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it 5 stars, because it is almost too powerful. I cannot leave it on its more powerful setting for too long or my hair becomes very tangled. This is not a big problem for me, but the unit does not heat up as much when it is on a lower blower setting. That is not optimal for me, because it takes a little longer for me to paddle brush it straight. For reference I have chest length, wavy, and medium course hair. Time will tell if this is better for my hair. I am betting that it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I also use it on my Pekingese after his weekly baths. I like that it has a lot of settings, more specifically that it does not get too hot to use on a pet or small child if need be.</li>
            <li> I needed a blow dryer that would actually dry my hair instead of wasting my time and so I got this one and it&#x27;s great I love that it&#x27;s super powerful and not too heavy. Only downfall about it is that it&#x27;s so powerful if your not careful it will tangle your hair but I just make sure to brush my hair a few times during drying ...</li>
            <li> This dryer is worth every penny!  I have thick curly hair that takes a while to dry, especially when i straighten it.  I used my sister&#x27;s dryer like this and immediately went home and purchased my own.  Cut my drying/styling time and frustration in half!  I am 50 years old and have owned a lot of hair dryers in my day..........this one has a ferrari engine and makes the others look like a bike with training wheels.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t possibly say enough great things about my Babyliss.  My mom used it shortly after I got it &amp; loved it so much too, that I had to order a 2nd one for her!!  I think that about says it all!</li>
            <li> Do not be put off by the price tag of this hair dryer!  It is, by far, the best hair instrument I have ever owned.  This has changed my life!!  My long, thick, wavy hair used to take an hour to blow dry and straighten (often times, also requiring the use of a straightening iron).  Ever since I got the Babyliss Pro Volare Dryer, my hair takes TWENTY MINUTES, from start to finish, to dry straight and beautifully!  No more straightening iron required! For the first time in fifteen years, I am able to wash my hair in the morning, before I leave for work.  I never had the time before!  Do yourself a favor....don&#x27;t wait as long as I did to buy this hair dryer!!!!1</li>
            <li> This is, by far, THE BEST HAIR DRYER, I have ever owned.  It is powerful but doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.  Leaves hair smooth, frizz-free and soft.  Salon results at home.  What more can I say?</li>
            <li> We bought this product for our very picky sister-in-law.  She loved it and that means the thing should probably be dipped in gold and displayed as one of the world&#x27;s best inventions.</li>
            <li> My hair looks much better after using this dryer.  I&#x27;ve cut drying time in half and my hair is really benefitting.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous when I purchased this, being it was a bit more than I am used to spending on a hairdryer.  But WOW! this dryer is amazing. I have extremely long hair (to my bum) and it usually takes me at least an hour; at the least.  With this dryer, my hair is dry in 15-20 minutes AND it is smoooooth, shiny, and manageable.  There are several settings on this that makes it really great for different styling.  It also works GREAT Dry when my hair is a little greasy, or I have been around smokers.  I just use this and brush my hair, and it takes OUT the greasiness and any smoke smell.  This is totally worth the pricetag.  In Love that it also has the Ferrari motor!  Can&#x27;t go wrong buying this.  Oh, also, I am very slim (not a whole lot of muscles) and I do not find it heavy at all.</li>
            <li> the best!pro!powerfull! super fast!sleek! worth every penny!beautiful hair! i hate to write reviews, but this one i thought i should share.</li>
            <li> Beat blow dryer and beauty investment to date! I not only bought myself one but one for my mom too! It has a turbo button for extra fast air. I have thick coarse hair and this blow dryer helps with shine and smoothing it out! I cannot be without it!</li>
            <li> I know this is a high priced dryer, and I&#x27;ve read many reviews claiming that it&#x27;s powerful Ferrari motor cuts drying time in half, leaving your hair smoother, with more shine and volume. I was skeptical, but it does do all of those things, and is the most powerful dryer I have ever owned! It&#x27;s fairly quiet too! The ergonomic handle is good for all hand sizes and it&#x27;s quite well balanced. There are six speed/temperature combinations and a cold shot button as well! There is a 4 Year Limited warranty from the manufacterer, and a long, 2.8 meter power cord with a built-in safety breaker. There is an identical model now available in red (Model BABFRV1). Mine is still going strong since July 2012. It isn&#x27;t cheap, but is seems well made, and performs as advertised, giving you salon results at home, in half the time. That&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife to replace her other Babyliss that I dropped on the tiles in the bathroom and broke.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> We love itnits super strong everyone in the house os fighting for it because we all have longhair and this machine is powerful.</li>
            <li> Wow--I am skeptical, but who would believe a hairdryer could make a difference?!  Love it, and worth the money!</li>
            <li> I never get my hair blown out at a salon,  recently i went to a salon to put color and the stylist asked if i wanted him to blow my hair and of course i said \\&quot;no, thank you\\&quot;.  so he said i can blow my hair myself for free and when i picked up his blow dryer omg i went online right away and purchased my own.  it cut my drying time in half.  i blow dry my hair so mcuh so its so worth the investment</li>
            <li> I have medium length very fine hair.  I was very surprised at how quickly it took me to dry my hair with this dryer vs any of the others.  Plus it gave me much more volume too.  Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have long straight healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This blow dryer is a good size, but the weight is heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highest setting is WAY too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this blow dryer, however I did like my last dyer better, it was an ION.</li>
            <li> does everything it promised. powerful, used it blow pine needles on my deck, blows dust bunnies in my computer away. slightly big and harder to hold sometimes if you werking on the back of your head. i would be tempted to try the mini version of this product that has the same horsepower.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this! The first one for me and the second to my mother. This is the only hair dryer either of us will ever use!! It had minimized blow drying, makes hair less frizzy and overall just love using it! Saving time blow drying your hair is the biggest gift of all.</li>
            <li> great dryer! loved it, now I just need a car to go along with my dryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing product , I blow dry my hair and style it in 13 mins, it&#x27;s just perfect for my life style and met my satisfaction</li>
            <li> WOW. This is the best investment I have made in a LONG time!  My hair drying routine has been cut in half, maybe more.  Same for my pomeranean who is intimidated by it but hey, he&#x27;s a dog.</li>
            <li> Have to work quickly, because this dryer gets with it!! Only con is that its heavy,  but you won&#x27;t holding long.</li>
            <li> I ordered this blow dryer and instead of the volare v1 that they advertise they sent me a portifino. That&#x27;s false advertising. I want my correct product.</li>
            <li> It is really unlike me to indulge in a purchase like this, but it was well worth it. I also have super thick hair and this makes drying it a breeze. The best hair dryer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this dryer was in my stylists salon. My stylist (a close friend of mine) was running behind one day, and asked if I minded drying my own hair while she put some color on another client.  Since I get my hair done free of charge, I didn&#x27;t have an issue with this request.  She told me I could use another stylists dryer who was out that day.  OMG!  I&#x27;ve never had my hair dry so fast on low heat!  I have a lot of hair, and I usually have to use the high heat setting in order to not have to stand there for nearly half an hour or more getting my hair dry...but the high heat leaves it a bit frizzy. This dryer dries my hair in less than 10 minutes on low heat, so that I can still enjoy that soft shine without the frizz!  I had to get one for myself, and considering this will save damage to my hair, it is well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and naturally wavy hair ... I can get a quicker blow out with tamer waves.  Not loud!</li>
            <li> I choose five stars because it dried the hair quicker and the hair was silkier.  My clients can go longer in between relaxers.  The tourmaline makes a big difference.  I would recommend this to stylists who do a lot of blowouts.  I have used the turbo power dryers which are better than most, but this babyliss  Volare is by far the best for time conscious stylists who demand the best.  It also has a great 4 year warranty.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. Had been looking for a new one, and decided to make the investment.&lt;br /&gt;Dries my hair quickly and smoothly. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST hairdryer I have ever owned. It is very powerful. You can expect to cut hair drying time in half. Also hair is left soft and smooth. I actually don&#x27;t need to use a hair straightener afterwards. It is not a light hair dryer but you get used to it. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Amazing blow dryer. Great power,  nice settings, drirs my hair in 1/3 of the time. Best purchase ive made in a long time.  Don&#x27;t let the price scare you. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she uses on a daily basis.  She really likes the results she gets from it and dries her hair quicker than the ordinary dryer you buy a your local stores.</li>
            <li> I have thick but fine, slightly curly hair that usually looks like a broom when I blow dry it straight.  After years of having hair like that I caved and got a Brazilian Blow Out.  I loved it but it&#x27;s expensive and there are questions about the safety of the chemicals used.  I also still needed to blow dry my hair.  Now that I have this monster, I don&#x27;t need the Blow Out anymore.  It dries my hair incredibly fast and makes it straight without frizziness.  I&#x27;ve only had it a month so I can&#x27;t attest to it&#x27;s sturdiness.  Everything about it indicates there were no corners cut on the quality, the power cord is thick and long, the dryer is loud but not any more than the 1875 W consumer dryer that I had.  Even the box it comes in is impressive.  I have to say though, if I had to replace it every 6 months, it would be worth it for me.  This baby is a godsend.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a dryer that has amazing blowing force, this is the dryer for you.  But I have short hair that I blow dry with a round brush and this dryer has too much force, even on the low setting, to style my hair.  If you have long hair or are using a diffuser, this will probably work great and dry your hair quickly but I just felt like I was in a wind tunnel.  I sent it back so I could try to find a dryer with less force.</li>
            <li> I would really like to rate it a 4.5. It is a bit on the heavy side and also louder than my T3 Light. It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair as quickly as my T3 but isn&#x27;t far behind.  However, I love the power and different settings of this dryer. I feel it seals in the cuticle better so there is no frizz. Overall, I prefer this dryer over the T3 and others I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
