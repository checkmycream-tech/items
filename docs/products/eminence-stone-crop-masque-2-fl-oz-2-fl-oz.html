            <li>It&#x27;s good product...as many people recommend use it for clamming after lime stimulating treatment, but I don&#x27;t like its smell</li>
            <li>I have nice skin without any issues</li>
            <li>Scrubs are easy to find and you can often settle for an inexpensive one but masques like this one are good to have for when your skin needs some calming.</li>
            <li>Great to use the day before a date ;)</li>
            <li>just like the fresh&#x27;s rose mask, both are over hype!</li>
            <li>and it has made a huge diffrence in my skin!  </li>
            <li>so I said sure why not.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, smoother, and I like the smell of the product:)</li>
            <li>also will give u better clamming fact...</li>
            <li>I LOVE the 8 greens whip moisurizer and was expecting a lot more out of this.</li>
            <li>Maybe the 8 greens masque would be better.</li>
            <li>I used Lancome for  years and was completely satisfied with my skin using  their products.</li>
            <li>personaly this one is my favorite-</li>
            <li>but my skin looks much better after using this one-</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any magical results with my hyper pigmentation</li>
            <li>The Stone Crop Masque product is good which makes my skin feels good, gentle, clean and smooth after using it although just started using it</li>
            <li>but right now my skin is more reactive and oily</li>
            <li>It took about a month for my skin to adjust to the new regime but I am more than satisfied with all of the Eminence products.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft and with a nice tone.  </li>
            <li>it has really given my skin a healthy glow and has balanced the hormones in my face-</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, the stone crop is kind of big</li>
            <li>This was the first product to arrive to my home from an Eminence order of 10 products, so I was really excited that it was the Stone Crop</li>
            <li>It helps calm my skin and reduce the size of the spots</li>
            <li>I prefer their cream-based masques such as the [[ASIN:B003POGRLO Eminence Rhubarb Masque Skin Care, Strawberry, 2 Ounce]] which are more worth the money.</li>
            <li>Received item super fast &amp; product was just as described.</li>
            <li>Eminence is amazing is pretty much every way possible.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I had younger acne prone skin that would be good, but I have skin that is dry already which gets occassional hormonal outreaks.</li>
            <li>This masque as a very earthy smell and texture.</li>
            <li>love the natural aspects of their formulas but this one has very stimulating botanicals (such as lemon), which tend to irritate skin instead of soothe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adds so much moisture to your skin.</li>
            <li>I think results really depend on your skin type.</li>
            <li>Masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high expectations for this particular product as I read the reviews and consulted an online Eminence reseller about the range before the large product purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to stop polluting their bodies with chemicals.</li>
            <li>It does not brighten the complexion visibly as the actives are probably too low to warrant a true brigthening/lightening effect.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying the a lot of their products because I was so pleased with them - I have this masque, sour cherry and the 8 greens-</li>
            <li>It also seems to help calm my face of break outs and such.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great calming mask but tad messy with green bits that hangs on your skin while it soaked in.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this product after getting a facial-</li>
            <li>I went through a honkin&#x27; 8.4 oz professional size tub of this stuff , and i would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stone Crop is a succulent plant that has hydrating, healing, and soothing properties (similar to Aloe), and was prescribed by Eminence experts to soothe and heal my sensitive, blemish-prone, dehydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone looking for a hydrating masque for dry skin.</li>
            <li>this has cut down on the amount of them tremedously and now they are much softer and lighter-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Eminence masks are the best</li>
            <li> I first discovered this product after getting a facial- my facial expert recommended it and I had extra money on my gift certificate so I said sure why not. Now I found a product I would use for perhaps the rest of my life. I notice an instant difference after using it. My skin is softer, smoother, and I like the smell of the product:) I&#x27;m just in my twenties but I can feel the hydration it provides for my skin and I love it!</li>
            <li> This mask was used on me during a facial and I have been using it every since. It hydrates the skin and leaves you with amazing texture. The smell is also beautiful and you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I love this masque!  It leaves my face soft and with a nice tone.  It is easy to use, the stone crop is kind of big but it is worth it!</li>
            <li> Eminence is amazing is pretty much every way possible. I also use the Stone crop toner, apricot whip face moisturizer, and Naseberry moisturizer. This masque as a very earthy smell and texture. The smell is so wonderful!</li>
            <li> I went through a honkin&#x27; 8.4 oz professional size tub of this stuff , and i would not purchase it again. My evaluation is based on living with this product long-term and using it over and over (it took about a year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone Crop is a succulent plant that has hydrating, healing, and soothing properties (similar to Aloe), and was prescribed by Eminence experts to soothe and heal my sensitive, blemish-prone, dehydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the natural aspects of their formulas but this one has very stimulating botanicals (such as lemon), which tend to irritate skin instead of soothe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate test was when i had an inflamed, itchy red face. Hoping the Stone Crop would make the redness go away and calm down my skin, i was shocked to find that after rinsing, my skin remained red and inflamed, angry welt marks still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year&#x27;s assessement of this formula, i can say: It did not improve sensitivity or blemishes. It does not calm or soothe skin. It does not brighten the complexion visibly as the actives are probably too low to warrant a true brigthening/lightening effect. It does, however, hydrate. But for me, that&#x27;s a very expensive hydrating mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone Crop is not Eminence&#x27;s best masque. I prefer their cream-based masques such as the [[ASIN:B003POGRLO Eminence Rhubarb Masque Skin Care, Strawberry, 2 Ounce]] which are more worth the money.</li>
            <li> This masque is amazing, and in my opinion, one of the best Eminence makes!  Great for problem/sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin in brighter and smoother since using this product 2 times per week!</li>
            <li> I love it! Makes my face supple after using it. It also seems to help calm my face of break outs and such. Great to use the day before a date ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good product...as many people recommend use it for clamming after lime stimulating treatment, but I don&#x27;t like its smell and I think there is similar product with lower price also will give u better clamming fact...</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied with the masque because it was not entirely new, there were signs that it was opened before showed in the external&lt;br /&gt;Box and inside the masque container, not sure if somebody has actually used it.</li>
            <li> This was the first product to arrive to my home from an Eminence order of 10 products, so I was really excited that it was the Stone Crop Masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high expectations for this particular product as I read the reviews and consulted an online Eminence reseller about the range before the large product purchases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was bad, but that was not the issue. The issue is that I did not feel or see a result. My skin was the same AFTER having the masque on for 30 minutes. I don&#x27;t know If the product is off, or I have heard that products on Amazon can be \\&quot;fakes\\&quot;. I will see how the other products are before deciding if Eminence is the product range for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Adds so much moisture to your skin.</li>
            <li> just like the fresh&#x27;s rose mask, both are over hype! bad products. don&#x27;t hydrate at all. only tighten skin coz they make skin dry!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this did anything but make my skin feel tight and dry. Perhaps if I had younger acne prone skin that would be good, but I have skin that is dry already which gets occassional hormonal outreaks. Not a winner for me. I LOVE the 8 greens whip moisurizer and was expecting a lot more out of this. Maybe the 8 greens masque would be better.</li>
            <li> If you want to go organic on your skin, then the Eminence line is what you want. I used Lancome for  years and was completely satisfied with my skin using  their products. A few years ago I realized how many chemicals are in skin products that have very nasty side affects with long term use and decided to go organic. It took about a month for my skin to adjust to the new regime but I am more than satisfied with all of the Eminence products. Would highly recommend them to anyone who wants to stop polluting their bodies with chemicals.</li>
            <li> This was the 1st masque I used from eminence- started using it about 2 wks ago and it has made a huge diffrence in my skin!  I ended up buying the a lot of their products because I was so pleased with them - I have this masque, sour cherry and the 8 greens- personaly this one is my favorite- it has really given my skin a healthy glow and has balanced the hormones in my face- I have nice skin without any issues but beore I started using this I had black chin hairs I had to pluck every morning- this has cut down on the amount of them tremedously and now they are much softer and lighter- so it doing something! I also like the 8 greens and the sour cherry - I alternate between them because I already have them- but my skin looks much better after using this one- if I had it all to do over again I would have just stocked up on this one.</li>
            <li> Received item super fast &amp; product was just as described. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a hydrating masque for dry skin.</li>
            <li> i use the stone crop masque after an exfoliant when i give myself an at home facial. its soothing and works well with all skin types.</li>
            <li> I love this!!its the best!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great calming mask but tad messy with green bits that hangs on your skin while it soaked in. Skin is refreshed and felt dewy after wash off. It has a gluey texture.</li>
            <li> The Stone Crop Masque product is good which makes my skin feels good, gentle, clean and smooth after using it although just started using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Eminence stone crop masque for a few months now and it&#x27;s been somewhat helpful to my combination/acne prone skin. This is one of those products you FEEL the difference after use rather than seeing. It helps calm my skin and reduce the size of the spots but I haven&#x27;t seen any magical results with my hyper pigmentation (that&#x27;s why I got this product). Scrubs are easy to find and you can often settle for an inexpensive one but masques like this one are good to have for when your skin needs some calming. I apply the masque for 10-15 mins and rinse off with a towel. My skin is smoother and cleaner after use. I think results really depend on your skin type. I bought this product when I didn&#x27;t have skin issues but right now my skin is more reactive and oily so I&#x27;m going to try their probiotic masque next.</li>
