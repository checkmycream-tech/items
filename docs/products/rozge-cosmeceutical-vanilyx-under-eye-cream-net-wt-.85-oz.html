    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I will happily continue using my Vanilyx!</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>Despite never hearing of this product before and based solely upon all the great feedback on this product, I went ahead and purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I try almost everything that has good advertising, but this is one product that does work .  </li>
            <li>Many times people ask if I had a face lift.</li>
            <li>but I thought I would give this a try and see if it worked better for me.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and this us</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I admit it</li>
            <li>SO I was blessed with a beautiful baby girl who still, at 8 months old, doesn&#x27;t sleep through the night!</li>
            <li>so far, good product.</li>
            <li>This silky cream texture is light and very hydrating.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that I only wish I had taken before and after pics to show you how incredible this works.  </li>
            <li>I think my eye area looks younger and much more refreshed.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, product is very concentrated, and you only need a DROP, so it makes the cost worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>THANKS AMAZON &amp; ROZGE.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li>This product lighted them up by about 40% - and that is more then any other cream I tried!</li>
            <li>Also, no eye irritations, and I am highly allergic as well as being a contact lens wearer, so no issues with any of those.</li>
            <li>I have hereditary darkness under my eyes that has gotten a little more noticeable with time.  </li>
            <li>, I read the reviews and count on them when buying a new product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I aged fast and thought after trying a drawer full of other more popular and expensive under creams that I&#x27;d be stuck with this problem for the rest of my days.  </li>
            <li>I even kind of felt as if it made my dark circles a bit more noticeable, which is weird.</li>
            <li>my circles are considerably lighter.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say completely gone</li>
            <li>But no black lines under eyes does take years off you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product exactly according to the directions for 3 months; and, after all this time I have not seen any difference in the dark undereye circles I was born with.</li>
            <li>It .really eliminates the dark circles and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>This product has really helped me with my dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>I have always had bothersome dark circles under my eyes, and now I don&#x27;t have to use as much concealer to cover them.</li>
            <li>Really works on dark circles.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> After spending LOTS time and money trying treatments for dark under eye circles and puffy bags I FINALLY found a cream that works!</li>

            <li> Sadly, after following the directions and using this product consistently for three weeks, I did NOT HAVE ANY IMPROVEMENT on the circles or puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I went back to the other brand and the dark circles were reduced again.</li>
            <li> My eyes look much younger and have less dark circle..</li>
            <li> I tried this product for under eye circles due to allergies, and after 5 weeks using 2x a day (might have missed a few days the second time)</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks my dark circles started coming back</li>
            <li> I had been using another brand that was working to reduce the dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> Reduces my dark circles.</li>
            <li> So now I have puffy, bloodshot eyes with dark circles to boot.</li>
            <li> My dark circles started as a side effect of some medication I had taken &amp; am still on.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product last week, and so far, the deep under eye circles have diminished a little, however, it says to give it a while...for the time, so far, its done what it says, and I have SERIOUS under eye rings from being sick, tired, and stressed...</li>
            <li> So essentially I wasted money on a product that does not work (for me).</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday once a day for about two weeks</li>
            <li> It looked like I had 2 black eyes!</li>
            <li> With this product--nothing and I used it for at least a few months.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> And the dark circles have already decreased.  </li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s regenerist you at least see SOMETHING within a week.</li>
            <li> bad, reviews here were raving.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would work for me been using it 2 to 3 times a day for 3 weeks no change &#x3D;(  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried this product for under eye circles due to allergies, and after 5 weeks using 2x a day (might have missed a few days the second time) my circles are considerably lighter. I just ordered another tube.</li>
            <li> I try almost everything that has good advertising, but this is one product that does work .  I panic if my tubes run low. Many times people ask if I had a face lift. No. But no black lines under eyes does take years off you. Wish lI could remember which Beauty catalogue always sells it for $19.99</li>
            <li> Just started using this product last week, and so far, the deep under eye circles have diminished a little, however, it says to give it a while...for the time, so far, its done what it says, and I have SERIOUS under eye rings from being sick, tired, and stressed...so far, good product. I would like to offer product of before and after after the four week period.  Also, product is very concentrated, and you only need a DROP, so it makes the cost worthwhile.  Also, no eye irritations, and I am highly allergic as well as being a contact lens wearer, so no issues with any of those.</li>
            <li> I am using this for now 4 weeks. I can definetly see the difference.. My eyes look much younger and have less dark circle.. I won&#x27;t say completely gone but it does work well.</li>
            <li> none of these products do anything they say they do. I never learn to save my money!&lt;br /&gt;Always hoping the next product will &amp;#34;work&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve wasted too much money hoping 1 product will&lt;br /&gt;do what it says it will do</li>
            <li> I had been using another brand that was working to reduce the dark circles under my eyes but I thought I would give this a try and see if it worked better for me. After using it for a few weeks my dark circles started coming back so I went back to the other brand and the dark circles were reduced again. This product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again...</li>
            <li> Reduces my dark circles. I&#x27;ve tried many products and this us the only I&#x27;ve that works for me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It .really eliminates the dark circles and is reasonably priced.  This is my second purchase of this product</li>
            <li> One star for delivery. Okay, I admit it, I read the reviews and count on them when buying a new product on Amazon. Despite never hearing of this product before and based solely upon all the great feedback on this product, I went ahead and purchased this product. Sadly, after following the directions and using this product consistently for three weeks, I did NOT HAVE ANY IMPROVEMENT on the circles or puffiness under my eyes. I did however, get red eyes. So now I have puffy, bloodshot eyes with dark circles to boot. So essentially I wasted money on a product that does not work (for me). Be forewarned.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped me with my dark under eye circles. I have always had bothersome dark circles under my eyes, and now I don&#x27;t have to use as much concealer to cover them. This silky cream texture is light and very hydrating.I put it on in the morning before makeup and again at night. I think my eye area looks younger and much more refreshed. I will happily continue using my Vanilyx!</li>
            <li> This is definitely diminishing the appearance of my dark circles. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 1week and a halve but my eyes don&#x27;t feel so droopy anymore. As they shouldn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m only 22.</li>
            <li> After spending LOTS time and money trying treatments for dark under eye circles and puffy bags I FINALLY found a cream that works! Vanilyx Under Eye Cream has not only corrected these problems but left me looking 10 years younger.  My only regret is that I only wish I had taken before and after pics to show you how incredible this works.  My dark circles started as a side effect of some medication I had taken &amp; am still on. I aged fast and thought after trying a drawer full of other more popular and expensive under creams that I&#x27;d be stuck with this problem for the rest of my days.  Saw this on Amazon.com and thought I&#x27;d try one last thing before giving up - IT WORKED! THANKS AMAZON &amp; ROZGE.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Really works on dark circles. Fast delivery too.</li>
            <li> I just received this 2 days ago and have been applying to the eye area morning and night.  I can&#x27;t believe my puffy eyes have been eliminated!  And the dark circles have already decreased.  I will not be without this.  P.S. i&#x27;m 52</li>
            <li> SO I was blessed with a beautiful baby girl who still, at 8 months old, doesn&#x27;t sleep through the night! It looked like I had 2 black eyes! My circles couldn&#x27;t even cover up with makeup! This product lighted them up by about 40% - and that is more then any other cream I tried! Dace it ladies, nothing will remove them 100%! It takes about 3 weeks to notice a big difference but it does work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product exactly according to the directions for 3 months; and, after all this time I have not seen any difference in the dark undereye circles I was born with. Perhaps I was foolish to believe that a simple cream would lighten up these dark undereye circles.</li>
            <li> I am an African-American with olive undertones.  I wear Revlon Colorstay foundation in \\&quot;Caramel\\&quot;.  I have hereditary darkness under my eyes that has gotten a little more noticeable with time.  I was hoping that this cream would thicken and/or brighten the skin under my eyes, but it has not.  I have been using it everyday once a day for about two weeks and I only like that it does moisturize without irritation, but that&#x27;s about it.  I will switch to Korres products in the future.</li>
            <li> Just simply doesn&#x27;t work. I even kind of felt as if it made my dark circles a bit more noticeable, which is weird. I stopped using it pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, reviews here were raving.</li>
            <li> Tryed using this cream under and around my eyes twive a day for several weeks.I really couldn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would work for me been using it 2 to 3 times a day for 3 weeks no change &#x3D;(  bummer</li>
            <li> I need to learn my lesson when it comes to products like this: stick to trusted brands like Olay, Lancome, etc.&lt;br /&gt;4 weeks before you see results?? Come on. Olay&#x27;s regenerist you at least see SOMETHING within a week. With this product--nothing and I used it for at least a few months.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
