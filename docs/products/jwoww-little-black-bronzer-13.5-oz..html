            <li>Super price!</li>
            <li>Bought a sample packet at the tanning salon and fell in love with the smell and the way it tans fast!!</li>
            <li>It has great results and will only be buying this from now on</li>
            <li>but otherwise I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It is silky and smooth to the touch and soaks into my skin quickly, making tanning quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast too! :)</li>
            <li>When I got it, it wasn&#x27;t sealed, which kind of surprised me.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks now and can honestly say it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This lotion EASILY fulfills those requirements and i would recommend this lotion to anyone looking for a new tanning lotion</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t streat at all, it does have a strong after tan smell though that I could live without.</li>
            <li>so I am obviously a very avid and educated tanner haha, and</li>
            <li>I love trying out all different types of lotions and seeing what i like.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li>The price is great too, I spent double at a tanning salon, the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super dark and get many compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li>I find no differences in tanning lotions and certainly nothing stood out in this one.</li>
            <li>have to say this is my absolute new #1 lotion!!</li>
            <li>I used a sample of a different lotion in between using this and could tell a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Would highly reccomand!</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t notice it to make me any darker</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used a JWOW tanning lotion I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>but this lotion didnt do much for me.</li>
            <li>just didnt see much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and it does the job, but if you want to be tan and bronze fast......</li>
            <li>Seller contacted me explaining that amazon requires them to smug out the  serial item number at the bottom which is what I confused for the expiration date, this product works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other jwwow products and they have produced better results.</li>
            <li>I have used her other products before and just love them.</li>
            <li>This lotion gives me the color that I want, is extremely moisturizing with a great scent that is long lasting.</li>
            <li>Live used JWOW products before.</li>
            <li>The color is natural looking and the scent is to die for!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much change in tan after several applications.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Hispanic and naturally tan</li>
            <li>I gave this 2 stars because I had such high hopes for this lotion, but I didn&#x27;t see any color change while using it.</li>
            <li>I was previously using One and Done, but felt that the color I achieved with that lotion was not as natural looking as I wanted as well as a bit too intense.</li>
            <li>I already had a nice dark color to my skin from other jwoww lotions but after using this lotion i got really dark..</li>
            <li>I love Jwoww Little Black Bronzer!</li>

            <li> I love Jwoww Little Black Bronzer!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed, little black bronzer is the best tanning lotion in the world.</li>
            <li> If you want to get extremely dark, in a short amount of time, get this.</li>
            <li> I have the One and Done in the pink bottle</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> i have tried a couple of snooki&#x27;s lotions as well as one of Jwoww&#x27;s other bronzers but none compare to the little black bronzer.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little darker.</li>
            <li> smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming...</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t gain hardly any color from this</li>
            <li> or you will waste money!!</li>
            <li> Has a slight weird hint of bubblegum</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great on my skin</li>
            <li> Was not expired or fake.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> great smell - no after tan smell or minimal - bronzer works great!</li>
            <li> I got color you could see by 3rd tan! It was remarkable! It doesn&#x27;t make you look orange it helps with you actually looking tan! Like you just got back from the tropics!</li>
            <li> This was a very good quality!</li>
            <li> Has a slight weird hint of bubblegum but otherwise I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought a sample packet at the tanning salon and fell in love with the smell and the way it tans fast!! I tan easily but this tan lotion left me feeling moisturizer and NOT smelling like burnt toast leaving the tan salon. It has a fruity smell but not overpowering. It has great results and will only be buying this from now on</li>
            <li> When I got it, it wasn&#x27;t sealed, which kind of surprised me. Live used JWOW products before. I have the One and Done in the pink bottle and I love it. But this leaves me orangey. And literally, washes away. I&#x27;ve been tanning for weeks, almost daily and it has taken me forever to look like I have any color. I used a sample of a different lotion in between using this and could tell a huge difference. I honestly think the lotion was tampered with or isn&#x27;t legit. Definitely will not buy again though.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lotions, delivered in a timely manner, thank you...</li>
            <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t streat at all, it does have a strong after tan smell though that I could live without.</li>
            <li> Love love love all of the jwoww brands. They all give you amazing color.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Disappointed in product. Didn&#x27;t see much change in tan after several applications. Didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost all of the jwoww lotions and this is one of my favorites now. Im sure i would be getting better color if i were using a lay down bed, but its an awesome lotion and gives me good color.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky.  I&#x27;m super dark and get many compliments on my tan.</li>
            <li> I have every tanning lotion you could think of from jwoww to kardashion and with this one I got a lot darker than I thought I would and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it at all would never buy it again</li>
            <li> Smells great before and after tan. No burning smells. Gives great color! Fast shipping. Would highly reccomand! One of her best lotions out there!</li>
            <li> Good deal compared to what you would pay retail for.  Not greasy, and smells good.  Does not streak.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon so I am obviously a very avid and educated tanner haha, and I love trying out all different types of lotions and seeing what i like. have to say this is my absolute new #1 lotion!! It smells AMAZING before AND after tanning, moisturizes my skin almost as well as the Hempz products do and i see instant color after tanning with this one. i have tried a couple of snooki&#x27;s lotions as well as one of Jwoww&#x27;s other bronzers but none compare to the little black bronzer. A perfect tanning lotion must do 3 things: accelerate your tan, smell good, and moisturize/hydrate you AND your skin. This lotion EASILY fulfills those requirements and i would recommend this lotion to anyone looking for a new tanning lotion I will most definitely continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> Works awesome for this naturally white girl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this tanning lotion for over a year. I use different ones for the smell and bronzers. This lotion will give you a tan after two days. It is literally the best lotion you can buy on the Internet. I was brown within two weeks. Everyone asked me what I was doing and what I was using, and I loved recommending this. If you want to get extremely dark, in a short amount of time, get this. You will not be disappointed, little black bronzer is the best tanning lotion in the world.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells AMAZING and works great! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Seems like a really great product but, I love all of J-Woww&#x27;s tanning lotions! No ato at all! Just gotta use it some more!</li>
            <li> It does condition my skin but I really didn&#x27;t notice it to make me any darker</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Love the color. Love this lotion</li>
            <li> Great product- don&#x27;t let the tanning salon sell you this product in the store or you will waste money!! This product is just has good and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I really haven&#x27;t used a JWOW tanning lotion I didn&#x27;t like. It spreads on evenly and doesn&#x27;t have a overbearing smell.The best thing is you don&#x27;t have to use a bunch of it.</li>
            <li> I love Jwoww Little Black Bronzer! The price is great too, I spent double at a tanning salon, the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li> I find no differences in tanning lotions and certainly nothing stood out in this one. I guess it does the job?</li>
            <li> It smells good even after tanning. I wish it was a little darker.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but it lived up to its promise of not streaking. The color you get from using it is so amazing.  I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> This is an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; product. I&#x27;m Hispanic and naturally tan but this lotion didnt do much for me. It did however leave me brown and not orange...just didnt see much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming...wouldn&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan easily so I bought this because of the bronzer and the hype of jwoww lotions; I wasn&#x27;t impressed and didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> Smells great but didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in color. I&#x27;ve used other jwwow products and they have produced better results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and can honestly say it is amazing. The color is natural looking and the scent is to die for! It is silky and smooth to the touch and soaks into my skin quickly, making tanning quick and easy. I was previously using One and Done, but felt that the color I achieved with that lotion was not as natural looking as I wanted as well as a bit too intense. This lotion gives me the color that I want, is extremely moisturizing with a great scent that is long lasting. I would definitely recommend this lotion to anyone, especially when bought from Australian Gold as they are the manufacturer of this lotion. Was not expired or fake. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Great lotion, pleasant fragrance! Super price! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of lotions and this one does alright it smells good and gives me good color....just doesn&#x27;t quite compare to anything that designer skin makes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all the jwoww lotions ams what I like about this over all the others one is that there is ZERO after tan smell! I get pretty good color I got better color with her wedding one. That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars</li>
            <li> I love it. I have used her other products before and just love them. I would recommend this to others</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy this again. Great seller, but cheap Australian gold worked better.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion... I already had a nice dark color to my skin from other jwoww lotions but after using this lotion i got really dark.. I desided to try all of her lotions and I think this is her best one out of all of them... My two favorite lotions from her is this one and her one and done lotion</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I do like it but Elusive is the one for me after trying several bronzers. The smell on this is alright and it does the job, but if you want to be tan and bronze fast......Elusive is your best bet.</li>
            <li> Seller contacted me explaining that amazon requires them to smug out the  serial item number at the bottom which is what I confused for the expiration date, this product works great and I will be a repeat customer</li>
            <li> I gave this 2 stars because I had such high hopes for this lotion, but I didn&#x27;t see any color change while using it. The smell was good though, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion I only use JWOWW TANNING LOTIONS and always get the best results and compliments on my color. Streak free and smells great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this tanning lotion! It brought me to my maximum darkness without leaving streaks! I&#x27;ve always been a fan of all of Jwoww&#x27;s tanning lotions. TRY IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased! Good bronzer!</li>
            <li> Great lotion! I love Austrailian Gold products! It smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells AMAZING! Shipped fast too! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is great lotion (it&#x27;s not expired) but it&#x27;s not great on my skin, I didn&#x27;t gain hardly any color from this (I tan 5 days a week) go a head and try it though, it seems like others love it!</li>
