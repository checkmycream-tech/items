            <li> I only gave this 2 stars based on the sprayer not working after 2 weeks, causing me to throw it away. The scent probably would have rated 4 stars, if the sprayer performed.</li>
            <li> Awesome Cologne my boyfriend has been using it for years and he loves it. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better smelling Cologne</li>
            <li> Not very strong. Although not objectionable, but I expected more. I bought another type of his cologne, from Marshall, it really smelled good and lasted long time.</li>

            <li> I always buy this cologne at christmas time as a gift. for my hubby and my brothers its inexpensive and smells realy good! from a womans point of view.</li>
            <li> I really like the look of this and the bottle is very stylish. The scent itself is pretty good- not my favorite but a really good cologne for the summer. Not so much the winter- it kind of gives me a headache if i&#x27;m at school all day and it doesn&#x27;t really feel right. Very fresh smelling with a citrus feel and sometimes i noticed hints of flowers. A nice change from most that i own, but definitely best fit for the summer time.</li>
