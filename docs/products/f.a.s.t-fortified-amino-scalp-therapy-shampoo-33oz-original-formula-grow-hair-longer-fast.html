            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>I just use a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>but  it seems to be a good shampoo</li>
            <li>am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Im told by people that knows me the hair looks very healthy.  </li>
            <li>but I love the way my hair looks and feels!</li>
            <li>The first thing we noticed is that it greatly controls her oily scalp condition and in turn has helped with her dandruff a lot!!!!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Smells nice but my hair did not grow as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The conditioner is also VERY light that I use it as a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>High quality ,beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li>Will definately order more before i run out</li>
            <li>I guess it works ok.  </li>
            <li>but my hair is for sure getting healthier</li>
            <li>I love FAST&lt;</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo</li>
            <li>I love the way this product works, smells and leave my hair.  </li>
            <li>Its super shiny!  </li>
            <li>This product works great but will dry your air out and fade hair color very quickly.</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>and you need a good deep conditioner for your ends.</li>
            <li>although idk If it works to make my hair grow fast it does make it healthy..</li>
            <li>- this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought the large bottle as it works better than most drugstore shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am Sorry for late.&lt;br /&gt;it is so good and good for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a very strong moisturizing conditioner and a leave in treatment is definitely needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast and item is as shown/described.</li>
            <li>This shampoo always leaves my hair very clean and soft and really accelerates the hair growth process.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and it is hard to not use it anymore.</li>
            <li>after a couple of weeks of use hair is not falling as much, its stronger and its growing very fast..  </li>
            <li>I use my own conditioner to keep the moisture up and frizz down.</li>
            <li>(you should never wash your hair with shampoo every day anyways, use this shampoo twice-three times a week at most) and put some conditioner on your ends afterwards, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about dry</li>
            <li>When nothing else has helped, FAST does work to help stop the patchy hair loss, and help some growth with alopecia areata.    </li>
            <li>her hair is growing fast and she is so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I guess real results must happen within and not out</li>
            <li>It really works well for me.</li>
            <li>I have a challenging hair trifecta - fine, color treated hair with hard well water!  </li>
            <li>I purchase it on a regular basis and it really does seem to make the hair grown longer!</li>
            <li>Its definitely NOT a miracle product by any means,  needs to be improved and its very high priced.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t definitively say that my hair grows any faster using this shampoo, but it does seem to help keep it relatively healthy and less dead ends to trim certainly doesn&#x27;t impede growth speed!</li>
            <li>next thing we noticed is how fast her hair is growing.  </li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly and use it daily.</li>
            <li>Im not using the conditioner only the shamppoo and the hair is very bouncy not flat.  </li>
            <li>stuff cleans you hair very well and does make your hair really dry so</li>
            <li>As I read in some other reviews, it isn&#x27;t necessarily moisturizing, but that&#x27;s okay as it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down either -</li>
            <li>I could barely afford one bottle and the set is so freaking</li>

            <li> Some people say this shampoo can dry out your hair but as long as you don&#x27;t use this every day</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference and my hair felt so dry.</li>
            <li> This clears the way for the second shampoo, which I use two pumps [half dollar size]..</li>
            <li> I mean ive seen a little growth quicker than normal and definitely have lots of baby hairs around my forehead but its not as &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; as they claim it to be which is a HUGE disappointment for me.</li>

            <li> if washed like instructed for a black woman, you hair will dry out and break.</li>

            <li> and she has very oily scalp and bad dandruff.  </li>
            <li> not sure if I will buy this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> so I thought at least</li>
            <li> Her hair is thick but grows slowly</li>
            <li> I have hypothiroidism and my hair got weak and very thin</li>
            <li> Im just kinda disappointed</li>

            <li> I am Sorry for late.&lt;br /&gt;it is so good and good for me.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied.</li>

            <li> Too soon to tell on hair growth results but I love the way my hair looks and feels!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is alright. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work like they say cause it is a shampoo. No shampoo is going to double hair growth in my opinion. But I figured id try.  My hair is a HORRIBLE cut so I thought at least I could try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using it for about a month and a half now. I guess it works ok.  I mean ive seen a little growth quicker than normal and definitely have lots of baby hairs around my forehead but its not as &amp;#34;fast&amp;#34; as they claim it to be which is a HUGE disappointment for me. BUT im only using the shampoo cause I could barely afford one bottle and the set is so freaking expensive!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff cleans you hair very well and does make your hair really dry so a very strong moisturizing conditioner and a leave in treatment is definitely needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a big difference in the appearance of my hair though.  Its super shiny!  I have mixed opinions on this shampoo. Its definitely NOT a miracle product by any means,  needs to be improved and its very high priced.  I mean not everyone has deep pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure if I will buy this shampoo again. But everyone is different so maybe it will work for some people.  Im just kinda disappointed but oh well.  Good luck if you try this product (:</li>
            <li> When nothing else has helped, FAST does work to help stop the patchy hair loss, and help some growth with alopecia areata.    It&#x27;s helped gal friend who also has thining hair.</li>
            <li> Great item, excellent  for the hair.High quality ,beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter wanted to try this.  Her hair is thick but grows slowly and she has very oily scalp and bad dandruff.  Since using this product, she washes her hair 2 -3 times per week with this and then another shampoo on off days.  The first thing we noticed is that it greatly controls her oily scalp condition and in turn has helped with her dandruff a lot!!!!  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing we noticed is how fast her hair is growing.  Usually she only gets her hair trimmed every 6 - 8 wks.  Now she has to have it trimmed every 2-3 wks to shape it and her hair is growing fast and she is so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with other comments and reviews that this is a drying product and you need a good deep conditioner for your ends.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a few months and ordered my second bottle. although idk If it works to make my hair grow fast it does make it healthy.. it may be because I don&#x27;t use the conditioner to go with it but my hair is for sure getting healthier&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend!</li>
            <li> this is regular shampoo with just a different name. nothing special. I guess real results must happen within and not out</li>
            <li> I have a challenging hair trifecta - fine, color treated hair with hard well water!  I can&#x27;t definitively say that my hair grows any faster using this shampoo, but it does seem to help keep it relatively healthy and less dead ends to trim certainly doesn&#x27;t impede growth speed! As I read in some other reviews, it isn&#x27;t necessarily moisturizing, but that&#x27;s okay as it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down either - I just use a good conditioner.  If you are on the fence - give it a shot - this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought the large bottle as it works better than most drugstore shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> after a couple of weeks of use hair is not falling as much, its stronger and its growing very fast..  Im not using the conditioner only the shamppoo and the hair is very bouncy not flat.  Im told by people that knows me the hair looks very healthy.  I have hypothiroidism and my hair got weak and very thin and I have always been told nothing would help.  but I notice big difference with this shamppo.  Will definitely keep using it.  I really love how my hair looks!!</li>
            <li> I love FAST&lt;br /&gt;My hair even feels healthier. I wish it was cheaper since it does go so fast.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to shampoo twice, What I&#x27;ve learned is to do this, but watered down.&lt;br /&gt;The first shampoo should just be one pump, a small amount to rub just onto your scalp. This clears the way for the second shampoo, which I use two pumps [half dollar size].. [If you do only one shampoo and then one conditioner I find the results are not the same as when you double shampoo].&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is also VERY light that I use it as a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Almond Oil [100% organic] to help my hair grow. Who knows if any of our tricks actually work. All I know is that my hair, and scalp are the healthiest they have ever been.</li>
            <li> This shampoo will help your hair grow faster. Just be mindful that there are some sellers who sell non-genuine stuff. Look at the ratings, buy and use the shampoo, and you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> This product works great but will dry your air out and fade hair color very quickly. I purchase it on a regular basis and it really does seem to make the hair grown longer!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Delivery was very fast and item is as shown/described. The bottle is very big and lasts a long time. This shampoo always leaves my hair very clean and soft and really accelerates the hair growth process. Some people say this shampoo can dry out your hair but as long as you don&#x27;t use this every day (you should never wash your hair with shampoo every day anyways, use this shampoo twice-three times a week at most) and put some conditioner on your ends afterwards, you shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend and I&#x27;ll be buying this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money.  It does NOT work.  It does make your hair brittle and mine sheds now and it never shed before!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I wanted my hair longer. Used it for three months and did not see a change. I hated how it made my hair feel. Will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo but you have to use it every day.</li>
            <li> Despite my initial concerns about my hair falling out, the product does the job of speeding my hair growth. I use my own conditioner to keep the moisture up and frizz down. After six weeks of using this gem, my hair has grown about an inch. That&#x27;s faster than it&#x27;s usual half inch or so in that same time span. I recommend it highly and use it daily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a difference and my hair felt so dry.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and it is hard to not use it anymore. It really works well for me.</li>
            <li> I love and hate it. Works well but not fond of the \\&quot;wash and repeat\\&quot; every day. Wish they could make a leave in scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product works, smells and leave my hair.  I don&#x27;t know if it makes it grow but  it seems to be a good shampoo</li>
            <li> Smells nice but my hair did not grow as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is no different than a $1 bottle of Suave.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This product does not work as advertised. The return period expires before you can figure out if its working or not.  Learn from my mistake!!!!!</li>
