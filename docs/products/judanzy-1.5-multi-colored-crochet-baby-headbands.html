            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t look as cute at all!</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for and the number of headbands and colors are wonderful for the price.</li>
            <li>Received the items in perfect condition with colors exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for my newborn sized well holding up good colors are vibrant</li>
            <li>I make my own barrettes &amp; bows and buy the head wraps.</li>
            <li>I dont know if they were cheaply made hence the good price</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to wear, and very stylish, not to mention easy to attach bows and ribbons to!</li>
            <li>stick out on top of the band</li>
            <li>My daughter looks adorable in these.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I purchased them.</li>
            <li>My 2.5 yr old daughter loves them and they fit her head perfectly!</li>
            <li>and that would also be safe.  </li>
            <li>THESE ARE REALLY CUTE</li>
            <li>Love these and love the price.</li>
            <li>Love the assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>buy some more of these for friends</li>
            <li>They have just the right amount of elastic in them and were very easy to glue things to!</li>
            <li>but by the time you pay shipping the cost becomes more significant!  </li>
            <li>I do photos of rescue dogs for petfinder and these actually make very good decorative collars.</li>
            <li>These are a very good value and they are pretty and shimmery, much prettier than in the pictures.</li>
            <li>They appeared to be able to fit a variety of head sizes.  </li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and they have a good elasticity to them.</li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;m sure they look pretty on babies, too!</li>
            <li>They are so flexible, they even fit on my head...</li>
            <li>dont fit yet.</li>
            <li>and they fit with no problem.</li>
            <li>These headbands are an awsome fit for any baby head size.</li>
            <li>They have other great cute stuff on their web site also.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these headbands to put on my baby girl.</li>
            <li>They arrived very quickly &amp; are exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>They do fit good because they stretch easily and don&#x27;t leave marks like other baby headbands.</li>
            <li>very pretty colors too.</li>
            <li>15 different colors is probably too many, but I can now color coordinate my child until the apocalypse!  </li>
            <li>They seem to be made very well &amp; are super stretchy!</li>
            <li>These headbands are soft and springy, they don&#x27;t hurt my little girl, and being able to switch colors and clips to match her outfits is great.  </li>
            <li>I liked these a lot, but the colors were different from what is shown.  </li>
            <li>I clip flowers or bows right to the bands.  </li>
            <li>These are just the right size.  </li>
            <li>The colors are great, and they serve the purpose, but definitely dont last.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that i received them earlier than the appointed delivery time!</li>
            <li>Rather, you should make quality headband that is as safe as possible for babies.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Strings get loose easily.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that she can grab it and snag some of the loops out of place, but so far I have found that easy to fix.  </li>
            <li>She is 8 months old and doesn&#x27;t have much hair, so these bands help when people wonder if she is a girl or boy!  </li>
            <li>My daughter has been wearing them and so far there does not appear to be any issue of stretching out or becoming loose.</li>
            <li>I bought these crochet headbands because I made little cute clips to attach to them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten headbands twice now from Little Noggin, and I as well as my children LOVE them.</li>
            <li>The warning suggest to me that the makers know this headband can easily become unraveled (as other reviews have noted) and therefore be unsafe.  </li>
            <li>They are a nice size and fairly soft for little one&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My one year old doesn&#x27;t pull them off as much as some of the others she has and they don&#x27;t leave marks either.  </li>
            <li>But they are very stretchy and soft.</li>
            <li>Also they come in different sizes, some fit my 3 months old and other</li>
            <li>I would pay more for a higher quality, better made, safer product, but unfortunately have had trouble finding basic baby headbands that are soft and stay on my baby&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Glue gun on some decorations such as flowers and such and the dogs look so pretty.</li>
            <li>They stay in her hair, which stands straight up on her 8 month old head, until she lays down for a nap or in her car seat or swing.  </li>
            <li>My little girl has a rather big head, so i needed something that was fairly loose and comfortable for her.</li>
            <li>but I just use white or black when I can&#x27;t find one to match exactly.  </li>

The biggest disappointment is that I&#x27;ve had several of the bands easily become unwoven by simply adjusting them on my babys head during the day so then longer threads stick out on top of the band and it doesn&#x27;t look as cute at all! I dont know if they were cheaply made hence the good price but by the time you pay shipping the cost becomes more significant!  I just found that these were not as sturdy as other woven bands!</li>
            <li> My daughter looks adorable in these.  I wish there was a red one but I just use white or black when I can&#x27;t find one to match exactly.  I clip flowers or bows right to the bands.  They stay in her hair, which stands straight up on her 8 month old head, until she lays down for a nap or in her car seat or swing.

            <li> This is a great product at an amazing price! Received the items in perfect condition with colors exactly as shown. My 2.5 yr old daughter loves them and they fit her head perfectly! She is very small for her age so I assume these would work great for babies as well. I also tried them on my head just to test the stretch and they fit with no problem. My daughter has been wearing them and so far there does not appear to be any issue of stretching out or becoming loose. Great buy!</li>
            <li> These headbands are an awsome fit for any baby head size. My little girl has a rather big head, so i needed something that was fairly loose and comfortable for her.

            <li> My baby has a lot of hair and I was looking for something to keep her hair off her face that wouldn&#x27;t break or dry it out and that would also be safe.  The first thing I noticed about these headbands is that the package says something like &amp;#34;Warning:  Contains small chokable parts.  Not intended for children under 3.&amp;#34;  Granted, I don&#x27;t plan to put my baby to sleep in her crib with the headband on or leave her unsupervised with it.  But in my opinion, if you market your product for babies, you should not say its unsafe for children under 3.  Rather, you should make quality headband that is as safe as possible for babies.  The warning suggest to me that the makers know this headband can easily become unraveled (as other reviews have noted) and therefore be unsafe.  I would pay more for a higher quality, better made, safer product, but unfortunately have had trouble finding basic baby headbands that are soft and stay on my baby&#x27;s head.</li>

            <li> Love these and love the price. Just wish my daughter would wear them now. She pulls them off as soon as I put them on. But they are very stretchy and soft. Setting them aside for next year to see if she&#x27;ll keep them on then. Love the assortment of colors. Good price.</li>
            <li> These are a very good value and they are pretty and shimmery, much prettier than in the pictures. I do photos of rescue dogs for petfinder and these actually make very good decorative collars. Glue gun on some decorations such as flowers and such and the dogs look so pretty. Of course, I&#x27;m sure they look pretty on babies, too!</li>
            <li> i order these alot, u get a pastel pack, a bright pack and a neutral pack.  the only improvement they could offer would be a basic pack. ( red, yellow, royal blue, etc)</li>
            <li> These were perfect for my craft baby shower. Great price and great quality! I liked the assortment of color too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my newborn sized well holding up good colors are vibrant&lt;br /&gt;May buy some more of these for friends</li>
            <li> These headbands came very quickly and look great!  They did not have an odor to them.  They appeared to be able to fit a variety of head sizes.  I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> They arrived very quickly &amp; are exactly what I was looking for! They seem to be made very well &amp; are super stretchy! Thanks!</li>
