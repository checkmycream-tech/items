            <li>and they are amazing ....</li>
            <li>Each brush was in it&#x27;s own wrapper</li>
            <li>My customers were thrilled with their looks.</li>
            <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t labled and it doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of a pamphlet or instructions.  </li>
            <li>THEY ARE NICE QUALITY AND THE POUCH FOLDS NEATLY AND KEEPS THE BRUSHES IN PLACE</li>
            <li>, so I keep them in a drawer in their handy pouch.  </li>
            <li>Over all it was a good purchase:)</li>
            <li>Comes with many brushes, and the quality is good.</li>
            <li>This brushes are so beautiful big elegant just perfect</li>
            <li>They clean great</li>
            <li>Professional design, great deal!</li>
            <li>This set is a good, budget friendly buy.  </li>
            <li>However on the money I saved buying these brushes I was able to get apothecary jar and some rocks to keep them in, looks nice and keeps brushes safe.</li>
            <li>Great quality and was shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive these because of the good reviews, but these brushes are just ok.</li>
            <li>, she was absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more....</li>
            <li>Nice shave and light weight.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the eyeliner brush, it makes my gel eyeliner look</li>
            <li>Brushes are better than described.  </li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>They are ok makeup brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>I love the shadow brushes yet I have not been able to use them all yet.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Heather L.</li>
            <li>Thought item was much better made.  </li>
            <li>This is an ok product for someone just learning to apply makeup</li>
            <li>I HAVE FOUND I USE MOST OF THEM</li>
            <li>there is a great variety of brushes for everything you could possibly want to do makeup wise.</li>
            <li>I have worked with many brushes...</li>
            <li>I love Sigma brushes, but they are quite pricey.  </li>
            <li>love them.</li>
            <li>I liked the case though despite the fact that it had a cheap plastic lining thing..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve stayed soft and effective and I haven&#x27;t experienced the brushes loosing any hairs.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good brushes considering the price.</li>
            <li>They are soft and apply makeup evenly and with great texture.  </li>
            <li>been using them for months still going strong</li>
            <li>Everything is fine.</li>
            <li>The brushes are fine for my infrequent uses, but the pouch is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Thanks for send this in the time we agreed,it was what we were expecting for, i hope I can keep on doing deals with you, have a nice day.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great choice.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, and way cheaper than buying at MAC with similar quality.</li>
            <li>I enjoy having them</li>
            <li>This item was bought as a gift for a young ballet dancer who absolutely loved the brush set.</li>
            <li>However, as much money I have blew on brushes; I could of probably purchased four sets by now!!Way better then the ones on top of that.</li>
            <li>beautiful enough to display on the counter top in a large glass jar.  </li>
            <li>They are very rough and altnough it applies my powder eyeshadows well, maybe because I have good eyeshadows, but it kind of hurts when it touches my face.</li>
            <li>The brush quality itself is pretty good, and it&#x27;s very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Loving the price I payed for decent quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of Bobbi Brown brushes, and they&#x27;re nice, but for the price and quality of FASH brushes, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Overall amazing brushes!</li>
            <li>Seeing as it is just for my own personal use, I cannot see spending upwards of $100.00 or more on a brush set.</li>
            <li>I needed them for a 10 face party and a military ball formal event, both turned out great.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, and held pigment nicely.</li>
            <li>I love the style and really just everything about it.</li>
            <li>Nice, soft brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and soft but the solvent smell from the case was pretty strong.</li>
            <li>However, the case is a little cheap, but it works great.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a full set, and I finally got them for a great price.</li>
            <li>I think the good reviews on this are fake because the brushes are not that great.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend this set :)</li>
            <li>yes, it is pretty cheap</li>
            <li>I love my new brushes....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to control how much I put on.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I love my very soft.</li>
            <li>Have a good look but, not very well quaility.</li>
            <li>I received this brush set nearly two weeks ago and it looks so good that I&#x27;ve used but one brush so far.</li>
            <li>This set of brushes was an economical choice for a gift.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>the only reason I&#x27;m giving this set two stars is because they are soft, there are many and in good sizes, and SOME of these brushes are decent additions to my brush collection.</li>
            <li>they are ok brushes they are super soft but for me they kept shedding even after i washed them very gently but other than that they are pretty good</li>
            <li>they are very soft and they apply makeup very evenly throughout the whole entire makeup application very good</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working right now...</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is the faux leather portfolio has a very, very strong smell to it.</li>
            <li>The item itself is exactly what I was looking for and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for some really reasonable brushes for a reasonable price and these brushes are fantastic</li>
            <li>The price of the brushes was great deal but the brushes were not as soft as I had expected them.</li>
            <li>I recently recieved my brush set a few weeks ago and was very happy with what i got.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, the brushes were packaged very well and also made very, very well!</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are sturdy, soft and very pretty!</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the brushes.</li>
            <li>I love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li>Those aren&#x27;t used at all.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger brushes are ok, they shed quite a bit</li>
            <li>Shipped so fast!</li>
            <li>Overall its a fabulous deal!</li>
            <li>WHEN I FIRST RECEIVED THE MAKEUP BRUSH SET</li>
            <li>The hair did shed when i first took them out of the pack</li>
            <li>i love them and would definitely recommend them!!!</li>
            <li>Just remember to wash them first with shampoo</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t purchase this set for the case, and the giftee isn&#x27;t that interested in it either.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t be happier :) actually purchased 2 sets</li>
            <li>You can buy better brushes with about the same cost at a Walmart.</li>
            <li>At first I didnt know what to use the fan brush for</li>
            <li>I opened it up and the case it comes in is very well made, not flibsy at all, with magnetic closures.</li>
            <li>A lot better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They have made my life so much easier in putting my eyeshadow</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier, considering how much more money I could have spent.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much easier to work with.  </li>
            <li>Didnt have any issues with the handles falling off from washing them so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come across this set a few times and really liked the way it looked.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to open up the packaging!</li>
            <li>Other then that I love them, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li>Although I love the variation in brushes and sizes, they are just not worth it if you are looking for a ride or die set.</li>
            <li>You get alot more than you would expect for such a low price.</li>
            <li>The case is decent and the magnetic clasps work well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them for the price...</li>
            <li>I love the eyeliner brush so far, but I have not tried any of the other ones yet.</li>
            <li>but if you give a thorough cleaning before us, the smell should get a little better.</li>
            <li>Works really well, really soft &amp;&amp; doesnt shed.</li>
            <li>I am not a brush snob, normally buy Elf studio brushes but gave these a try.  </li>
            <li>The angled contour brush I cant live with out .</li>
            <li>being said, they are soft and work decently well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I love how they blend and don&#x27;t shed brush hairs all over my face, unlike other brushes i currently have.</li>
            <li>The brushes should be washed prior to first use.</li>
            <li>I only had fall out my first wash none since then.</li>
            <li>A slight odor on the brushes, I think from the ends being stained, wash them good with a brush cleanser (properly) and let them dry and the smell goes away.</li>
            <li>The coarseness of the brushes didn&#x27;t make them harder to use, or less effective.</li>
            <li>For this cheap I was expecting way less in this case you actually get a little more than what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I bought these as my backup to used, while my other brushes is waiting to be dry :)</li>
            <li>You can clear it up by leaving it out to vent</li>
            <li>I like this brush set a lot, this really does the work for eye makeup, not much the face brushes but for the price it really payoff..</li>
            <li>Fast delivery but low quality</li>
            <li>Soft and well put together ...</li>
            <li>The brushes appear to be soft but not overly so.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent..</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes are amazing they seriously are the only ones I use.</li>
            <li>I have not used all brushes however i use a few everyday and love them!</li>
            <li>Im am barely getting to write a review after having these brushes for about a year .</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that once you take of the gaudy plastic inside the brushes easily fall out.</li>
            <li>The white handles and black brush tips on this brush set are certainly eye-catching!</li>
            <li>Read some of the other reviews that said the brushes aren&#x27;t soft but mine are soft.</li>
            <li>The hair on the brushed are a littler hard but nothing worth complaining about.</li>
            <li>But the brushes are far too LONG!!!  </li>

            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> They are ok makeup brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the shadow brushes yet I have not been able to use them all yet.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Heather L.</li>
            <li> Thought item was much better made.  </li>
            <li> This is an ok product for someone just learning to apply makeup</li>
            <li> I HAVE FOUND I USE MOST OF THEM</li>
            <li> there is a great variety of brushes for everything you could possibly want to do makeup wise.</li>
            <li> I have worked with many brushes...</li>
            <li> I love Sigma brushes, but they are quite pricey.  </li>
            <li> love them.</li>
            <li> I liked the case though despite the fact that it had a cheap plastic lining thing..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve stayed soft and effective and I haven&#x27;t experienced the brushes loosing any hairs.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good brushes considering the price.</li>
            <li> They are soft and apply makeup evenly and with great texture.  </li>
            <li> been using them for months still going strong</li>
            <li> Everything is fine.</li>
            <li> The brushes are fine for my infrequent uses, but the pouch is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Thanks for send this in the time we agreed,it was what we were expecting for, i hope I can keep on doing deals with you, have a nice day.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great choice.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, and way cheaper than buying at MAC with similar quality.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having them</li>
            <li> This item was bought as a gift for a young ballet dancer who absolutely loved the brush set.</li>
            <li> However, as much money I have blew on brushes; I could of probably purchased four sets by now!!Way better then the ones on top of that.</li>
            <li> beautiful enough to display on the counter top in a large glass jar.  </li>
            <li> They are very rough and altnough it applies my powder eyeshadows well, maybe because I have good eyeshadows, but it kind of hurts when it touches my face.</li>
            <li> The brush quality itself is pretty good, and it&#x27;s very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> Loving the price I payed for decent quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of Bobbi Brown brushes, and they&#x27;re nice, but for the price and quality of FASH brushes, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Overall amazing brushes!</li>
            <li> Seeing as it is just for my own personal use, I cannot see spending upwards of $100.00 or more on a brush set.</li>
            <li> I needed them for a 10 face party and a military ball formal event, both turned out great.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, and held pigment nicely.</li>
            <li> I love the style and really just everything about it.</li>
            <li> Nice, soft brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft but the solvent smell from the case was pretty strong.</li>
            <li> However, the case is a little cheap, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a full set, and I finally got them for a great price.</li>
            <li> I think the good reviews on this are fake because the brushes are not that great.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend this set :)</li>
            <li> yes, it is pretty cheap</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to control how much I put on.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I love my very soft.</li>
            <li> Have a good look but, not very well quaility.</li>
            <li> I received this brush set nearly two weeks ago and it looks so good that I&#x27;ve used but one brush so far.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes was an economical choice for a gift.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> the only reason I&#x27;m giving this set two stars is because they are soft, there are many and in good sizes, and SOME of these brushes are decent additions to my brush collection.</li>
            <li> they are ok brushes they are super soft but for me they kept shedding even after i washed them very gently but other than that they are pretty good</li>
            <li> they are very soft and they apply makeup very evenly throughout the whole entire makeup application very good</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working right now...</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the faux leather portfolio has a very, very strong smell to it.</li>
            <li> The item itself is exactly what I was looking for and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some really reasonable brushes for a reasonable price and these brushes are fantastic</li>
            <li> The price of the brushes was great deal but the brushes were not as soft as I had expected them.</li>
            <li> I recently recieved my brush set a few weeks ago and was very happy with what i got.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the brushes were packaged very well and also made very, very well!</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are sturdy, soft and very pretty!</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the brushes.</li>
            <li> I love all the different sizes.</li>
            <li> Those aren&#x27;t used at all.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger brushes are ok, they shed quite a bit</li>
            <li> Shipped so fast!</li>
            <li> Overall its a fabulous deal!</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST RECEIVED THE MAKEUP BRUSH SET</li>
            <li> The hair did shed when i first took them out of the pack</li>
            <li> i love them and would definitely recommend them!!!</li>
            <li> Just remember to wash them first with shampoo</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t purchase this set for the case, and the giftee isn&#x27;t that interested in it either.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t be happier :) actually purchased 2 sets</li>
            <li> You can buy better brushes with about the same cost at a Walmart.</li>
            <li> At first I didnt know what to use the fan brush for</li>
            <li> I opened it up and the case it comes in is very well made, not flibsy at all, with magnetic closures.</li>
            <li> A lot better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They have made my life so much easier in putting my eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier, considering how much more money I could have spent.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much easier to work with.  </li>
            <li> Didnt have any issues with the handles falling off from washing them so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come across this set a few times and really liked the way it looked.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to open up the packaging!</li>
            <li> Other then that I love them, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> Although I love the variation in brushes and sizes, they are just not worth it if you are looking for a ride or die set.</li>
            <li> You get alot more than you would expect for such a low price.</li>
            <li> The case is decent and the magnetic clasps work well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them for the price...</li>
            <li> I love the eyeliner brush so far, but I have not tried any of the other ones yet.</li>
            <li> but if you give a thorough cleaning before us, the smell should get a little better.</li>
            <li> Works really well, really soft &amp;&amp; doesnt shed.</li>
            <li> I am not a brush snob, normally buy Elf studio brushes but gave these a try.  </li>
            <li> The angled contour brush I cant live with out .</li>
            <li> being said, they are soft and work decently well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I love how they blend and don&#x27;t shed brush hairs all over my face, unlike other brushes i currently have.</li>
            <li> The brushes should be washed prior to first use.</li>
            <li> I only had fall out my first wash none since then.</li>
            <li> A slight odor on the brushes, I think from the ends being stained, wash them good with a brush cleanser (properly) and let them dry and the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> The coarseness of the brushes didn&#x27;t make them harder to use, or less effective.</li>
            <li> For this cheap I was expecting way less in this case you actually get a little more than what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought these as my backup to used, while my other brushes is waiting to be dry :)</li>
            <li> You can clear it up by leaving it out to vent</li>
            <li> I like this brush set a lot, this really does the work for eye makeup, not much the face brushes but for the price it really payoff..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery but low quality</li>
            <li> Soft and well put together ...</li>
            <li> The brushes appear to be soft but not overly so.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent..</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are amazing they seriously are the only ones I use.</li>
            <li> I have not used all brushes however i use a few everyday and love them!</li>
            <li> Im am barely getting to write a review after having these brushes for about a year .</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that once you take of the gaudy plastic inside the brushes easily fall out.</li>
            <li> The white handles and black brush tips on this brush set are certainly eye-catching!</li>
            <li> Read some of the other reviews that said the brushes aren&#x27;t soft but mine are soft.</li>
            <li> The hair on the brushed are a littler hard but nothing worth complaining about.</li>
            <li> But the brushes are far too LONG!!!  </li>
            <li> BUT it is not made to last long..</li>
            <li> The brushes are not too firm nor too soft!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something new besides my basic ELF brushes, I usually just buy them whenever I am out and about at Walgreens or Drugstore.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so when I apply my powder my face feels itch for a little bit.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t amazing quality, but they aren&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only use the small brushes.</li>
            <li> some people like their brushes not to soft are not to stiff.</li>
            <li> then condition them let them air dry</li>
            <li> The only negative was a noticeable chemical smell emanating from the case but that dissipated after the case was removed from it&#x27;s protective plastic sheild and left open for a day or two.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of different types of brushes from other companies but these are the softest and prettiest!</li>
            <li> I only found myself using a few pieces from the set</li>
            <li> only a few strands.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice and soft but the odor it had was horrible, it smelled like harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have other brushes for my face.</li>
            <li> They apply make up on well and the brissles don&#x27;t fall out either like other brushes I have.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> but these brushes is not soft its stiff almost like a paint brush.</li>
            <li> smaller brushes are all EXTREMELY hard, even after washing them.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday, but my only complaint would be that the bristles are a little rough.</li>
            <li> They are so rough on the skin and shed all over, threw them out, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The brush&#x27;s themselves are a little course compared to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little softer, but I figured I&#x27;d still try them out.</li>
            <li> BUT, it does have a little funky smell</li>
            <li> As the purchaser, the only issue I had with the set was the rather weak plastic flap used on the interior of the brush case.</li>
            <li> I WAS INTIMIDATED BY THE NUMBER OF BRUSHES, BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS OF USING THEM</li>
            <li> The CASE however is irritating because whenever its turned upside down brushes come slipping out.</li>
            <li> These are my everyday brushes for the past year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that was in the product info.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a budget (and its common sense to always be on one)</li>
            <li> But alas, my bathroom is too small for that</li>
            <li> There just not a good product.</li>
            <li> At this price, I almost expected to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but it was nothing too dramatic ...</li>
            <li> But the overall package smelled so bad!!</li>
            <li> Brushes had a horrible smell and I deep cleaned them but could not get the smell out</li>
            <li> it comes with had to be thrown away due to the HORRIBLE smell of chemicals it had on it.</li>
            <li> The fan brush was bent awkwardly because the shaper was bent awkwardly.</li>
            <li> I am just mad</li>
            <li> These are awful, do not buy!  </li>
            <li> The bristles are cut horribly.</li>
            <li> , they just look terrible now.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brushes are so beautiful big elegant just perfect i recomend this to anyone good presentation just perfect!!!da best&lt;br /&gt;Se lo recomiendo a cualkiera buena presentacion estan grandes lindan te makillan bien k puedo decir lo mejor!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are really nice and soft but the odor it had was horrible, it smelled like harsh chemicals. ( the case and brushes) I had to wash them for the scent to go away, and they still somewhat smell.</li>
            <li> I saw a good deal and had to jump on it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the brushes were packaged very well and also made very, very well! I haven&#x27;t used them yet but can&#x27;t wait for the event I&#x27;m going to in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loved the fact these brushes are eco-friendly and are made from goat hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sturdy, soft and very pretty!</li>
            <li> the quality and quantity of the brushes for the price was a great investment. You get alot more than you would expect for such a low price. I bought this for my gf who does make-up art for online contests and haloween, she was absolutely in love with this product. My only complaint is that once you take of the gaudy plastic inside the brushes easily fall out. But all in all a great product of good brush quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Great quality for a great price! I would order them again! Very happy with these brushes. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more....</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes....I was kinda hesitant about purchasing them and I&#x27;m glad i did they work really good!</li>
            <li> The brushes are good. But the overall package smelled so bad!! It reeked of mothballs. And when you use the brushes the smell transferred to your skin.  We are attempting to wash the brushes and air them out as well as the package. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working right now...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a lower priced make up brush set. Seeing as it is just for my own personal use, I cannot see spending upwards of $100.00 or more on a brush set. So I&#x27;ve been searching on amazon. I&#x27;ve come across this set a few times and really liked the way it looked. So I decided to give it a try. I ordered them 2 days later. I was so excited to open up the packaging! I opened it up and the case it comes in is very well made, not flibsy at all, with magnetic closures. Each brush was in it&#x27;s own wrapper so I took off all of the wrappers and felt the quality of them. They aren&#x27;t amazing quality, but they aren&#x27;t bad either. The brush&#x27;s themselves are a little course compared to others I&#x27;ve used. I wish they were a little softer, but I figured I&#x27;d still try them out. I did a full face of makeup using these brushes and they worked great! The coarseness of the brushes didn&#x27;t make them harder to use, or less effective. Overall I am pleased with the brushes. For 12.99 you shouldn&#x27;t expect MAC quality brushes, but I think you will be happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft but the solvent smell from the case was pretty strong. You can clear it up by leaving it out to vent but it takes a while for it to dissipate.</li>
            <li> Product was awesome! A lot better than I expected. I have been looking for some really reasonable brushes for a reasonable price and these brushes are fantastic</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and for a beginner, these brushes are definitely good to start with. The only thing I do not like about it is that it sheds a lot. Even after I cleaned the brushes they were still shedding.</li>
            <li> This product was great! The brushes are soft, and held pigment nicely. However, the case is a little cheap, but it works great.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this inexpensive makeup brush set. I love the style and really just everything about it. BUT, it does have a little funky smell but if you give a thorough cleaning before us, the smell should get a little better.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great!  I was able to create some great looks effortlessly. I needed them for a 10 face party and a military ball formal event, both turned out great. My customers were thrilled with their looks.</li>
            <li> Good work . Everything is fine. No break.. Nice shave and light weight.  Great job!  My boy like it too.</li>
            <li> Professional design, great deal! I love it. Blends amazing</li>
            <li> These brushes dont have a good qualitity the hair falls out.There just not a good product.Have a good look but, not very well quaility.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and arrived on time. Very pleased with the product and the delivery time. The item itself is exactly what I was looking for and definitely worth the price. The brushes are not too firm nor too soft! One of my best purchases.</li>
            <li> I love all the different sizes. I use these everyday, but my only complaint would be that the bristles are a little rough. I have sensitive skin, so when I apply my powder my face feels itch for a little bit. Other then that I love them, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind at all. My favorite is the eyeliner brush, it makes my gel eyeliner look like I used liquid liner.</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast.  Brushes are better than described.  They are soft and apply makeup evenly and with great texture.  Love them.  Will definitely order from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for send this in the time we agreed,it was what we were expecting for, i hope I can keep on doing deals with you, have a nice day.</li>
            <li> They are ok makeup brushes for the price. I love the eyeliner brush so far, but I have not tried any of the other ones yet. I really wanted a full set, and I finally got them for a great price.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive these because of the good reviews, but these brushes are just ok. They are very rough and altnough it applies my powder eyeshadows well, maybe because I have good eyeshadows, but it kind of hurts when it touches my face. The plastic smell went away after awhile after I took them out of the plastic pouch. So far I&#x27;ve only use the small brushes. I have other brushes for my face. I think the good reviews on this are fake because the brushes are not that great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good starter set I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case it comes with had to be thrown away due to the HORRIBLE smell of chemicals it had on it. No amount of cleaning or airing it out helped.&lt;br /&gt;The smaller brushes are all EXTREMELY hard, even after washing them. Those aren&#x27;t used at all.&lt;br /&gt;The bigger brushes are ok, they shed quite a bit though.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again, or recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are awful, do not buy!  I am not a brush snob, normally buy Elf studio brushes but gave these a try.  They are so rough on the skin and shed all over, threw them out, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I like this brush set a lot, this really does the work for eye makeup, not much the face brushes but for the price it really payoff..</li>
            <li> The brush quality itself is pretty good, and it&#x27;s very well packaged.  There is a brush for EVERYTHING.  The problem is, I have no idea which brush to use for what.  The brushes aren&#x27;t labled and it doesn&#x27;t come with any kind of a pamphlet or instructions.  If it included that I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Shipped so fast! Loving the price I payed for decent quality brushes. I try to replace mine every 3-6 months just because of constant use. I&#x27;d buy these again and again!</li>
            <li> they are ok brushes they are super soft but for me they kept shedding even after i washed them very gently but other than that they are pretty good</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have not used all brushes however i use a few everyday and love them! The only thing is that the description indicated the folding case would have a velvet lining of which it did not. For the price and quality it is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Wow! I received my brushes yesterday and the packaging was beautiful and the products were even better than advertised. I have a lot of different types of brushes from other companies but these are the softest and prettiest! I love how they blend and don&#x27;t shed brush hairs all over my face, unlike other brushes i currently have. I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> This product arrived in specified time and as described.  The brushes should be washed prior to first use. I&#x27;m not sure that was in the product info. but the set comes w instructions for washing prior to use. I have had no issued w this set at all.</li>
            <li> I received this brush set nearly two weeks ago and it looks so good that I&#x27;ve used but one brush so far. I&#x27;ll get over it though.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes was an economical choice for a gift. The brush materials seem comparable to higher-end brushes. The only issue I have is the faux leather portfolio has a very, very strong smell to it. I will have to let this air out before it&#x27;s usable. Overall, a great choice.</li>
            <li> I loveeee these brushes ! They apply make up on well and the brissles don&#x27;t fall out either like other brushes I have. Overall ill definitely be buying from them again :)</li>
            <li> All shapes and sizes, lots of them.  Very nice brushes!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery but low quality</li>
            <li> Look @ what you pay for &amp; the result will not be as what you would like it to be. yes, it is pretty cheap but these brushes is not soft its stiff almost like a paint brush. also it depends on what you like. some people like their brushes not to soft are not to stiff. Personally, I love my very soft. I bought these as my backup to used, while my other brushes is waiting to be dry :)</li>
            <li> Great product! For this cheap I was expecting way less in this case you actually get a little more than what you pay for. Overall its a fabulous deal!</li>
            <li> I love the shadow brushes yet I have not been able to use them all yet. They have made my life so much easier in putting my eyeshadow on.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Heather L.</li>
            <li> Low quality;  Brush ends actually fell off of wooden handle as I opened the package.  Thought item was much better made.  HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> This is an ok product for someone just learning to apply makeup BUT it is not made to last long..I only found myself using a few pieces from the set</li>
            <li> The price of the brushes was great deal but the brushes were not as soft as I had expected them.</li>
            <li> Brushes had a horrible smell and I deep cleaned them but could not get the smell out and they shed!! Do not recommend them.. Had to throw them out!</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST RECEIVED THE MAKEUP BRUSH SET I WAS INTIMIDATED BY THE NUMBER OF BRUSHES, BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS OF USING THEM I HAVE FOUND I USE MOST OF THEM EVERY TIME I PUT ON MY MAKEUP. THEY ARE NICE QUALITY AND THE POUCH FOLDS NEATLY AND KEEPS THE BRUSHES IN PLACE</li>
            <li> At this price, I almost expected to be disappointed.  But I&#x27;m not.  These brushes are so beautiful...beautiful enough to display on the counter top in a large glass jar.  But alas, my bathroom is too small for that, so I keep them in a drawer in their handy pouch.  The brushes blend my makeup very nicely.  It&#x27;s easy to control how much I put on.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier, considering how much more money I could have spent.  I have a couple of Bobbi Brown brushes, and they&#x27;re nice, but for the price and quality of FASH brushes, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, and way cheaper than buying at MAC with similar quality. Would recommend to any of my friends looking for a discount set of brushes that are quality.</li>
            <li> Nice, soft brushes. Read some of the other reviews that said the brushes aren&#x27;t soft but mine are soft. Don&#x27;t like the smell from when you open the case.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good brushes considering the price. The hair on the brushed are a littler hard but nothing worth complaining about. The hair did shed when i first took them out of the pack but it was nothing too dramatic ... only a few strands. Over all it was a good purchase:)</li>
            <li> I recently recieved my brush set a few weeks ago and was very happy with what i got. Highly reccomend this set :) Works really well, really soft &amp;&amp; doesnt shed.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes a while ago and i could not be happier. they are beautiful and dont shed at all (which i was worried about). there is a great variety of brushes for everything you could possibly want to do makeup wise. i love them and would definitely recommend them!!!</li>
            <li> they are very soft and they apply makeup very evenly throughout the whole entire makeup application very good I enjoy having them</li>
            <li> The brushes are fine for my infrequent uses, but the pouch is cheaply made. I am very happy I did not pay full price.</li>
            <li> Although I love the variation in brushes and sizes, they are just not worth it if you are looking for a ride or die set. The hairs in the larger brushes fall out every time I use them and the &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; pouch they came in smells.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, they are soft and work decently well.&lt;br /&gt;I use the some of the smaller brushes and a couple of the larger brushes for blush and bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;But the only reason I&#x27;m giving this set two stars is because they are soft, there are many and in good sizes, and SOME of these brushes are decent additions to my brush collection. I would never depend on these as my essential set.</li>
            <li> I have 3 teenage girls and I got them this for Christmas. Perfect!! I am just mad I didn&#x27;t get one for myself. Great quality and was shipped very fast. Worth the money and I would tell anyone to buy this product. They clean great</li>
            <li> I went to beauty school and I am a licensed cosmetologist.. I have worked with many brushes...These are not MAC but they are great brushes.. Soft and well put together ...Just remember to wash them first with shampoo then condition them let them air dry and they are amazing ....I would highly recommend them for the price...Well worth the money spent..</li>
            <li> This item was bought as a gift for a young ballet dancer who absolutely loved the brush set. As the purchaser, the only issue I had with the set was the rather weak plastic flap used on the interior of the brush case. However, I didn&#x27;t purchase this set for the case, and the giftee isn&#x27;t that interested in it either. We&#x27;re in it for the brushes, which she loves!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something new besides my basic ELF brushes, I usually just buy them whenever I am out and about at Walgreens or Drugstore. However, as much money I have blew on brushes; I could of probably purchased four sets by now!!Way better then the ones on top of that.So I came and looked on Amazon to find the perfect set to create the perfect face. I was impressed how quickly it arrived in the mail.The case fits perfectly for the brushes. All the brushes have protectors.Very impressed and probably will order another one for christmas or maybe before. I just got my set this week and have not played yet</li>
            <li> This set is a good, budget friendly buy.  Comes with many brushes, and the quality is good. I love Sigma brushes, but they are quite pricey.  This set is priced so well that you can buy another one when they wear out without dreading the cost.</li>
            <li> love them. couldn&#x27;t be happier :) actually purchased 2 sets I was so happy with them</li>
            <li> been using them for months still going strong</li>
            <li> The bristles are cut horribly. I had to cut them to make them useable. The fan brush was bent awkwardly because the shaper was bent awkwardly. I liked the case though despite the fact that it had a cheap plastic lining thing.. Meh. Just pass on it. It isn&#x27;t worth it. You can buy better brushes with about the same cost at a Walmart.</li>
            <li> good.  But the brushes are far too LONG!!!  I cant get up close to the mirror so I broke one in two and it&#x27;s much easier to work with.  I wished I realized this before purchase but the shortened brushes are good, they just look terrible now.</li>
            <li> Im am barely getting to write a review after having these brushes for about a year . Even after a year i can tell you that I love them! They quality is great .I wash them once a week and they still feel great.The eyeshadow brushes are amazing they seriously are the only ones I use. At first I didnt know what to use the fan brush for but I found it works great for highlight on the cheek bones. The angled contour brush I cant live with out . Overall amazing brushes! These are my everyday brushes for the past year I only had fall out my first wash none since then. Didnt have any issues with the handles falling off from washing them so much. Great quality!</li>
            <li> The white handles and black brush tips on this brush set are certainly eye-catching! It looks much more expensive than it actually is. The brushes appear to be well made. Since this was purchased as a stocking stuffer, I couldn&#x27;t actually use the brushes but I did tug on the bristles and did not get any &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34;. The brushes appear to be soft but not overly so. The case is decent and the magnetic clasps work well. The only negative was a noticeable chemical smell emanating from the case but that dissipated after the case was removed from it&#x27;s protective plastic sheild and left open for a day or two.</li>
            <li> So I have been using these brushes for a month or so now. The brushes are good for the money, these aren&#x27;t MAC brushes- but the price tells you that. A slight odor on the brushes, I think from the ends being stained, wash them good with a brush cleanser (properly) and let them dry and the smell goes away. They&#x27;ve stayed soft and effective and I haven&#x27;t experienced the brushes loosing any hairs. The CASE however is irritating because whenever its turned upside down brushes come slipping out. However on the money I saved buying these brushes I was able to get apothecary jar and some rocks to keep them in, looks nice and keeps brushes safe. If you&#x27;re on a budget (and its common sense to always be on one) I recommend.</li>
