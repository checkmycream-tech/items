            <li>I normally buy</li>
            <li>Given that it does not perform it&#x27;s primary function there is not a price low enough for me to buy it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent reminds me of an old guy instead of a powdery-fresh one.</li>
            <li>But a very small amount works better and doesn&#x27;t get itchy.</li>

            <li> But a very small amount works better and doesn&#x27;t get itchy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t how long ago it has been since I bought the 4-pack, but it&#x27;s a long time</li>
            <li> I was desperate to get it online because it works better than other brands.</li>
            <li> The reason I say that is because out of necessity I only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brands I do not get stains in my shirts from it either.</li>
            <li> And (unlike some other brands) it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin when I put it on and cause me to rash-up.</li>
            <li> and I just opened the second one lately.</li>
            <li> I only let a very small amount of the gel to peek out of the little holes.</li>
            <li> If I were to stay in the house all weekend without taking a shower I would have little to no body odor from my arm pits.</li>
            <li> One of the deodorants was leaking a little and got the rest dirty, but maybe international shipping was too hard on them.  </li>
            <li> It is a stick and the scent is too strong and smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find the gel anymore.  </li>
            <li> He was having a hard time finding this in the stores.....</li>
            <li> you stink no matter how hard your working.</li>
            <li> I found that if I put it on thick, my underarm itches and I can&#x27;t stop</li>
            <li> I have been an Amazon customer for a long time and have never had a bad experience until now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white stick.  :-(</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when the picture of the product did not contain the word &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, but since the description said &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, I decided to give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> No sticky, gummy residue that is difficult to wash off.  </li>

            <li> This works great as far as smell, how ever I rate it low because it left yellow stains on my dress shirts. I highly advice wearing a good undershirt.</li>
            <li> Got this with Subscribe and Save.  My husband is pleased with it and I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of deodorant for him...which makes my life simpler.  :o)</li>
            <li> This is not Gel.  That is the way it is described.  It is hard to find the gel anymore.  This is just the speed stick.  You need to correct the decription.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, as discribed</li>
            <li> Looks like some people did get the gel.... but I didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a white stick.  :-(</li>
            <li> I ordered the ones that come in &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; bot bar.&lt;br /&gt;The scent reminds me of an old guy instead of a powdery-fresh one.</li>
            <li> dont need for jan 1 2016 he got all he needs right now thank you</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find these on the selves anymore and I will probably stock up on these.  This is the best antiperspirant/deodorant on the market for me.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the gel as pictured or described.</li>
            <li> It what I wanted and they are fine.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was listed as a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; which I have always liked but is hard to find in stores now.  IT IS NOT A GEL. It is a stick and the scent is too strong and smells horrible.  I was skeptical when the picture of the product did not contain the word &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, but since the description said &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, I decided to give it a chance.  I have been an Amazon customer for a long time and have never had a bad experience until now.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t gel, ordered 3 6pks of the gel and what was received was 2 6pks of the sport solid, and 1 6pk of the unscented solid.</li>
            <li> If this is the GEL, I think it&#x27;s the most inexpensive deodorant/antiperspirant I have ever used. The reason I say that is because out of necessity I only use a small amount. I only let a very small amount of the gel to peek out of the little holes. As long as there is enough that it barely will spread around. I found that if I put it on thick, my underarm itches and I can&#x27;t stop and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m trying to scrape it off. But a very small amount works better and doesn&#x27;t get itchy. I don&#x27;t how long ago it has been since I bought the 4-pack, but it&#x27;s a long time and I just opened the second one lately.</li>
            <li> I order the speed stick gel online because, at the time it was not found in stores. I have since found it at my local store. They have added the word Gear to the name. I do not know why but during that change it was not at stores. I was desperate to get it online because it works better than other brands. Unlike other brands I do not get stains in my shirts from it either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Speedstick Gel for years and been extremely happy. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this particular kind and I&#x27;m disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Speedstick Gel I normally buy seems to last forever. If I were to stay in the house all weekend without taking a shower I would have little to no body odor from my arm pits. This stuff doesn&#x27;t even seem to last a full day. At the end of the day when I get home I can smell body odor from my arm pits. I dare not go without a shower for a day or two using this stuff because by the following morning the body odor is almost unbearable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was really cheap when I bought it, so I thought I would give it a try. I will not buy it again because it does not work as an antiperspirant for me. It has the same affect for me as if I use my deodorant that does not act as an antiperspirant. Given that it does not perform it&#x27;s primary function there is not a price low enough for me to buy it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite.  This is the gel style.  He likes speed stick brand the best.  Easy to order from amazon.</li>
            <li> i love speed  I love Mennen speed stick  I  have bin  using it for about  16 years  thank  you for the fast shipping  Floyd Dockery  papadock</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. Always keeps me nice and cool and smelling good.  Was shipped and arrived intact with all ok.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Received product as advertised, super fast shipping, and a great price.  I love this stuff and cant find it in the stores anymore so now I have a \\&quot;lifetime\\&quot; supply and am a happy camper.  I highly recommend this seller and this product.</li>
            <li> This image shoes gel based deodorant, but when it arrived it was solid style sticks!  Agh!</li>
            <li> One of the deodorants was leaking a little and got the rest dirty, but maybe international shipping was too hard on them.  Otherwise exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> I am an Indian male - enough said - and this is the only deodorant that works for me and actually lasts.  In fact  I feel like I could probably go four days in a zombie apocalypse wearing this stuff and still smell good.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant couldn&#x27;t find locally so looked on Amazon, great to know I can still get.</li>
            <li> I love this line of deodorant. It last along time and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;love the price!</li>
            <li> Always arrives on time, and with no issues.  It is my preferred deodorant.</li>
            <li> Continues to be effective for me after several years.  And (unlike some other brands) it doesn&#x27;t burn my skin when I put it on and cause me to rash-up.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy anything else. This is the best</li>
            <li> The gel is a great product.  No sticky, gummy residue that is difficult to wash off.  I returned the product as it was the STICK and not the GEL as advertised.  Not the products fault.</li>
            <li> This works the best for me. I have tried &#x27;em all...and this one works well. I like getting them by subscribe and save because I know there will always be one waiting for me.</li>
            <li> He was having a hard time finding this in the stores.....so buying several at one time at a good price....happy, happy, happy</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to stink. This stuff work great wither your going to work, out on a date, or a booty call from a friend with benefits. This stuff won&#x27;t et you stink no matter how hard your working.</li>
