            <li>This blue was too light for me, I prefer a deeper shade, and it wasn&#x27;t close to as dark as the photo showed.  </li>

            <li> I received the wrong shade, the labeling is corret but the color is not. The polish is suposed to be more of a Tiffany color; I get it on my nails at my local salon and they were different.

I do like the color, I&#x27;m just disappointed that I was sent the wrong product.</li>
