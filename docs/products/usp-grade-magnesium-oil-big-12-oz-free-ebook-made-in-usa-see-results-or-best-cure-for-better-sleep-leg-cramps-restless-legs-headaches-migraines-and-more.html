            <li>Update - Been using this for over 2 months and still having great results for sleep.</li>
            <li>May not work for everyone but our experience has been great.</li>
            <li>I have been spraying it on my torso and haven&#x27;t experienced the burning as described by others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It worked great</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll just say, in my opinion, it&#x27;s great for joints and teeth.</li>
            <li>I purchased the oil after reading some great reviews about helping with restless leg syndrome.</li>
            <li>Great for all aches and pains.  </li>
            <li>The product works great.</li>
            <li>but I experienced none.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>, this has relieved it , I&#x27;m really happy to have found it.</li>
            <li>Works great....</li>
            <li>, it works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you are looking for a way to get skin moisture and get magnesium;</li>
            <li>and I think Seven Minerals has a great quality product and price for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is a great way to get the Magnesium I needed to lessen leg and foot cramps.  </li>
            <li>My sleep is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>It’s amazing!</li>
            <li>So many wonderful uses.</li>
            <li>My doctor [who is very wonderful] is glad</li>
            <li>loving it!</li>
            <li>felt pleasant, cooling sensation upon spraying on soles of my feet.</li>
            <li>A great product for relieving muscle pain or headaches and I love it!</li>
            <li>You would think that I would have seen some good from it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have nothing good to say about it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilbur Ginn</li>
            <li>Loved this product.</li>
            <li>I hear magnesium oil also good for insomniacs and foot fungus</li>
            <li>Using it in good faith.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product and think anyone with a magnesium deficiency would like it.  </li>
            <li>I am continuing to use it anyway because I want to maintain good levels.</li>
            <li>But I had never tried magnesium oil on my skin before, even though I had heard good things about</li>
            <li>In some ways, I find this product to be superior to the Ancient Minerals brand that I&#x27;m accustomed to.  </li>
            <li>Which that part is good of course.</li>
            <li>It makes him itchy but if he rubs it in really good for about 5 min</li>
            <li>but this seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li>You may want to use a good moisturizer along with the spray.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Very VERY pleased with the result.  </li>

            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>Seriously Amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled</li>
            <li>To be honest with you, I did not have any pain, however I have all the possibilities listed that could happen.</li>
            <li>I REALY liked it  </li>
            <li>I received a bottle from the manufacturer in exchange of an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome oil works really well</li>
            <li>Oil is a nice consistency and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t honestly state it if helps improve the sore muscles, but my issues have been chronic for 10-years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems to be effective against muscle aches and spasms when rubbed into the affected area.</li>
            <li>Nice oil for magnesium supplement.</li>
            <li>But effective and I tossed my toxic antiperspirant along with the toxic laxatives.</li>
            <li>Reading more research, I found magnesium oil was good for the gums.</li>
            <li>When wrote a message to a member of this company with some questions regarding the product, she was so kind and helpful in answering.  </li>
            <li>I appreciated the follow up email with tips on how to use the product for best results.</li>
            <li>I have been using Magnesium oil for over a month now, and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>I never thought it would work, but I was offered this product to review and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It seems to work best after a hot shower, as that’s when my skin was the softest and most absorbent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>works great at helping me go right to sleep and sleep well!</li>
            <li>I will buy this again for certain, it&#x27;s wonderful! :)</li>
            <li>The product is good quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The product itself shipped quickly and came attractively packaged.</li>
            <li>Used hand-in-hand with a good moisturizer, this is a wonderful supplment to add to your daily health regime.</li>
            <li>Pretty good investment!  </li>
            <li>Pretty good investment!  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure if its that or the magnesium oil that&#x27;s helping me feel better!</li>
            <li>I love this product and all the important information that you receive via email!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a plastic bottle with a good sprayer that works well to deliver a fine mist of the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This spray is a nice way to get more.</li>
            <li>I have just started using this product but so far I am impressed .</li>
            <li>Great success with preventing foot cramps.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent natural solution to joint and muscle pain, a chronic thing for me.</li>
            <li>as They indicated: it does leave a very fine salt residue.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>It feels good, clean, and tingly in the mouth.</li>
            <li>It feels good, clean, and tingly in the mouth.</li>
            <li>And it was delivered fast, packaged beautifully.</li>
            <li>Super good.</li>
            <li>It is amazing what this and good quality water and eating smart can do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to try that one to see if it works better for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that I am sleeping better since I have started using it.</li>
            <li>Plus I noticed that I started to sleep better too.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I received a free sample product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I was able to confidently use the product knowing that it was both safe and &amp;#34;theoretically&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using another product that is ok, but it takes a while to work.</li>
            <li>Been using for about a week and seems to be helping me sleep better.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why so many others say it work so well for them.</li>
            <li>If she remembered to take the magnesium oil, she felt a lot better, if she forgot to put it on, then she would be up with pain.</li>
            <li>Way more absorbable than pill form.</li>
            <li>Magnesium tables have helped but then I end up taking ibuprofen to get more relief and sleep</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to try it.nd 8 weeks (at this rate).  </li>
            <li>So glad I was able to try it.</li>
            <li>Love it and will keep buying this</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t see the hole any more.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me with a more restful sleep, as well as muscle tension in some areas.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>and it does make me feel better.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to take more pills and that&#x27;s why I bought this</li>
            <li>have a thyroid condition and many of the side effects I was attributing to thyroid</li>
            <li>Interesting, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to purchasing this product I was craving and eating pumpkin seeds for the magnesium.  </li>
            <li>I still love pumpkin seeds, but I do not crave them anymore.  </li>
            <li>Really love this product.</li>
            <li>this product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>i absolutely Love spraying this on my skin, and leaving it on.</li>
            <li>:))</li>
            <li>In fairness, this company seems legit and maybe i was applying it with too many sprays?</li>
            <li>Play better golf.</li>
            <li>Make sure you dilute before you use ..</li>
            <li>This has helped so much more than anything else,even what doctor&#x27;s prescribed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Magnesium is one of the many snake oils out there.  </li>
            <li>If you need something to convince you that you&#x27;ve gotten better, placebo can help.  </li>
            <li>Continued use of these can cause you to not be able to go number two without adding laxatives (like magnesium salts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Through the skin, your body is much more selective.  </li>
            <li>* Pour into your favorite spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even at freezing, it should hold more than 5oz MgCl per 10oz water.  </li>
            <li>* Pour into your favorite spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>Even at freezing, it should hold more than 5oz MgCl per 10oz water.  </li>
            <li>so maybe my magnesium levels are ok (?).</li>
            <li>So you see I cant say  for sure its the oil or the therapy, but</li>
            <li>im glad to have bought the oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been putting it on the bottom of my feet at night, most nights, for a bit now.</li>
            <li>This morning she brought me the bottle and asked to have more put on because it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li>Sip rise benefit...helps me sleep better.</li>
            <li>I wanted the most bio-available way to get magnesium in my system.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it and it does help me sleep better, eases muscle pain.  </li>
            <li>Love how it makes me feel -&lt;br /&gt;helps</li>
            <li>More than anything I purchased it to help with my migraines.</li>
            <li>If you google &amp;#34;How to use magnesium oil by Dr. Sircus,&amp;#34; there are many helpful suggestions and further explanation about best usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After taking 1,500 mg per day, the latest discovery is that my &amp;#34;output&amp;#34; has no odor.</li>

            <li>I am using this to help me sleep better.  </li>
            <li>I feel more energetic thru out the day.  </li>
            <li>I love this magnesium oil.</li>
            <li>I love the information that came with it as well.</li>
            <li>this is so fantastic!</li>
            <li>There are just too many variables when it comes to digestion and sleeping like better exercise or a better diet.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic  product and I&#x27;m so grateful to have it!</li>
            <li>, my mood is more stable.</li>
            <li>but this seems to be a  much better delivery  </li>
            <li>I am sure I did not get it in my mouth-</li>
            <li>feel like it has increased my energy somewhat, but mostly it has helped my sleep.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve slept much better and for longer periods of time since I started using this.  </li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve been using this I am often sleeping 5 or more hours at once.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this oil.</li>
            <li>Even with all that, I slept better than I have in years.  </li>
            <li>Im glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>I Love it, i spray it on my feet, i have chronic pain all over my body</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>it does work. :)</li>
            <li>results have been interesting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Magnesium oil is not an oil, it is more of a brine.</li>
            <li>Most of the pain was gone within 30 – 60 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>so I put more oil on it and</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sleeping way better</li>
            <li>I even made enough for daughter and friend with excellent results!</li>
            <li>It does not seem to have helped her sleep (yet) but that doesn&#x27;t matter much, as she is quite happy not having the pain in her legs.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, she has not had a migraine since she started using it.</li>
            <li>Applying it morning and night, according to instructions, makes your muscles relax and life becomes much more tolerable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;Magnesium Oil&amp;#34;, in nice spritz bottle, with a clean looking label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tells you for best results, let it air dry.</li>
            <li>more so, though, it has a huge effect on my tendons, joints, muscles.</li>
            <li>So far my husband and I are pretty impressed with this.</li>
            <li>The product was great, I give 5 stars for how professional the selling organization was.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll find magnesium oil in use at many spas around the world, and it is now readily available for the consumer.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily</li>
            <li>Easy to use...no foot or leg cramps as of yet.</li>
            <li>Great, second bottle purchased, has helped relieved pain from my legs and feet and my nails never looked better.</li>
            <li>The itchiness was so strong</li>
            <li>Too strong ...</li>
            <li>Very light oil, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have read the other reviews and if you don&#x27;t feel like going through the process of making your own, this is worth the money, it is very good.</li>
            <li>(which makes sense, as it has to be fine, to be suspended in liquid) -</li>
            <li>The oil is light and easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>The next day, she said her legs felt pretty good!!!</li>
            <li>I bought it when I was pregnant because it supposedly absorbs better than in pill form.</li>
            <li>product is very nice, clean, and professional looking.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s huge.  </li>
            <li>First&lt;br /&gt;dose of the Ionic Magnesium made a huge difference with that problem within 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>so I could leave an accurate one.</li>
            <li>This is a great option for getting extra magnesium.</li>
            <li>After using it every night for 2 weeks, i was pain free.</li>
            <li>Sleep is not perfect...yet, but it is greatly improved in the two weeks I have been rubbing it into the sole of my feet before going to sleep.  </li>
            <li>With all of that detailed information, I knew what to expect if anything happened at all.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great it works and is used daily by my family.</li>
            <li>Great product for a terrific price!</li>
            <li>it seems to itch a bit, but once it dries, I lightly smooth over it with water to remove the remaining salt.  </li>
            <li>This is a great way to get magnesium topically!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT, this is ready to go, and looks nice.  </li>

            <li>The product reviewed was provided as a free sample.</li>
            <li>Subjectively speaking, I feel that the Seven Minerals brand is more easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>and i am stink free for up to 48hrs</li>
            <li>I was provided a free sample of this product for review.</li>
            <li>Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price is great, especially for the size!!</li>
            <li>and I have slept sound .</li>
            <li>It tells you just how  magnesium plays an important part in your body.</li>
            <li>and I am literally blown away at how great this product actually DOES work</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>The info is what the consumer is interested in not all the advertising!!</li>
            <li>, SO WORTH THE MONEY !</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed any significant differences in how I feel.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>After washing it off my feet felt silky and sparkly clean.</li>
            <li>for my personal experience, I have been sleeping well and feeling pretty good after using it, but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it was because of this magnesium oil.</li>
            <li>One of the latest health crazes is Pure Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li>Never had a problem with full strength on bottoms of feet.</li>
            <li>I do a good deal of exercise, and use this either after sport, or the next morning if my muscles are sore.</li>
            <li>Excess magnesium ingested can lead to diarrhea, so some people do better by absorbing it through the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>* Cover, and allow to cool to room temperature</li>
            <li>* Cover, and allow to cool to room temperature</li>
            <li>but I can see a true difference in my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>This review will be easy because it did exactly as it said.</li>
            <li>I went easy on it the first 2 days diluting it since all the comments about itchiness</li>
            <li>This oil is like a dry oil it does not leave a oily residue which is nice!</li>
            <li>I must admit that I have not used it all over , but did rub it on my feet and experienced no itching or other discomfort.</li>
            <li>I SLEPT LIKE A BABY LAST NIGHT AFTER I SHOWERED AND MESSAGED MY ENTIRE BODY WITH THIS OIL, WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>The oil was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>The oil comes in a spray-on format and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>After one month, I have noticed some mild relief with the joint pain.</li>
            <li>The product arrived more quickly than expected, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Many people have a magnesium deficiency and don’t realize this and many symptom, like from stress, are the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a big bottle and has no scent or color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free sample for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Where I am boasting about this oil is I have had a back ache in which I pulled some muscles in my back and in that respect this oil is great!</li>
            <li>You also want to make sure you have a high quality</li>
            <li>I was curious, so I did some research on it and apparently it has a bunch of health benefits, with the most notable ones being better sleep, stress relief, and better digestion.</li>
            <li>but apparently those aren’t as effective.</li>
            <li>I have difficulty sleeping for more than an hour or two at a time normally,</li>
            <li>which (I think) means that Im getting to a more normal level of mag.  </li>
            <li>The oil is very fine and not heavy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and HIGHLY recommended for reducing exterior bodily aches and pains.</li>
            <li>I live in Alberta and our autumns, winters, and springs bring Chinook winds and changes in barometric pressure, thus causing migraines among many residents.</li>
            <li>but my back feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, my very sensitive skin didn&#x27;t itch, I was able to apply some on my legs, without tingling sensations...</li>
            <li>REALLY!!</li>
            <li>Not to mention you  definitely  get  more for your  money  with this  company!</li>
            <li>I will say it was almost instant, which was amazing.</li>
            <li>The magnesium oil is prickly after application which goes away after a period of time as absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The people that make this oil have assured me that the magnesium is absorbed in 20 min</li>
            <li>So far pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>Since most people are mg deficient i think this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s slippery and can be fun to play with in your hands.  </li>
            <li>I bathe in epsom salts frequently and being able to apply magnesium in oil form is awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The company actually contacted me to follow up and see how I liked it.</li>
            <li>It hadn&#x27;t helped the muscle spasms (and I was also taking the liquid Ionic magnesium  - tremendously effective but for different reasons).&lt;br /&gt;The company sent me this magnesium oil (but not in exchange for a review).</li>
            <li>worth.</li>
            <li>Thus far I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good for minor muscle aches too.</li>
            <li>It worked with no crazy itching.</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;ve rarely seen improvements from magnesium pills.  </li>
            <li>I had a rare reaction to it ...</li>
            <li>The first night was super itchy/tingly.  </li>
            <li>I have mild fibromyalgia and this really helps!</li>
            <li>It evidently holds down bacteria very effectively.</li>
            <li>This was a suggestion from a friend in another country and so far I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve tried it, looking forward for its full potential :)</li>
            <li>I also used it under my armpits right after the shower; yeah it itched a lot in the beginning</li>
            <li>Now regarding the PMS - guys, you can quit reading right now, this is all you need to know.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now regarding the PMS - guys, you can quit reading right now, this is all you need to know.  </li>
            <li>I have been rubbing on the bottom of my feet right before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Now, I spray the stuff, full strength, onto my sore arm muscle, my sore feet, have a back rubs with it and more</li>
            <li>If this works consistently, it will be well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I seem to generally feel better.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to use instead of using harsh chemical laden deodorant and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>first night ALL of it absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>I have both the full strength version and the aloe version and like them both, although I use the full strength version more often as the itchiness is minimal.</li>
            <li>Down sides: I haven&#x27;t found a good spot to do the spraying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be effective, Magnesium oil must be as pure as possible.</li>
            <li>But I am known for tolerating a certain amount of torture for the sake of health - or beauty!.  </li>
            <li>taking this product, I put one spritz on both sides of my feet, on top and under my knees, on my lower back, and on my shoulder/neck areas and then waited for it to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>your medical doctor diagnoses you with a magnesium deficiency, then this product would be a great way to supplement, especially if you don&#x27;t tolerate eating pills</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eaten, Magnesium Lactate, Aspartate, Citrate, and similar organic salts are more readily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>did find I needed to use it in the evening, because the first time I used it in the morning and afternoon</li>
            <li>DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything I read about this product did exactly what it said so</li>
            <li>is my first time trying magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li>The first time I sprayed my legs, focusing on my knees, and feet.  </li>
            <li>I have also used it on my feet when they were cramping from dehydration and it helped really fast!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Magnesium Oil after reading loads of articles and books on the importance of this mineral.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>You might be able to get it in bulk locally.  </li>

            <li>how many of us have low levels.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s also much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I have taken liquid calcium with magnesium for several years, but evidently needed more magnesium.</li>
            <li>So the problem I was at first trying to address ended up changing my life.</li>
            <li>So the problem I was at first trying to address ended up changing my life.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I will get back to say more</li>
            <li>yes i do believe I feel more consistent energy;  as per the internet site I read i am using topical iodine as well as magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>It was very helpful!</li>
            <li>Really helps you relax at night!</li>
            <li>Arrived fast!</li>
            <li>I haven’t experienced any negative side effects since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>It is exactly as they describe and they give tips on how to use it.</li>
            <li>The first time I sprayed it on it felt like it was burning</li>
            <li>This is the  first  time I  used  this  product  </li>
            <li>really well!  </li>
            <li>If you are low on magnesium, and most of us are, you need this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I could taste magnesium.  </li>
            <li>Product is a exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have a TON more energy, and just overall feel</li>
            <li>I just overall feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>Overall I feel better too.</li>
            <li>Helped my husband&#x27;s restless legs first time he used it.</li>
            <li>This oil really helps when my leg muscles start to hurt!</li>
            <li>I will say the first 3-4 times I used this</li>
            <li>The first night we got it, I massaged it on the bottom of her feet and around her knees and calves.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m loving the magnesium oil, easy to use just spray it on every night, I got it for health reasons a lot of food loses magnesium in the processing</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;ll comment that this particular bottle is clear, easy to use, and has no offensive</li>
            <li>I use it on myself and my patients in my holistic health practice with positive results.</li>
            <li>They seem to settle down more quickly.</li>
            <li>It burns at first but really helps a lot.</li>
            <li>In addition, the residue on my feet and ankles caused my bare feet to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on smooth flooring...made them skid proof?</li>
            <li>First off I would really like to say that you shipped this promptly</li>
            <li>Sprays on easy, dries almost instantly, and leaves no oily residue!  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin so the itchiness was tremendous in the beginning.  </li>
            <li>Oil is odorless and makes my skin feel super soft.</li>
            <li>can do sometimes with a body spray if the skin is a bit red or irritated, but it does subside very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Pure Magnesium Oil is  hidden treasure,  this is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>so I agree to try out Seven Minerals Pure Magnesium Oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a large bottle of magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li>If you leave it, it&#x27;s a very fine, white powder, and it will eventually come off on its own, or slowly soak over the day, or come off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next time I sprayed the magnesium oil, I rubbed it in quickly and then used Argan oil to moisturize the skin and reduce some of the itchiness, it worked!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li>Very high quality Magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Has made a huge difference in my lower back pain.</li>
            <li>I have tried applying oil (almond, coconut) after applying the spray, but that didn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Not waking up as much and sleeping deeper.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and it really seems to have helped with restless leg syndrome during sleep.</li>
            <li>I have improved that much</li>
            <li>but it really help to keep the odor</li>
            <li>Not greasy feeling and drys fast.</li>
            <li>The magnesium has improved it so much.</li>
            <li>this really work on night cramps</li>
            <li>After buying this product I received a very helpful email with tips and instructions.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really as if it is salt dust.</li>
            <li>but i really like this.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know why; i really feel like my body likes this product.</li>
            <li>My heart goes out to all the people being tortured by night time whole leg cramping like me.</li>
            <li>and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having this.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really helps me sleep.</li>
            <li>Magnesium is also used in neurons, and is one of the important minerals for muscle control, especially for cramping.  </li>
            <li>You can do this through mineral supplement pills, through consuming salts, or through absorbing salts through your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bring filtered or distilled water to a boil in stainless or glass pan.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spray bottles in bulk are very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>* Bring filtered or distilled water to a boil in stainless or glass pan.</li>
            <li>Spray bottles in bulk are very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I have not applied it to my whole body but instead focused on applying it to any aches and pains and sore spots on my body</li>
            <li>&gt; The seller really cares about this product and how it&#x27;s working for their customers.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li>and I was very please about that.  </li>
            <li>Really does help,with my plantar faciatis pain.</li>
            <li>But theodicy really does work as promised.</li>
            <li>I took some to a friend who has very sore knees, and she is going to try it also.</li>
            <li>my whole life.</li>
            <li>5 on my arm then lightly rubbed in and then about 5 squirts on my back for my husband to rub in.</li>
            <li>I just really started to use this.</li>
            <li>Much nicer to use.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t really have a smell.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much from this product when I ordered it</li>
            <li>but it is really working for me.  </li>
            <li>My son is using it for migraines and said it really helps if he uses it in time.</li>
            <li>It really works well.  </li>
            <li>this really works for pain.</li>
            <li>Really works for muscle cramping....</li>
            <li>I didnt even use that much.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a spray bottle, much like I have for my hair products.</li>
            <li>Now if I really stretch I can feel a twinge</li>
            <li>/&gt;It could very well be that we&#x27;re in Hawaii</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m also experiencing an all-around feeling of well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The word oil may be deceving, however, because it is very drying.  </li>
            <li>I was really amazed.</li>
            <li>used it on a headache one time and it relieved it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>relieving the pain in my back is one fantastic consequence of using the oil and it will keep a permanent spot in my medicine chest from now on.</li>
            <li>By the way, if it makes you itch too much, try the magnesium oil with aloe vera, also made by Seven Minerals.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to use, especially for back rubs.</li>
            <li>product appears to be just the product if you want something contemporary looking, crisp, clean, simple, and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product appears to be just the product if you want something contemporary looking, crisp, clean, simple, and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend, but maybe test on your sheets (like new detergents, etc) first...</li>
            <li>far as how well it works, I didn&#x27;t notice anything right away</li>
            <li>Right now I believe that magnesium oil&#x27;s benefits are just an old wive&#x27;s tale, but who knows, maybe someday we will see it in the news as being a research-validated, health must-have...</li>
            <li>The first couple applications were right before bed and even then with my body dried out (from sitting in a heated house with no humidifier running), it still took more than 20 min for the product to be absorbed into my skin - and the whole time I was sitting in my bathroom because I didn&#x27;t want to track oil all over the white carpets in my house</li>
            <li>I originally ordered the Magnesium oil with Aloe Vera for muscle spasms in my back.</li>
            <li>I finally resorted to rubbing the product into my skin (which is what I probably should have done the first time), but it still took over 10 min to be absorbed</li>
            <li>* Clean and simple style&lt;</li>
            <li>I have used a few different mag oils, can&#x27;t have to much info on this amazing oil, thanks!!</li>
            <li>Truly, your body does not need very much magnesium, and you get it naturally from food, tap water, and from sea</li>
            <li>My body absolutely loves magnesium - I have a high stress personality and I take magnesium capsules every day to help me manage stress and relax at night.  </li>
            <li>Based on that we recommended it to another family with a special needs child and they have had similar results.</li>
            <li>For me, cramps are either normal sodium salt deficiency (from sweating), or too much exertion, so my muscles are unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can see the product working because the down time I have after putting on the product is rather annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have noticed better quality sleep and less tiredness in the afternoons.</li>
            <li>in fact even spraying on my feet- causes my back to become fairly quickly more mobile; and my back will pop as i turn:</li>
            <li>I have read through many different health related books and articles and they all seem to bring up the importance of supplementing with Magnesium.  </li>
            <li>Most of these supplements rarely have negative side effects, and if it doesn’t work–well you don’t ever have to buy it</li>

            <li>Only mild stinging after shaving, which was my biggest concern.</li>
            <li>I mainly got it because my husband often has leg cramps, and to see if it would help my body aches, but I thought I&#x27;d try it to see if it helped my autoimmunity problems.</li>
            <li>Overall I thought this was a very effective product, but dinged it two stars on my review because of the slow absorption issue and the relatively mild improvement in my overall pain relief.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product at first, but I discovered a big issue after a few days....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I must say that I had high hopes that this would work.</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>Has a high quality feel.</li>
            <li>It is high quality.  </li>
            <li>Now to keep up with the cost: Price of liquid calcium and liquid magnesium is high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>started to feel a little better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten a little better...</li>
            <li>you normally dilute, or if you get little crystals forming, then just add more water.  </li>
            <li>If you normally dilute, or if you get little crystals forming, then just add more water.  </li>
            <li>I slept extremely well that night and could stretch my feet easily without any cramping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product reviewed was provided as a free sample.nd roughly 190g of MgCL, and 270g of H2O.  </li>
            <li>I felt calm and left it on for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I use it in a recipe for natural deodorant and it works very well.</li>
            <li>both surprised by the efficacy and by how fast it works.  </li>
            <li>It does itch at times, but it gets better after few minutes.</li>
            <li>i normally do it in bed; so i can just relax as it soaks in.</li>
            <li>my feet normally absorb all of it.</li>
            <li>Using sea salt sometimes instead of refined salt, and a diet with a normal variety of things, will get all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I read the instructions and it says it’s normal.</li>
            <li>Normal?</li>
            <li>If that’s normal I will stick with taking magnesium pills</li>
            <li>couple of days after, I let a few of my co-workers try out this product by spraying it on the areas that they&#x27;re often feeling the most pain</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I thought this was a very effective product, but dinged it two stars on my review because of the slow absorption issue and the relatively mild improvement in my overall pain relief.s, is that my back and neck (and to a much lesser extent, my knees) were very itchy throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>However a quick Google Search of even reputable/verifiable sites like WebMD state that there is a certain amount of evidence that Magnesium treatment (either through an IV, as a topical, or via supplement) can lessen both muscle and nerve pains due to its well-known ability to relax muscles when absorbed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil does dry and causes my skin to tighten and subsequently itch as the salts form on the top layer.  </li>
            <li>After the first few days of using I saw a significant change.</li>
            <li>Like this Magnesium Spray, (having used a Magnesium lotion in past) - Easy and Clean application - Absorbs fast - Marked improvement in muscle relaxation in arms, neck, legs - application of magnesium oil to intestinal area aids in bowl relaxing -  suggest a thinner and smaller bottle option because bottle is a bit large and as bottle spray tends to not work at an angle, it is hard to maintain an upright position when applying to self in many areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Putting it on is easy - I have been using it after my shower or bath and just spraying myself down.  </li>
            <li>If you have muscle cramps or maybe even bursitis (as I do), you need your muscles to relax and ease up on those joints, otherwise you live with a lot of pain.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, I don&#x27;t use Argan oil anymore and the itchiness is very mild - I can handle it, it goes away within a half an hour.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it come extemely fast, it works fast.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Consistent daily use reduces this response.</li>
            <li>When we finally received it, the first thing I did was read the instructions.</li>
            <li>If so, it is most likely due to lack of magnesium in your body already.</li>
            <li>I have also been receiving compliments on my soft glowing skin and hair!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be surprised!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any major cramps and seem to sleep a little better.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It was an ongoing issue for him due to a very physical job and his love of a couple of beers every night before bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Im totally surprised!  </li>
            <li>I even put some in a small bottle with a roller applicator, in case I need it while out &amp; about, just be sure to place it in a plastic bag before putting it in your bag or purse.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge at 12 oz and is basically a quantity that should last me several years (unless I start bathing in it or something) considering one spritz covers such a large area</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge at 12 oz and is basically a quantity that should last me several years (unless I start bathing in it or something) considering one spritz covers such a large area</li>
            <li>It is less drying, but also a little less strong and effective than the pure</li>
            <li>It is more potent than the Aloe Vera one, and doesn&#x27;t have the unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>It could be a contributing factor to this oil taking a while to dry up or be absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as how well it works, I didn&#x27;t notice anything right away but after a couple days my back and knees (which had been aching after just getting home from a long overseas trip) started to feel a little better</li>
            <li>I finally found Pure Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li>have used this pure magnesium oil and the one with aloe vera for the last 4 months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other treatments absorbed through my skin, but this one is new to me.</li>
            <li>so it is clearly doing something.  </li>
            <li>so it is clearly doing something.  </li>
            <li>It clearly tells you how to apply this spray.</li>
            <li>I was clearly prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well,</li>
            <li>/&gt;We really do not need much Magnesium unless you&#x27;re one in a million who has a problem absorbing or using Magnesium.  </li>
            <li>That my migraine were not as frequent.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you know you have sensitive skin, you can also purchase the one with Aloe in it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this magnesium oil to use as a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>On sensitive skin areas like belly or thigh</li>
            <li>Fixed aches and pains, eczema</li>
            <li>It really helps with the pain in my wrist ,took the pain away by next day.</li>
            <li>But it works on pain  really well for me, but all bodies are different.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used the magnesium oil five times and can tell an improvement in sleep quality.  </li>
            <li>My muscle spasms are severe in my back and neck, so maybe expecting too much from the spray-on form.</li>
            <li>After using the spray for two weeks, the soreness is completely gone.</li>
            <li>After using the spray for two weeks, the soreness is completely gone.</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well for reducing my muscle aches and pains in my neck and back!!  </li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t caused itchiness, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and as a busy mom of 6</li>
            <li>I still have restless legs, but use a variety of natural supplements and vitamins to control my symptoms.  </li>
            <li>think it worked well as far as helping my sleep goes.  </li>
            <li>If hubby does have leg cramps, it will be so much easier to just grab the oil and spray his legs than have to get up in the middle of the night looking for juice and bananas and quinine water.  </li>
            <li>If hubby does have leg cramps, it will be so much easier to just grab the oil and spray his legs than have to get up in the middle of the night looking for juice and bananas and quinine water.  </li>
            <li>I am profoundly surprised at the effectiveness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, if you have sensitive skin you may want to spot test before just spraying yourself.</li>
            <li>I also noticed a marked increase in my energy levels and mood.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t use more than that at a time because of the slow absorption rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t use more than that at a time because of the slow absorption rate.  </li>
            <li>evidently holds down bacteria very effectively.have</li>
            <li>rubbed it in, got back in bed and went right back to sleep.</li>
            <li>Works really well for leg cramps, sore neck muscles (although it might tingle a bit) but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for pain free muscles in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from joint pain or aches who have tried other remedies without success.</li>
            <li>Maybe my leg cramps have progressed to not being alleviated by topical magnesium which has worked in the past because this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I had no previous experience with magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li>I fell fast asleep using this, but the ruined sheets means I haven&#x27;t used it beyond the first few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my main  responsibility is to inspect higher-end tech products that&#x27;ll be shipped to Central and South America.  </li>
            <li>Also used it on our special needs child who has trouble staying asleep and it has worked wonders.</li>
            <li>The feel of the product is not really greasy as some have reported-it&#x27;s just different, seems to absorb and go away quickly.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very large and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I never expected this, and didn&#x27;t have a lot of confidence that it would help with the RLS, but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Itching sensation is mild, and, once the oil has dried, I use RIXX lotion (anti inflammatory) which gets rid of the itchiness and helps with joint discomfort.</li>
            <li>However, I rubbed some on my lower back (back pain for years) and shoulders/neck and was very surprised when the pain/soreness decreased significantly, and very fast.</li>
            <li>For those with sensitive skin, the spray can sting a bit, especially on a cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great shipping and I will likely reorder the product once my bottle is complete.</li>
            <li>Only natural contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why don&#x27;t medical doctors suggest this natural remedy?</li>
            <li>I get severe muscle spams in my back and this magnesium oil completely relaxes them.</li>
            <li>I have been using a brand by Seven Minerals because it is tested and purified and in a natural state, and I&#x27;m definitely hooked.</li>
            <li>I had also read an article that stated that most of us are deficient in magnesium and don&#x27;t know it.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this product because I read that most people are magnesium deficient.</li>
            <li>so thought for sure I&#x27;d get something out of it since they say the itchiness is from being deficient.</li>
            <li>if/when I notice  anything better or worse.</li>
            <li>and I had my husband spray it on and gently rub it in less than thirty minutes that pain was completely gone.</li>
            <li>The bottle recommends spraying it on your whole body and letting it air dry, especially targeting the bottoms of the feet.  </li>
            <li>I mean, if you buy a 2-seater car, you cannot complain that it doesn&#x27;t fit 20 people and paint your house for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels a bit funny having salt on your skin, but it’s also oddly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I have definitely slept harder than normal.  </li>
            <li>After I brush, I spray this directly on my gums and massage it in with a rubber toothpick to break up the bacteria pockets especially where I have had two problem spots that constantly require flossing and rubber toothpicks to keep them from getting sore.</li>
            <li>Most of us are deficient in magnesium which has been linked with numerous health issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a former athlete, I do suffer from some joint pain and general body soreness.</li>
            <li>That made me feel itchy (but only slightly…), which is apparently a sign of magnesium deficiency (</li>
            <li>I began soaking my feet in water heavy with Epsom salts before bed which seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s used many different products and although this works, he can&#x27;t get past the stickiness this product leaves behind on his skin if he applies too much.</li>
            <li>Still working on this product, a little itchy when using to much of it.</li>
            <li>As for his leg cramps, my husband has only been willing to get a spray down about one every 3-4 days, but he has not had a single leg cramp once we started using the oil.  </li>
            <li>dunno if that&#x27;s good or bad, since I had read itchiness indicates not enough magnesium in the system</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that the oil reduced my headaches, but it sure does make my neck and shoulders less tense during a headache, which likely reduces the duration of the headache.</li>

            <li> May not work for everyone but our experience has been great.</li>
            <li> I have been spraying it on my torso and haven&#x27;t experienced the burning as described by others.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It worked great</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll just say, in my opinion, it&#x27;s great for joints and teeth.</li>
            <li> I purchased the oil after reading some great reviews about helping with restless leg syndrome.</li>
            <li> Great for all aches and pains.  </li>
            <li> The product works great.</li>

            <li> loving it!</li>
            <li> felt pleasant, cooling sensation upon spraying on soles of my feet.</li>
            <li> A great product for relieving muscle pain or headaches and I love it!</li>
            <li> You would think that I would have seen some good from it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have nothing good to say about it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilbur Ginn</li>
            <li> Loved this product.</li>
            <li> I hear magnesium oil also good for insomniacs and foot fungus</li>
            <li> Using it in good faith.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product and think anyone with a magnesium deficiency would like it.  </li>
            <li> I am continuing to use it anyway because I want to maintain good levels.</li>
            <li> But I had never tried magnesium oil on my skin before, even though I had heard good things about</li>
            <li> In some ways, I find this product to be superior to the Ancient Minerals brand that I&#x27;m accustomed to.  </li>
            <li> Which that part is good of course.</li>
            <li> It makes him itchy but if he rubs it in really good for about 5 min</li>
            <li> but this seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> You may want to use a good moisturizer along with the spray.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Very VERY pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li> Very VERY pleased with the result.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> Seriously Amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled</li>
            <li> To be honest with you, I did not have any pain, however I have all the possibilities listed that could happen.</li>
            <li> I REALY liked it  </li>
            <li> I received a bottle from the manufacturer in exchange of an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome oil works really well</li>
            <li> Oil is a nice consistency and absorbs well into the skin.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t honestly state it if helps improve the sore muscles, but my issues have been chronic for 10-years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems to be effective against muscle aches and spasms when rubbed into the affected area.</li>
            <li> Nice oil for magnesium supplement.</li>
            <li> But effective and I tossed my toxic antiperspirant along with the toxic laxatives.</li>
            <li> Reading more research, I found magnesium oil was good for the gums.</li>
            <li> When wrote a message to a member of this company with some questions regarding the product, she was so kind and helpful in answering.  </li>
            <li> I appreciated the follow up email with tips on how to use the product for best results.</li>
            <li> I have been using Magnesium oil for over a month now, and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I never thought it would work, but I was offered this product to review and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It seems to work best after a hot shower, as that’s when my skin was the softest and most absorbent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> works great at helping me go right to sleep and sleep well!</li>
            <li> I will buy this again for certain, it&#x27;s wonderful! :)</li>
            <li> The product is good quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The product itself shipped quickly and came attractively packaged.</li>
            <li> Used hand-in-hand with a good moisturizer, this is a wonderful supplment to add to your daily health regime.</li>
            <li> Pretty good investment!  </li>
            <li> Pretty good investment!  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure if its that or the magnesium oil that&#x27;s helping me feel better!</li>
            <li> I love this product and all the important information that you receive via email!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plastic bottle with a good sprayer that works well to deliver a fine mist of the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This spray is a nice way to get more.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product but so far I am impressed .</li>
            <li> Great success with preventing foot cramps.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent natural solution to joint and muscle pain, a chronic thing for me.</li>
            <li> as They indicated: it does leave a very fine salt residue.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> It feels good, clean, and tingly in the mouth.</li>
            <li> It feels good, clean, and tingly in the mouth.</li>
            <li> And it was delivered fast, packaged beautifully.</li>
            <li> Super good.</li>
            <li> It is amazing what this and good quality water and eating smart can do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to try that one to see if it works better for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that I am sleeping better since I have started using it.</li>
            <li> Plus I noticed that I started to sleep better too.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I received a free sample product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I was able to confidently use the product knowing that it was both safe and &amp;#34;theoretically&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another product that is ok, but it takes a while to work.</li>
            <li> Been using for about a week and seems to be helping me sleep better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why so many others say it work so well for them.</li>
            <li> If she remembered to take the magnesium oil, she felt a lot better, if she forgot to put it on, then she would be up with pain.</li>
            <li> Way more absorbable than pill form.</li>
            <li> Magnesium tables have helped but then I end up taking ibuprofen to get more relief and sleep</li>
            <li> So glad I was able to try it.nd 8 weeks (at this rate).  </li>
            <li> So glad I was able to try it.</li>
            <li> Love it and will keep buying this</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t see the hole any more.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me with a more restful sleep, as well as muscle tension in some areas.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> and it does make me feel better.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to take more pills and that&#x27;s why I bought this</li>
            <li> have a thyroid condition and many of the side effects I was attributing to thyroid</li>
            <li> Interesting, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to purchasing this product I was craving and eating pumpkin seeds for the magnesium.  </li>
            <li> I still love pumpkin seeds, but I do not crave them anymore.  </li>
            <li> Really love this product.</li>
            <li> this product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> i absolutely Love spraying this on my skin, and leaving it on.</li>
            <li> :))</li>
            <li> In fairness, this company seems legit and maybe i was applying it with too many sprays?</li>
            <li> Play better golf.</li>
            <li> Make sure you dilute before you use ..</li>
            <li> This has helped so much more than anything else,even what doctor&#x27;s prescribed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Magnesium is one of the many snake oils out there.  </li>
            <li> If you need something to convince you that you&#x27;ve gotten better, placebo can help.  </li>
            <li> Continued use of these can cause you to not be able to go number two without adding laxatives (like magnesium salts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Through the skin, your body is much more selective.  </li>
            <li> * Pour into your favorite spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even at freezing, it should hold more than 5oz MgCl per 10oz water.  </li>
            <li> * Pour into your favorite spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> Even at freezing, it should hold more than 5oz MgCl per 10oz water.  </li>
            <li> so maybe my magnesium levels are ok (?).</li>
            <li> So you see I cant say  for sure its the oil or the therapy, but</li>
            <li> im glad to have bought the oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been putting it on the bottom of my feet at night, most nights, for a bit now.</li>
            <li> This morning she brought me the bottle and asked to have more put on because it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li> Sip rise benefit...helps me sleep better.</li>
            <li> I wanted the most bio-available way to get magnesium in my system.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it and it does help me sleep better, eases muscle pain.  </li>
            <li> Love how it makes me feel -&lt;br /&gt;helps</li>
            <li> More than anything I purchased it to help with my migraines.</li>
            <li> If you google &amp;#34;How to use magnesium oil by Dr. Sircus,&amp;#34; there are many helpful suggestions and further explanation about best usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After taking 1,500 mg per day, the latest discovery is that my &amp;#34;output&amp;#34; has no odor.</li>

            <li> I am using this to help me sleep better.  </li>
            <li> I feel more energetic thru out the day.  </li>
            <li> I love this magnesium oil.</li>
            <li> I love the information that came with it as well.</li>
            <li> this is so fantastic!</li>
            <li> There are just too many variables when it comes to digestion and sleeping like better exercise or a better diet.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic  product and I&#x27;m so grateful to have it!</li>
            <li> , my mood is more stable.</li>
            <li> but this seems to be a  much better delivery  </li>
            <li> I am sure I did not get it in my mouth-</li>
            <li> feel like it has increased my energy somewhat, but mostly it has helped my sleep.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slept much better and for longer periods of time since I started using this.  </li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve been using this I am often sleeping 5 or more hours at once.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this oil.</li>
            <li> Even with all that, I slept better than I have in years.  </li>
            <li> Im glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I Love it, i spray it on my feet, i have chronic pain all over my body</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> it does work. :)</li>
            <li> results have been interesting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Magnesium oil is not an oil, it is more of a brine.</li>
            <li> Most of the pain was gone within 30 – 60 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> so I put more oil on it and</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sleeping way better</li>
            <li> I even made enough for daughter and friend with excellent results!</li>
            <li> It does not seem to have helped her sleep (yet) but that doesn&#x27;t matter much, as she is quite happy not having the pain in her legs.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, she has not had a migraine since she started using it.</li>
            <li> Applying it morning and night, according to instructions, makes your muscles relax and life becomes much more tolerable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;Magnesium Oil&amp;#34;, in nice spritz bottle, with a clean looking label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tells you for best results, let it air dry.</li>
            <li> more so, though, it has a huge effect on my tendons, joints, muscles.</li>
            <li> So far my husband and I are pretty impressed with this.</li>
            <li> The product was great, I give 5 stars for how professional the selling organization was.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll find magnesium oil in use at many spas around the world, and it is now readily available for the consumer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use...no foot or leg cramps as of yet.</li>
            <li> Great, second bottle purchased, has helped relieved pain from my legs and feet and my nails never looked better.</li>
            <li> The itchiness was so strong</li>
            <li> Too strong ...</li>
            <li> Very light oil, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have read the other reviews and if you don&#x27;t feel like going through the process of making your own, this is worth the money, it is very good.</li>
            <li> (which makes sense, as it has to be fine, to be suspended in liquid) -</li>
            <li> The oil is light and easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> The next day, she said her legs felt pretty good!!!</li>
            <li> I bought it when I was pregnant because it supposedly absorbs better than in pill form.</li>
            <li> product is very nice, clean, and professional looking.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s huge.  </li>
            <li> First&lt;br /&gt;dose of the Ionic Magnesium made a huge difference with that problem within 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> so I could leave an accurate one.</li>
            <li> This is a great option for getting extra magnesium.</li>
            <li> After using it every night for 2 weeks, i was pain free.</li>
            <li> Sleep is not perfect...yet, but it is greatly improved in the two weeks I have been rubbing it into the sole of my feet before going to sleep.  </li>
            <li> With all of that detailed information, I knew what to expect if anything happened at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great it works and is used daily by my family.</li>
            <li> Great product for a terrific price!</li>
            <li> it seems to itch a bit, but once it dries, I lightly smooth over it with water to remove the remaining salt.  </li>
            <li> This is a great way to get magnesium topically!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, this is ready to go, and looks nice.  </li>
            <li> BUT, this is ready to go, and looks nice.  </li>
            <li> The product reviewed was provided as a free sample.</li>
            <li> Subjectively speaking, I feel that the Seven Minerals brand is more easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> and i am stink free for up to 48hrs</li>
            <li> I was provided a free sample of this product for review.</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price is great, especially for the size!!</li>
            <li> and I have slept sound .</li>
            <li> It tells you just how  magnesium plays an important part in your body.</li>
            <li> and I am literally blown away at how great this product actually DOES work</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> The info is what the consumer is interested in not all the advertising!!</li>
            <li> , SO WORTH THE MONEY !</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any significant differences in how I feel.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> After washing it off my feet felt silky and sparkly clean.</li>
            <li> for my personal experience, I have been sleeping well and feeling pretty good after using it, but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it was because of this magnesium oil.</li>
            <li> One of the latest health crazes is Pure Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li> Never had a problem with full strength on bottoms of feet.</li>
            <li> I do a good deal of exercise, and use this either after sport, or the next morning if my muscles are sore.</li>
            <li> Excess magnesium ingested can lead to diarrhea, so some people do better by absorbing it through the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Cover, and allow to cool to room temperature</li>
            <li> * Cover, and allow to cool to room temperature</li>
            <li> but I can see a true difference in my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> This review will be easy because it did exactly as it said.</li>
            <li> I went easy on it the first 2 days diluting it since all the comments about itchiness</li>
            <li> This oil is like a dry oil it does not leave a oily residue which is nice!</li>
            <li> I must admit that I have not used it all over , but did rub it on my feet and experienced no itching or other discomfort.</li>
            <li> I SLEPT LIKE A BABY LAST NIGHT AFTER I SHOWERED AND MESSAGED MY ENTIRE BODY WITH THIS OIL, WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The oil was shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> The oil comes in a spray-on format and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> After one month, I have noticed some mild relief with the joint pain.</li>
            <li> The product arrived more quickly than expected, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Many people have a magnesium deficiency and don’t realize this and many symptom, like from stress, are the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a big bottle and has no scent or color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free sample for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Where I am boasting about this oil is I have had a back ache in which I pulled some muscles in my back and in that respect this oil is great!</li>
            <li> You also want to make sure you have a high quality</li>
            <li> I was curious, so I did some research on it and apparently it has a bunch of health benefits, with the most notable ones being better sleep, stress relief, and better digestion.</li>
            <li> but apparently those aren’t as effective.</li>
            <li> I have difficulty sleeping for more than an hour or two at a time normally,</li>
            <li> which (I think) means that Im getting to a more normal level of mag.  </li>
            <li> The oil is very fine and not heavy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product and HIGHLY recommended for reducing exterior bodily aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I live in Alberta and our autumns, winters, and springs bring Chinook winds and changes in barometric pressure, thus causing migraines among many residents.</li>
            <li> but my back feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, my very sensitive skin didn&#x27;t itch, I was able to apply some on my legs, without tingling sensations...</li>
            <li> REALLY!!</li>
            <li> Not to mention you  definitely  get  more for your  money  with this  company!</li>
            <li> I will say it was almost instant, which was amazing.</li>
            <li> The magnesium oil is prickly after application which goes away after a period of time as absorbed.  </li>
            <li> The people that make this oil have assured me that the magnesium is absorbed in 20 min</li>
            <li> So far pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> Since most people are mg deficient i think this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s slippery and can be fun to play with in your hands.  </li>
            <li> I bathe in epsom salts frequently and being able to apply magnesium in oil form is awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The company actually contacted me to follow up and see how I liked it.</li>
            <li> It hadn&#x27;t helped the muscle spasms (and I was also taking the liquid Ionic magnesium  - tremendously effective but for different reasons).&lt;br /&gt;The company sent me this magnesium oil (but not in exchange for a review).</li>
            <li> worth.</li>
            <li> Thus far I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good for minor muscle aches too.</li>
            <li> It worked with no crazy itching.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;ve rarely seen improvements from magnesium pills.  </li>
            <li> I had a rare reaction to it ...</li>
            <li> The first night was super itchy/tingly.  </li>
            <li> I have mild fibromyalgia and this really helps!</li>
            <li> It evidently holds down bacteria very effectively.</li>
            <li> This was a suggestion from a friend in another country and so far I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve tried it, looking forward for its full potential :)</li>
            <li> I also used it under my armpits right after the shower; yeah it itched a lot in the beginning</li>
            <li> Now regarding the PMS - guys, you can quit reading right now, this is all you need to know.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now regarding the PMS - guys, you can quit reading right now, this is all you need to know.  </li>
            <li> I have been rubbing on the bottom of my feet right before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Now, I spray the stuff, full strength, onto my sore arm muscle, my sore feet, have a back rubs with it and more</li>
            <li> If this works consistently, it will be well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I seem to generally feel better.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to use instead of using harsh chemical laden deodorant and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> first night ALL of it absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> I have both the full strength version and the aloe version and like them both, although I use the full strength version more often as the itchiness is minimal.</li>
            <li> Down sides: I haven&#x27;t found a good spot to do the spraying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be effective, Magnesium oil must be as pure as possible.</li>
            <li> But I am known for tolerating a certain amount of torture for the sake of health - or beauty!.  </li>
            <li> taking this product, I put one spritz on both sides of my feet, on top and under my knees, on my lower back, and on my shoulder/neck areas and then waited for it to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li> your medical doctor diagnoses you with a magnesium deficiency, then this product would be a great way to supplement, especially if you don&#x27;t tolerate eating pills</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eaten, Magnesium Lactate, Aspartate, Citrate, and similar organic salts are more readily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> did find I needed to use it in the evening, because the first time I used it in the morning and afternoon</li>
            <li> DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything I read about this product did exactly what it said so</li>
            <li> is my first time trying magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li> The first time I sprayed my legs, focusing on my knees, and feet.  </li>
            <li> I have also used it on my feet when they were cramping from dehydration and it helped really fast!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Magnesium Oil after reading loads of articles and books on the importance of this mineral.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> You might be able to get it in bulk locally.  </li>

            <li> how many of us have low levels.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s also much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I have taken liquid calcium with magnesium for several years, but evidently needed more magnesium.</li>
            <li> So the problem I was at first trying to address ended up changing my life.</li>

            <li> I will get back to say more</li>
            <li> yes i do believe I feel more consistent energy;  as per the internet site I read i am using topical iodine as well as magnesium oil.  </li>

            <li> It was very helpful!</li>
            <li> Really helps you relax at night!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast!</li>
            <li> I haven’t experienced any negative side effects since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> It is exactly as they describe and they give tips on how to use it.</li>
            <li> The first time I sprayed it on it felt like it was burning</li>
            <li> This is the  first  time I  used  this  product  </li>
            <li> really well!  </li>
            <li> If you are low on magnesium, and most of us are, you need this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I could taste magnesium.  </li>
            <li> Product is a exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have a TON more energy, and just overall feel</li>
            <li> I just overall feel so much better.  </li>
            <li> Overall I feel better too.</li>
            <li> Helped my husband&#x27;s restless legs first time he used it.</li>
            <li> This oil really helps when my leg muscles start to hurt!</li>
            <li> I will say the first 3-4 times I used this</li>
            <li> The first night we got it, I massaged it on the bottom of her feet and around her knees and calves.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m loving the magnesium oil, easy to use just spray it on every night, I got it for health reasons a lot of food loses magnesium in the processing</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;ll comment that this particular bottle is clear, easy to use, and has no offensive</li>
            <li> I use it on myself and my patients in my holistic health practice with positive results.</li>
            <li> They seem to settle down more quickly.</li>
            <li> It burns at first but really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> In addition, the residue on my feet and ankles caused my bare feet to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on smooth flooring...made them skid proof?</li>
            <li> First off I would really like to say that you shipped this promptly</li>
            <li> Sprays on easy, dries almost instantly, and leaves no oily residue!  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin so the itchiness was tremendous in the beginning.  </li>
            <li> Oil is odorless and makes my skin feel super soft.</li>
            <li> can do sometimes with a body spray if the skin is a bit red or irritated, but it does subside very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Pure Magnesium Oil is  hidden treasure,  this is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> so I agree to try out Seven Minerals Pure Magnesium Oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a large bottle of magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li> If you leave it, it&#x27;s a very fine, white powder, and it will eventually come off on its own, or slowly soak over the day, or come off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next time I sprayed the magnesium oil, I rubbed it in quickly and then used Argan oil to moisturize the skin and reduce some of the itchiness, it worked!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> Very high quality Magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li> Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Has made a huge difference in my lower back pain.</li>
            <li> I have tried applying oil (almond, coconut) after applying the spray, but that didn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Not waking up as much and sleeping deeper.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and it really seems to have helped with restless leg syndrome during sleep.</li>
            <li> I have improved that much</li>
            <li> but it really help to keep the odor</li>
            <li> Not greasy feeling and drys fast.</li>
            <li> The magnesium has improved it so much.</li>
            <li> this really work on night cramps</li>
            <li> After buying this product I received a very helpful email with tips and instructions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really as if it is salt dust.</li>
            <li> but i really like this.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know why; i really feel like my body likes this product.</li>
            <li> My heart goes out to all the people being tortured by night time whole leg cramping like me.</li>
            <li> and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having this.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Really helps me sleep.</li>
            <li> Magnesium is also used in neurons, and is one of the important minerals for muscle control, especially for cramping.  </li>
            <li> You can do this through mineral supplement pills, through consuming salts, or through absorbing salts through your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bring filtered or distilled water to a boil in stainless or glass pan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spray bottles in bulk are very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> * Bring filtered or distilled water to a boil in stainless or glass pan.</li>
            <li> Spray bottles in bulk are very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I have not applied it to my whole body but instead focused on applying it to any aches and pains and sore spots on my body</li>
            <li> &gt; The seller really cares about this product and how it&#x27;s working for their customers.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li> and I was very please about that.  </li>
            <li> Really does help,with my plantar faciatis pain.</li>
            <li> But theodicy really does work as promised.</li>
            <li> I took some to a friend who has very sore knees, and she is going to try it also.</li>
            <li> my whole life.</li>
            <li> 5 on my arm then lightly rubbed in and then about 5 squirts on my back for my husband to rub in.</li>
            <li> I just really started to use this.</li>
            <li> Much nicer to use.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t really have a smell.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much from this product when I ordered it</li>
            <li> but it is really working for me.  </li>
            <li> My son is using it for migraines and said it really helps if he uses it in time.</li>
            <li> It really works well.  </li>
            <li> this really works for pain.</li>
            <li> Really works for muscle cramping....</li>
            <li> I didnt even use that much.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a spray bottle, much like I have for my hair products.</li>
            <li> Now if I really stretch I can feel a twinge</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could very well be that we&#x27;re in Hawaii</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m also experiencing an all-around feeling of well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The word oil may be deceving, however, because it is very drying.  </li>
            <li> I was really amazed.</li>
            <li> used it on a headache one time and it relieved it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> relieving the pain in my back is one fantastic consequence of using the oil and it will keep a permanent spot in my medicine chest from now on.</li>
            <li> By the way, if it makes you itch too much, try the magnesium oil with aloe vera, also made by Seven Minerals.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to use, especially for back rubs.</li>
            <li> product appears to be just the product if you want something contemporary looking, crisp, clean, simple, and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product appears to be just the product if you want something contemporary looking, crisp, clean, simple, and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend, but maybe test on your sheets (like new detergents, etc) first...</li>
            <li> far as how well it works, I didn&#x27;t notice anything right away</li>
            <li> Right now I believe that magnesium oil&#x27;s benefits are just an old wive&#x27;s tale, but who knows, maybe someday we will see it in the news as being a research-validated, health must-have...</li>
            <li> The first couple applications were right before bed and even then with my body dried out (from sitting in a heated house with no humidifier running), it still took more than 20 min for the product to be absorbed into my skin - and the whole time I was sitting in my bathroom because I didn&#x27;t want to track oil all over the white carpets in my house</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the Magnesium oil with Aloe Vera for muscle spasms in my back.</li>
            <li> I finally resorted to rubbing the product into my skin (which is what I probably should have done the first time), but it still took over 10 min to be absorbed</li>
            <li> * Clean and simple style&lt;</li>
            <li> I have used a few different mag oils, can&#x27;t have to much info on this amazing oil, thanks!!</li>
            <li> Truly, your body does not need very much magnesium, and you get it naturally from food, tap water, and from sea</li>
            <li> My body absolutely loves magnesium - I have a high stress personality and I take magnesium capsules every day to help me manage stress and relax at night.  </li>
            <li> Based on that we recommended it to another family with a special needs child and they have had similar results.</li>
            <li> For me, cramps are either normal sodium salt deficiency (from sweating), or too much exertion, so my muscles are unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can see the product working because the down time I have after putting on the product is rather annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have noticed better quality sleep and less tiredness in the afternoons.</li>
            <li> in fact even spraying on my feet- causes my back to become fairly quickly more mobile; and my back will pop as i turn:</li>
            <li> I have read through many different health related books and articles and they all seem to bring up the importance of supplementing with Magnesium.  </li>
            <li> Most of these supplements rarely have negative side effects, and if it doesn’t work–well you don’t ever have to buy it</li>
            <li> Most of these supplements rarely have negative side effects, and if it doesn’t work–well you don’t ever have to buy it again.</li>
            <li> Only mild stinging after shaving, which was my biggest concern.</li>
            <li> I mainly got it because my husband often has leg cramps, and to see if it would help my body aches, but I thought I&#x27;d try it to see if it helped my autoimmunity problems.</li>
            <li> Overall I thought this was a very effective product, but dinged it two stars on my review because of the slow absorption issue and the relatively mild improvement in my overall pain relief.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product at first, but I discovered a big issue after a few days....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I must say that I had high hopes that this would work.</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> Has a high quality feel.</li>
            <li> It is high quality.  </li>
            <li> Now to keep up with the cost: Price of liquid calcium and liquid magnesium is high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> started to feel a little better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten a little better...</li>
            <li> you normally dilute, or if you get little crystals forming, then just add more water.  </li>
            <li> If you normally dilute, or if you get little crystals forming, then just add more water.  </li>
            <li> I slept extremely well that night and could stretch my feet easily without any cramping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product reviewed was provided as a free sample.nd roughly 190g of MgCL, and 270g of H2O.  </li>
            <li> I felt calm and left it on for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I use it in a recipe for natural deodorant and it works very well.</li>
            <li> both surprised by the efficacy and by how fast it works.  </li>
            <li> It does itch at times, but it gets better after few minutes.</li>
            <li> i normally do it in bed; so i can just relax as it soaks in.</li>
            <li> my feet normally absorb all of it.</li>
            <li> Using sea salt sometimes instead of refined salt, and a diet with a normal variety of things, will get all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I read the instructions and it says it’s normal.</li>
            <li> Normal?</li>
            <li> If that’s normal I will stick with taking magnesium pills</li>
            <li> couple of days after, I let a few of my co-workers try out this product by spraying it on the areas that they&#x27;re often feeling the most pain</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I thought this was a very effective product, but dinged it two stars on my review because of the slow absorption issue and the relatively mild improvement in my overall pain relief.s, is that my back and neck (and to a much lesser extent, my knees) were very itchy throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> However a quick Google Search of even reputable/verifiable sites like WebMD state that there is a certain amount of evidence that Magnesium treatment (either through an IV, as a topical, or via supplement) can lessen both muscle and nerve pains due to its well-known ability to relax muscles when absorbed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil does dry and causes my skin to tighten and subsequently itch as the salts form on the top layer.  </li>
            <li> After the first few days of using I saw a significant change.</li>
            <li> Like this Magnesium Spray, (having used a Magnesium lotion in past) - Easy and Clean application - Absorbs fast - Marked improvement in muscle relaxation in arms, neck, legs - application of magnesium oil to intestinal area aids in bowl relaxing -  suggest a thinner and smaller bottle option because bottle is a bit large and as bottle spray tends to not work at an angle, it is hard to maintain an upright position when applying to self in many areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Putting it on is easy - I have been using it after my shower or bath and just spraying myself down.  </li>
            <li> If you have muscle cramps or maybe even bursitis (as I do), you need your muscles to relax and ease up on those joints, otherwise you live with a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, I don&#x27;t use Argan oil anymore and the itchiness is very mild - I can handle it, it goes away within a half an hour.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it come extemely fast, it works fast.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Consistent daily use reduces this response.</li>
            <li> When we finally received it, the first thing I did was read the instructions.</li>
            <li> If so, it is most likely due to lack of magnesium in your body already.</li>
            <li> I have also been receiving compliments on my soft glowing skin and hair!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be surprised!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any major cramps and seem to sleep a little better.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It was an ongoing issue for him due to a very physical job and his love of a couple of beers every night before bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Im totally surprised!  </li>
            <li> I even put some in a small bottle with a roller applicator, in case I need it while out &amp; about, just be sure to place it in a plastic bag before putting it in your bag or purse.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge at 12 oz and is basically a quantity that should last me several years (unless I start bathing in it or something) considering one spritz covers such a large area</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge at 12 oz and is basically a quantity that should last me several years (unless I start bathing in it or something) considering one spritz covers such a large area</li>
            <li> It is less drying, but also a little less strong and effective than the pure</li>
            <li> It is more potent than the Aloe Vera one, and doesn&#x27;t have the unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> It could be a contributing factor to this oil taking a while to dry up or be absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as how well it works, I didn&#x27;t notice anything right away but after a couple days my back and knees (which had been aching after just getting home from a long overseas trip) started to feel a little better</li>
            <li> I finally found Pure Magnesium Oil.</li>
            <li> have used this pure magnesium oil and the one with aloe vera for the last 4 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other treatments absorbed through my skin, but this one is new to me.</li>
            <li> so it is clearly doing something.  </li>
            <li> so it is clearly doing something.  </li>
            <li> It clearly tells you how to apply this spray.</li>
            <li> I was clearly prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well,</li>
            <li> /&gt;We really do not need much Magnesium unless you&#x27;re one in a million who has a problem absorbing or using Magnesium.  </li>
            <li> That my migraine were not as frequent.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you know you have sensitive skin, you can also purchase the one with Aloe in it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this magnesium oil to use as a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> On sensitive skin areas like belly or thigh</li>
            <li> Fixed aches and pains, eczema</li>
            <li> It really helps with the pain in my wrist ,took the pain away by next day.</li>
            <li> But it works on pain  really well for me, but all bodies are different.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used the magnesium oil five times and can tell an improvement in sleep quality.  </li>
            <li> My muscle spasms are severe in my back and neck, so maybe expecting too much from the spray-on form.</li>
            <li> After using the spray for two weeks, the soreness is completely gone.</li>
            <li> After using the spray for two weeks, the soreness is completely gone.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for reducing my muscle aches and pains in my neck and back!!  </li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t caused itchiness, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and as a busy mom of 6</li>
            <li> I still have restless legs, but use a variety of natural supplements and vitamins to control my symptoms.  </li>
            <li> think it worked well as far as helping my sleep goes.  </li>
            <li> If hubby does have leg cramps, it will be so much easier to just grab the oil and spray his legs than have to get up in the middle of the night looking for juice and bananas and quinine water.  </li>

            <li> I am profoundly surprised at the effectiveness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, if you have sensitive skin you may want to spot test before just spraying yourself.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a marked increase in my energy levels and mood.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use more than that at a time because of the slow absorption rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use more than that at a time because of the slow absorption rate.  </li>
            <li> evidently holds down bacteria very effectively.have</li>
            <li> rubbed it in, got back in bed and went right back to sleep.</li>
            <li> Works really well for leg cramps, sore neck muscles (although it might tingle a bit) but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for pain free muscles in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from joint pain or aches who have tried other remedies without success.</li>
            <li> Maybe my leg cramps have progressed to not being alleviated by topical magnesium which has worked in the past because this didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I had no previous experience with magnesium oil.  </li>
            <li> I fell fast asleep using this, but the ruined sheets means I haven&#x27;t used it beyond the first few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my main  responsibility is to inspect higher-end tech products that&#x27;ll be shipped to Central and South America.  </li>
            <li> Also used it on our special needs child who has trouble staying asleep and it has worked wonders.</li>
            <li> The feel of the product is not really greasy as some have reported-it&#x27;s just different, seems to absorb and go away quickly.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very large and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I never expected this, and didn&#x27;t have a lot of confidence that it would help with the RLS, but I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Itching sensation is mild, and, once the oil has dried, I use RIXX lotion (anti inflammatory) which gets rid of the itchiness and helps with joint discomfort.</li>
            <li> However, I rubbed some on my lower back (back pain for years) and shoulders/neck and was very surprised when the pain/soreness decreased significantly, and very fast.</li>
            <li> For those with sensitive skin, the spray can sting a bit, especially on a cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great shipping and I will likely reorder the product once my bottle is complete.</li>
            <li> Only natural contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why don&#x27;t medical doctors suggest this natural remedy?</li>
            <li> I get severe muscle spams in my back and this magnesium oil completely relaxes them.</li>
            <li> I have been using a brand by Seven Minerals because it is tested and purified and in a natural state, and I&#x27;m definitely hooked.</li>
            <li> I had also read an article that stated that most of us are deficient in magnesium and don&#x27;t know it.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this product because I read that most people are magnesium deficient.</li>
            <li> so thought for sure I&#x27;d get something out of it since they say the itchiness is from being deficient.</li>
            <li> if/when I notice  anything better or worse.</li>
            <li> and I had my husband spray it on and gently rub it in less than thirty minutes that pain was completely gone.</li>
            <li> The bottle recommends spraying it on your whole body and letting it air dry, especially targeting the bottoms of the feet.  </li>
            <li> I mean, if you buy a 2-seater car, you cannot complain that it doesn&#x27;t fit 20 people and paint your house for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels a bit funny having salt on your skin, but it’s also oddly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I have definitely slept harder than normal.  </li>
            <li> After I brush, I spray this directly on my gums and massage it in with a rubber toothpick to break up the bacteria pockets especially where I have had two problem spots that constantly require flossing and rubber toothpicks to keep them from getting sore.</li>
            <li> Most of us are deficient in magnesium which has been linked with numerous health issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a former athlete, I do suffer from some joint pain and general body soreness.</li>
            <li> That made me feel itchy (but only slightly…), which is apparently a sign of magnesium deficiency (</li>
            <li> I began soaking my feet in water heavy with Epsom salts before bed which seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used many different products and although this works, he can&#x27;t get past the stickiness this product leaves behind on his skin if he applies too much.</li>
            <li> Still working on this product, a little itchy when using to much of it.</li>
            <li> As for his leg cramps, my husband has only been willing to get a spray down about one every 3-4 days, but he has not had a single leg cramp once we started using the oil.  </li>
            <li> dunno if that&#x27;s good or bad, since I had read itchiness indicates not enough magnesium in the system</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that the oil reduced my headaches, but it sure does make my neck and shoulders less tense during a headache, which likely reduces the duration of the headache.</li>
            <li> I still feel a very very slight itching in certain locations</li>
            <li> I still needed ibuprofen once everything began but it was WAY less than my normal dose.  </li>
            <li> I still needed ibuprofen once everything began but it was WAY less than my normal dose.  </li>
            <li> This helped where other natural or rx  topicals did not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a surgical tech and have various skin and muscle issue do to compression garments, and long physically demanding hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know exactly what&#x27;s</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sleeping better and feeling less tired during the day, all of this with zero lifestyle changes.  </li>
            <li> I will admit the itchiness it causes makes me use it less frequently than I would like to (hence the four star rating) but that can be helped by simply showering 20 minutes after application.</li>
            <li> , that seems to be quite common among reviewers, is that my back and neck (and to a much lesser extent, my knees) were very itchy throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much it increases ones magnesium level.</li>
            <li> I just really wanted it to work for something. :-/</li>
            <li> but after a couple days my back and knees (which had been aching after just getting home from a long overseas trip)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I have used it long enough to comment on how helpful it is yet.</li>
            <li> Taking Mag internally did not work for me, plus the long term laxative effects reduces tone in the colon.  </li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time, and you bet I will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a 45 year old male who (although thin) doesn&#x27;t exercise as much as he should</li>
            <li> Chloride is distilled from seawater, as it is one of the major salts other than Sodium Chloride (table salt).  </li>
            <li> This bottle will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It also let you know that it may cause your skin to be a bit dry and leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> (my skin is sensitive so it does itch slightly until it dries - may order the one with aloe.</li>
            <li> He only applied a spray here and there and it took so long to dry</li>
            <li> tried this for cramps after a long bike ride (60 miles).  </li>
            <li> so we have lots of unexplained aches and pains.</li>
            <li> It also goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Since then ive been absorbing less, so I just rinse off after about 20 minutes, because it gets a little sticky.</li>
            <li> but I have  used similar  products  from other  companies.</li>
            <li> On the back of the bottle on the label it says you may experience this due to your body lacking magnesium or to try their spray with aloe.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on the bottom of her feet and thoroughly rubbed it in and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> , you can use this product, spritz it on, and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> I spray this on after towel drying from a shower, spray it on, rub it in and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I had to vary the location of my body where I sprayed the oil as it leaves the skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of slight burning at times though it does not last long.  </li>
            <li> In this case, if you think you need magnesium (usually found naturally in cocoa, leafy greens like spinach, and nuts), it wouldn’t hurt to try this out.</li>
            <li> However, eating or drinking magnesium salts pulls water into your digestive tract, and can cause loose bowels.  </li>
            <li> When i sprayed it on, about a minute in, I began to feel the tingling slightly stingy feeling, but it didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways so this bottle will last me around 8 weeks (at this rate).  </li>
            <li> It does leave a slightly itchy feeling, but it goes away shortly after applying.</li>
            <li> I use less of it to get the same results.  </li>
            <li> Some of the studies done have found that ~70% of Americans consume less than the recommended dose of magnesium, and this topical magnesium oil should help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe partially due to some arthritic causes, and also likely due to some other ailments.</li>
            <li> so i get those hard to reach place like the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my back and a few fingers that are sore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews prior to buying it about how the oil can cause itching and stinging, but should subside in few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really an oil, just salt in a water solution, but it does have an oily-like feel.</li>
            <li> After evaporating all of the water out under heat, I found roughly 190g of MgCL, and 270g of H2O.  </li>
            <li> I recieved my order a few days or a week later.</li>
            <li> Well, I have had this for a few weeks now and have used it daily</li>
            <li> It has only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> just be careful to read the directions.</li>
            <li> I used it the last few weeks of my pregnancy to help me sleep and to ward off leg and foot cramps.</li>
            <li> I have noticed the skin on my feet is now very dry, due to the salt water I expect.</li>
            <li> If it stings a little at first you can leave it on for 20 minutes then rinse it off ( mine never did sting, but some people complained that it stung a little).</li>
            <li> In a few days, I will probably only use it every other day or so to maintain.  </li>
            <li> My main issues were poor sleep and aches... but having a baby who doesn&#x27;t sleep through the night and needs nursed (while I sit up in a chair) will do that to you.</li>
            <li> I had my blood work tested a few weeks ago and was found to be pretty deficient in mag</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t slow me down on a busy morning.  </li>
            <li> so when I read that other people had used this product for a lot of things including joint pain, I thought I&#x27;d try it as well</li>
            <li> Thank you for having something I can use without taking narcotics or other over the counter medicine to relieve my pain.</li>
            <li> I experience leg pain sometimes due the lack of minerals and end up taking magnesium and potassium in tablet form.  </li>
            <li> My wife use it daily and reports no more cramps.</li>
            <li> it has an extreme effect that way.</li>
            <li> Anxiety, digestive tract issues, muscle issues, and all of the other supposed problems that call for it...  </li>
            <li> As for the other claims time will tell.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the leg issue is muscle related.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other brand of magnesium oil, so I can&#x27;t compare</li>
            <li> The package arrive to Mexico City before I even expected it!</li>
            <li> I woke up the other night with leg cramps, got up and sprayed my legs</li>
            <li> Any other time I would have been walking the floors the rest of the night.</li>
            <li> It did not affect my autoimmune problems one way or the other that I could tell.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to get on the bottom of your feet and let dry but other than that I&#x27;m a fan.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes my skin feels a little dry</li>
            <li> I let it air dry, once dried, then I felt the itching come on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for RLS, as I have extremely active Restless Legs Syndrome and sleep issues.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not real oily but just slightly</li>
            <li> Once dry, you can re-spritz with plain water, and it will re-dissolve, and keep soaking in.  </li>
            <li> When I take magnesium supplements orally, it is hard to balance the positive physical effects with the unfortunate digestive componants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can burn a little at times, not sure why, but I think when Im low and spray it on, it doesnt burn at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for me that includes it being really itchy and drying.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me in terms of post-exercise soreness.</li>
            <li> This year it traveled down into my foot.</li>
            <li> Anyways, with that in mind, I’ll write down some of my observations after 2 weeks of using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so he could lay down in bed without getting this stuff all over the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other family members tried it too, they did not experience any itching, however my skin was itchy after it dried.  </li>
            <li> Both the person from the company that contacted me about testing the product and the product label state that this is common occurrence due to either a Magnesium deficiency or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Both the person from the company that contacted me about testing the product and the product label state that this is common occurrence due to either a Magnesium deficiency or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Also less body aches, as well. .</li>
            <li> it also informs you that you may experience a slight burning or itching.</li>
            <li> The Ancient Minerals magnesium oil had this odd tendency to bead up and drip off my body like sweat even after massaging it in.  </li>
            <li> I spray it on my skin and it starts to tingle and itch slightly.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product as recommended for about a week, and I have significantly less joint pain.</li>
            <li> leaves a slight residue that can be itchy....</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t expect was that I would feel a lot less pain in my knee joint less than half an hour</li>
            <li> Again, she could care less since it seems to work.</li>
            <li> After brushing my teeth with it for about a month, a small cavity along the gum line completely closed up</li>
            <li> It does sting a little when applied, but nothing that is that bothersome.</li>
            <li> it does make me feel a little relaxed sometimes.</li>
            <li> It feels a little like oil or lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little longer to stop the cramp that the roll-on Cramp 911.</li>
            <li> It does sting a little because of the salt content, but mixing it with grape seed oil or water helps.</li>
            <li> I also find that there is a little residue left behind where ever you spray it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using it a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Once dried she went to sleep.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out quite a bit</li>
            <li> Just a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> I have elbow tendonitis &amp; within a few minutes</li>
            <li> As for the spray itself, I don&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;salty&amp;#34; or grit feeling ever left behind</li>
            <li> Sorry it has not helped me so far.  </li>
            <li> Just a few pumps on each armpit</li>
            <li> He used it a few times and said the pains did subside so it does work.</li>
            <li> every night for a few weeks to go to sleep (faster).</li>
            <li> but unless I did something wrong, or my sheets are just the wrong type, mine have funky orangish blotches all over (since I applied over a significant part of my body).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does burn a little but it is a small price to pay for the relief in my pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it costs 21 times the raw materials you could use to make it at home:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> However, it costs 21 times the raw materials you could use to make it at home:</li>
            <li> I found this product to really help with a few painful spots.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re sick, or have suffered moderate to severe dehydration, or have been starving for over 10 days, or have to consume diuretics (water pills) regularly, or have problems with your digestive tract, then your doctor might recommend magnesium supplementation.  </li>
            <li> Hard day at work and after being home a little while my hamstrings on both legs started cramping up.</li>
            <li> SO the next day I decided to read the instructions and spray my legs with it, somehow taking the crazy itching and burning and then after 20 minutes rinse it off (or try their other product with Aloe Vera. )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad too as I had some high hopes</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve also had &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; and felt like I had bad breath my whole life.</li>
            <li> Now, this happened for about 2-3 day max, after that, there were no more itching skin or stingy feeling.</li>
            <li> Even if you do small quantities, you can make this for 10% of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if you do small quantities, you can make this for 10% of the cost.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed a small amount on my feet as suggested.</li>
            <li> I accidentally applied it to a small wound this one time, and it burned like salt water would.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the magnesium oil we just spray, rub it in and in a few minutes the pain is gone!</li>
            <li> NO MORE PAIN PILLS</li>
            <li> Unbelievable how well this stuff worked for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I received this bottle last weekend, I casually sprayed my knees about 15 minutes before going to bed that Saturday night.</li>
            <li> I could hardly get my socks on.</li>
            <li> Makes me sleep hard</li>
            <li> Plus the price is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does sting/tingle a bit, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll at least use up the bottle.</li>
            <li> I suffer from chronic complex sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome, as well as chronic cervicogenic tension headaches...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it in the least bit</li>
            <li> I had my husband test this since he suffers from chronic pains in his back and joints.</li>
            <li> The magnesium is slowly working.  </li>
            <li> and I mean severe pain in her legs.</li>
            <li> suffer from migraines, fibromyalgia, a twisted spin, and a handful of other conditions, and I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at the claims this oil has, yet I decided to give it a try anyway</li>
            <li> you, my teenage daughter still prefers to take magnesium tablets when cramping gets bad - not as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it at night on my hip which is only painful when I lay on it.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, or really hate that sensation, maybe try the version with the aloe.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This oil has saved me from bad muscle cramping and neuropathy due to damage from past Lyme Disease infections.</li>
            <li> Guess it working last time was a fluke.  :(</li>
            <li> I am using the oil for my broken wrists.  </li>
            <li> I knew I was deficient (plus the sensitivity of my skin).  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any itchiness.</li>
            <li> I never really experienced the itchiness that has been reported...</li>
            <li> I have been having leg spams for years,getting worse.</li>
            <li> Next time I will try the lotion as the oil is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Some nights are worse than others.  </li>
            <li> and I assumed I was deficient).  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any itching with this product.</li>
            <li> But they said that would happen if you were deficient.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to use and is very effective on muscle spasms.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife whilst we were on a ski trip to Vail. Whilst it did not quite turn her into Lindsey Vonn it did relax the muscles and she is a big fan of the product. Order arrived within two days of placement.</li>
            <li> Everything about the product seems to be as advertised.  Unfortunately, for me that includes it being really itchy and drying.  I know there&#x27;s another 50/50 product with aloe vera.  I&#x27;ll have to try that one to see if it works better for my skin.  I have tried applying oil (almond, coconut) after applying the spray, but that didn&#x27;t help much.  The magnesium spray does seem to help with foot/leg cramps, and I&#x27;m grateful for that.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because of almost nightly leg cramps that would take several minutes of walking to get relief.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I&#x27;ve only had one or two leg cramps that lasted only a couple minutes after I again applied the magnesium oil.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use. I have noticed that I am sleeping better since I have started using it.</li>
            <li> I am using the oil for my broken wrists.  It&#x27;s helping to heal them.  My husband and daughter use it for muscle cramps and it helps</li>
            <li> I like it. Not getting enough magnesium can be detrimental to your health. This spray is a nice way to get more. Plus, it is MADE IN THE USA. That is a big plus to me.</li>
            <li> I found this product to really help with a few painful spots. I used it on my back and a few fingers that are sore.&lt;br /&gt;I did find I needed to use it in the evening, because the first time I used it in the morning and afternoon I couldn&#x27;t stay awake.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to help with sleep too. It does sting a little when applied, but nothing that is that bothersome.</li>
            <li> I have been giving this to everyone I know.  My Mother-in-law, daughter and son.  It is amazing what this and good quality water and eating smart can do.  I feel that I have turned back the aging clock 20 years.  My energy is coming back and the pain is leaving.</li>
            <li> This oil has saved me from bad muscle cramping and neuropathy due to damage from past Lyme Disease infections. I&#x27;m very glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from migraines  for about 20 years now. They are horrible. I&#x27;ve seemed to try everything to prevent them. So I decided to look for a product that could help with this problem. I finally found Pure Magnesium Oil. I started using it a few days ago. After the first few days of using I saw a significant change. That my migraine were not as frequent.  Plus I noticed that I started to sleep better too. I love this product!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for the purpose of inspection and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> *** NOTE: I received a free sample product in exchange for an honest review. ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a 45 year old male who (although thin) doesn&#x27;t exercise as much as he should, I have various aches and pains that just seem to stay with me.  Chief among them are my neck, lower back, knees, and occasionally my feet.  As such, I&#x27;m always on the look out for products that will improve my condition so I agree to try out Seven Minerals Pure Magnesium Oil eventhough I had never heard of Magnesium&#x27;s reputed ability as a pain reliever.  However a quick Google Search of even reputable/verifiable sites like WebMD state that there is a certain amount of evidence that Magnesium treatment (either through an IV, as a topical, or via supplement) can lessen both muscle and nerve pains due to its well-known ability to relax muscles when absorbed.  Because of this, I was able to confidently use the product knowing that it was both safe and &amp;#34;theoretically&amp;#34; effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When taking this product, I put one spritz on both sides of my feet, on top and under my knees, on my lower back, and on my shoulder/neck areas and then waited for it to be absorbed.  The first couple applications were right before bed and even then with my body dried out (from sitting in a heated house with no humidifier running), it still took more than 20 min for the product to be absorbed into my skin - and the whole time I was sitting in my bathroom because I didn&#x27;t want to track oil all over the white carpets in my house (they already attract enough dirt).  I finally resorted to rubbing the product into my skin (which is what I probably should have done the first time), but it still took over 10 min to be absorbed and then I had to thoroughly wash my hands as the warning label says you should get the stuff into your eyes.  I&#x27;m glad I can see the product working because the down time I have after putting on the product is rather annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one side effect that I experienced, that seems to be quite common among reviewers, is that my back and neck (and to a much lesser extent, my knees) were very itchy throughout the day.  Both the person from the company that contacted me about testing the product and the product label state that this is common occurrence due to either a Magnesium deficiency or dry skin.  I could have either or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how well it works, I didn&#x27;t notice anything right away but after a couple days my back and knees (which had been aching after just getting home from a long overseas trip) started to feel a little better so it is clearly doing something.  The bottle is huge at 12 oz and is basically a quantity that should last me several years (unless I start bathing in it or something) considering one spritz covers such a large area and I wouldn&#x27;t use more than that at a time because of the slow absorption rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I thought this was a very effective product, but dinged it two stars on my review because of the slow absorption issue and the relatively mild improvement in my overall pain relief.s, is that my back and neck (and to a much lesser extent, my knees) were very itchy throughout the day.

            <li> Great product. This is a great option for getting extra magnesium.</li>
            <li> This Product Just arrived on this day. Hard day at work and after being home a little while my hamstrings on both legs started cramping up. I&#x27;ve been using another product that is ok, but it takes a while to work. I decided this was a perfect time to try this oil. I sprayed it on both hamstrings and on neck.... because I read once where a person also applied to neck to get mag levels up faster. In about 5 minutes all cramping was gone. Wow! I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Been using for about a week and seems to be helping me sleep better. Not waking up as much and sleeping deeper.A little tricky to get on the bottom of your feet and let dry but other than that I&#x27;m a fan.  Update - Been using this for over 2 months and still having great results for sleep. Also used it on our special needs child who has trouble staying asleep and it has worked wonders. Based on that we recommended it to another family with a special needs child and they have had similar results. May not work for everyone but our experience has been great.</li>
            <li> Pure Magnesium Oil is  hidden treasure,  this is an amazing product.  I read about this product,  but was skeptical about what it said it could do,  but to my surprise and amazement,  this product works wonders.  I had lower back pain and I had my husband spray it on and gently rub it in less than thirty minutes that pain was completely gone. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT ! DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT CLAIMS, SO WORTH THE MONEY !</li>
            <li> I suffered with a nagging pain in my knee for 3 years. This year it traveled down into my foot. A friend suggested I switch from taking magnesium orally to the oil. After using it every night for 2 weeks, i was pain free. It&#x27;s now been 4 weeks and I am telling everybody. I just bought another bottle for a friend, &amp; 5 others I know have already purchased.I am thrilled , anybody who has suffered from constant nagging pain, will understand, I wouldn&#x27;t give it praise if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I spray on my lower back and it has helped with the chronic pain I&#x27;ve been experiencing. It does leave a slightly itchy feeling, but it goes away shortly after applying. I highly recommend this product.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Oh, my gosh! I am so happy with this product!!  Sleep is not perfect...yet, but it is greatly improved in the two weeks I have been rubbing it into the sole of my feet before going to sleep.  I am sure it will keep on improving!  Also less body aches, as well. . Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I like this product very much. I&#x27;ve been having a lot of pain in my shoulder for quite a while so when I read that other people had used this product for a lot of things including joint pain, I thought I&#x27;d try it as well and yes it did work. Thank you for having something I can use without taking narcotics or other over the counter medicine to relieve my pain. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Just started using it.It&#x27;s working as advertised.Thanks!</li>
            <li> Like this Magnesium Spray, (having used a Magnesium lotion in past) - Easy and Clean application - Absorbs fast - Marked improvement in muscle relaxation in arms, neck, legs - application of magnesium oil to intestinal area aids in bowl relaxing -  suggest a thinner and smaller bottle option because bottle is a bit large and as bottle spray tends to not work at an angle, it is hard to maintain an upright position when applying to self in many areas.  The go around on this is to spray on hands and then apply.  The magnesium oil is prickly after application which goes away after a period of time as absorbed.  Consistent daily use reduces this response.</li>
            <li> My sleep is absolutely amazing! So deep</li>
            <li> Simply wonderful. I could fight a bull at this point in my life after using this product. Feel anazing</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  Sprays on easy, dries almost instantly, and leaves no oily residue!  Doesn&#x27;t slow me down on a busy morning.  Spray it on, get dressed.  Simple as that.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product but so far I am impressed . I have been spraying it on my torso and haven&#x27;t experienced the burning as described by others.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I have used it long enough to comment on how helpful it is yet.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Surprisingly, my very sensitive skin didn&#x27;t itch, I was able to apply some on my legs, without tingling sensations... maybe my body is already balanced in magnesium ? I would definitely recommend this brand, made in the US.</li>
            <li> I must say that I had high hopes that this would work. I don&#x27;t know why I though it might but it has not done anything for me or my wife. I don&#x27;t understand why so many others say it work so well for them. You would think that I would have seen some good from it.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing good to say about it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wilbur Ginn</li>
            <li> I SLEPT LIKE A BABY LAST NIGHT AFTER I SHOWERED AND MESSAGED MY ENTIRE BODY WITH THIS OIL, WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have been using it at night on my hip which is only painful when I lay on it. I have stopped the Aleve I was taking every night. It seems to be working. Down sides: I haven&#x27;t found a good spot to do the spraying. It gets everywhere. Also it makes my skin like Velcro - not sticky but sort of non- skid! I could hardly get my socks on. I&#x27;m going to try it on my hair next.</li>
            <li> This review will be easy because it did exactly as it said. I have had this product for a while as I wanted to wait it out. My mother has been having severe and I mean severe pain in her legs. Maybe partially due to some arthritic causes, and also likely due to some other ailments. Either way, this pain would constantly keep her up at night.  When we finally received it, the first thing I did was read the instructions. It clearly tells you how to apply this spray. It lets you know when and how to apply it especially on the bottom of your feet any time or after a bath/shower. It tells you for best results, let it air dry. it also informs you that you may experience a slight burning or itching. If so, it is most likely due to lack of magnesium in your body already. Once your magnesium levels balance out, it wouldn&#x27;t itch anymore. It also let you know that it may cause your skin to be a bit dry and leave a white residue. With all of that detailed information, I knew what to expect if anything happened at all. I was clearly prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, one night my mother was having her painful spells, and I said, let&#x27;s try this. I sprayed it on the bottom of her feet and thoroughly rubbed it in and let it air dry. She said it did not tingle or burn her. Once dried she went to sleep. The next morning, she had not felt any pain through the night. We did this same process every night when she would have the pain. If she remembered to take the magnesium oil, she felt a lot better, if she forgot to put it on, then she would be up with pain. Needless to say, it works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally tried it myself. To be honest with you, I did not have any pain, however I have all the possibilities listed that could happen. When i sprayed it on, about a minute in, I began to feel the tingling slightly stingy feeling, but it didn&#x27;t last very long. I let it air dry, once dried, then I felt the itching come on. It dried my skin out quite a bit and it left a bit of the white flaky residue. Now, this happened for about 2-3 day max, after that, there were no more itching skin or stingy feeling. There were no red blotches, or irritations on my skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything I read about this product did exactly what it said so therefore there were no disappointments. I highly highly recommend this product. I have read the other reviews and if you don&#x27;t feel like going through the process of making your own, this is worth the money, it is very good. Also, if you know you have sensitive skin, you can also purchase the one with Aloe in it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed. Will purchase this again</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Used it with some essential oils for a muscle rub. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Way more absorbable than pill form.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great it works and is used daily by my family. Just give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this magnesium oil. I use it on myself and my patients in my holistic health practice with positive results. I have both the full strength version and the aloe version and like them both, although I use the full strength version more often as the itchiness is minimal.</li>
            <li> I bought this magnesium oil to use as a natural deodorant. I read all the reviews prior to buying it about how the oil can cause itching and stinging, but should subside in few days. I am still experiencing the stinging, but haven&#x27;t given up yet. If it continues I&#x27;ll mix in some aloe vera. I have also sprayed some of this magnesium oil on my ankle to relieve pain from rheumatoid arthritis and it works great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product at a great price!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I was hoping for relief but for me it did not do anything, however I will keep trying.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now and it really seems to have helped with restless leg syndrome during sleep.</li>
            <li> Using this every night,  It is working!</li>
            <li> I am sleeping like a newborn</li>
            <li> This product has helped with releasing symptoms of Restless Leg syndrome. Thank you</li>
            <li> I REALY liked it  It worked great</li>
            <li> **I received a bottle from the manufacturer in exchange of an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE - 4 months later.. (7/18/15)&lt;br /&gt;I have used this pure magnesium oil and the one with aloe vera for the last 4 months.  The people that make this oil have assured me that the magnesium is absorbed in 20 min and if there is salt residue on your skin, you can wipe it off after that.  I now only use it 3-4 times a month! REALLY!! I have improved that much it&#x27;s amazing.  My PMS has reduced a lot.  Mind you, my teenage daughter still prefers to take magnesium tablets when cramping gets bad - not as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW (3/7/15)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time trying magnesium oil.  I experience leg pain sometimes due the lack of minerals and end up taking magnesium and potassium in tablet form.  Also, I get severe PMS cramping 7-10 days before my cycle begins.  Magnesium tables have helped but then I end up taking ibuprofen to get more relief and sleep better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so the itchiness was tremendous in the beginning.  But I am known for tolerating a certain amount of torture for the sake of health - or beauty!.  The first time I sprayed my legs, focusing on my knees, and feet.  The itchiness was so strong I knew I was deficient (plus the sensitivity of my skin).  The next time I sprayed the magnesium oil, I rubbed it in quickly and then used Argan oil to moisturize the skin and reduce some of the itchiness, it worked!  I tried it this way for the next ten days spraying twice a day.  I also used it under my armpits right after the shower; yeah it itched a lot in the beginning but it really help to keep the odor down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain in my legs minimized some but it is not all gone yet.  The magnesium is slowly working.  After two weeks, I don&#x27;t use Argan oil anymore and the itchiness is very mild - I can handle it, it goes away within a half an hour.  I learned to spray only 3 times (tops) on a specific area to reduce itchiness.  A little goes a long ways so this bottle will last me around 8 weeks (at this rate).  Pretty good investment!  Now regarding the PMS - guys, you can quit reading right now, this is all you need to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that has helped with my PMS is magnesium tablets, raspberry tea, and ibuprofen.  This combo helps with cramps and nausea which is become regular with me.  It happened that I received this oil...well...I had a chance to test PMS cramping.  I have to say how amazed I was at the minimum PMS cramping I felt for ONE DAY and almost zero nausea.  I could give it 1000 stars just for that!  If you are a girl - and you should because guys aren&#x27;t reading at this point, you&#x27;d understand.  I still needed ibuprofen once everything began but it was WAY less than my normal dose.  Very VERY pleased with the result.  Definitely purchasing this oil.  So glad I was able to try it.nd 8 weeks (at this rate).  Pretty good investment!

            <li> Use allot and still have 90% of the bottle left. Can burn a little at times, not sure why, but I think when Im low and spray it on, it doesnt burn at all. Love it and will keep buying this</li>
            <li> Very good product and it&#x27;s easy to apply. Not greasy feeling and drys fast. I will reorder when this one is used up.</li>
            <li> I bought it when I was pregnant because it supposedly absorbs better than in pill form. Used it along with coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Makes me sleep hard but I dream some wildly crazy dreams.</li>
            <li> So many wonderful uses. I spray it everywhere, even in my hair! I&#x27;m a surgical tech and have various skin and muscle issue do to compression garments, and long physically demanding hours. I can&#x27;t wait to use my magnesium oil when i get home. I have also been receiving compliments on my soft glowing skin and hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really an oil, just salt in a water solution, but it does have an oily-like feel. I&#x27;ve used this for my joints and for brushing my teeth. I&#x27;d say about a 40-50% improvement on the soreness in my joints. After brushing my teeth with it for about a month, a small cavity along the gum line completely closed up and you can&#x27;t see the hole any more. Re-mineralized? Guess I&#x27;ll find out at my next dentist visit. For those with sensitive skin, the spray can sting a bit, especially on a cut. It&#x27;s like going to the ocean and getting salt water on your skin. If you don&#x27;t like that feeling then you may want to look into getting magnesium lotion instead. I hear magnesium oil also good for insomniacs and foot fungus but I don&#x27;t need it for either of those issues so I&#x27;ll just say, in my opinion, it&#x27;s great for joints and teeth.</li>
            <li> I use this every night before bed. it helps me get to sleep and helps keep me regular... I have also used it on my feet when they were cramping from dehydration and it helped really fast! highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Magnesium Oil after reading loads of articles and books on the importance of this mineral.  I spray it on my feet and legs every night before going to sleep.  When it dries I can feel it working by the tingling sensation.  Sometimes my skin feels a little dry so I follow with lotion.  I would be open to try the oil with aloe next time.  The oil was shipped quickly.  Overall, I like the oil and will order again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the oil after reading some great reviews about helping with restless leg syndrome. Thus, when I feel pain or tingling in my legs, I spray with the oil. It does itch at times, but it gets better after few minutes. So far pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I use on the bottom of my feet at night. It does itch anywhere else. I tried it on my head for migraine. It itched and did nothing. Not sure how much it increases ones magnesium level. I would need to see the data or check the serum levels. Ha. Using it in good faith.</li>
            <li> Great success with preventing foot cramps. Never had a problem with full strength on bottoms of feet.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this on her injured hand /wrist she claims it helps her</li>
            <li> This is magic stuff!  Everyone could benefit from the uses of magnesium oil!  Good the uses of it and you&#x27;ll be surprised!  Great product for a terrific price!</li>
            <li> great product easy to us helps with pain and swelling</li>
            <li> The product is good quality and easy to use. My wife use it daily and reports no more cramps.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have a patch of eczema on my leg. It was so bad it would bleed often. The magnesium has improved it so much. It burns at first but really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from migraines.  The outrageously expensive migraine medication hasn&#x27;t been working.  He&#x27;s had one almost every day for about 6 weeks now.  I was very skeptical about magnesium for migraines because my husband takes magnesium tablets almost every day.  I had also read an article that stated that most of us are deficient in magnesium and don&#x27;t know it.  So, I gave it a shot.  WELL, one night my husband felt a migraine coming on, rubbed some of the oil on his temple, and it went away!!!  If this works consistently, it will be well worth the money.  UPDATE:  husband had another migraine this evening.  This time the oil did nothing.  Guess it working last time was a fluke.  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month. Two thumbs up!  I am a massage therapist so I know the importance of Magnesium for muscle function.  Taking Mag internally did not work for me, plus the long term laxative effects reduces tone in the colon.  This product has helped me with a more restful sleep, as well as muscle tension in some areas.  i use about 16 sprays daily.  On sensitive skin areas like belly or thigh it seems to itch a bit, but once it dries, I lightly smooth over it with water to remove the remaining salt.  It is not oily at all. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> this really work on night cramps</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I do a good deal of exercise, and use this either after sport, or the next morning if my muscles are sore. It *always* works.</li>
            <li> I read about Magnesium deficiency and spoke to my doctor about it.  She told me to put the oil on the bottoms of my feet before going to bed.  I did that and it does make me feel better.  If I spray it anywhere else, though, it itches (this happens when I cross my foot over my thigh for some spraying).  This bottle will last a very long time.  I think this is a good product and think anyone with a magnesium deficiency would like it.  I didn&#x27;t want to take more pills and that&#x27;s why I bought this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a thyroid condition and many of the side effects I was attributing to thyroid may have just been magnesium deficiency.  Interesting, eh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to purchasing this product I was craving and eating pumpkin seeds for the magnesium.  I haven&#x27;t eaten a pumpkin seed since I started spraying the bottoms of my feet each night.  I still love pumpkin seeds, but I do not crave them anymore.  My body must have needed magnesium.  That&#x27;s my theory anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you have to lose?  Just a few bucks.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Really love this product. Has a high quality feel. Itching sensation is mild, and, once the oil has dried, I use RIXX lotion (anti inflammatory) which gets rid of the itchiness and helps with joint discomfort. Winning combo!</li>
            <li> This is so convenient to use. Oil is odorless and makes my skin feel super soft. My headaches have subsided since using this product. After buying this product I received a very helpful email with tips and instructions.</li>
            <li> this product is phenomenal. the COMPANY is phenomenal too! i absolutely Love spraying this on my skin, and leaving it on. i normally do it in bed; so i can just relax as it soaks in. my feet normally absorb all of it. oil and everything. my legs will not absorb all the oil. but i just leave it on, and go to sleep with it on. as They indicated: it does leave a very fine salt residue. it&#x27;s really as if it is salt dust. (which makes sense, as it has to be fine, to be suspended in liquid) - but i really like this. i don&#x27;t know why; i really feel like my body likes this product. it does make me feel a little relaxed sometimes. more so, though, it has a huge effect on my tendons, joints, muscles. in fact even spraying on my feet- causes my back to become fairly quickly more mobile; and my back will pop as i turn: which feels AWESOME! it has an extreme effect that way. also on my feet. i will spray it on my feet, and then after a while i will bend my toes- and they all pop and are just TOTALLY relaxed. it&#x27;s uber-Lovely! :)) i just can&#x27;t recommend this spray enough. and as i mentioned: this company is PHENOMENAL!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a week now but I do notice a difference, it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;completely take away the pain but it makes it so I can tolerate it and continue&lt;br /&gt;with my daily chores.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  Seriously Amazing.  Fixed aches and pains, eczema, I&#x27;m sleeping better and feeling less tired during the day, all of this with zero lifestyle changes.  TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This product does what it says it does. I have been having horrible leg cramps at night and trouble sleeping. I use this before I go to bed and the cramping has ceased and I have been sleeping better!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I tend to get very bad knots in a lot of muscles and it did seem to help ease the stiffness, although not completely. Also, it&#x27;s a great alternative to swallowing pills! Since most people are mg deficient i think this is a great alternative. I did notice some prickly feeling but it didn&#x27;t bother me. If you have sensitive skin, or really hate that sensation, maybe try the version with the aloe.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It just what I was excepting. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Maybe my leg cramps have progressed to not being alleviated by topical magnesium which has worked in the past because this didn&#x27;t work. In addition, the residue on my feet and ankles caused my bare feet to &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; on smooth flooring...made them skid proof? IDK. My heart goes out to all the people being tortured by night time whole leg cramping like me. I began soaking my feet in water heavy with Epsom salts before bed which seems to work pretty well. and is much cheaper. In fairness, this company seems legit and maybe i was applying it with too many sprays?</li>
            <li> It really helps with the pain in my wrist ,took the pain away by next day. I have a fungal infection and was told to use  magnesium oil instead of the supplement because the fungus feeds on magnesium pills or capsule. So am trying this. But it works on pain  really well for me, but all bodies are different. Thanks for having this.</li>
            <li> Love it! Help me sleep better at night and relieved pain anywhere! Play better golf. Thanks</li>
            <li> works great at helping me go right to sleep and sleep well!</li>
            <li> Too strong ... Make sure you dilute before you use .. i had allergy at 11 pm at night and need to take medication immediately</li>
            <li> Awesome oil works really well</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia three years ago. This has helped so much more than anything else,even what doctor&#x27;s prescribed. It seems to help with all the symptoms of fibromyalgia. I use it both morning and night. When I reduced to only once a day, after a week my symptoms started returning. I would recommend it to others suffering from chronic pain or fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> Wonderful supplement for those sore muscles. Works really well for leg cramps, sore neck muscles (although it might tingle a bit) but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for pain free muscles in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> Oil is a nice consistency and absorbs well into the skin. I like rubbing it on my lower back where I get muscle aches -I can&#x27;t honestly state it if helps improve the sore muscles, but my issues have been chronic for 10-years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil does dry and causes my skin to tighten and subsequently itch as the salts form on the top layer.  I switched to using it 30-minutes before I bathe and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great shipping and I will likely reorder the product once my bottle is complete.</li>
            <li> Really helps me sleep. A deeper sleep.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to get magnesium topically!!!! Not oily, which I love!!!!! A+</li>
            <li> SUMMARY: It&#x27;s &amp;#34;Magnesium Oil&amp;#34;, in nice spritz bottle, with a clean looking label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* Clean and simple style&lt;br /&gt;* Source of inorganic magnesium salt&lt;br /&gt;* Only natural contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY FOUR STARS?&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing wrong with this product.  It is high quality.  I mean, if you buy a 2-seater car, you cannot complain that it doesn&#x27;t fit 20 people and paint your house for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your medical doctor diagnoses you with a magnesium deficiency, then this product would be a great way to supplement, especially if you don&#x27;t tolerate eating pills well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW WELL DOES IT WORK?&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for cramps after a long bike ride (60 miles).  No effect.  My cramps are not caused by magnesium deficiency.  For me, cramps are either normal sodium salt deficiency (from sweating), or too much exertion, so my muscles are unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has been prescribed Magnesium for a variety of issues, but it doesn&#x27;t *do* anything.  Anxiety, digestive tract issues, muscle issues, and all of the other supposed problems that call for it...  No effect.  Truly, your body does not need very much magnesium, and you get it naturally from food, tap water, and from sea salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium is one of the many snake oils out there.  You can use it when you don&#x27;t need it, and it&#x27;s unlikely to cause problems that people will sue over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exception is for placebo effect.  People poo-poo this, but it&#x27;s huge.  For some conditions, it can be 20-30% recovery rate among patients.  It&#x27;s where the Navy Seals get their awesome power - because they believe they have it.  Mind over matter.  If you need something to convince you that you&#x27;ve gotten better, placebo can help.  Knowing it&#x27;s placebo sometimes negates that, but not always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s slippery and can be fun to play with in your hands.  It feels a little like oil or lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes.  It&#x27;s water soluble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IS MAGNESIUM:&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium Chloride is distilled from seawater, as it is one of the major salts other than Sodium Chloride (table salt).  Magnesium is also used in neurons, and is one of the important minerals for muscle control, especially for cramping.  Excess magnesium ingested can lead to diarrhea, so some people do better by absorbing it through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We really do not need much Magnesium unless you&#x27;re one in a million who has a problem absorbing or using Magnesium.  Using sea salt sometimes instead of refined salt, and a diet with a normal variety of things, will get all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re sick, or have suffered moderate to severe dehydration, or have been starving for over 10 days, or have to consume diuretics (water pills) regularly, or have problems with your digestive tract, then your doctor might recommend magnesium supplementation.  You can do this through mineral supplement pills, through consuming salts, or through absorbing salts through your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eaten, Magnesium Lactate, Aspartate, Citrate, and similar organic salts are more readily absorbed.  However, eating or drinking magnesium salts pulls water into your digestive tract, and can cause loose bowels.  Continued use of these can cause you to not be able to go number two without adding laxatives (like magnesium salts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the skin, your body is much more selective.  You can do a soak, in a tub, with a quarter cup of magnesium chloride (not the same as epsom salts).  You can also swim in the ocean, because that&#x27;s where this comes from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, you can use this product, spritz it on, and let it dry.  Once dry, you can re-spritz with plain water, and it will re-dissolve, and keep soaking in.  Or, you can wash it off.  If you leave it, it&#x27;s a very fine, white powder, and it will eventually come off on its own, or slowly soak over the day, or come off in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COST ANALYSIS:&lt;br /&gt;This product is very nice, clean, and professional looking.  There is no odor, and it appears to be a supersaturated solution of Magnesium Chloride in distilled water.  After evaporating all of the water out under heat, I found roughly 190g of MgCL, and 270g of H2O.  The bottle, cap, and label were 38 grams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product appears to be just the product if you want something contemporary looking, crisp, clean, simple, and ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it costs 21 times the raw materials you could use to make it at home:&lt;br /&gt;* Bring filtered or distilled water to a boil in stainless or glass pan.&lt;br /&gt;* Add 7 ounces of Magnesium Chloride flakes for every 10 ounces of water by weight.&lt;br /&gt;* Stir to dissolve.&lt;br /&gt;* Once dissolved, remove from heat.&lt;br /&gt;* Cover, and allow to cool to room temperature&lt;br /&gt;* Pour into your favorite spray bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you normally dilute, or if you get little crystals forming, then just add more water.  Even at freezing, it should hold more than 5oz MgCl per 10oz water.  In bulk, MgCl flakes required to make this at maximum strength is about a dollar and ten cents, shipped.  You might be able to get it in bulk locally.  Spray bottles in bulk are very inexpensive.  Even if you do small quantities, you can make this for 10% of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, this is ready to go, and looks nice.

            <li> So far my husband and I are pretty impressed with this. Seems to be effective against muscle aches and spasms when rubbed into the affected area. We have noticed better quality sleep and less tiredness in the afternoons. I seem to generally feel better.  I have not experienced any itchiness. The feel of the product is not really greasy as some have reported-it&#x27;s just different, seems to absorb and go away quickly. I like the fact that there is no odor with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month... haven&#x27;t noticed any significant differences in how I feel. I never really experienced the itchiness that has been reported... so maybe my magnesium levels are ok (?). I am continuing to use it anyway because I want to maintain good levels. My main issues were poor sleep and aches... but having a baby who doesn&#x27;t sleep through the night and needs nursed (while I sit up in a chair) will do that to you. It&#x27;s gotten a little better... but my baby has been adjusting sleep/eat patterns.. so I can&#x27;t say for sure if its that or the magnesium oil that&#x27;s helping me feel better! I do have to say though.. it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try it! And it&#x27;s a big bottle!</li>
            <li> Im not a writer, but ill try to give you my story.I have been having leg spams for years,getting worse. I had the worst case while keeping my grandchildren.My grandaughter was so frightened,I knew I had to do something different.I called for an appointment with a doctor,chiropractor.  The next week is when I ordered the magnesium oil,told to me by my sons friend.He had ordered some for his wife and it had helped her.I recieved my order a few days or a week later.The doctor said I had a problem in my spine.He has been working on that area.  Ive been using the oil too.I have not had a spasm since the one when I was  keeping my grandchildren. My doctor [who is very wonderful] is glad im using the  oil.  So you see I cant say  for sure its the oil or the therapy, but im glad to have bought the oil.</li>
            <li> My body absolutely loves magnesium - I have a high stress personality and I take magnesium capsules every day to help me manage stress and relax at night.  But I had never tried magnesium oil on my skin before, even though I had heard good things about it.&lt;br /&gt;So I was anxious to try this product.  The bottle recommends spraying it on your whole body and letting it air dry, especially targeting the bottoms of the feet.  I have not applied it to my whole body but instead focused on applying it to any aches and pains and sore spots on my body and it definitely helps.  I think the bottoms of the feet is beneficial as well.&lt;br /&gt;Some other family members tried it too, they did not experience any itching, however my skin was itchy after it dried.  So in the future I will probably try diluting it a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes, and I am happy with it, and intend to keep using it for help with aches and pains!</li>
            <li> In some ways, I find this product to be superior to the Ancient Minerals brand that I&#x27;m accustomed to.  The Ancient Minerals magnesium oil had this odd tendency to bead up and drip off my body like sweat even after massaging it in.  Subjectively speaking, I feel that the Seven Minerals brand is more easily absorbed.  I use less of it to get the same results.  So far I&#x27;ve used the magnesium oil five times and can tell an improvement in sleep quality.  Plus the price is hard to beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me in terms of post-exercise soreness.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have only been using for a week and I felt immediate relief from deep aching caused by stenosis and I am a fifibromyalgia sufferer as well. I bathe in epsom salts frequently and being able to apply magnesium in oil form is awesome.&lt;br /&gt; The seller really cares about this product and how it&#x27;s working for their customers. I really appreciate that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I got this. Why does anyone need magnesium oil? But Then I started seeing posts and articles about the benefits of it and how many of us have low levels. It is also difficult to know what your levels are because (and I&#x27;m not 100% sure) it is difficult to test for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been putting it on the bottom of my feet at night, most nights, for a bit now. It&#x27;s hard to know exactly what&#x27;s it&#x27;s doing but I also haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. It goes on easily (this comes in a spray bottle so I spray it over a towel). There is a lot of information online about using magnesium and the benefits. I don&#x27;t want to make any claims or suggestions except to research it yourself. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll comment that this particular bottle is clear, easy to use, and has no offensive odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to add that my daughter fell while skating and hurt her wrist. We tried Tylenol, wrapping and ice. Then I put some magnesium oil on it. This morning she brought me the bottle and asked to have more put on because it helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Great for all aches and pains.  I will never be without this product.</li>
            <li> Stopped my leg cramps almost instantly!</li>
            <li> The product works great.</li>
            <li> First off I would really like to say that you shipped this promptly and I was very please about that.  I do like how it feels on the skin after applying it. I use it on my feet every night and think that has helped since I had a problem taking  the regular magnesium tablet.</li>
            <li> I FOLLOWED DIRECTIONS FOR DILUTING OIL - IT STILL BURNED A BIT.</li>
            <li> Nice oil for magnesium supplement.</li>
            <li> The product was great, I give 5 stars for how professional the selling organization was. The reason for the three stars though is that I just don&#x27;t personally believe that magnesium oil has any medicinal benefit. If it does, and I am wrong, I would give it a five star rating. The sellers deserve it. Right now I believe that magnesium oil&#x27;s benefits are just an old wive&#x27;s tale, but who knows, maybe someday we will see it in the news as being a research-validated, health must-have...</li>
            <li> Really does help,with my plantar faciatis pain. Sip rise benefit...helps me sleep better. Next time I will try the lotion as the oil is a bit annoying. But theodicy really does work as promised.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because I read that most people are magnesium deficient. I wanted the most bio-available way to get magnesium in my system.  I have been using it and it does help me sleep better, eases muscle pain.  Some of the issues mentioned like itchiness after application did affect me; but it goes away after continuous use.  There is no smell and it&#x27;s not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I love this product and all the important information that you receive via email!! The info is what the consumer is interested in not all the advertising!! I have used a few different mag oils, can&#x27;t have to much info on this amazing oil, thanks!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any major cramps and seem to sleep a little better. Feeling good !</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results.  What a wast of money and time.....</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!  I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works as stopping leg cramps and restless leg syndrome.  WOW!</li>
            <li> Great  product! Love how it makes me feel -&lt;br /&gt;helps the pain especially my legs. I bought a second bottle for my parents</li>
            <li> Actually, I am still evaluating. I bought this for RLS, as I have extremely active Restless Legs Syndrome and sleep issues. I believe it is helping. However, I rubbed some on my lower back (back pain for years) and shoulders/neck and was very surprised when the pain/soreness decreased significantly, and very fast. I also tried some on my knees. I took some to a friend who has very sore knees, and she is going to try it also. I never expected this, and didn&#x27;t have a lot of confidence that it would help with the RLS, but I am pleasantly surprised. It does sting/tingle a bit, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least. However, I am going to get the Aloe Vera version to help with the &amp;#34;saltiness&amp;#34; of the after application. Bottom line, I think I am going to be a big believer in this stuff. And it was delivered fast, packaged beautifully.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well. Takes a little longer to stop the cramp that the roll-on Cramp 911. But, it&#x27;s also much cheaper!</li>
            <li> To date I have noticed that the magnesium oil has made a difference only on my restless legs. I will say it was almost instant, which was amazing. I am somewhat disappointed coonsidering all the things it was said to help with. More than anything I purchased it to help with my migraines. It has not helped with those. I am still trying.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the Magnesium oil with Aloe Vera for muscle spasms in my back. The company actually contacted me to follow up and see how I liked it. It hadn&#x27;t helped the muscle spasms (and I was also taking the liquid Ionic magnesium  - tremendously effective but for different reasons).&lt;br /&gt;The company sent me this magnesium oil (but not in exchange for a review). It is more potent than the Aloe Vera one, and doesn&#x27;t have the unpleasant odor. My muscle spasms are severe in my back and neck, so maybe expecting too much from the spray-on form.However, I have a very painful nerve disorder, RSD caused by a bad surgery (I haven&#x27;t worn shoes in 7 years, just rubber ugly things. I take a conservative amount of pain meds so I can function. Even with a small dose, they have caused horrible constipation, so I have been taking a laxative for 7 years. Why don&#x27;t medical doctors suggest this natural remedy? First&lt;br /&gt;dose of the Ionic Magnesium made a huge difference with that problem within 45 minutes. I have taken liquid calcium with magnesium for several years, but evidently needed more magnesium. My chiropractor suggested using the spray not only over&lt;br /&gt;muscle spasm areas, but especially over the lymph nodes (groin, armpits, neck, back of knees). I find it difficult to walk around for 20 minutes nude while this stuff dries so it can be rubbed off  - have to close the blinds. It also stains my bra even after armpit is wiped off so I have to wipe off armpits with alcohol. But effective and I tossed my toxic antiperspirant along with the toxic laxatives. Now to keep up with the cost: Price of liquid calcium and liquid magnesium is high. So I experimented with the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; magnesium pills, and have been taking 6 pills, 1,500 milligrams daily, 2 pills three times a day. Reading more research, I found magnesium oil was good for the gums. After I brush, I spray this directly on my gums and massage it in with a rubber toothpick to break up the bacteria pockets especially where I have had two problem spots that constantly require flossing and rubber toothpicks to keep them from getting sore.

            <li> I have read through many different health related books and articles and they all seem to bring up the importance of supplementing with Magnesium.  Topical is the recommended method.  I am using this to help me sleep better.  I spray it on my skin and it starts to tingle and itch slightly.  The itch eventually goes away and from what I understand it is an indicator that you are lacking Magnesium.  So far I have definitely slept harder than normal.  So I&#x27;m guessing that this Magnesium Oil is the reason.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any relief of foot pain as described.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have elbow tendonitis &amp; within a few minutes the pain is almost gone.</li>
            <li> Well, I have had this for a few weeks now and have used it daily &amp; I have to say.....I haven&#x27;t noticed a thing different. I&#x27;m very sad too as I had some high hopes but I&#x27;m not getting anything. Not even itchiness. I went easy on it the first 2 days diluting it since all the comments about itchiness but I experienced none. Which that part is good of course. Now, I spray the stuff, full strength, onto my sore arm muscle, my sore feet, have a back rubs with it and more and I&#x27;m using about 20 pumps altogether at once! 5 on each foot, 5 on my arm then lightly rubbed in and then about 5 squirts on my back for my husband to rub in. I had my blood work tested a few weeks ago and was found to be pretty deficient in mag so thought for sure I&#x27;d get something out of it since they say the itchiness is from being deficient. I&#x27;ll keep trying it. I&#x27;ll at least use up the bottle. As for the spray itself, I don&#x27;t notice any &amp;#34;salty&amp;#34; or grit feeling ever left behind and it&#x27;s not real oily but just slightly so it&#x27;s nice to use, especially for back rubs. I just really wanted it to work for something. :-/</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described. It has only been a few weeks but I can see a true difference in my hands and feet. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I just really started to use this. There is no smell. I will get back to say more if/when I notice  anything better or worse.</li>
            <li> yes i do believe I feel more consistent energy;  as per the internet site I read i am using topical iodine as well as magnesium oil.  I feel more energetic thru out the day.  As for the other claims time will tell.  John boy</li>
            <li> Great product.  helped me get my magnesium level back to where it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a small amount on my feet as suggested. No itching at all.  I felt calm and left it on for 20 minutes.  After washing it off my feet felt silky and sparkly clean. I slept extremely well that night and could stretch my feet easily without any cramping. I&#x27;ve been using it daily ever since. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used magnesium oil in the past but always stopped because the residue was so annoying.  This product leaves a residue but it is not bothersome.  Much nicer to use.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for reducing my muscle aches and pains in my neck and back!!  When wrote a message to a member of this company with some questions regarding the product, she was so kind and helpful in answering.  I&#x27;m very happy and impressed with the quality of the product and the company itself!  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I spray this on after towel drying from a shower, spray it on, rub it in and let it air dry. It does burn a little but it is a small price to pay for the relief in my pain. Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Product feels as described, but I had no itching or ill effects.  But, sadly, it did not solve the pain in my leg.  I put it on the bottoms of my feet at bedtime.  It is said to absorb best through the feet.  I have no idea what that is supposed to do.  No noticeable changes.  Sorry it has not helped me so far.  It was recommended by a friend to resolve muscle pain and RLS. I do have RLS.  Not sure if the leg issue is muscle related.  So sad.</li>
            <li> I love this magnesium oil. My husband and I spray it on our feet at night. I love the information that came with it as well. They e-mailed a booklet of information about magnesium oil. It was very helpful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now.  It works well just be careful to read the directions.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...no foot or leg cramps as of yet. Would recommend .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad and mom it seems to be working on my dad for  shoulder/arm pain. It makes him itchy but if he rubs it in really good for about 5 min it goes way.</li>
            <li> The product has noticeably reduced my leg cramps!</li>
            <li> I have used this product as recommended for about a week, and I have significantly less joint pain.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Really helps you relax at night!</li>
            <li> Arrived fast! felt pleasant, cooling sensation upon spraying on soles of my feet. Second ,third day I sprayed on my shoulders , legs after showering, rubbed in. Eased my neck, shoulder heaviness, helped me to relax ,sleep sounder! Hasn&#x27;t caused itchiness, and I have sensitive skin. My shoulders have been aching  toward evening, this has relieved it , I&#x27;m really happy to have found it. Even tried on my scalp for the recommended 20 min. After shampooing, my hair is softer, conditioned feeling. I will buy this again for certain, it&#x27;s wonderful! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use instead of using harsh chemical laden deodorant and it is amazing! Just a few pumps on each armpit and i am stink free for up to 48hrs and as a busy mom of 6 this is so fantastic! Plus im reaping all the benefits of magnesium without any extra steps in my day to day routine.</li>
            <li> I was provided a free sample of this product for review. I had no previous experience with magnesium oil.  The product itself shipped quickly and came attractively packaged. The oil comes in a spray-on format and absorbs quickly into the skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. As a former athlete, I do suffer from some joint pain and general body soreness. I tried to concentrate the spray in those problem areas on a daily basis. After one month, I have noticed some mild relief with the joint pain. I would recommend this product to anyone suffering from joint pain or aches who have tried other remedies without success. This may just provide the relief you are looking for!</li>
            <li> I’ve never tried magnesium oil–nor have I even heard of it–until I was sent this product for review. I was curious, so I did some research on it and apparently it has a bunch of health benefits, with the most notable ones being better sleep, stress relief, and better digestion. Some of the studies done have found that ~70% of Americans consume less than the recommended dose of magnesium, and this topical magnesium oil should help with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my personal experience, I have been sleeping well and feeling pretty good after using it, but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it was because of this magnesium oil. There are just too many variables when it comes to digestion and sleeping like better exercise or a better diet. Also, what works for one person might not work for another. Anyways, with that in mind, I’ll write down some of my observations after 2 weeks of using this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ It seems to work best after a hot shower, as that’s when my skin was the softest and most absorbent.&lt;br /&gt;+ I would compare it to rubbing salt water on yourself rather than an oil–it leaves a layer of salt on your skin after it dries that you can’t see but you can feel. I accidentally applied it to a small wound this one time, and it burned like salt water would.&lt;br /&gt;+ Instructions say to rub it on your feet, especially on the bottom of your feet. That made me feel itchy (but only slightly…), which is apparently a sign of magnesium deficiency (oh no!)&lt;br /&gt;+ It doesn’t really have a smell. I tried smelling it once after rubbing it on my feet and smelled… my feet.&lt;br /&gt;+ I haven’t experienced any negative side effects since using this product.&lt;br /&gt;+ It feels a bit funny having salt on your skin, but it’s also oddly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, my advice with health supplements is to try them if you think you need them. In this case, if you think you need magnesium (usually found naturally in cocoa, leafy greens like spinach, and nuts), it wouldn’t hurt to try this out. Most of these supplements rarely have negative side effects, and if it doesn’t work–well you don’t ever have to buy it again.uldn’t hurt to try this out. Most of these supplements rarely have negative side effects, and if it doesn’t work–well you don’t ever have to buy it again.</li>
            <li> My Dr. suggested I purchase this to use on neuropathy and headaches, also sore muscles. Thus far I am pleased with the results. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic  product and I&#x27;m so grateful to have it! Not only did it come extemely fast, it works fast.  This is an excellent natural solution to joint and muscle pain, a chronic thing for me. It works quite miraculously! This helped where other natural or rx  topicals did not.  I would not want to be without this product and will reorder.</li>
            <li> I am using the magnesium spray for muscle aches mostly in my low back and hips and I can feel relief almost immediately.  I also use it at night to help with sleep and it does help me to relax. This is one product I would and do recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great....no problems here!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! It is exactly as they describe and they give tips on how to use it.</li>
            <li> This product works well for my purposes. I mix it with lavender essential oil and spray it on my kids when they go to bed. They seem to settle down more quickly. I use it as well for sleep purposes. I have also noticed that my joints don&#x27;t feel achy since I&#x27;ve been using it. Might be a coincidence, but I&#x27;m open to it not being one. It does sting a little because of the salt content, but mixing it with grape seed oil or water helps.</li>
            <li> It works but I dont like the  &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; sensation on my skin</li>
            <li> Very light oil, absorbs quickly. I recommend this product very highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other brand of magnesium oil, so I can&#x27;t compare but this seems to be good quality. I use it in a recipe for natural deodorant and it works very well. Only mild stinging after shaving, which was my biggest concern. Works pretty good for minor muscle aches too. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a great headache cure!  I decided to try magnesium oil to get some relief for my migraine. It’s amazing! The headaches are gone! loving it! spray the bottom of my feet, my forehead and neckI</li>
            <li> The product arrived more quickly than expected, which was a nice surprise. I used it the last few weeks of my pregnancy to help me sleep and to ward off leg and foot cramps. It did the job and I am so pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Has made a huge difference in my lower back pain. I use twice a day. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The package arrive to Mexico City before I even expected it! Super good. I have been using it for 3 weeks now and feel some benefits, my mood is more stable. This was a suggestion from a friend in another country and so far I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve tried it, looking forward for its full potential :)</li>
            <li> This product is a must-have for people with restless leg syndrome.  I have struggled with this for years and took prescription medication for over 5 years before taking myself off it due the terrible side effects.  I still have restless legs, but use a variety of natural supplements and vitamins to control my symptoms.  Some nights are worse than others.  Spray this oil generously and massage on your legs before bed, it works great.  The bottle is very large and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much from this product when I ordered it but it is really working for me.  I am now sleeping through the night without my legs bothering me at all.  So grateful I found this.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff! My husband and I are both seniors so we have lots of unexplained aches and pains. With the magnesium oil we just spray, rub it in and in a few minutes the pain is gone! I woke up the other night with leg cramps, got up and sprayed my legs rubbed it in, got back in bed and went right back to sleep. Any other time I would have been walking the floors the rest of the night. My son is using it for migraines and said it really helps if he uses it in time. I have started walking every morning and if I have any place that hurts when I get back, I just spray with the oil and it&#x27;s gone. I am recommending it to all my friends!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product it worked for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for restless legs; based on the reviews I thought I would try it out. The first time I sprayed it on it felt like it was burning so I wiped it off. Then I tried it again and it was itching to the point it drove me crazy so I again wiped it off and started the return process. Then I read the instructions and it says it’s normal. Normal? If that’s normal I will stick with taking magnesium pills but apparently those aren’t as effective. I chatted with my wife and she stated the same thing happened. SO the next day I decided to read the instructions and spray my legs with it, somehow taking the crazy itching and burning and then after 20 minutes rinse it off (or try their other product with Aloe Vera. ) So I did. I sprayed my legs went nearly insane waiting for the absorption so I could get some sleep, waited for about 7 minutes couldn’t take it anymore and jumped in the shower. Then I told my wife and she said “oh I tried it again and you just rub it in with that Aveno lotion” Oh… So I tried it and voila! It worked with no crazy itching. I still feel a very very slight itching in certain locations but it went away after 15 minutes or so. Got a great night sleep! Simple.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product at first, but I discovered a big issue after a few days....my sheets are ruined.  While I wasn&#x27;t looking for it, I didn&#x27;t see any mentioning of sheets/comforters being discolored after use.  I did my best to &amp;#34;air out&amp;#34; before getting fully into bed...but unless I did something wrong, or my sheets are just the wrong type, mine have funky orangish blotches all over (since I applied over a significant part of my body).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it worked well as far as helping my sleep goes.  And I suffered zero itchiness (dunno if that&#x27;s good or bad, since I had read itchiness indicates not enough magnesium in the system and I assumed I was deficient).  I suffer from chronic complex sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome, as well as chronic cervicogenic tension headaches...so magnesium is always recommended for me...though I&#x27;ve rarely seen improvements from magnesium pills.  I fell fast asleep using this, but the ruined sheets means I haven&#x27;t used it beyond the first few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend, but maybe test on your sheets (like new detergents, etc) first...you&#x27;ll appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Product does what it says in description.  Very good.</li>
            <li> This is the  first  time I  used  this  product  but I have  used similar  products  from other  companies. I did  know  that  they  work but this seems to be a  much better delivery  system  and it  works  really well!  Not to mention you  definitely  get  more for your  money  with this  company!</li>
            <li> I got my product in great condition!  It really works well.  If you are low on magnesium, and most of us are, you need this.  M</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a large bottle of magnesium oil.  It&#x27;s a plastic bottle with a good sprayer that works well to deliver a fine mist of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Putting it on is easy - I have been using it after my shower or bath and just spraying myself down.  It is not scented at all.  The oil is very fine and not heavy.  I don&#x27;t find it in the least bit unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I could taste magnesium.  I have a bit of slight burning at times though it does not last long.  For me the burning is very subtle, a bit like alcohol can do sometimes with a body spray if the skin is a bit red or irritated, but it does subside very quickly.  After that firt time, I never tasted the magnesium again.  I am sure I did not get it in my mouth- I suspect that was just some absorbtion related phenomenon.  It didn&#x27;t taste bad- I&#x27;ve been taking the supplements and it was just a bit like that and it passed in about 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it has increased my energy somewhat, but mostly it has helped my sleep.  I&#x27;ve slept much better and for longer periods of time since I started using this.  I have difficulty sleeping for more than an hour or two at a time normally, but since I&#x27;ve been using this I am often sleeping 5 or more hours at once.  I think that is increasing my energy levels a lot.  I had never dreamed that magnesium would help my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I mainly got it because my husband often has leg cramps, and to see if it would help my body aches, but I thought I&#x27;d try it to see if it helped my autoimmunity problems. It did not affect my autoimmune problems one way or the other that I could tell. I didn&#x27;t have any sort of decrease in back pain I have at times.  As for his leg cramps, my husband has only been willing to get a spray down about one every 3-4 days, but he has not had a single leg cramp once we started using the oil.  It was an ongoing issue for him due to a very physical job and his love of a couple of beers every night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.  I&#x27;ll buy it again when I run out.  If hubby does have leg cramps, it will be so much easier to just grab the oil and spray his legs than have to get up in the middle of the night looking for juice and bananas and quinine water.  I&#x27;m appreciating the increased sleep time.t before bed.    I like it.  I&#x27;ll buy it again when I run out.

            <li> this really works for pain. (my skin is sensitive so it does itch slightly until it dries - may order the one with aloe.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you are looking for a way to get skin moisture and get magnesium;</li>
            <li> Really works for muscle cramping....leaves a slight residue that can be itchy....</li>
            <li> Still working on this product, a little itchy when using to much of it.</li>
            <li> Very high quality Magnesium oil.  Price is great, especially for the size!!</li>
            <li> Product is a exactly as described. I have been rubbing on the bottom of my feet right before bedtime. I seem to fall asleep faster. I have not experienced any itching with this product. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have had a terrible time for the last 3 years falling to sleep. I have A fib. which is an irregular heart beat ,so I could not sleep. I have been using this every night for about 2 weeks and I have slept sound . I also bought the book The Magnesium Miracle , by Carolyn Dean. It tells you just how  magnesium plays an important part in your body. I will be buying more of this oil. I spray about 8 squirts on my feet and rub it in. The reason you put it on your feet because it goes into the blood steam faster. Then just go to sleep with it on. It also goes a long ways. If it stings a little at first you can leave it on for 20 minutes then rinse it off ( mine never did sting, but some people complained that it stung a little).</li>
            <li> WOW!  Im totally surprised!  The first night was super itchy/tingly.  But they said that would happen if you were deficient.  Even with all that, I slept better than I have in years.  I have a TON more energy, and just overall feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been a few days of using it nightly and it doesnt tingle so bad anymore, which (I think) means that Im getting to a more normal level of mag.  I just overall feel so much better.  I didnt even use that much. This bottle will last a long time, and you bet I will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night ALL of it absorbed into my skin. Since then ive been absorbing less, so I just rinse off after about 20 minutes, because it gets a little sticky. In a few days, I will probably only use it every other day or so to maintain.  Great product!  Im glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I Love it, i spray it on my feet, i have chronic pain all over my body i spray everywhere i can reach and rub.  If i can then i have even duck taped on the door jam so i get those hard to reach place like the middle of my back.  I got the 2nd bottle for my dad and he is a amputee and is bed bound so on his stump, his shoulder blade, neck.  WONDERFUL STUFF ......  NO MORE PAIN PILLS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Laura Hauser-Jaques  8-13-2015</li>
            <li> This product is very effective at alleviating aches and pains and is especially good for menstrual cramps. I will admit the itchiness it causes makes me use it less frequently than I would like to (hence the four star rating) but that can be helped by simply showering 20 minutes after application. Now I just need to remember to spray it on 20 minutes before I shower.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I get severe muscle spams in my back and this magnesium oil completely relaxes them. I even put some in a small bottle with a roller applicator, in case I need it while out &amp; about, just be sure to place it in a plastic bag before putting it in your bag or purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product but I&#x27;m very happy with the quality, customer service and level of information they offer about the product. I appreciated the follow up email with tips on how to use the product for best results.</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;m sleeping so much better now. Overall I feel better too.</li>
            <li> I love this product. it does work. :)</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:cee1f5b845bfae9bc5558419a23f8e88]] I am profoundly surprised at the effectiveness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received an email from this company asking me to review this, promoting it as some as a healing agent: relieving pain, like aches and pains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bad knees.  I&#x27;ve always had problems bending and kneeling, even as a teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I received this bottle last weekend, I casually sprayed my knees about 15 minutes before going to bed that Saturday night. What I didn&#x27;t expect was that I would feel a lot less pain in my knee joint less than half an hour later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work at an exporting company during the week and my main  responsibility is to inspect higher-end tech products that&#x27;ll be shipped to Central and South America.  I&#x27;m constantly bending and walking for 8 hours a day.  This product has relieved joint pains that I experience in doing this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days after, I let a few of my co-workers try out this product by spraying it on the areas that they&#x27;re often feeling the most pain and the consensus is, is that this product is a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m both surprised by the efficacy and by how fast it works.  There&#x27;s no odor and it dries with no residue and has the consistency of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and HIGHLY recommended for reducing exterior bodily aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I suffer from vitamin and mineral deficiencies, including magnesium. When I take magnesium supplements orally, it is hard to balance the positive physical effects with the unfortunate digestive componants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not know magnesium came in a spray. I&#x27;ve had other treatments absorbed through my skin, but this one is new to me. The bottle is a spray bottle, much like I have for my hair products. The oil is light and easily absorbs into the skin. I can let it air-dry or rub it in. It leaves behind the salts described in the item description, but I do not find them itchy or bothersome. I don&#x27;t wash off the salts, unless I plan to go out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results have been interesting. I can&#x27;t say that the oil reduced my headaches, but it sure does make my neck and shoulders less tense during a headache, which likely reduces the duration of the headache. I also apply it before a workout for extra endurance during exercise. I&#x27;ve had fewer back cramps and charlie horses since beginning this product, and their occurances continues to decrease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from migraines, fibromyalgia, a twisted spin, and a handful of other conditions, and I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for quality testing purposes. I hope you found my review helpful.</li>
            <li> didnt work for my restless leg...</li>
            <li> Many people have a magnesium deficiency and don’t realize this and many symptom, like from stress, are the same. Magnesium also can help the body heal, if you notice Epsom salts is magnesium that we soak in to relieve achy muscles and such. The problem is who has time to soak in the bath, I for one don’t. This is where magnesium oil comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium oil is not an oil, it is more of a brine. So, when you use it you may have an itchy, burning feeling. That is a side effect from use. So, if you have sensitive skin you may want to spot test before just spraying yourself. I also find that there is a little residue left behind where ever you spray it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium oil can help with painful and sore muscles, headaches, and can help you relax. I used this on my back, which was hurting this morning. Most of the pain was gone within 30 – 60 minutes of use. Now if I really stretch I can feel a twinge but my back feels pretty good. I had a bad cramp in my calf the other morning. I sprayed the magnesium oil on it and within 30-60 min the pain was gone and gone for 2 days. It started to twinge this morning so I put more oil on it and the pain is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that everyone add magnesium oil to their medicine cabinet. You also want to make sure you have a high quality and I think Seven Minerals has a great quality product and price for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Kovacich&lt;br /&gt;Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle! I was a little skeptical at the claims this oil has, yet I decided to give it a try anyway and I am literally blown away at how great this product actually DOES work My husband uses it every day as well and now he can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothy, not sticky.  I use it on my feet and legs, aids sleep, and I have neuropathy it gives some sensation on my feet after I apply it. I love the product.</li>
            <li> I got another bottle for my grandmother for her body aches but she hasn&#x27;t used it yet. Although my sis is still using her bottle after 3weeks and it&#x27;s still working for her and she has MS.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great way to get the Magnesium I needed to lessen leg and foot cramps.  Because I was experiencing some itching with the product, I used the spray on the bottoms of my feet, which helped with that.  I have noticed the skin on my feet is now very dry, due to the salt water I expect. You may want to use a good moisturizer along with the spray.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m loving the magnesium oil, easy to use just spray it on every night, I got it for health reasons a lot of food loses magnesium in the processing</li>
            <li> Great, second bottle purchased, has helped relieved pain from my legs and feet and my nails never looked better.</li>
            <li> I had my husband test this since he suffers from chronic pains in his back and joints. He used it a few times and said the pains did subside so it does work. He&#x27;s used many different products and although this works, he can&#x27;t get past the stickiness this product leaves behind on his skin if he applies too much. He continues to use it when he feels he needs help in lessening aches and pains but he tends to run towards the Doterra Deep Blue rub instead. His biggest gripe was the drying time. He only applied a spray here and there and it took so long to dry so he could lay down in bed without getting this stuff all over the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could very well be that we&#x27;re in Hawaii and we&#x27;ve got humidity to deal with. It could be a contributing factor to this oil taking a while to dry up or be absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a big bottle and has no scent or color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a free sample for my honest review.</li>
            <li> One of the latest health crazes is Pure Magnesium Oil. There are hundreds of benefits being credited to this supplement, and this is why it&#x27;s getting a reputation for being called a miracle oil. Most of us are deficient in magnesium which has been linked with numerous health issues:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depression&lt;br /&gt;Fatigue&lt;br /&gt;Sleep problems&lt;br /&gt;Migraine&lt;br /&gt;Cluster headaches&lt;br /&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;br /&gt;Premenstrual syndrome&lt;br /&gt;Chest pain (angina)&lt;br /&gt;Hypertension&lt;br /&gt;Type II diabetes&lt;br /&gt;Asthma&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be effective, Magnesium oil must be as pure as possible. I have been using Magnesium oil for over a month now, and I am loving it. I have noticed that my migraine headaches have been reduced in frequency and impact. I live in Alberta and our autumns, winters, and springs bring Chinook winds and changes in barometric pressure, thus causing migraines among many residents. I also noticed a marked increase in my energy levels and mood. I&#x27;m sleeping way better and I&#x27;m also experiencing an all-around feeling of well-being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word oil may be deceving, however, because it is very drying.  I had to vary the location of my body where I sprayed the oil as it leaves the skin extremely dry. The best place to spray is on the soles of the feet. I have also sprayed on my knee, in the underarm area, on my chest, and tummy. Once the oil dries, I apply lotion to keep the skin moist. An alternative is Magnesium oil with Aloe Vera. It is less drying, but also a little less strong and effective than the pure stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll find magnesium oil in use at many spas around the world, and it is now readily available for the consumer. I have been using a brand by Seven Minerals because it is tested and purified and in a natural state, and I&#x27;m definitely hooked. Used hand-in-hand with a good moisturizer, this is a wonderful supplment to add to your daily health regime. Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Helped my husband&#x27;s restless legs first time he used it.</li>
            <li> I made Magnesium foot rub with this item ,it mixed well and made the richest foot rub. I even made enough for daughter and friend with excellent results! Everyone slept well.</li>
            <li> Stopped my legs from hurting.</li>
            <li> This oil really helps when my leg muscles start to hurt! I have mild fibromyalgia and this really helps!</li>
            <li> I was holding off on writing a review so I could leave an accurate one. I have been using this spray (on my feet, legs and abdomen) every night for a few weeks to go to sleep (faster). I really enjoy this product. I will say the first 3-4 times I used this I got this weird tingling/itching but do not experience that any more. On the back of the bottle on the label it says you may experience this due to your body lacking magnesium or to try their spray with aloe. This oil is like a dry oil it does not leave a oily residue which is nice!</li>
            <li> This product. . Was a disappointment.  I had a rare reaction to it ... Very uncomfortable itching and burning.  I has to give it to my brother who had no adverse reactions to it all.... :(( ughhhhh</li>
            <li> I never thought it would work, but I was offered this product to review and give my honest opinion. Since my wife has some health issues that create pains in her joints and muscles, I thought I had nothing to lose and gave it a try. The first night we got it, I massaged it on the bottom of her feet and around her knees and calves. The next day, she said her legs felt pretty good!!! She hasn&#x27;t said that in a while. I was really amazed. It does not seem to have helped her sleep (yet) but that doesn&#x27;t matter much, as she is quite happy not having the pain in her legs. She did say that she felt a bit of burning and itching feeling. Again, she could care less since it seems to work. It looks like we are hooked. Interestingly, she has not had a migraine since she started using it. We are impressed! It is great that it comes in a pump, this makes it easy to apply without getting it all over or dripping it everywhere.</li>
            <li> This Magnesium Oil is great! I must admit that I have not used it all over , but did rub it on my feet and experienced no itching or other discomfort. My calves were hurting one day and I rubbed some of the oil on my calves and soon after the pain went away. Where I am boasting about this oil is I have had a back ache in which I pulled some muscles in my back and in that respect this oil is great! I rubbed the oil on my aching back, and 20 minutes later, the pain was gone! I could not believe it worked that well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on a headache one time and it relieved it worked very well.  I don&#x27;t care if the Magnesium Oil doesn&#x27;t do anything else, relieving the pain in my back is one fantastic consequence of using the oil and it will keep a permanent spot in my medicine chest from now on. A great product for relieving muscle pain or headaches and I love it!</li>
            <li> If you have muscle cramps or maybe even bursitis (as I do), you need your muscles to relax and ease up on those joints, otherwise you live with a lot of pain. I tried several different rubs, exercises, stretches, to no avail, until I found this stuff. Applying it morning and night, according to instructions, makes your muscles relax and life becomes much more tolerable. Unbelievable how well this stuff worked for me. Highly recommended. By the way, if it makes you itch too much, try the magnesium oil with aloe vera, also made by Seven Minerals. Good stuff.</li>
