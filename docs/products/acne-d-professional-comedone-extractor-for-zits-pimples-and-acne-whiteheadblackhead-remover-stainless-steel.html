    <ol>
            <li>This product works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be scared off by the price the heads are very good for picking up the pus and blackheads out of the pores.</li>
            <li>Hurts but works, I use it with a toner and the results are great.</li>
            <li>great item and size is also great.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price</li>
            <li>keep the grubby finger germs off your skin - this gently &amp; effectively removes the yuck!  </li>
            <li>Good tool to have at home.</li>
            <li>Good for blackheads, but smears infection under the skin for anything else.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but if you&#x27;ve ever used one of these you know it takes a good deal of pressure to get anything to happen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working good.</li>
            <li>this is made from good quality steel,&lt;br /&gt;Basic, fairly unbreakable.</li>
            <li>Its good quality.happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Its so good my husband steals it from me to use it.</li>
            <li>my face feel nice</li>
            <li>Better than what you will find at Wal-Mart for sure!</li>
            <li>It can get addicting though and you can damage your skin so extract at your own risk &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Perfect for Professional use on clients.</li>
            <li>This one seems to work better than some others I have tried, mostly because it is thinner and not bulky</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>You have to be able to know to use these</li>
            <li>It worked much better than squeezing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I will probably order even more just so my friends can have one.</li>
            <li>Take better care of you skin and you won&#x27;t need this product.</li>
            <li>My fingers work better</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many pimples just every now and then....</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Make sure to disinfect it continuously.</li>
            <li>I need a better tool for blackheads.</li>
            <li>its surprising how much junk is in there.</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to grip and manipulate.</li>
            <li>It works deep into the pore and gets the comedones out beautifully.</li>
            <li>We watched the video, as suggested on the packaging, and attempted to use it on what I thought was the PERFECT candidate of a little blemish.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve had much more success with the thinner end.</li>
            <li>A rounded handle, whether with grips or smooth, would be a huge design improvement.</li>
            <li>I originally paid $18 for the tweezerman one at sephora.  </li>
            <li>You need to keep the extractor clean</li>
            <li>to clean</li>
            <li>Clean, morning and night.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, didn&#x27;t get a lot of stuff</li>
            <li>Not the most pleasant way to remove black heads.</li>
            <li>It is probably a good product, but I bought it expecting it to be 7 &amp;#34; and it is only 5.....</li>
            <li>If you have larger pimples that you want to squeeze out in a sterile manner this is a good tool.</li>
            <li>High quality, much better than is the grocery store.</li>
            <li>Clean the extractor with hot water and soap or rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>This thing is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun to see the gunk that comes out of your pores.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m golden.  </li>
            <li>Not much to it really.&lt;br /&gt;Price was pretty good too.</li>
            <li>But this one works extremely well and is easy to use!!</li>
            <li>Once whitehead is extracted, the extractor actually wasn&#x27;t able to clear out all of the whitehead, which can cause more bacterial build up.</li>
            <li>This model has a more oval shape extractor head than a round extractor head which I love.</li>
            <li>works pretty well and makes it</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t need to touch my face as much, which decreases the need to use it!</li>
            <li>find it easiest to use this product when I get out of a hot shower</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re pretty</li>
            <li>I have yet to be able to actually extract a blackhead with this.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Both ends are better suited to regular or large pores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this more expensive one is superior to a cheaper version.</li>
            <li>Bought this, but instructional video really wasn&#x27;t very helpful, io have to have my esthetician show me how to use it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and has left no marks or bruises.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the tool can be held easy, you can reach around yourself to get the ones on your back using a mirror.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they are really large.</li>
            <li>It almost seems like the diameter of the opening is just too large.</li>
            <li>good quality and hard</li>
            <li>Guess I thought this tool would help me release the bacteria in my pimples without me picking at them and creating big huge holes.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work for blackhead removal.</li>
            <li>- very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ehh! doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me</li>
            <li>it is sturdier than one you would get at your local pharmacy but the design just looks cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a medical-grade piece of equipment that works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have much fewer scars.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s stainless steal</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this tool very helpful and wish I avoided it.</li>
            <li>It honestly doesn&#x27;t work like you&#x27;d think it would ... waste of money IMO.</li>
            <li>This particular extractor is a bit bulky on both ends.</li>
            <li>My wife has the Tweezerman version and I like it better only because it is a bit smaller in size than the Acne-d version.</li>
            <li>And I have a mess that can take two or more weeks to resolve.&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality construct</li>
            <li>I find it gets the job done better than the round extractor head.</li>
            <li>With practice, this is a wonderful tool to keep pores clear of ugly blackheads.</li>
            <li>Often I find myself getting frustrated while using it and resorting to squeezing with my fingers, because it is more effective.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have always been skeptical about doing my own facials at home, but after purchasing this tool, I have saved so much money not getting facials!</li>
            <li>THis works out great for getting those hard to get black heads (like where your nose and face meet).</li>
            <li>This just allows your pores to open more for a less invasive skin marking when going after these unwanted things however since your not using your fingers anymore this already helps decrease marks.</li>
            <li>And it will only get certain ones.</li>
            <li>Then when I am done with the extractor I get a clean cotton ball and put toner on it and wipe down the areas I just extracted.</li>
            <li>The loops on this are large and do net apply pressure correctly near blackhead.</li>
            <li>Less effective than other extractors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my pores clear.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is weighty and feels like a quality tool - just don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>We have tried other implements without success.  </li>
            <li>seriously - I need more words than that?</li>
            <li>have extremely fine pore structure, so messing with a pimple can make it much worse really fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Notes&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect for getting the blackheads on the side of your nose and chin if you just run the tool down a few times after a hot shower every couple days and use a toner, it really allows for less noticeable breakouts and blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;-Works better for pores than those fancy brushes on tv or online you probably read about.</li>
            <li>I find I have to apply more pressure to get results (which is kind of painful), unlike other products I have used for those stubborn pimples in the corner of the nose.</li>
            <li>Now, i only pop them if they are ready, and i use this tool ONLY to extract it.</li>
            <li>Not small enough for blackheads.</li>
            <li>You have to press hard and it leaves a huge mark on your face.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use it too much because it can bruise your face if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>this painful little torture device works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s solid and heavy and worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little tool is pretty neat.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of them with minimal swelling (I have very sensitive skin)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Gets rid of them with minimal swelling (I have very sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> Learning the right technique does take a few tries.</li>
            <li> High quality craftsmanship, not a cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I never seem to use the flat end</li>
            <li> The flat end works alright,</li>
            <li> The body stem is a square flat shape</li>
            <li> wont completely rid you of acne, but i guarantee it will reduce the amount and severity of pimples and black heads.</li>
            <li> The picture looks like one end would work for large pores and the other for small pores.</li>
            <li> In other words I use this extractor on areas of my face where problems are known to crop up, such as around the nose and over the chin.</li>
            <li> I really thought that, for the price, this would be a cheap piece of crap that&#x27;d fall apart on me within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I looked into this a few different times before buying, and finally took the plunge on Prime Day.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to remove blackheads with either end, and I have had only limited success using this to pop whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Kinda weird, but helps get black heads out easily without scarring.</li>
            <li> In desperation, I finally broke down and bought it, then braced for disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Loops are too big to extract black  heads.</li>
            <li> So I thought this might help with leaving less red marks, etc.</li>
            <li> i hate the pain but love the results!</li>
            <li> It is a little gross sometimes with the amount of stuff that come out.</li>
            <li> This thing works great, I use it after showers and baths around my nose where I get the worst of the oils.</li>
            <li> More painful than anything.</li>
            <li> This works as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen, but still get a few blackheads/whiteheads, so I use this weekly when I give myself a facial.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly no miracle tool - there are plenty of blackheads / whiteheads it can&#x27;t take on.</li>
            <li> perhaps it is due to lack of experience</li>
            <li> I returned the other one.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how to explain where the other 2 inches went....</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s pretty uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> but I got it for the other loop end and that one hurts without it even working.</li>
            <li> Was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> and the swelling goes down after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I mean, for those who complain your skin gets red</li>
            <li> Takes little pressure and will target problem areas, just don&#x27;t press to hard on any area because any metal product can hurt or tear skin if not used properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We ended up having to push way too hard, it hurt like hell, and ended up leaving little red marks for almost 2 days!!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it to remove black heads.</li>
            <li> With slight effort all the nastiness comes out without squeezing or pinching.  </li>
            <li> It worked, but kept bending slightly.</li>
            <li> From my attempts, it does nothing to remove either whiteheads or black heads.  </li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for at a price less than the stores.  </li>
            <li> if you use this instead of your fingers and stop trying to pop every little bump on your face, your skin will improve.</li>
            <li> not sure what the other side is for.  </li>
            <li> Since doing so, I have all but eliminated breakouts in trouble spots without traumatizing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clears my clogged pores without a problem and saves me from having to use harsh exfoliating products every day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the sharp edges of this will cut into your fingers if you&#x27;re using this with enough pressure to extract the dirt.</li>
            <li> Some of them I can push down so hard on and they still won&#x27;t come out...</li>
            <li> but they make my nose raw.</li>
            <li> I bought it regardless of the bad comments, and these really suck.</li>
            <li> Works sometimes but usually to get It to  </li>
            <li> They are too small for me to remove with my finger nails, but this does the trick.</li>
            <li> , well that&#x27;s what happens when you press something firmly against your skin!</li>
            <li> i have been getting adult stress acne like crazy lately and was always &amp;#34;popping&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in it, I was hoping for an easy to use piece of beauty equipment, but this is not it.</li>
            <li> Possibly I&#x27;m not using it correctly, but it&#x27;s not very good at extricating black heads and is prety painful to use.</li>
            <li> I have to press it so hard into my skin that I leave marks.</li>
            <li> At least the price was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I had high hopes for this to help address those pesky blemishes we all hate.  </li>
            <li> but seriously, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> your fingers leave behind tons of germs and grim (yes even if they are clean) that clogs pores.</li>
            <li> The square shape of the handle makes it a little awkward to hold</li>
            <li> leaves marks behind and isn&#x27;t something I would recommend</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> its a little painful</li>
            <li> I get these annoying black heads that no one can see</li>
            <li> our guilty pleasure, its sad but works like a charm</li>
            <li> does a dirty job well</li>
            <li> pops zits like crazy.</li>
            <li> I hate to send something that I&#x27;ve used back, but this was so terrible and traumatic...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne...</li>
            <li> I am really bad about picking at my skin.</li>
            <li> I broke out badly after using this.</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing because I bought this hoping to avoid picking my face and squeezing with fingers.</li>
            <li> I ran the loop over my nose and had crap coming out that I didn&#x27;t even know was there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work - very painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Loops are too big to extract black  heads. Was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well. hurts when we try to use it. leaves marks behind and isn&#x27;t something I would recommend</li>
            <li> This works as well as I expected. It&#x27;s certainly no miracle tool - there are plenty of blackheads / whiteheads it can&#x27;t take on. However, it does work well when it meets the proper match. I never seem to use the flat end - I&#x27;ve had much more success with the thinner end. Overall, it is weighty and feels like a quality tool - just don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> High quality craftsmanship, not a cheap piece of junk. Better than what you will find at Wal-Mart for sure!</li>
            <li> This thing works great, I use it after showers and baths around my nose where I get the worst of the oils. It can get addicting though and you can damage your skin so extract at your own risk &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Just seems to leave a big mark on my nose and no blackhead removed</li>
            <li> does a dirty job well</li>
            <li> Works sometimes but usually to get It to  I have to press it so hard into my skin that I leave marks. Not the most pleasant way to remove black heads. And it will only get certain ones. Some of them I can push down so hard on and they still won&#x27;t come out...I just end up with marks all over my face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work for blackhead removal. More painful than anything.</li>
            <li> Good tool to have at home.</li>
            <li> Hurts but works, I use it with a toner and the results are great. You need to keep the extractor clean so I use a cotton ball with toner on it to wipe the extractor in between pore usage. Then when I am done with the extractor I get a clean cotton ball and put toner on it and wipe down the areas I just extracted.</li>
            <li> Resist the TEMPTATION to skip steaming your face before using this tool!&lt;br /&gt;Steaming is key. It opens the pore structure on your face and improves the effectiveness of the extractor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are uncertain how to steam your face properly, check out YouTube there are plenty of videos that will show you how.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also check out videos on comedone extractors for techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely fine pore structure, so messing with a pimple can make it much worse really fast.  And I have a mess that can take two or more weeks to resolve.&lt;br /&gt;That said, his device allows me to open the pimple without making it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO SQUEEZIING. Wash your hands. Wash your face. Steam your face. Clean the extractor with hot water and soap or rubbing alcohol.  Run the extractor over the pimple. Wash your face again. NO SQUEEZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep everything - your hands and the extractor - very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending upon your circumstances, you may wish to repeat this process once or twice daily if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I use this extractor as a preventative device. In other words I use this extractor on areas of my face where problems are known to crop up, such as around the nose and over the chin. Since doing so, I have all but eliminated breakouts in trouble spots without traumatizing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars and not 5?  This particular extractor is a bit bulky on both ends. The picture looks like one end would work for large pores and the other for small pores. Not the case. Both ends are better suited to regular or large pores.</li>
            <li> Ehh! doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me</li>
            <li> This one seems to work better than some others I have tried, mostly because it is thinner and not bulky so you don&#x27;t bruise your skin. Takes little pressure and will target problem areas, just don&#x27;t press to hard on any area because any metal product can hurt or tear skin if not used properly.</li>
            <li> great item and size is also great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this.  I can&#x27;t get it to remove black heads.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, didn&#x27;t get a lot of stuff I wanted it to</li>
            <li> This little tool is pretty neat. i have been getting adult stress acne like crazy lately and was always &amp;#34;popping&amp;#34; pimples - which is a big no no if you are trying to get rid of acne. your fingers leave behind tons of germs and grim (yes even if they are clean) that clogs pores. Now, i only pop them if they are ready, and i use this tool ONLY to extract it. its a little painful but it does work. like i said though, they have to be &amp;#34;ready&amp;#34;. it does work wonders around the nostrils as well - its surprising how much junk is in there. i have eliminated creating scars and those monster scabs you get from using your fingers. if you use this instead of your fingers and stop trying to pop every little bump on your face, your skin will improve. wont completely rid you of acne, but i guarantee it will reduce the amount and severity of pimples and black heads.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty cool. I have blackheads on my nose and they are really large. I have used the Biore strips and they do work but they make my nose raw. I also have blackheads on my chin that the strips won&#x27;t pull out. This tool takes some pressure but it does push those out.</li>
            <li> ... I got what I paid for is all I can say. it is sturdier than one you would get at your local pharmacy but the design just looks cheap</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as the one the dermatologist uses</li>
            <li> Not small enough for blackheads. Works ok.</li>
            <li> This thing HURTS.  perhaps it is due to lack of experience but I don&#x27;t get enough blemishes to practice on so it will probably always hurt.</li>
            <li> It may work for others but it doesn&#x27;t work well for me.  I find I have to apply more pressure to get results (which is kind of painful), unlike other products I have used for those stubborn pimples in the corner of the nose.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-good quality&lt;br /&gt;-easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;-does what it&#x27;s supposed to&lt;br /&gt;-great for blackheads&lt;br /&gt;-makes my face feel nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Nothing really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchase it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun to see the gunk that comes out of your pores.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> Works well.  Came quality.</li>
            <li> Good for blackheads, but smears infection under the skin for anything else.</li>
            <li> Guess I thought this tool would help me release the bacteria in my pimples without me picking at them and creating big huge holes. i tried this several times and it just didn&#x27;t remove the dirt/bacteria, whatever that gross stuff is that makes a pimple. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work - very painful.</li>
            <li> This tool is helpful.</li>
            <li> works pretty well and makes it so i don&#x27;t need to touch my face as much, which decreases the need to use it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad acne...but a blackhead or whitehead here and there.  I originally paid $18 for the tweezerman one at sephora.  Once I saw this at this price...I returned the other one.  With slight effort all the nastiness comes out without squeezing or pinching.  I spritz with 99% alcohol before each use and I&#x27;m golden.  I only use one end though (smaller one) not sure what the other side is for.  Quality metal. Not flimsy at all</li>
            <li> It is probably a good product, but I bought it expecting it to be 7 &amp;#34; and it is only 5..... don&#x27;t know how to explain where the other 2 inches went.... I wanted a longer one to reach an area on my back.</li>
            <li> You have to be able to know to use these and I couldn&#x27;t seem to understand and you tube didn&#x27;t help me either.</li>
            <li> I get these annoying black heads that no one can see but I can feel and know they are there. They are too small for me to remove with my finger nails, but this does the trick. Gets rid of them with minimal swelling (I have very sensitive skin) and the swelling goes down after an hour or so. Clears my clogged pores without a problem and saves me from having to use harsh exfoliating products every day. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted. Poor quality.</li>
            <li> Maybe if it came with tips and instructions?</li>
            <li> It worked, but kept bending slightly. I prefer the old-school method of fingernails.</li>
            <li> High quality construct</li>
            <li> High quality, much better than is the grocery store.</li>
            <li> This sat in my cart for almost three weeks while I waffled on the decision. I really thought that, for the price, this would be a cheap piece of crap that&#x27;d fall apart on me within a couple of weeks. I did not believe that it would work. In desperation, I finally broke down and bought it, then braced for disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got it today and I was so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a medical-grade piece of equipment that works very well. I ran the loop over my nose and had crap coming out that I didn&#x27;t even know was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s solid and heavy and worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and has left no marks or bruises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never pop a zit again. I wish I&#x27;d bought this a decade ago. I&#x27;d have much fewer scars.</li>
            <li> this painful little torture device works great! i hate the pain but love the results!</li>
            <li> pops zits like crazy.</li>
            <li> good quality and hard</li>
            <li> keep the grubby finger germs off your skin - this gently &amp; effectively removes the yuck!  seriously - I need more words than that?</li>
            <li> Less effective than other extractors I&#x27;ve used. Difficult to remove blackheads with either end, and I have had only limited success using this to pop whiteheads. Often I find myself getting frustrated while using it and resorting to squeezing with my fingers, because it is more effective. This is very disappointing because I bought this hoping to avoid picking my face and squeezing with fingers. At least the price was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> THis works out great for getting those hard to get black heads (like where your nose and face meet). It is a little gross sometimes with the amount of stuff that come out.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly. I tried it out on a family members back. It worked much better than squeezing. It works deep into the pore and gets the comedones out beautifully. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> We have tried other implements without success.  But this one works extremely well and is easy to use!! I will order another one to keep in my travel case.</li>
            <li> I know this one works so well that two days after losing it, I had to order another one immediately. Don&#x27;t be scared off by the price the heads are very good for picking up the pus and blackheads out of the pores. Also it&#x27;s stainless steal so it won&#x27;t rust and it&#x27;s built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it easiest to use this product when I get out of a hot shower or I&#x27;m sweating like a dog. This just allows your pores to open more for a less invasive skin marking when going after these unwanted things however since your not using your fingers anymore this already helps decrease marks. I have noticed if you just do this without goosebumps you&#x27;re pretty set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect for getting the blackheads on the side of your nose and chin if you just run the tool down a few times after a hot shower every couple days and use a toner, it really allows for less noticeable breakouts and blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;-Works better for pores than those fancy brushes on tv or online you probably read about. I prefer this over my olay spinning brush.&lt;br /&gt;-Because the tool can be held easy, you can reach around yourself to get the ones on your back using a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;-I will probably order even more just so my friends can have one.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but if you&#x27;ve ever used one of these you know it takes a good deal of pressure to get anything to happen. Unfortunately, the sharp edges of this will cut into your fingers if you&#x27;re using this with enough pressure to extract the dirt. It works, but it&#x27;s pretty uncomfortable to use. A rounded handle, whether with grips or smooth, would be a huge design improvement.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Possibly I&#x27;m not using it correctly, but it&#x27;s not very good at extricating black heads and is prety painful to use.</li>
            <li> Wow! Talk about hurt. Forget it. Take better care of you skin and you won&#x27;t need this product. Clean, morning and night.</li>
            <li> You really need a round extractor to place force all around the blackhead or pimple. The loops on this are large and do net apply pressure correctly near blackhead. You have to press hard and it leaves a huge mark on your face. Once whitehead is extracted, the extractor actually wasn&#x27;t able to clear out all of the whitehead, which can cause more bacterial build up. I have yet to be able to actually extract a blackhead with this. My fingers work better and I&#x27;d rather not use my fingers to prevent scarring.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work...I don&#x27;t have many pimples just every now and then....had one pop up and instead of using my fingers...I pressed and pulled and the pimple burst...Love it</li>
            <li> I am really bad about picking at my skin. So I thought this might help with leaving less red marks, etc. From my attempts, it does nothing to remove either whiteheads or black heads.  It almost seems like the diameter of the opening is just too large. I&#x27;ve tried it after a shower too, but still no luck. I wish it worked, but now it is just sitting in the bottom of my drawer.</li>
            <li> Works well in removing blackheads. I almost wish the loop was smaller, and I have no use for the larger loop. I don&#x27;t see how this more expensive one is superior to a cheaper version. So you might go with a cheaper one if you are trying to save money. They all work the same.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for at a price less than the stores.  I am a senior citizen, but still get a few blackheads/whiteheads, so I use this weekly when I give myself a facial.  It helps keep my pores clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working good. I&#x27;m trying to sterilize it with alcohol whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> this is made from good quality steel,&lt;br /&gt;Basic, fairly unbreakable. Not much to it really.&lt;br /&gt;Price was pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I looked into this a few different times before buying, and finally took the plunge on Prime Day.  Don&#x27;t we all wish we could erase that day from our minds?!  Anyway, I had high hopes for this to help address those pesky blemishes we all hate.  We watched the video, as suggested on the packaging, and attempted to use it on what I thought was the PERFECT candidate of a little blemish.  It did not go well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ended up having to push way too hard, it hurt like hell, and ended up leaving little red marks for almost 2 days!!  I hate to send something that I&#x27;ve used back, but this was so terrible and traumatic... back in the mail it went.</li>
            <li> It does the job for surface ones but still doesn&#x27;t get the blackheads out from the root</li>
            <li> I bought it regardless of the bad comments, and these really suck. I mean, for those who complain your skin gets red, well that&#x27;s what happens when you press something firmly against your skin! The flat end works alright, but I got it for the other loop end and that one hurts without it even working. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the pain but seriously, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> our guilty pleasure, its sad but works like a charm</li>
            <li> Perfect for Professional use on clients. I am an esthetician and I use this on my clients. Its good quality.happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have always been skeptical about doing my own facials at home, but after purchasing this tool, I have saved so much money not getting facials! It is extremely easy to use. The body stem is a square flat shape so it is easy to grip and manipulate. This model has a more oval shape extractor head than a round extractor head which I love. I find it gets the job done better than the round extractor head. Its so good my husband steals it from me to use it. Be careful not to use it too much because it can bruise your face if you are not careful. With practice, this is a wonderful tool to keep pores clear of ugly blackheads.</li>
            <li> I broke out badly after using this. Make sure to disinfect it continuously. I don&#x27;t find this tool very helpful and wish I avoided it. I need a better tool for blackheads. If you have larger pimples that you want to squeeze out in a sterile manner this is a good tool.</li>
            <li> This product is very similar to the Tweezerman version and seems to work in a similar fashion. My wife has the Tweezerman version and I like it better only because it is a bit smaller in size than the Acne-d version.</li>
            <li> This skin tool didn&#x27;t work for me at all. The square shape of the handle makes it a little awkward to hold and I couldn&#x27;t extract anything using it.</li>
            <li> This item does not work at all.  I am very disappointed in it, I was hoping for an easy to use piece of beauty equipment, but this is not it.</li>
            <li> It honestly doesn&#x27;t work like you&#x27;d think it would ... waste of money IMO.</li>
            <li> Kinda weird, but helps get black heads out easily without scarring. Learning the right technique does take a few tries.</li>
            <li> Bought this, but instructional video really wasn&#x27;t very helpful, io have to have my esthetician show me how to use it!</li>
