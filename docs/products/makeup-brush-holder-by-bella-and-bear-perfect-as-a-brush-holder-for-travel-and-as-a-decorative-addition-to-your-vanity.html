            <li>I love how elegant they look on  my vanity and</li>
            <li>how many brushes they hold.</li>
            <li>I love that it is sturdy and tall.</li>
            <li>I picked out a cute 10 piece brush set I have and tried it out inside the brush holder.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;I was very excited to try this out because I can store all my brushes neatly and they will be protected my dust.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Bella and Bear as it is and love, love, love the design on their products.</li>
            <li>I love that on the sides of the holder there are snaps to make sure your brushes are safe and secure inside.  </li>
            <li>When I need to hit the road, whether it be a vacation or a overnight stay with my boyfriend all I need to do is attach the top, secure the snaps and throw in my overnight bag along with matching Bella &amp; Bear makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Overall, the floral design is very pretty, the quality is great and I would recommend this holder!</li>
            <li>Please note that when it arrived it did have a strong &amp;#34;new product&amp;#34; odor that did take a week, or two to fully air out and dissipate.  </li>
            <li>I love having a dressing table full of girly, glamorous accessories.</li>

            <li>I really love this makeup brush holder not only is it pretty, it holds most of my favorite makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bella and bear!!</li>
            <li>You can choose to keep the lid on the holder to keep your brushes safe and secure, or what I do is just leave the holder with my brushes open on the counter for easier access.</li>
            <li>The holder is tall enough to fit full-size brushes and even has a top so that you can take it with you on-the-go.  </li>
            <li>Long makeup brushes can fit inside and it has a captivating design.  </li>
            <li>The holder has snap button closures on each side of it which are very easy to open and to close.</li>
            <li>make up brush holder comes in a very cute box that has the same classic Bella &amp; Bear floral print as the holder itself.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it super pretty on my vanity, but it holds my 6 very fluffy makeup brushes perfectly airtight when packed for travel.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty and sturdy</li>
            <li>o have everything arranged and organized all prettily.</li>
            <li>It’s floral and feminine, and the colors are so pretty.</li>
            <li>It looks so pretty sitting on my makeup table.</li>
            <li>Bella &amp; Bear have certainly done it again.  </li>
            <li>This makeup brush holder certainly does not disappoint.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very feminine</li>
            <li>It was a little bigger than I expected but will be great for travel and may be able to hold a few more items.</li>
            <li>Bigger and sturdier than expected, very cute, clever design.</li>
            <li>Having a holder like this can be more convenient than a traditional makeup brush pouch because this type of holder makes the brushes easier to access, to remove from the holder and to put back.</li>
            <li>The case feels well made, of high quality materials.</li>
            <li>This brand makes high quality products that will be adored by me for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s printed inside and out with a pretty roses-on-polka-dots design that sort of harkens back to the 1950s.</li>
            <li>You can use it as one complete makeup holder or take it apart to make two separate holders.  </li>
            <li>This holder can fit quite a few brushes.  </li>
            <li>I am slowly but surely building up my Bella &amp; Bear collection.  </li>
            <li>I seriously have WAY too many makeup brushes and I have been storing them in a big ziplock bag.</li>
            <li>The holder is nice and tall to suit even long brushes, and it’s wide enough to hold quite a few brushes.</li>
            <li>As a makeup junkie I have lots of brushes but only a few are worthy to sit upon the throne of Bella &amp; Bear.  </li>

            <li> I love having a dressing table full of girly, glamorous accessories. It just makes me happy o have everything arranged and organized all prettily. I feel like Belle and the Bear just *gets* it. This makeup brush holder is a perfect example. It&#x27;s printed inside and out with a pretty roses-on-polka-dots design that sort of harkens back to the 1950s. The case feels well made, of high quality materials. It&#x27;s a worthy storage spot for all of our expensive brushes. The case itself snaps together on each side, the top comes off and your brushes can rest in the bottom cupholder. The case is also perfect for travel, since it safely encloses everything and can just be tossed into your luggage.

            <li> Attractive. Well made</li>
            <li> I never have enough space for all of my makeup brushes so this cup holder was a must have for me. I am a huge fan of Bella and Bear as it is and love, love, love the design on their products. the cup holder actually is two holders that snap shut to use for travel. I love how elegant they look on  my vanity and how many brushes they hold. I can&#x27;t wait to travel and use this as intended! This makeup brush cup holder is a MUST HAVE for any makeup guru in your life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>

            <li> Bella &amp; Bear have certainly done it again.  I am slowly but surely building up my Bella &amp; Bear collection.  I&#x27;m the proud owner of the makeup bag and now I have the makeup brush holder.  I love this brand and the collection is very cute and stylish.  As always Bella &amp; Bear pay attention to details big and small.  This makeup brush holder certainly does not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make up brush holder comes in a very cute box that has the same classic Bella &amp; Bear floral print as the holder itself.  This holder can fit quite a few brushes.  As a makeup junkie I have lots of brushes but only a few are worthy to sit upon the throne of Bella &amp; Bear.  I picked out a cute 10 piece brush set I have and tried it out inside the brush holder.  As you can see from the pictures the brushes match the holder perfectly, but that&#x27;s not what this review is about.  Even with 10 brushes in the holder there is still more room for another 10 brushes, maybe more. The holder is tall enough to fit full-size brushes and even has a top so that you can take it with you on-the-go.  I love that on the sides of the holder there are snaps to make sure your brushes are safe and secure inside.  This brush holder will sit on my vanity in style with the top off for all the world (or whoever comes into my room) to see the awesomeness that is Bella &amp; Bear, and how cute it matches my brushes.  When I need to hit the road, whether it be a vacation or a overnight stay with my boyfriend all I need to do is attach the top, secure the snaps and throw in my overnight bag along with matching Bella &amp; Bear makeup bag. This brand makes high quality products that will be adored by me for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. This brush holder is stylish and durable. I like to keep my brushes in the bathroom, so I wanted to protect them against moisture. Some of my brushes are too short, but that&#x27;s because they are not professional and came in the package with different shades and liners. Overall, the floral design is very pretty, the quality is great and I would recommend this holder!</li>
            <li> I seriously have WAY too many makeup brushes and I have been storing them in a big ziplock bag. I know it&#x27;s horrible but I just had no where to. Put them to keep them protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to try this out because I can store all my brushes neatly and they will be protected my dust. It snapped together nicely and hold a good amount. All of my high end brushes fit in here perfect. The material on the outside is very thick so there is no need to worry about it ripping. This is highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I received this at a promotional rate for review purposes, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with this makeup brush holder. It can be used as two separate cups,  or together forming one long enclosed cup.  Such a pretty design,  excellent quality, no funky smell.  It looks so pretty sitting on my makeup table.</li>
            <li> Great quality fabric and super sturdy enough to hold two sets of brushes (:</li>
            <li> I adore this case. I travel so often that it&#x27;s hard for me to find a sturdy, reliable holder for my brushes. This one is perfect! It&#x27;s cute, and it holds up well in a suitcase. At home, I unsnap the two halves and I have two brush holders in one!</li>
            <li> This is a very cute and functional makeup brush case! It was a little bigger than I expected but will be great for travel and may be able to hold a few more items.</li>
            <li> So cute! And nice quality too. Don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all</li>
