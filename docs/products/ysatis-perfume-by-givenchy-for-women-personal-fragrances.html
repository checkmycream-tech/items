            <li>I will continue to order more.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>Department stores aren&#x27;t carrying this scent any more, which makes this even more exotic.</li>
            <li>I went almost a year without one of my favorite scents</li>
            <li>Just love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>No matter what scents I find that I like, I still like this one better.  </li>

            <li>I am pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li>I have used this cologne for many years.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have to say it&#x27;s the most any woman&#x27;s fragrance</li>
            <li>The wife love the perpume a lot.</li>
            <li>After all these years and many new bottles, it still smells great on her</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this since I was young and beautiful</li>
            <li>The best parfum that I use from long time.</li>
            <li>The scent is brilliantly alive with a semi spicy woodsy note &amp; a beautiful floural waft of goodness.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping, and fantastic customer service.  </li>
            <li>It works for me in so many ways, but the most important is</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sad I can&#x27;t buy it in the stores any more, but I&#x27;m very happy I can buy it on Amazon through great Sellers.  </li>
            <li>I think that the formula has changed from the original, but it still has the floral tones that I love.  </li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>Also tried some other Givenchy perfumes which are also nice, but this is a favorite &amp; Amazon.com enabled me to get an excellent price, Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>and I was glad to find it on here for such a great price.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best scent!</li>
            <li>Perfume was delivered quickly!  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, when I am ready to buy again it will still be available!!  </li>
            <li>The price was fantastic for a bottle of this size, and with the free shipping the choice was easy.</li>
            <li>Your price is Fabulous.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic</li>
            <li>I hope Givenchy continues to make it available.</li>
            <li>Light and not cloying.</li>
            <li>She had not used it in years because she did not know it was still available.  </li>
            <li>On our first date, many moons ago, I commented on how nice a fragrance she was sporting, both elegant and soft, and not overly sweet, like many of the more neo modern Perfumes that are so strong, they seem like they should require an OSHA approved \\&quot;CAUTION- FLAMMABLE\\&quot;, warning and accompanying MSDS sheet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a floral, oriental scent, very intriguing.......</li>
            <li>(It doesn&#x27;t have that rich fragrance.)  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents ever it&#x27;s sweet and long wearing , every time I wear it I receive compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>I started using this fragrance many years ago as I have an allergy to most perfumes and this was the only one that not only smelled great, but also I was not allergic to it.</li>
            <li>I will have to use for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I wear it for special occassions.  </li>
            <li>but when i wanted a special scent for my daughter&#x27;s wedding, this came to mind.</li>
            <li>Got it for that special someone who was floored by the gift.</li>
            <li>Super excited to find it online and almost $30 cheaper than the perfume store.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it and ordering through Amazon makes it so easy to shop!  </li>
            <li>Shipping on this item was outstanding and we were amazed how fast, this order, arrived.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell so much.</li>
            <li>Everyone is always telling me how much they love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Unbelieveably fast, and one of my favorite \\&quot;gifts\\&quot; this holiday season.</li>
            <li>Sweet but not flowery.</li>
            <li>I buy my original Polo (a great cologne whose function lasts far beyond the targeted results of a shower), at Amazon as well, which IS available in most stores, but not the 8oz size, and certainly not as reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>My husband selected this as a gift a number of years ago, and I always come back to it after trying other scents - it is truly a favorite of ours with many happy memories.</li>
            <li>Lucky for us</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s classic and sexy ..</li>
            <li>item was well priced and delivered quickly</li>
            <li>It is classic, feminine and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>If you have any old and beautiful (or just old) women in your life you will really brighten their day!</li>
            <li>The seller offered fast and easy service.</li>
            <li>Ysatis is elegant and soft, not too sweet.</li>
            <li>probably will use this cologne for many more years as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li>Have used this since it first came out!</li>
            <li>Thanks for keeping in available to purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and great for both day and evening use.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li>It is the only kind I wear.  </li>
            <li>It was fun when the delivery person rang the doorbell</li>
            <li>When I searched Amazon&#x27;s site, my search was over because the price was right.</li>
            <li>Went right out and purchased it and have been wearing it all these years.  </li>
            <li>it smells great, not real strong, so very condusive to an office environment.  </li>
            <li>price is amazing for the 3.3oz, most perfume shops charge over 95USD for the same fragrance in smaller quantities.</li>
            <li>(Mrs. Veloman writes this review): Someone has labeled this as a scent for \\&quot;mature women,\\&quot; but we disagree - I&#x27;ve loved it since discovering the joys of French perfume.</li>
            <li>She had not been able to find it locally.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time buying fragrance from Amazon</li>
            <li>Yes and I am not tired of it; I get compliments on it all the time!</li>
            <li>My wife has used this product for many years and still prefers it to all similar products.</li>
            <li>I discovered Ysatis back in the 1980&#x27;s and it has become a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s simply intoxicating and love it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The bottle top was different then illustrated and the fragerance isn&#x27;t what I had ordered.</li>
            <li>My husband asked me on our first date, almost 14 years ago, \\&quot;what is that wondorous scent</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Ysatis BY Givenchy for 40 years and this is not the real stuff!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what she was expecting.</li>
            <li>If you like oriental, warm, floral scents but want something more individual than the plethora of fruity florals so common right now, this is a scent that is unique yet not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>A lovely floral, it is neither too sharp nor too sweet.</li>
            <li>I received this last year (2009) as a Christmas gift from someone very special.  </li>
            <li>I have had many compliments on it and it lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li>I find it very pleasing as I am overly sensitive to perfumes and rarely use colonge myself.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really find this perfume at the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>And I can order here at a reasonable  price.</li>
            <li>I like as much over the years.</li>
            <li>She really likes the smell.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive comparing to the retail stores.</li>
            <li>A+ for me Thanks.</li>
            <li>and when you do the price is just too much.</li>
            <li>This order for Ysatis in the purple box came wrapped and looked exactly like my previous Ysatis purchase however this one smelled more like alcohol.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, buy some today, she will love and you will love her.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to always have a bottle gifted to me by a cousin regularly, so I never had to buy any until recently when I finally ran out.</li>
            <li>I just love, the sensual smell, rich and bold but not sweet heavy.</li>
            <li>This classic fragrance Givenchy.</li>
            <li>but yet the perfume is still of high quality..</li>
            <li>Men love it too because it isn&#x27;t heavy like some others...</li>
            <li>After finding this some 15 years ago in New York, I have worn it almost every day..</li>
            <li>This does not have a new fragrance smell.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not what I had remembered, so I don&#x27;t know quite what I will do with such a large amount of this perfume!</li>
            <li>FABULOUS, LONG LASTING FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and product was as expected.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;m glad i can still get it here.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited, so I bought the largest bottle, knowing this will last me a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find Amazon sells this and basically $10 less than any other source.</li>
            <li>This is my mothers favorite perfume and its getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>mmmmmmmmmmm absolutely the one and only fragrance I will ever wear!!!</li>
            <li>I guess I must be old.</li>
            <li>It smelled old and rancid when it arrived</li>
            <li>The same fragrance I have is from 2009 and is much stronger and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I was 12 years old when I discovered this perfume from my Mam&#x27;s collection...</li>
            <li>It smells old.  </li>
            <li>I am retired now and on a fixed income.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>This fragrance was with me a long time, I am very Hoth again to get it.</li>
            <li>recently reached the bottom of a large bottle that I purchased several years ago, and so this year I included Ysatis on my Christmas wish list.</li>
            <li>The scent vividly brings back memories of me as a child running up and hugging her when she got home from work, or cuddling to her when i wasn&#x27;t feeling well.</li>
            <li>gave it a five star because it is hard to fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitly a personal type of scent for a mature woman, but it&#x27;s not great-grandmother&#x27;s Essence of Roses.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the same as the old one.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if perfume gets old or not, but this was just not the same perfume I have purchased before.</li>
            <li>Seems a little watered down, not as strong as the last bottle i bought.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I will continue to order more.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> Department stores aren&#x27;t carrying this scent any more, which makes this even more exotic.</li>
            <li> I went almost a year without one of my favorite scents</li>
            <li> Just love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> No matter what scents I find that I like, I still like this one better.  </li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments that I just don&#x27;t consider switching.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for many years.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have to say it&#x27;s the most any woman&#x27;s fragrance</li>
            <li> The wife love the perpume a lot.</li>
            <li> After all these years and many new bottles, it still smells great on her</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this since I was young and beautiful</li>
            <li> The best parfum that I use from long time.</li>
            <li> The scent is brilliantly alive with a semi spicy woodsy note &amp; a beautiful floural waft of goodness.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, and fantastic customer service.  </li>
            <li> It works for me in so many ways, but the most important is</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad I can&#x27;t buy it in the stores any more, but I&#x27;m very happy I can buy it on Amazon through great Sellers.  </li>
            <li> I think that the formula has changed from the original, but it still has the floral tones that I love.  </li>
            <li> Not bad!</li>
            <li> Also tried some other Givenchy perfumes which are also nice, but this is a favorite &amp; Amazon.com enabled me to get an excellent price, Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> and I was glad to find it on here for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best scent!</li>
            <li> Perfume was delivered quickly!  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, when I am ready to buy again it will still be available!!  </li>
            <li> The price was fantastic for a bottle of this size, and with the free shipping the choice was easy.</li>
            <li> Your price is Fabulous.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic</li>
            <li> I hope Givenchy continues to make it available.</li>
            <li> Light and not cloying.</li>
            <li> She had not used it in years because she did not know it was still available.  </li>
            <li> On our first date, many moons ago, I commented on how nice a fragrance she was sporting, both elegant and soft, and not overly sweet, like many of the more neo modern Perfumes that are so strong, they seem like they should require an OSHA approved \\&quot;CAUTION- FLAMMABLE\\&quot;, warning and accompanying MSDS sheet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a floral, oriental scent, very intriguing.......</li>
            <li> (It doesn&#x27;t have that rich fragrance.)  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents ever it&#x27;s sweet and long wearing , every time I wear it I receive compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> I started using this fragrance many years ago as I have an allergy to most perfumes and this was the only one that not only smelled great, but also I was not allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I will have to use for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I wear it for special occassions.  </li>
            <li> but when i wanted a special scent for my daughter&#x27;s wedding, this came to mind.</li>
            <li> Got it for that special someone who was floored by the gift.</li>
            <li> Super excited to find it online and almost $30 cheaper than the perfume store.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it and ordering through Amazon makes it so easy to shop!  </li>
            <li> Shipping on this item was outstanding and we were amazed how fast, this order, arrived.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell so much.</li>
            <li> Everyone is always telling me how much they love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Unbelieveably fast, and one of my favorite \\&quot;gifts\\&quot; this holiday season.</li>
            <li> Sweet but not flowery.</li>
            <li> I buy my original Polo (a great cologne whose function lasts far beyond the targeted results of a shower), at Amazon as well, which IS available in most stores, but not the 8oz size, and certainly not as reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My husband selected this as a gift a number of years ago, and I always come back to it after trying other scents - it is truly a favorite of ours with many happy memories.</li>
            <li> Lucky for us</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s classic and sexy ..</li>
            <li> item was well priced and delivered quickly</li>
            <li> It is classic, feminine and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> If you have any old and beautiful (or just old) women in your life you will really brighten their day!</li>
            <li> The seller offered fast and easy service.</li>
            <li> Ysatis is elegant and soft, not too sweet.</li>
            <li> probably will use this cologne for many more years as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> Have used this since it first came out!</li>
            <li> Thanks for keeping in available to purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and great for both day and evening use.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> It is the only kind I wear.  </li>
            <li> It was fun when the delivery person rang the doorbell</li>
            <li> When I searched Amazon&#x27;s site, my search was over because the price was right.</li>
            <li> Went right out and purchased it and have been wearing it all these years.  </li>
            <li> it smells great, not real strong, so very condusive to an office environment.  </li>
            <li> price is amazing for the 3.3oz, most perfume shops charge over 95USD for the same fragrance in smaller quantities.</li>
            <li> (Mrs. Veloman writes this review): Someone has labeled this as a scent for \\&quot;mature women,\\&quot; but we disagree - I&#x27;ve loved it since discovering the joys of French perfume.</li>
            <li> She had not been able to find it locally.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time buying fragrance from Amazon</li>
            <li> Yes and I am not tired of it; I get compliments on it all the time!</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for many years and still prefers it to all similar products.</li>
            <li> I discovered Ysatis back in the 1980&#x27;s and it has become a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s simply intoxicating and love it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> The bottle top was different then illustrated and the fragerance isn&#x27;t what I had ordered.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me on our first date, almost 14 years ago, \\&quot;what is that wondorous scent</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Ysatis BY Givenchy for 40 years and this is not the real stuff!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what she was expecting.</li>
            <li> If you like oriental, warm, floral scents but want something more individual than the plethora of fruity florals so common right now, this is a scent that is unique yet not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> A lovely floral, it is neither too sharp nor too sweet.</li>
            <li> I received this last year (2009) as a Christmas gift from someone very special.  </li>
            <li> I have had many compliments on it and it lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> I find it very pleasing as I am overly sensitive to perfumes and rarely use colonge myself.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really find this perfume at the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> And I can order here at a reasonable  price.</li>
            <li> I like as much over the years.</li>
            <li> She really likes the smell.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive comparing to the retail stores.</li>
            <li> A+ for me Thanks.</li>
            <li> and when you do the price is just too much.</li>
            <li> This order for Ysatis in the purple box came wrapped and looked exactly like my previous Ysatis purchase however this one smelled more like alcohol.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, buy some today, she will love and you will love her.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to always have a bottle gifted to me by a cousin regularly, so I never had to buy any until recently when I finally ran out.</li>
            <li> I just love, the sensual smell, rich and bold but not sweet heavy.</li>
            <li> This classic fragrance Givenchy.</li>
            <li> but yet the perfume is still of high quality..</li>
            <li> Men love it too because it isn&#x27;t heavy like some others...</li>
            <li> After finding this some 15 years ago in New York, I have worn it almost every day..</li>
            <li> This does not have a new fragrance smell.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not what I had remembered, so I don&#x27;t know quite what I will do with such a large amount of this perfume!</li>
            <li> FABULOUS, LONG LASTING FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and product was as expected.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;m glad i can still get it here.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited, so I bought the largest bottle, knowing this will last me a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find Amazon sells this and basically $10 less than any other source.</li>
            <li> This is my mothers favorite perfume and its getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> mmmmmmmmmmm absolutely the one and only fragrance I will ever wear!!!</li>
            <li> I guess I must be old.</li>
            <li> It smelled old and rancid when it arrived</li>
            <li> The same fragrance I have is from 2009 and is much stronger and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I was 12 years old when I discovered this perfume from my Mam&#x27;s collection...</li>
            <li> It smells old.  </li>
            <li> I am retired now and on a fixed income.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> This fragrance was with me a long time, I am very Hoth again to get it.</li>
            <li> recently reached the bottom of a large bottle that I purchased several years ago, and so this year I included Ysatis on my Christmas wish list.</li>
            <li> The scent vividly brings back memories of me as a child running up and hugging her when she got home from work, or cuddling to her when i wasn&#x27;t feeling well.</li>
            <li> gave it a five star because it is hard to fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitly a personal type of scent for a mature woman, but it&#x27;s not great-grandmother&#x27;s Essence of Roses.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the same as the old one.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if perfume gets old or not, but this was just not the same perfume I have purchased before.</li>
            <li> Seems a little watered down, not as strong as the last bottle i bought.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get anywhere but Amazon, but the price is always right, so no worries.</li>
            <li> It does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> elegant and refined, with very subtle notes - not sweet or cloying.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is not overwhelming with citrus, sweet or powerful placing such as formal or casual!</li>
            <li> I will continue using Ysatis for as long as it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to linger as long, but I still like it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is wrong with it, but I have used this perfume for years and always liked it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other scents, but always come back to this one</li>
            <li> I was down to the last drop when I saw it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s harder and harder to find.  </li>
            <li> It is an expensive scent but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and I work outside as a heavy equipment operator</li>
            <li> My poor husband went from store to store, receiving blank stares from cosmetics associates who seemed to be completely unfamiliar with it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a smaller  bottle; to my surprise it was double the size of my usual purchase and 1/2 the price!</li>
            <li> I hope I am always able to find it ,as it seems the department stores ridded themselves of it few years back :(</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have experimented with other fragrances but always return to Ysatis.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for several decades (at least 3).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used ONLY Ysatis for at least 20 years...</li>
            <li> The price is about $30.00 less than buying it in a department store.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly off color too.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to be just a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As someone else stated, this was one of the few perfumes that I could wear even though I have allergies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have worn it everyday for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed as I have not been able to find it in the stores for the past 6 months at least.  </li>
            <li> I will keep this one hidden in my bottom drawer and the miniature in the change zipper inside the hand clutch!</li>
            <li> I wore it years ago but slowly added other fragrances</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find so whenever I see it I stock up.</li>
            <li> Hard to find at times.</li>
            <li> It only has a faint scent of Ysatis!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the formula has changed or if the product was fake.</li>
            <li> and I never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> I found that the fragrance has become very subtle.</li>
            <li> This perfume is difficult to find in our area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li> Unable to locate in stores any longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that this fragrance is now considered &amp;</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.  :</li>

            <li> My Scent...Everyone I know could be blindfolded &amp; would know that its ne in the room. My absolute Fav!&lt;br /&gt;Has been my everyday scent for approx. 30 years now! I hope I am always able to find it ,as it seems the department stores ridded themselves of it few years back :( Thank Goodness for internet/amazon!!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so very happy that I can still purchase Ysatis with Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Ysantis has the most wonderful aroma in perfumes ever...and amazon gets it to me at the lowest price but yet the perfume is still of high quality..</li>
            <li> Perfume was delivered quickly!  :)  The fragrance is fabulous!  :]  Thank you very much!  :D</li>
            <li> This was purchased at the request of my mother.  She had not been able to find it locally.  She loves the scent and that it is not overpowering.  I find it very pleasing as I am overly sensitive to perfumes and rarely use colonge myself.  It&#x27;s definitly a personal type of scent for a mature woman, but it&#x27;s not great-grandmother&#x27;s Essence of Roses.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying fragrance from Amazon and I would do it again.  I had done online and in-store price comparisons.  When I searched Amazon&#x27;s site, my search was over because the price was right. I saved about $30, the delivery was faster than estimated, and I was satisfied with the product upon delivery.  Additionally, a lot of stores no longer stock Ysatis.  It is my all-time FAVORITE FRAGRANCE for life!!!   :O)</li>
            <li> The Mrs. has worn this for years and it&#x27;s fragrance lasts throughout the day.  Shipping on this item was outstanding and we were amazed how fast, this order, arrived.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really find this perfume at the stores anymore. Bought one for me and another one for my mom.</li>
            <li> My husband picked this out for me. I have used Ysatis for years and will till I cant&#x27;t find it. I get compliments all the time. And I can order here at a reasonable  price.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this cologne!  It is hard to find in stores, so I&#x27;m glad i can still get it here.  It is the only fragrance that doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Great experience!!!</li>
            <li> This is the most Beautiful Perfume! Will never switch. Your price is Fabulous. Get great compliment&#x27;s often. Always asked what the name of my perfume is.</li>
            <li> After finding this some 15 years ago in New York, I have worn it almost every day..all year! It is truly the loveliest fragrance for any age, at all times.  I love how iut makes me feel when I spray it on, opr dab it. I feel elegant!  Men love it too because it isn&#x27;t heavy like some others...mmmmmmmmmmm absolutely the one and only fragrance I will ever wear!!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for the fragrance from the 1980s/1990s this is not it.  The smell is very, very different. (It doesn&#x27;t have that rich fragrance.)  This was my favorite perfume. As someone else stated, this was one of the few perfumes that I could wear even though I have allergies.  I am so disappointed.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do order it and don&#x27;t like it, you CANNOT return it. &amp;#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I rated as 1 star, its not horrible, its just not what I thought I was ordering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find and I love the smell so much.</li>
            <li> Seems a little watered down, not as strong as the last bottle i bought.</li>
            <li> Love this scent on my wife.</li>
            <li> I could not  find a gift set for this fragrance but I did find it for a great price. My mother loved it!</li>
            <li> This is a purchase I make all the time. It is always a great product and service is always satisfactory.</li>
            <li> This perfume is difficult to find in our area. I have used it for years. My granddaughters like to put it on so they can smell like grandma.</li>
            <li> The only perfume I use.  I have to order it since it has been discontinued from department stores.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best fragrance I have found (for me) and haven&#x27;t found another I like as much over the years.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for the last 20 years!  Yes and I am not tired of it; I get compliments on it all the time!</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for many years and still prefers it to all similar products.</li>
            <li> I guess I must be old. I&#x27;ve worn this perfume since my 20&#x27;s. I was fortunate to always have a bottle gifted to me by a cousin regularly, so I never had to buy any until recently when I finally ran out. Went to I don&#x27;t know how many stores and no one carries it anymore!!!? SO happy to have found it on Amazon! Smells fantastic and I still often get compliments when I wear it. So what if its not hip anymore! Its my favorite fragrance EVER!</li>
            <li> smells wonderful, fast delivery</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law got this for me in the 1980s, and I&#x27;ve been using it since!  Thanks for being one of the few places I can still get it.</li>
            <li> Has a floral, oriental scent, very intriguing.......</li>
            <li> I have looked for this for 2 years, great product and Amazon has the best price!</li>
            <li> My Wife&#x27;s all time favorite fragrance.  After all these years and many new bottles, it still smells great on her and she loves to wear it.</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect condition. It smells wonderful! I love it!</li>
            <li> Ysatis by Givenchy -  Eau De Toilette Spray&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This order arrived as promised in good condition.  I have used this for several years and regularly order it on line.</li>
            <li> I discovered Ysatis back in the 1980&#x27;s and it has become a favorite of mine. I get compliments every time I wear it. I just love, the sensual smell, rich and bold but not sweet heavy. Just nice. They discontinued selling it at the dept stores and all of my friends and I were extremely disappointed. My friend said look online I found it! Lucky for us they didn&#x27;t change the formula it&#x27;s the same as the old one. I love, love, love this perfume. Thanks for keeping in available to purchase.</li>
            <li> I Love this perfume. It is my signature fragrance. Have worn it exclusively since 1985..Always get compliments from both men and women</li>
            <li> FABULOUS, LONG LASTING FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping, and fantastic customer service.  Made for a great gift...  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Both men and women have commented on how lovely this fragrance is.  I hope Givenchy continues to make it available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for over 20 years. I&#x27;m so sad it&#x27;s discontinued. I love it. I will have to use for special occasions.</li>
            <li> (Mrs. Veloman writes this review): Someone has labeled this as a scent for \\&quot;mature women,\\&quot; but we disagree - I&#x27;ve loved it since discovering the joys of French perfume. If you like oriental, warm, floral scents but want something more individual than the plethora of fruity florals so common right now, this is a scent that is unique yet not overpowering.  A quality perfume smells different on different people, and doesn&#x27;t precede you into the room.  My husband selected this as a gift a number of years ago, and I always come back to it after trying other scents - it is truly a favorite of ours with many happy memories.</li>
            <li> I have loved this fragrance for quite some time.  It stays with you without being overpowering.  It is also quite wonderful to wear for every occasion.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and price is great too!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful fragrance and I have used it for years.  I would highly recommend it and ordering through Amazon makes it so easy to shop!  I started using this fragrance many years ago as I have an allergy to most perfumes and this was the only one that not only smelled great, but also I was not allergic to it. (no sneezing)</li>
            <li> Love Ysatis, but will not order it in warm months. It smelled old and rancid when it arrived</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day!!!  This is her  favorite perfume!!!</li>
            <li> My signature scent since the 80&#x27;s. I&#x27;ve tried other scents, but always come back to this one and it&#x27;s harder and harder to find.  I was hesitant to buy online, but it&#x27;s wonderful.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff...me too for that matter!</li>
            <li> So heavenly a perfume. Been using it for years. Just love it. Light and not cloying. A sophisticated perfume for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Have used this since it first came out! Wonderful! The seller offered fast and easy service.</li>
            <li> The scent is not what I had remembered, so I don&#x27;t know quite what I will do with such a large amount of this perfume!</li>
            <li> I found that the fragrance has become very subtle. It does not last long at all. Not sure if the formula has changed or if the product was fake. The same fragrance I have is from 2009 and is much stronger and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents ever it&#x27;s sweet and long wearing , every time I wear it I receive compliments on how good I smell. I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s simply intoxicating and love it.  I would never be without my Ysatis it&#x27;s become one of my signature scents .</li>
            <li> Perfect product and description. Everything was as depicted in the description. Product was perfect and made an excellent present! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Saved about $25.00 by purchasing this with you as opposed to a department store.  I&#x27;m always happy to save money.  My favorite EDT.</li>
            <li> Everyone is always telling me how much they love this fragrance.  I followed a woman in Neiman Marcus one day to ask what she was wearing!  I wear it in the summer and wear Bijan in the winter.</li>
            <li> I love this product,Yasitis by Givenchy. Smells wonderful &amp; I ALWAYS get compliments. Have been using it for 15 years.Also tried some other Givenchy perfumes which are also nice, but this is a favorite &amp; Amazon.com enabled me to get an excellent price, Thank you so much. ladybrighteyes@comcast.net</li>
            <li> Noticed Ysatis on a temp in my office probably 20 years ago.  Asked what fragrance she wore, and was told Ysatis.  Went right out and purchased it and have been wearing it all these years.  Always receive compliments.  My all-time favorite.</li>
            <li> Everyone always asks what I have on.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance. Adorable, gives life.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite scents. It&#x27;s hard to find so whenever I see it I stock up.</li>
            <li> I was 12 years old when I discovered this perfume from my Mam&#x27;s collection... It&#x27;s classic and sexy .. Big yes</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  It was shipped promptly and the price was competitive.</li>
            <li> This does not have a new fragrance smell.  It smells old.  I wish I could return it!!! I&#x27;ve wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I think someone else mentioned that Ysatis is everything a perfume should be. Ysatis is elegant and soft, not too sweet. I have worn it everyday for over 20 years. Since the day a woman walked into my office wearing it and it was the most wonderful perfume I had ever smelled. Just like everyone else, I get asked constantly about it if I hug someone (otherwise you can&#x27;t smell it because I only wear a tiny amount) My mother was allergic to all perfume and so are many of my friends and yet Ysatis has never bothered anyone, even if I wear it stronger. Hands down the best scent!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne, has been for many years. It is the only kind I wear.  I was so disappointed as I have not been able to find it in the stores for the past 6 months at least.  I was down to the last drop when I saw it on Amazon.  I was so excited, so I bought the largest bottle, knowing this will last me a very long time.  Hopefully, when I am ready to buy again it will still be available!!  Great product!  Great service time, I had it in a week.</li>
            <li> my favorite scent.  item was well priced and delivered quickly</li>
            <li> This has been &amp;#34;MY&amp;#34; fragrance for many years. Unable to locate in stores any longer. Glad to get it on Amazon with an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Very Lovely fragrance for day or evening.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  She had not used it in years because she did not know it was still available.  On the QT, I shopped Amazon, found it, and ordered it without telling her.  It was fun when the delivery person rang the doorbell and I placed the &amp;#34;what&#x27;s this&amp;#34; package in her lap.  I remained in her good graces for days afterward.  Just a hint to husbands who might be thinking of a way to escape the doghouse.</li>
            <li> This is my mothers favorite perfume and its getting harder and harder to find. Super excited to find it online and almost $30 cheaper than the perfume store. Packaged great. Had a happy mom this Christmas :)</li>
            <li> I wore it years ago but slowly added other fragrances so I tried it in a store before ordering. I have had many compliments on it and it lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> This order for Ysatis in the purple box came wrapped and looked exactly like my previous Ysatis purchase however this one smelled more like alcohol.</li>
            <li> I received this last year (2009) as a Christmas gift from someone very special.  I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s spicy, earthy, nice.  I wear it for special occassions.  A little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s a great scent.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for years and I never get tired of it. I also get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years and love it. So does my husband.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite fragrence.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> i hadn&#x27;t had ysatis for many years but when i wanted a special scent for my daughter&#x27;s wedding, this came to mind. elegant and refined, with very subtle notes - not sweet or cloying.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is not overwhelming with citrus, sweet or powerful placing such as formal or casual! I&#x27;ve received complements and requested for the name for gifting by men. This fragrance will last and stay on with softening aroma. I will keep this one hidden in my bottom drawer and the miniature in the change zipper inside the hand clutch! Love it :) the seller were great with packaging and delivery on time.  I&#x27;m very pleased :)</li>
            <li> This perfume is a decent price and it arrived in less than five days. Not bad!</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend who thought it had been discontinued.  She was THRILLED!  LOVED IT!!</li>
            <li> fast delivery, great product</li>
            <li> Ysatis is the best cologne/parfum I&#x27;ve really ever smelled.  It works for me in so many ways, but the most important is it smells great, not real strong, so very condusive to an office environment.  I get tons of compliments and have been using it for many years.  It&#x27;s sad I can&#x27;t buy it in the stores any more, but I&#x27;m very happy I can buy it on Amazon through great Sellers.  I will continue using Ysatis for as long as it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites. The price was great and the item shipped on time. I received it just as it was viewed on the site.</li>
            <li> The bottle top was different then illustrated and the fragerance isn&#x27;t what I had ordered. Never again!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and product was as expected.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Ysatis since I was in college, over twenty years ago. I have experimented with other fragrances but always return to Ysatis. It is classic, feminine and sophisticated. A lovely floral, it is neither too sharp nor too sweet. My husband asked me on our first date, almost 14 years ago, \\&quot;what is that wondorous scent you are wearing?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently reached the bottom of a large bottle that I purchased several years ago, and so this year I included Ysatis on my Christmas wish list. My poor husband went from store to store, receiving blank stares from cosmetics associates who seemed to be completely unfamiliar with it. One asked him if I had \\&quot;smelled it in Europe.\\&quot; Another asked him if he was buying it for his grandmother! And this is how he discovered that one can no longer find Ysatis in stores. Because he ran out of time, I was tasked with purchasing it for myself on Christmas day, and I discovered this listing. The price was fantastic for a bottle of this size, and with the free shipping the choice was easy. But I simply CANNOT believe that I received it in just two days, without having selected expedited shipping! Unbelieveably fast, and one of my favorite \\&quot;gifts\\&quot; this holiday season. A perfect purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it always reminds me of my mother and will for years to come. Love you Mom â™¥</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for years and loves the product. Well be after it once again</li>
            <li> This classic fragrance Givenchy. This fragrance was with me a long time, I am very Hoth again to get it. I breathed it, and once again become younger ...</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this fragrance, people ask me what it is, so fresh and great smelling.  Hard to find at times.</li>
            <li> the wife seemed very happy with the product, I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for years. I love it!</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I have this perfume on. I love it. It&#x27;s not too heavy and great for both day and evening use.</li>
            <li> I guess it is a good product. This was a Christmas gift for my mom. She really likes the smell.</li>
            <li> Great price for large size.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Ysatis for 25 years and it is a smell I love.  I get many compliments on it.  The price is about $30.00 less than buying it in a department store.  The delivery was only a couple of days after the order.  Great service.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorites!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this since I was young and beautiful lol. If you have any old and beautiful (or just old) women in your life you will really brighten their day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that this fragrance is now considered &amp;#34;out of style&amp;#34; since it has been my favorite for many years.  I think that the formula has changed from the original, but it still has the floral tones that I love.  It does not seem to linger as long, but I still like it.  I&#x27;m glad it is still available somewhere!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. I get so many compliments on it when I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a light, elegant fragrance that I can wear for day or night!</li>
            <li> My all time favorite perfume.  I get so many compliments on this perfume.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my grandmother. This is her favorite perfume and I was glad to find it on here for such a great price.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product great delivery and price</li>
            <li> Have been using Yastis by Givenchy, for years. Was so happy when I was able to buy it through Amazon, plus the price is right.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive comparing to the retail stores. I will continue to order more. I love the way it smells.  A must buy</li>
            <li> This fragrance is delightful. It smells divine on every woman that wears it. A little goes a long way, buy some today, she will love and you will love her.</li>
            <li> Department stores aren&#x27;t carrying this scent any more, which makes this even more exotic. I am allergic to most scents, but this is marvelous</li>
            <li> I went almost a year without one of my favorite scents</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like the ones I get at Department stores.</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for several decades (at least 3). It always brings compliments. I am always looking for the best deal. I have bought this for several years from department stores, specialty shops, and on-line. I am retired now and on a fixed income.&lt;br /&gt;One day it dawned on me, maybe Amazon sells this. I was thrilled to find Amazon sells this and basically $10 less than any other source. It is an expensive scent but worth every penny. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I loved this one too.  Divine fragrance.  Only fragrance I have ever worn that has men asking,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;What ever are you wearing?  It Smells great!&amp;#34;  and I work outside as a heavy equipment operator&lt;br /&gt;and in the office too.</li>
            <li> My wife panics at the thought of this fragrance ever being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for years.  Just love the fragrance.  probably will use this cologne for many more years as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a smaller  bottle; to my surprise it was double the size of my usual purchase and 1/2 the price!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get away from it.  No matter what scents I find that I like, I still like this one better.  Sweet but not flowery.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Ysatis BY Givenchy for 40 years and this is not the real stuff!  Don&#x27;t know if it is a knock off or what!  It only has a faint scent of Ysatis!  Don&#x27;t know how to return or ask for refund????</li>
            <li> I hope you never discontinue this fragrance - It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This IS my mothers fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s worn Ysatis since i can remember. The scent vividly brings back memories of me as a child running up and hugging her when she got home from work, or cuddling to her when i wasn&#x27;t feeling well. The scent lasts all day and my mother can be herself when she wears it. This scent no doubt is worn by proud women who are hardworking, down-to-earth, and outspoken.&lt;br /&gt;The price is amazing for the 3.3oz, most perfume shops charge over 95USD for the same fragrance in smaller quantities. Extremely satisfied with the product, and will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years and years.  If I get another fragrance as a gift, I regift it!  This fragrance goes with my personality or chemistry and I get so many compliments that I just don&#x27;t consider switching.  It is hard to get anywhere but Amazon, but the price is always right, so no worries.</li>
            <li> This smells like it should but I think it has been on a shelf for a while. It is slightly off color too.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and the price. I have used this cologne for many years. Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.  Great</li>
            <li> The best parfum that I use from long time. Amazon helps me always.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for years and years.  It is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a mild scent.</li>
            <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> excellent, smells amazing, just as I remembered. xo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used ONLY Ysatis for at least 20 years...I always get compliments on it! I consider it my signature fragrance!</li>
            <li> Mmmmmm! Smell that aroma.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is pretty awesome! Got it for that special someone who was floored by the gift. I hadn&#x27;t known about the scent until she put it on &amp; I have to say it&#x27;s the most any woman&#x27;s fragrance has ever moved me. The scent is brilliantly alive with a semi spicy woodsy note &amp; a beautiful floural waft of goodness. A+ for me Thanks.</li>
            <li> On our first date, many moons ago, I commented on how nice a fragrance she was sporting, both elegant and soft, and not overly sweet, like many of the more neo modern Perfumes that are so strong, they seem like they should require an OSHA approved \\&quot;CAUTION- FLAMMABLE\\&quot;, warning and accompanying MSDS sheet.&lt;br /&gt;This is all she wears to date (not including clothing of course.) Amazon comes thru again. After decades of a great marriage, I wanted to get my Eviesue a refill. Stores do not carry it, even Macy&#x27;s; and it&#x27;s just as well considering price comparison. Also, Amazon carries the larger size, which makes that selection a \\&quot;no brainer\\&quot; the savings is so incredible. I buy my original Polo (a great cologne whose function lasts far beyond the targeted results of a shower), at Amazon as well, which IS available in most stores, but not the 8oz size, and certainly not as reasonably priced. Thx Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Bobbo.</li>
            <li> Exactly what she was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is wrong with it, but I have used this perfume for years and always liked it.  The scent seems to be just a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if perfume gets old or not, but this was just not the same perfume I have purchased before.</li>
            <li> The wife love the perpume a lot. She was so happy that amazon had it .I gave it a five star because it is hard to fine and when you do the price is just too much.</li>
