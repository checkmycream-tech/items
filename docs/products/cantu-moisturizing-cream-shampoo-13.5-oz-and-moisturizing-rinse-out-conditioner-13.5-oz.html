            <li>After using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, I&#x27;ve noticed I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is okay</li>
            <li>Very rich, creamy &amp; light-weight.</li>
            <li>I loved the conditioner the first time I bought</li>
            <li>Good value fast shipping</li>
            <li>but this is great all the same.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>And I also use Cantu repair cream both work wonders, leaves hair soft and smells soo good.</li>
            <li>I use their hair lotion and it too leaves your hair feeling soft and smelling good (if you like coconut).</li>
            <li>but i didnt really c much difference!!!</li>
            <li>good news is that I was able to restore my hair’s moisture with my favorite hair product: Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Style Milk and a little bit of my DIY Coconut Argan Hair oil and leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean and moist</li>
            <li>I love and have used Cantu products for the longest and I love them, especially the Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair manageable and soft, and the scent of the product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>Cantu Shampoo and conditioner made My girls hair very soft, shiny, easy to do Untangle.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past with great results.  </li>
            <li>Cleans your hear great but the conditioner is not very good.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I used this product</li>
            <li>Hair will not feel dried out rather your hair will have moisture and smell good.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t soft or anything, and it felt super stripped.</li>
            <li>The Cantu products seem to compliment the pure shea butter.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that the price here is way too high.</li>
            <li>The Cantu shampoo and rinse out works good together, It gives my hair the feeling of clean hair and, you really don&#x27;t need much shampoo, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>love the product and it arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li>Absolute difference in my hair</li>
            <li>Shampoo lathers very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks cantu.</li>
            <li>It was definitely challenging for me to find something that was going to leave my hair feeling high and dry.</li>
            <li>This, at best, is a clarifying shampoo and at worst, the road to cause damage to your precious strands.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely noticed a big difference, my hair is more detangled, manageable.</li>
            <li>I live it on for 45mins under a conditioning cap.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair feeling very soft and mosturized.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great however the conditioner isn&#x27;t thick and left my hair tangled and dry</li>
            <li>Great for my thick hair!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased the shampoo and conditioner for my two girls who both have natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have been going natural for about a month now and this set does the job</li>
            <li>But overall I don&#x27;t like the product that much.</li>
            <li>I am going natural, and I do not like this for my natural hair, but for my relaxed hair it did well for me.</li>
            <li>makes my hair feel soft and silky</li>
            <li>Hair type: all natural, kinky, curly.  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m transitioning into natural</li>
            <li>It feels so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The shea butter had my hair really soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally frizzy/coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the natural world, and I&#x27;m determined not to be a product junkie,so if I want to try something new I will go to a friend or relative who is also natural and try out what is already in their arsenal.</li>
            <li>My hair at the moment if stretched is right above my shoulders.</li>
            <li>Shampoos these days seem to suck the moisture right out of your hair, especially if you are African American.</li>
            <li>and she barely has any split ends, after a year of no haircuts !</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner for my thin curly hair.</li>

            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner for my thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mixture of coils, kinks and curls, if you were to hair type it, a 4b texture with very loose curls in the front and back.</li>
            <li> As long as they keep producing it, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick but does nothing to really make up for the aftermath of the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Ladies and Gents, do you want dry hair with the appearance of brittle ends?  </li>
            <li> I got the shampoo half empty whole box was wet and mess up rest of my order</li>
            <li> There was not much slip to the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Overall I will not repurchase cause its not good enough for my transitioning.</li>
            <li> I usually use As I Am co-wash; but wanted to try something different.  </li>
            <li> He says his hair does not flake like the other shampoos he used before Cantu.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money I paid for it</li>
            <li> It can be very difficult to find a good shampoo and conditioner and sometimes just as difficult to find a matching duo.</li>
            <li> I also find less breakage after using Cantu.  </li>
            <li> Works for my daughters tight curls as well.</li>
            <li> It is among the products I use for my dry, wavy, and thick shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually my hair would get stiff and greasy due to product build up</li>
            <li> (I workout everyday and like to rid the salt from my hair.  </li>
            <li> That is how curiosity almost killed my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and Puerto Ricain and these poducts left little to no moisture in my hair and felt very weak even for a cleanser.</li>
            <li> my friends, look no more.  </li>
            <li> Oh, how I wished that I had done my usual</li>
            <li> I usually detangle my hair during the conditioning process, I use either my fingers, or occassionally a comb/denman brush.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not good for those looking to retain moisture in their hair and it is certainly not good for everyday use if you wash your hair everyday like I do.  </li>
            <li> Way too thick-</li>
            <li> Does that mean that the unfinished product is tested on animals?  </li>
            <li> After rinsing it out, hair is stripped, stingy and weak.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong selecting Cantu&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> but they either sent me a bad bottle or messes with the formula.</li>
            <li> Too bad a rating is required.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo and conditioner for my two girls who both have natural hair. Cantu Shampoo and conditioner made My girls hair very soft, shiny, easy to do Untangle. The girls love the products. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</li>
            <li> Wife could not find this in too many places.  Seems like the big stores have done away with it.  This is the only thing she will put in her hair.  I use it from time to time.  Happy wife happy life.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner for my thin curly hair. My hair is so soft and shiny. Works for my daughters tight curls as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past with great results.  Can&#x27;t wait to get started again.</li>
            <li> I got the shampoo half empty whole box was wet and mess up rest of my order</li>
            <li> Love this. Works well for three different hair textures of my hair and my sons hair. It also smells wonderful! Really really love and reccomend.</li>
            <li> Ladies and Gents, do you want dry hair with the appearance of brittle ends?  Are you looking for a great way to bring damage to your glorious head of hair?  Or, perhaps, you would like to support a company where there advertising is misleading and their products are inferior at best?&lt;br /&gt;Well my friends, look no more.  Cantu Shea Butter “Moisturizing” Cream Shampoo is your answer.  Yes, even after preparing your hair the night before with a mixture of coconut oil and Cantu’s leave in conditioner, your hair will still be dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the word “Moisturizing” in their name is ludicrous and totally misleading.  This, at best, is a clarifying shampoo and at worst, the road to cause damage to your precious strands.  And what is the deal with the phrase, “the finished product not tested on animals”.  Does that mean that the unfinished product is tested on animals?  Hmm…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, let’s sum it up.  This shampoo is not good for those looking to retain moisture in their hair and it is certainly not good for everyday use if you wash your hair everyday like I do.  (I workout everyday and like to rid the salt from my hair.  I usually use As I Am co-wash; but wanted to try something different.  That is how curiosity almost killed my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) and Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES)—which are my hair and skin enemies.  Oh, how I wished that I had done my usual research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that I was able to restore my hair’s moisture with my favorite hair product: Shea Moisture Curl &amp; Style Milk and a little bit of my DIY Coconut Argan Hair oil and leave-in conditioner.  My curls are once again, lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the shampoo once and I definitely noticed a big difference, my hair is more detangled, manageable. And I also use Cantu repair cream both work wonders, leaves hair soft and smells soo good. Will buy again</li>
            <li> √√√Excellent Product and Service</li>
            <li> It can be very difficult to find a good shampoo and conditioner and sometimes just as difficult to find a matching duo. It was definitely challenging for me to find something that was going to leave my hair feeling high and dry. Shampoos these days seem to suck the moisture right out of your hair, especially if you are African American. Cantu has definitely topped the cake with this one, in my opinion. Not only did I buy the set, I purchased the leave in conditioner and the repair cream. Altogether these products work miracles!! It leaves my hair manageable and soft, and the scent of the product is phenomenal. I definitely recommend this hair product and even more so if you are deciding to \\&quot;go natural\\&quot; with your roots!</li>
            <li> Dries my hair out.  Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have been going natural for about a month now and this set does the job, it detangles my knots and smells wonderful and the price is great for the set!</li>
            <li> love the product and it arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money I paid for it I would give it zero stars if I could</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for everybody</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the natural world, and I&#x27;m determined not to be a product junkie,so if I want to try something new I will go to a friend or relative who is also natural and try out what is already in their arsenal. A bit about my hair: last relaxer was May 2012, and I big chopped in March 2013. My hair at the moment if stretched is right above my shoulders. It&#x27;s a mixture of coils, kinks and curls, if you were to hair type it, a 4b texture with very loose curls in the front and back. My hair is also fine.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I borrowed the shampoo and conditioner from a co-worker after taking out my Senegalese twists. I used the shampoo. It had sulfates, which is something I avoid, but I figured what the heck, let me try it out. My hair felt ok. It wasn&#x27;t soft or anything, and it felt super stripped. After that I deep conditioned with a protein conditioner and sat in a heat cap, after which I topped it off with the rinse out conditioner. I usually detangle my hair during the conditioning process, I use either my fingers, or occassionally a comb/denman brush. There was not much slip to the conditioner. I was still able to detangle but I could hear my hair snagging even on my fingers,unlike when I use conditioners such as Herbal Essense hello hydration or tresseme naturals and so forth. I will definitely not be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> Cantu products are the bomb....</li>
            <li> Good value fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product severely overpriced on Amazon</li>
            <li> This combination shampoo and conditioner is priced great and does a fab job on my cury hair. I paid big buck for pricer stuff that did not leave my hair as soft,curly and manageable as the Cantu products do.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair feeling very soft and mosturized. It smells absolutely amazing and i will be continuing to buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works great for me ... Leaves my hair feeling so good esp that conditioner mmmm :) I recommend</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It is among the products I use for my dry, wavy, and thick shoulder length hair.  I find that the combo (shampoo AND conditioner) moisturizes, detangles, and even &amp;#34;relaxes&amp;#34; my wave a bit.  I also find less breakage after using Cantu.  I should also note that I bought this shampoo and conditioner because it contains shea butter.  I moisturize with (ivory colored) shea butter about 3 times per week.  The Cantu products seem to compliment the pure shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and Puerto Ricain and these poducts left little to no moisture in my hair and felt very weak even for a cleanser.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  Hair will not feel dried out rather your hair will have moisture and smell good.  You cannot go wrong selecting Cantu&#x27;s products.  I use their hair lotion and it too leaves your hair feeling soft and smelling good (if you like coconut).</li>
            <li> This shampoo and rinse out is all you will need, It gets really soapy and foamy which is great, your hair will feel revived and moisturized after each and every use. Looks like I won&#x27;t need to be shampoo searching any more. Lol and This smells really good. Like Seriously good.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that the price here is way too high. I bought mines at Walmart for $4.49 each shampoo and conditioner. And you can get this at target for the same price as Walmart.  But overall I don&#x27;t like the product that much. I am going natural, and I do not like this for my natural hair, but for my relaxed hair it did well for me. Overall I will not repurchase cause its not good enough for my transitioning.</li>
            <li> I loved the conditioner the first time I bought but they either sent me a bad bottle or messes with the formula. Way too thick- I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the bottle and it left my hair stuff. Never buying again.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel soft and silky</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Great results. Lovely smell! Good price.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hair products! The combination of shampoo and conditioner is a must!! Leaves my hair feeling clean and moist</li>
            <li> Really love the fagance of this product</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and so does my husband.  He says his hair does not flake like the other shampoos he used before Cantu.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!!  Shipped super fast!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend who has an allergy towards sulfur for neither the shampoo or the conditioner contained any sulfates. In addition to not causing her any cutaneous ailments the products performs. She loves the smell and the effects of the products so all in all a good buy.</li>
            <li> I love and have used Cantu products for the longest and I love them, especially the Conditioner.  I buy more conditioner than anything as I dont use a lot of Shampoo but this is great all the same.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great however the conditioner isn&#x27;t thick and left my hair tangled and dry I&#x27;m gonna stick to the shampoo but dish the conditioner</li>
            <li> This is now the only line of hair products I use now. Absolute difference in my hair</li>
            <li> Great for my thick hair!!!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used this product and I was well pleased with the results. This product lives up to all its claims</li>
            <li> It do not moisturizing shampoo</li>
            <li> Hair type: all natural, kinky, curly.  Shampoo lathers very well. After rinsing it out, hair is stripped, stingy and weak. The conditioner is thick but does nothing to really make up for the aftermath of the shampoo.  Too bad a rating is required. Never will buy or use this again. Returning to the store asap!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff. Usually my hair would get stiff and greasy due to product build up but this makes my hair bouncy and weightless for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S: I&#x27;m transitioning into natural so I do recommend this product!!!  I&#x27;m going to try the leave in conditioner for twist outs soon!!</li>
            <li> Cleans your hear great but the conditioner is not very good.</li>
            <li> Very rich, creamy &amp; light-weight. Leaves hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> The Cantu shampoo and rinse out works good together, It gives my hair the feeling of clean hair and, you really don&#x27;t need much shampoo, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way the Cantu shea butter Rinse out conditioner makes my hair feel. I live it on for 45mins under a conditioning cap. It feels so soft and manageable. I have tried the shampoo. I want to finish the shampoo I currently have. Once I finish it, I am definitely going to try the cantu shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Great product! As long as they keep producing it, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell.  The shea butter had my hair really soft and moist.  Well continue to buy them.  Thanks cantu.</li>
            <li> I have naturally frizzy/coarse hair.  After using the Cantu shampoo and conditioner, I&#x27;ve noticed I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair.  It literally feels like silk.  However when i add a high-end product to my hair like Oribe Moisturizer, it looses its effect.  Additionally my friend has been using Cantu shampoo and conditioner and she barely has any split ends, after a year of no haircuts !</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great asa u put in your hair u feel the difference and it smells great!! The conditioner is okay but i didnt really c much difference!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great product...I can see improvement in my daughter&#x27;s hair texture.love it..#teamnatural</li>
