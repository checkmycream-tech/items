            <li>I have used this product with great success for a long time.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product as I have fine hair and it tangles easily..  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy; just soft and shiny! :)</li>
            <li>Tigi products are usually pretty good, and this one in particular smells amazing, but I&#x27;ve had a hard time figuring out how much to use.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed that I can untangle my hair much easier after using this stuff.</li>
            <li>made the mistake of using too much, especially&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps moisturize my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have highlights done regularly, so I try to be extra nice to my hair.</li>
            <li>use a little bit &amp; mostly on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser loved the smell when she wet down my hair and trimmed it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>this product works well with my type of hair, baby fine, and helps control the ends and dryness that comes from everyday life.&#x3D;</li>
            <li>It smells like candy and it leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;super soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps to keep the ends from splitting and helped keep the color vibrant after washing and flat ironing</li>
            <li>If you use it, only use it once a month or so as they said it has too much protein to use daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this product has solely made a huge difference on my blonde highlights since I am combining it with a purple shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have super thick naturally curly hair.  </li>

            <li> This leave in conditioner is great! Leaves my hair very soft, silky, shiny and smells delicious. It also helps with the frizz and enhances the look of my highlights. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> ♡♡♡♡ this product! Leaves my hair soft and shiny! Smells great too!!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love&lt;br /&gt;Great product, came quickly!&lt;br /&gt;I definately recommend having amazon fill your order. The shampoo I ordered in my other order was filled by someone else was a bad experience. Wish I would have had amazon fill my both my orders.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it make a huge difference with my highlights, but it is a nice leave in that smells good and didn&#x27;t turn them brassy. Even my hairdresser loved the smell when she wet down my hair and trimmed it.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product as I have fine hair and it tangles easily..  Works great and smells nice. Very happy with this purchase!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product has solely made a huge difference on my blonde highlights since I am combining it with a purple shampoo. But I will have to say, this product smells AMAZING. It smells like candy and it leaves my hair feeling soft. I have also noticed that I can untangle my hair much easier after using this stuff. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> The senior stylists at Toni and Guy told me this was damaging my hair. If you use it, only use it once a month or so as they said it has too much protein to use daily. BAD LABELS on this as it doesn&#x27;t say and my hair was fried after using daily.</li>
            <li> Good product good seller</li>
            <li> I ordered this to maintain my virgin hair extensions once I bleached and dyed the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It helps to keep the ends from splitting and helped keep the color vibrant after washing and flat ironing</li>
            <li> I have highlights done regularly, so I try to be extra nice to my hair. This product smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft and amazing. When I do use it though, my hair gets extra greasy the next day, and I only use a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Only use a little bit &amp; mostly on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of using too much, especially&lt;br /&gt;on the top &amp; it made my hair look kind of greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It totally saves time in the shower &amp; makes hair&lt;br /&gt;super soft. I still use my various other Bedhead&lt;br /&gt;conditioners in the shower, but this product lets&lt;br /&gt;you save time. Best leave-in conditioner i have&lt;br /&gt;ever tried. Another great Bedhead product.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but my pump didn&#x27;t work. Only reason it gets a 4.</li>
            <li> I have super thick naturally curly hair.  Already on the dry side, I insist on beaching it, poor hair.  This stuff really helps moisturize my hair.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I always love bedhead products this one was great I like it however its a little heavy and can make hair a bit greasy.</li>

            <li> Works amazingly! Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy; just soft and shiny! :)</li>
            <li> this product works well with my type of hair, baby fine, and helps control the ends and dryness that comes from everyday life.&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Tigi products are usually pretty good, and this one in particular smells amazing, but I&#x27;ve had a hard time figuring out how much to use.  Too little and it&#x27;s a waste, too much and it leaves hair sticky and tangely.</li>
            <li> I can tell my bleached hair is beginning to get the life in it restored by using this product. It gives my hair texture and seems to make it look fuller and healthier.</li>
