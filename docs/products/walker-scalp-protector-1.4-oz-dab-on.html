            <li>love this product...</li>
            <li>item arrived quickly, this is a must buy when wearing lace wigs to protect yours scalp when applying any kind of glue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply, and will protect the scalp from irritations that may come from any over use of the Walkers Ultra Hold Adhesive.</li>
            <li>Also makes removel easy.  </li>
            <li>makes it easy for my lace wig to be removed and products my scalp.  </li>
            <li>The dabber is easy to use.</li>
            <li>And also the dabber does not seem to release any product easily.</li>
            <li>Very useful when applying my lace wig.  </li>
            <li>The holding power does not seem any greater when I add this to the scalp first.</li>
            <li>Works ok but not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Does as promised without adding a bunch more time to my getting ready routine.</li>
            <li>They did say that using would help bond strengthen the bond though and the bond was pretty strong</li>
            <li>I paid almost 3x the product price for the purpose of getting it here QUICK.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly.</li>
            <li>Inoffensive smell which dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>It is good for protecting my scalp, like it should, I tried other brands</li>
            <li>This product along with rubbing alcohol, {90 percent} is what is needed to clean the scalp area in preparation for the installation of your new lace front or full lace unit..</li>
            <li>I would say this is perfect for people like me who tend to &amp;#34;glisten&amp;#34; a little more than your average person!</li>
            <li>we have tried many different products and this is the one</li>
            <li>It protected my scalp from the adhesive and it actual help the adhesive stick better.</li>
            <li>First, I cleaned the back of my hand with alcohol until the cotton ball was free of debris.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it was kind of messy, but then I had my wife put it on for me while I was guiding her what to do</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let that change your mind though , it doesn&#x27;t take much to do that to my skin .</li>
            <li>Now you are ready to apply the Walker&#x27;s Ultra Hold Adhesive.</li>
            <li>This product really cleans your scalp and doesn&#x27;t leave any film.</li>
            <li>This has really helped me retain my edges and not lose hair during glue removal.</li>
            <li>Seems to do the job very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like it cleaned my scalp and</li>
            <li>This product really works in helping the tape to stick and protecting my hairline and skin from damage.</li>
            <li>Acts as a barrier between tape/glue and your skin and it REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li>I had to apply and re-apply the tape several times as this was my first full lace wig.</li>
            <li>When you apply the Walker Scalp Protector, make sure first that the scalp area is clean and dry, second, apply the Walker Scalp Protector just dab it on the edges of and around the scalp and let it dry.</li>
            <li>Will need to use more than two weeks to give a firm response.</li>
            <li>If you are new to this, as I am, I would suggest you either go to your beautician for assistance or watch some of the instructional videos on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin/scalp</li>
            <li>I just recently purchased my first lace front wigs and did my research on what products i would need to go with my new look and came across this product so i tried it.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, please do not use any type of adhesive without putting this scalp protector on first.</li>
            <li>Only once did I neglect to use this protector first</li>
            <li>just another product to make people spend more money when they can use something they likely already have at home and costs less.</li>
            <li>had trouble getting the stuff out of the bottle, but with practice it worked out fine.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and dries clear.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product and the others I mentioned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to use than tape on a daily basis, and it isn&#x27;t so sticky that it sticks to everything and won&#x27;t come loose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used similar scalp protector in the past that had a more &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; feel to it once it dried.</li>

            <li> I then spread 2 thin layers of the protectant, letting the first layer dry before adding the second.</li>
            <li> Product did not work as advertised, considered returning but due to the low cost of the product did not bother with the hassel.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to but makes my skin dry and kinda flaky .</li>
            <li> Thinking it would dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> i bought this product a long time and its gooood, did protect my scalp, a bit of smell but not much.</li>
            <li> This version seems watered down in that it doesn&#x27;t have the hold earlier version had.</li>
            <li> would definitely reccommend it to anyone who wears hair pieces/wigs that need to be glued down</li>
            <li> Lastly, it didn&#x27;t protect my scalp because I still got a slight rash.</li>
            <li> Rubbing alcohol works the same for less money.  </li>
            <li> it only takes a little</li>
            <li> only used this a few times it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really suer whether this product worked or not because I used it in combination with another product (Endura Bond).</li>
            <li> This is a must as I have heard other say, for anyone who wears a wig</li>
            <li> READ SOME OTHER REVIEWS</li>
            <li> I find that I have to push down extremely hard or tap the dabber constantly to release anything.</li>
            <li> Just remember to apply, let it dry and reapply, this helps your tape/glue to last longer w/o irritating skin or altering the intergrity of the tape/glue.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it has helped with skin irritation or not.</li>
            <li> The glue and tape is SO hard on your skin.</li>
            <li> When the protectant no longer felt tacky, I applied a thin layer of Ultra Hold adhesive.</li>
            <li> Helped hold my thin skin unit in place all day!</li>
            <li> I believe the citrus base helps to remove the glues and soothe your skin.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this and was fearful to use it on my hair line.  </li>
            <li> Never got to use because the wig I got was very bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used it and it did not damage my skin in any way so I did try it on a customer and it  seems to be a good product. I just don&#x27;t need now.</li>
            <li> only used this a few times it works.</li>
            <li> I ordered my lace, adhesive, and this product all on the same day and all for \\&quot;express\\&quot; shipping. I have received every item except my scalp protector. This scalp protector is what, 3 dollars? Well I paid an extra 11 on shipping to get it here asap (almost 15 dollars total), and I&#x27;m still waiting. They \\&quot;JUST\\&quot;  shipped it out to me. Anyways, I can&#x27;t say weather or not this is a great product, it seems as if it could be, if I could get what I paid for; which is \\&quot;express shipping\\&quot;. I paid almost 3x the product price for the purpose of getting it here QUICK. So of course I am annoyed,with good reason. I could have done the \\&quot;standard shipping\\&quot; and saved me some money. It&#x27;s principle. Hopefully, this product does it&#x27;s job whenever it arrives.</li>
            <li> This is a must have when applying lace wigs! the protector creates a barrier between your skin and the adhesive which allows for EXTRA HOLD along with blocking moisture! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Please, please, please, do not use any kind of wig/scalp adhesive without some sort of scalp protectant for your skin and a solvent to safely remove it! Along with this product I purchased the Ultra Hold adhesive, a roll of supertape and the C-22 Citrus Solvent. It all arrived together, which was great because I wanted to practice before my lace front wig arrived. First, I cleaned the back of my hand with alcohol until the cotton ball was free of debris. I then spread 2 thin layers of the protectant, letting the first layer dry before adding the second. When the protectant no longer felt tacky, I applied a thin layer of Ultra Hold adhesive. It goes on clear and dries clear. As an experiement, I added a layer of supertape to test the difference in the hold with and without the tape. I needed the solvent to remove the tape and glue. I believe the citrus base helps to remove the glues and soothe your skin. I can only imagine what it will be like to remove the glue and tape while under an attached lace front wig. If you are new to this, as I am, I would suggest you either go to your beautician for assistance or watch some of the instructional videos on YouTube. Type in \\&quot;how to apply a lace front wig\\&quot; and all sorts of results pop up. Videos in which the beauty expert applies the products on the model are helpful, but I prefer the ones where the model applies her own products as I will have to do. Overall, I highly recommend this product and the others I mentioned. Again, please do not use wig/scalp adhesive on unprotected skin.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased my first lace front wigs and did my research on what products i would need to go with my new look and came across this product so i tried it. It works great! Very Very happy with this product. I have very sensitive skin/scalp so i put this on ( as you should ) before i put the adhesive on and it worked amazingly. I definitely recommend this product, please do not use any type of adhesive without putting this scalp protector on first. It really works.</li>
            <li> well i did not have any skin irritation when using this product, it dried really well i did&#x27;nt notice that i was being protected so i would say it seemed to be a very good product.</li>
            <li> Works well to protect the edges.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product cause it was suppose to help my lace glue to hold better but you are better off without it.  I did not see any change in the holding power of my glue cause it still did not hold.  So even if you sweat or don not sweat this product do not make a difference.  Try something else.</li>
            <li> I have not used the Walker Scalp Protector 1.4 oz Dab-on .but I received the product quickly. Heard it was good protectant for skin that&#x27;s why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to but makes my skin dry and kinda flaky . Don&#x27;t let that change your mind though , it doesn&#x27;t take much to do that to my skin .</li>
            <li> This is a must as I have heard other say, for anyone who wears a wig &amp; I totally agree with them. It is a must for getting a better hold and protecting your hairline underneath the glue and tape that you are applying to your head.</li>
            <li> SENDER DID NOT SEND THIS TO ME, INSTEAD SENT ME A BOTTLE OF GLUE REMOVER FOR LACE WIG! SO I DONT KNOW IF THIS PRODUCT IS ANY GOOD!</li>
            <li> The Scalp Protector is a great product to use before applying wig glue.  This product came in 2 days after ordering and was packaged nicely and neatly!!</li>
            <li> So I was wearing lace front wigs without using this... going.... I dont need that.... YOU DO&amp;#60; YOU DO!  The glue and tape is SO hard on your skin. USE this! Its great</li>
            <li> This product along with rubbing alcohol, {90 percent} is what is needed to clean the scalp area in preparation for the installation of your new lace front or full lace unit.. It&#x27;s really easy to apply, and will protect the scalp from irritations that may come from any over use of the Walkers Ultra Hold Adhesive. When you apply the Walker Scalp Protector, make sure first that the scalp area is clean and dry, second, apply the Walker Scalp Protector just dab it on the edges of and around the scalp and let it dry. Now you are ready to apply the Walker&#x27;s Ultra Hold Adhesive.</li>
            <li> This product really cleans your scalp and doesn&#x27;t leave any film. I recommend this product for all customers who use lace fronts.</li>
            <li> item arrived quickly, this is a must buy when wearing lace wigs to protect yours scalp when applying any kind of glue. no order or smell safe product to use</li>
            <li> The product does what it states ... Also makes removel easy.  Have to appreciate a product that does what it states.</li>
            <li> This has really helped me retain my edges and not lose hair during glue removal.</li>
            <li> i bought this product a long time and its gooood, did protect my scalp, a bit of smell but not much.</li>
            <li> Have never tried a product that provideds a barrier beteeen scalp and appliance.  Seems to do the job very well.</li>
            <li> alcohol or a skin cleaning will do the same thing, if you just like to use what you think you should then well it&#x27;s your money noones going to judge you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar scalp protector in the past that had a more &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; feel to it once it dried. This version seems watered down in that it doesn&#x27;t have the hold earlier version had.</li>
            <li> makes it easy for my lace wig to be removed and products my scalp.  Recommend to anyone wearing lace wig</li>
            <li> This product holds for a couple of weeks if you know how to apply it correctly... The first time I used it it was kind of messy, but then I had my wife put it on for me while I was guiding her what to do it was perfect... it&#x27;s been like 4 months since I started using it and I&#x27;m looking forward to order more!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really suer whether this product worked or not because I used it in combination with another product (Endura Bond). I don&#x27;t really feel like it cleaned my scalp and if anything, I felt like the alcohol they told me to use before hand did just that. They did say that using would help bond strengthen the bond though and the bond was pretty strong but I can&#x27;t tell if it was because of the actual bond&#x27;s quality or the scalp protectant. Lastly, it didn&#x27;t protect my scalp because I still got a slight rash.</li>
            <li> Never got to use because the wig I got was very bad</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s so much easier to use than tape on a daily basis, and it isn&#x27;t so sticky that it sticks to everything and won&#x27;t come loose.</li>
            <li> Does as promised without adding a bunch more time to my getting ready routine. Inoffensive smell which dissipates quickly. I would say this is perfect for people like me who tend to &amp;#34;glisten&amp;#34; a little more than your average person! Holds up well even under sweat.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell of this and was fearful to use it on my hair line.  Thinking it would dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it has helped with skin irritation or not. Will need to use more than two weeks to give a firm response.</li>
            <li> love this product it does everything it states and more... we have tried many different products and this is the one and you don&#x27;t need to over apply to make the product work properly... it only takes a little</li>
            <li> This product is great. It protected my scalp from the adhesive and it actual help the adhesive stick better. I will  buy more of this product, it did not disappoint at all!</li>
            <li> had trouble getting the stuff out of the bottle, but with practice it worked out fine. would definitely reccommend it to anyone who wears hair pieces/wigs that need to be glued down</li>
            <li> Great Product&lt;br /&gt;Protects my skin &amp;amp; I no longer have irritation from adhesive !!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer will definitely buy from this vendor again</li>
            <li> This scalp protector works for me and it helps when you use adhesives to lay your lace units. It did not irritate my skin around my hair line.</li>
            <li> Great! I use it till today</li>
            <li> Works ok but not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> This product really works in helping the tape to stick and protecting my hairline and skin from damage. I had to apply and re-apply the tape several times as this was my first full lace wig. It did just what it was advertized to do.</li>
            <li> Very useful when applying my lace wig.  But, alcohol will also work if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money for this product.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner and will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Only once did I neglect to use this protector first and I noticed a difference. I experienced some skin irritation. So, now it&#x27;s always a  part of my routine.</li>
            <li> It is good for protecting my scalp, like it should, I tried other brands but I like this one better.</li>
            <li> I try it and it help my wig stay on longer and it help my wig not to lift. I will order it again.Beverly,</li>
            <li> Stings on skin... no different than rubbing alcohol. Rubbing alcohol works the same for less money.  Dont know why its called protector...it cleans the oil off skin so glue sticks better. Smells like rubbing alcohol... just another product to make people spend more money when they can use something they likely already have at home and costs less.</li>
            <li> great product to use with adhesive of any kind..especially wig it gripper....love this product...</li>
            <li> Product did not work as advertised, considered returning but due to the low cost of the product did not bother with the hassel.</li>
            <li> Works great The dabber is easy to use. Smells a little like rubbing alcohol. Works great with Walker tape. Helped hold my thin skin unit in place all day!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference when using this product vs using tape alone. The holding power does not seem any greater when I add this to the scalp first. And also the dabber does not seem to release any product easily. I find that I have to push down extremely hard or tap the dabber constantly to release anything. It seems like just alcohol and I can not see or notice and protective barrier on the skin. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Exciting!!! They have it in a glass bottle now. Fancy</li>
            <li> NO COMMENT ON THIS DIDN&#x27;T USE, BUT I hear it does work, and is suggested for lace front wearers.  READ SOME OTHER REVIEWS</li>
            <li> Acts as a barrier between tape/glue and your skin and it REALLY WORKS.  Just remember to apply, let it dry and reapply, this helps your tape/glue to last longer w/o irritating skin or altering the intergrity of the tape/glue.</li>
