            <li>/&gt;Not to mention, my spouse and father-in-law all now use these and are very happy to have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very good product.</li>
            <li>These work great until I fall asleep</li>
            <li>I wish they worked because I do like the sensation of all that air through my nostrils LOL.</li>
            <li>The best of its kind.</li>
            <li>my brother was able to get tid of his cpap machine and just use these!!</li>
            <li>These worked perfect for me and where comfortable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s place fairly well.</li>
            <li>: Loved these.</li>
            <li>Good investment and works well.</li>
            <li>Good for obstructive sleep apnea, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am fairly neutral on this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a great product I am glad to have purchased.</li>
            <li>These however, they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li>you know how it is , you don&#x27;t hear your own snoring.</li>
            <li>He stopped using them because they weren&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li>But on it&#x27;s own it is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>Turns out, they&#x27;re very easy to put in.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and I had to do some \\&quot;trimming surgery\\&quot; to get this product to fit without irritation to my nose.  </li>
            <li>The fit was good, the function ok.</li>
            <li>I have tried many nasal  type products, this is the best yet, they are soft and stay in place overnight.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Maybe they are made more for men.</li>
            <li>#34;open up&amp;#34; those passages and breath much better through my nose.</li>
            <li>I sorta worked ok but may not help if you have severe sleep apnea (as I do).</li>
            <li>They opened up my breathing better too.</li>
            <li>well I just reordered four more.</li>
            <li>I love this nose opening product.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it may save my life.</li>
            <li>The circumference of the medium at the top most part that goes deepest into the nose is 1 1/4\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The opening measured across the top opening 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li>They should have better ordering instructions.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I slept better</li>
            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t sure..</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m sleeping much better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Works great - much improved air flow in my nostrils.  </li>
            <li>It opened my nostrils and stayed put most of the night...</li>
            <li>I swear, I can breathe MUCH better at night</li>
            <li>It would not be on the top of my list though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The medium fit much better.</li>
            <li>They were much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any tips on how to make them feel more comfortable let me know.</li>
            <li>New design is great like not having to buy sizes that don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Relatively easy to sleep with</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I tried to trim to fit that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>But comfort is important.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the fit.  </li>
            <li>It feels comfortable in my nostrils, no complaints.</li>
            <li>This works much better than the breath right strips.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased the large...which made me feel like I was a bull with a ring in my nose.</li>
            <li>I had to give any &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; feedback - make sure you wash them thoroughly when you first get them.</li>
            <li>Hard to determine best size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful to reduce the snoring sound at times; however, this product keeps falling out of my nose.</li>
            <li>I gave both this product (NasiVent) and the Sleep-Right device a full month trial before making up my mind on how I felt they work for me.</li>
            <li>only good thing about it was the silicone.</li>
            <li>If they were actually medium, they&#x27;d be quite good.</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s just sweet dreams for me.</li>
            <li>It might just be me, but I actually find myself feeling more creative</li>
            <li>and I felt like I had a mild sunburn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced I breathe better than I do just normally,</li>
            <li>Best thing ever..was able to stop taking heavy duty anti histamine and cured upper airway resistance syndrome...</li>
            <li>I did suffer a bit of nose and nose area chafing at first because I was touching them too much--</li>
            <li>I used mine straight away the first night because it looked clean and was free of any residue/dust etc.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I snipped off, it never felt comfortable.</li>
            <li>Realized that I have more of a sinus problem than can be fixed with this item.</li>
            <li>Only thing is - if you own a cat - HIDE THESE.</li>
            <li>Finally, I ordered the XSmall which turned out to be the most comfortable for me.  </li>
            <li>once you get the size right</li>
            <li>Right</li>
            <li>That was a mistake, this product was huge and to get it to fit with the &#x27;fins&#x27; that hold the nose piece in it was wayyy too big.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy and comfortable to wear, and I really do recommend buying the &amp;#34;trial pack&amp;#34; so you can find the proper size for your nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do get a little stained and don&#x27;t look that good but still work well.  </li>
            <li>There may be a way to clean them so they look like new</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>These work and once you get them cut to size, they are comfortable and soft.  </li>
            <li>Buy assortment pack first.</li>
            <li>I will ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>But, SR definitely helps me breathe better.</li>
            <li>I should have ordered the starter pack with the four sizes first as recommended.  </li>
            <li>of my full time on the A P A P machine I haven&#x27;t really done much research on the NasiVent Tube</li>
            <li>Using a Neti-Pot everyday with reduce the good bacteria that you do need in your nostrils and sinus areas.  </li>
            <li>but they may be good for exercising if you have trouble breathing from the nose.</li>
            <li>Clean with 91% alcohol daily, about 1/3 of a cap full.  </li>
            <li>However - - I did notice a difference in effectiveness (for the better) when I moved from the dry Sacramento CA climate to the higher moisture climate of</li>
            <li>I awake feeling refreshed because I was able to breath all night long.</li>
            <li>My snoring has almost completely stopped and it allows me to get a full nights sleep.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Woody Knows and comparing the 2 items, this has less irritation and can easily be trimmed to fit.  </li>
            <li>However, the package says Large and indeed they are Large.</li>
            <li>I thought the medium would work for me since I have a large nose.  </li>
            <li>has really helped with conjestion not snoring</li>
            <li>They worked, and they opened my air passages, but they really bothered me after awhile.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really stop my husband from snoring.</li>
            <li>But I knew I needed a mouth guard to really fix that.</li>
            <li>They are comfy and they really really work.</li>
            <li>I use them every night and the work very well.</li>
            <li>Very uncomforable and does not work as well as others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Too big to be really comfortable.  </li>
            <li>These really work.  </li>
            <li>When he wears them, there isn&#x27;t much differene in how much he snores.  </li>
            <li>This really worked for me.&amp;#34; ;but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My husband use them every night and the work very well.</li>
            <li>Not too much money lost for the venture anyway.</li>
            <li>It does not compliment the A P A P Machine very well.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t really say.  </li>
            <li>works better than other brands</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>A little better than the softer alternatives available but doesn&#x27;t totally relieve congestion or help with sleep apnea.</li>
            <li>Honestly I think almost any size even if it is small would be helpful to almost ANYONE.</li>
            <li>They are discreet enough that most people would not pay attention to them in public.</li>
            <li>I still snore a little, but the increase of dilation of my nostrils keeps me breathing so much better throughout the night.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have to use a new nose strip each night.  </li>
            <li>My husband is a god for even sleeping in the same house as me and not suffocating me with a pillow.</li>
            <li>It opens my nostrils so that I can actually breathe through them for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>Once you trim to fit, they will stay in your nose all night with comfort and you will increase your oxygen and will snore less.  </li>
            <li>I would think they would be pretty good to have when suffering from a cold or allergies to assist breathing when congested at night.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it is reducued slightly, but not enough to be satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>and my thoughts are clear.</li>
            <li>My wife sleeps easier now that I don&#x27;t snore as loudly.</li>
            <li>So, neither fixed that.</li>
            <li>They stay in, and they stop my snoring  - completely.</li>
            <li>These also have a strong chemical scent and that&#x27;s the part I can&#x27;t get past.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and I barely notice them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sooooo I got scared enough after the third episode in 5 months where I was AWARE that I stopped breathing to start looking for a fix.</li>
            <li>The middle can pinch a bit, but with some maneuvering around (sometimes reinserting), it&#x27;s easily fixed.</li>
            <li>I am a 60 year old female who snores.</li>
            <li>Also when I woke up my nose felt dry and required some picking to feel normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not sure if just holding your nose nasal passages would cure snoring anyway,  but it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I apparently snored a few times but it was much lighter and quieter.</li>
            <li>I can finally breathe normally with my mouth closed.</li>

            <li> My husband use them every night and the work very well.</li>
            <li> Not too much money lost for the venture anyway.</li>
            <li> It does not compliment the A P A P Machine very well.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t really say.  </li>
            <li> works better than other brands</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> A little better than the softer alternatives available but doesn&#x27;t totally relieve congestion or help with sleep apnea.</li>
            <li> Honestly I think almost any size even if it is small would be helpful to almost ANYONE.</li>
            <li> They are discreet enough that most people would not pay attention to them in public.</li>
            <li> I still snore a little, but the increase of dilation of my nostrils keeps me breathing so much better throughout the night.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to use a new nose strip each night.  </li>
            <li> My husband is a god for even sleeping in the same house as me and not suffocating me with a pillow.</li>
            <li> It opens my nostrils so that I can actually breathe through them for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> Once you trim to fit, they will stay in your nose all night with comfort and you will increase your oxygen and will snore less.  </li>
            <li> I would think they would be pretty good to have when suffering from a cold or allergies to assist breathing when congested at night.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is reducued slightly, but not enough to be satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> and my thoughts are clear.</li>
            <li> My wife sleeps easier now that I don&#x27;t snore as loudly.</li>
            <li> So, neither fixed that.</li>
            <li> They stay in, and they stop my snoring  - completely.</li>
            <li> These also have a strong chemical scent and that&#x27;s the part I can&#x27;t get past.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and I barely notice them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sooooo I got scared enough after the third episode in 5 months where I was AWARE that I stopped breathing to start looking for a fix.</li>
            <li> The middle can pinch a bit, but with some maneuvering around (sometimes reinserting), it&#x27;s easily fixed.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old female who snores.</li>
            <li> Also when I woke up my nose felt dry and required some picking to feel normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure if just holding your nose nasal passages would cure snoring anyway,  but it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I apparently snored a few times but it was much lighter and quieter.</li>
            <li> I can finally breathe normally with my mouth closed.</li>
            <li> Next, I ordered the small which also felt too large.  </li>
            <li> A man should probably go with a large unless he has a really small nose.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t too uncomfortable and stay in fairly well for me, but not significantly effective.  </li>
            <li> Was difficult judge and to cut the cups to fit within my nostrils but once cut it seems the product did help with my breathing throughout the evening.</li>
            <li> No waking with a dry dry mouth and throat all night long.</li>
            <li> Strap is too big and hangs down noticably.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that I have less sinus drainage in the back of my throat.  </li>
            <li> I have in the past used breathe right strips, and it seemed like lately they where failing.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft, so they don&#x27;t hurt your nose like others that are made of hard plastic.</li>
            <li> I can only wear them for a few minutes before the smell makes me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> And at $25 for 2 tubes, no thanks.</li>
            <li> I am being crushed or smothered.</li>
            <li> I tried them a few times and they did open up my nasal passage, but didn&#x27;t help my snoring.</li>
            <li> Pretty useless; does nothing to stop snoring that I can tell.</li>
            <li> Have tried other types too.</li>
            <li> Pretty scary stuff.</li>
            <li> If you have sinus issues, the use of a Neti-Pot EVERY OTHER DAY and using this product will help.  </li>
            <li> They are a little uncomfortable, and I have to get in the right mindset with them.</li>
            <li> This helps me slightly to reduce snoring, but certainly not a fix.  </li>
            <li> I believe it has toned down my snoring and in the morning</li>
            <li> I did cut them down a bit as directed.</li>
            <li> It takes less time for me to get quality sleep using this device.</li>
            <li> I would say I have an average sized nose, but these are not comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> --I don&#x27;t like any type of restriction or such, makes me very claustrophobic, so those were a huge no go and hurt my jaw.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with these nasal hoses.</li>
            <li> They are not comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> all these are just not a fit for me.</li>
            <li> Cats will play with and destroy or lose them.</li>
            <li> It cleared up in a few hours</li>
            <li> If you want to waste you money you would think to purchase these.  </li>
            <li> Enough about me.&lt;br /&gt;IMHO: NasiVent is too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have a small nose and medium works for me.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it improves the snoring.</li>
            <li> Even after cutting plugs down they were too big and bulky</li>
            <li> and I end up having a hard time breathing.</li>
            <li> but the material is so thick that it caused my nasal air ways to be blocked</li>
            <li> lately I have been having scary nightmares about suffocating..</li>
            <li> Little annoying.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable and all it does is cause my sinuses to drain and plug my nose.</li>
            <li> Difficult to trim evenly.</li>
            <li> I also think it was uncomfortable for him to wear.</li>
            <li> How unhelpful for you folks, sorry</li>
            <li> It makes them uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These even helped my breathe when I had a cold.</li>
            <li> bad news:</li>
            <li> Snoring problem unchanged... :(</li>
            <li> A bad one!</li>
            <li> YES, women snore too.&lt;br /&gt;Truly the worst part for me is the smell.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husbnd who snores terribly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work and is too big for the nose</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with these nasal hoses. Uncomfortable and all it does is cause my sinuses to drain and plug my nose. Snoring problem unchanged... :(</li>
            <li> has really helped with conjestion not snoring</li>
            <li> Really works!  My wife sleeps easier now that I don&#x27;t snore as loudly.</li>
            <li> works better than other brands</li>
            <li> Difficult to trim evenly.</li>
            <li> New design is great like not having to buy sizes that don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Pretty useless; does nothing to stop snoring that I can tell.</li>
            <li> These work and once you get them cut to size, they are comfortable and soft.  They stay in all night too.  Have tried other types too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working for me</li>
            <li> God product. Hard to determine best size. Buy assortment pack first.</li>
            <li> These basically have the same effect that Breath Rite strips do.  Instead of adhesive strips flaring your nose out to keep nostrils open, these keep your nostrils from collapsing.  This helps me slightly to reduce snoring, but certainly not a fix.  They aren&#x27;t too uncomfortable and stay in fairly well for me, but not significantly effective.  I would think they would be pretty good to have when suffering from a cold or allergies to assist breathing when congested at night.  I probably won&#x27;t try them again for snoring elimination, but will try them the next time I am congested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the NasiVent Tube for almost a month. They are not comfortable to wear. I tried to trim to fit that didn&#x27;t help. I now have a whistle when I breathe in. These also have a strong chemical scent and that&#x27;s the part I can&#x27;t get past. I can only wear them for a few minutes before the smell makes me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;Over all these are just not a fit for me. Maybe they are made more for men. YES, women snore too.&lt;br /&gt;Truly the worst part for me is the smell. Even after a month the chemical scent is still there.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the large...which made me feel like I was a bull with a ring in my nose. They worked, and they opened my air passages, but they really bothered me after awhile. The medium fit much better. I have issues with my nasal passages swelling at night, the Nasivent helps me to &amp;#34;open up&amp;#34; those passages and breath much better through my nose.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really stop my husband from snoring. I also think it was uncomfortable for him to wear. I noticed that after he put it on he was snoring from his mouth rather than his nose. So if your partner sleeps with his/her mouth open at all, this won&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> seems to help me breath some</li>
            <li> These work great until I fall asleep and then they always fall out no matter which size I use.  It might just be me.  I wish they worked because I do like the sensation of all that air through my nostrils LOL.</li>
            <li> I have in the past used breathe right strips, and it seemed like lately they where failing. These worked perfect for me and where comfortable. I will ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> These things  actually help you breath</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful to reduce the snoring sound at times; however, this product keeps falling out of my nose. Basically , it won&#x27;t stay when I&#x27;m asleep.</li>
            <li> Relatively easy to sleep with once you get the size right but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Realized that I have more of a sinus problem than can be fixed with this item.</li>
            <li> Was difficult judge and to cut the cups to fit within my nostrils but once cut it seems the product did help with my breathing throughout the evening. I believe it has toned down my snoring and in the morning I awake feeling refreshed because I was able to breath all night long.</li>
            <li> I tried this device as a substitute for bringing my big CPAP machine on a trip. I sorta worked ok but may not help if you have severe sleep apnea (as I do). The fit was good, the function ok. The plug did fall out during the night once but otherwise held it&#x27;s place fairly well.</li>
            <li> I gave both this product (NasiVent) and the Sleep-Right device a full month trial before making up my mind on how I felt they work for me. Because... I&#x27;m a snorer. A bad one! My husband is a god for even sleeping in the same house as me and not suffocating me with a pillow. I&#x27;ve used breathe rights strips for years before I tried anything more...tangible, and wouldn&#x27;t rip off my skin every day. Enough about me.&lt;br /&gt;IMHO: NasiVent is too uncomfortable. No matter how much I snipped off, it never felt comfortable. Another drawback: After a couple minutes with them in, I&#x27;d have air whistling through my nose. Yeah, that&#x27;ll help me sleep. And at $25 for 2 tubes, no thanks. I won&#x27;t purchase them again.&lt;br /&gt;Sleep Right: Loved these. They were much more comfortable. The middle can pinch a bit, but with some maneuvering around (sometimes reinserting), it&#x27;s easily fixed. They opened up my breathing better too. At under $10 for 3, I will definitely keep buying these.&lt;br /&gt;The bad news: I still snore. So, neither fixed that. But I knew I needed a mouth guard to really fix that. But, SR definitely helps me breathe better.</li>
            <li> It works. According to my girlfriend, my snoring is reduced 90%. They&#x27;re soft, so they don&#x27;t hurt your nose like others that are made of hard plastic. These even helped my breathe when I had a cold. Only thing is - if you own a cat - HIDE THESE. Cats will play with and destroy or lose them.</li>
            <li> I am a 60 year old female who snores. lately I have been having scary nightmares about suffocating..and I wake up in a panic gasping for breath. What is happening is sleep apnea. In my sleep my breathing stops and  I dream I am being crushed or smothered. Pretty scary stuff. I will NOT use a CPAP Mask and be hooked to a machine at night. I know myself too well. Sooooo I got scared enough after the third episode in 5 months where I was AWARE that I stopped breathing to start looking for a fix. This product has resolved my mouth breathing and snoring apnea episodes. I have only used it for four nights but it works so well I just reordered four more. No snoring. No mouth breathing. No waking with a dry dry mouth and throat all night long. I love this nose opening product. It opens my nostrils so that I can actually breathe through them for the first time in my life. I love them. I will always use from this day forward. Try it. I did cut them down a bit as directed. They are comfy and they really really work. They did not fall out. I bought the medium. Thank you Nasi VENT folks. I sleep like a baby now!!! I love this product and it may save my life. No kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it still works. Someone asked for measurements. The circumference of the medium at the top most part that goes deepest into the nose is 1 1/4\\&quot;  around sounds big but isn&#x27;t. The opening measured across the top opening 1/4 inch. I have a small nose and medium works for me. A man should probably go with a large unless he has a really small nose. Honestly I think almost any size even if it is small would be helpful to almost ANYONE. But comfort is important.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t wake you up at night. Good investment and works well.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use a new nose strip each night.  very good product.</li>
            <li> I use them every night and the work very well.</li>
            <li> This is the second apperatis I have tried to prevent me from snoring.  I purchased the medium because I would say I have a medium sized nose... That was a mistake, this product was huge and to get it to fit with the &#x27;fins&#x27; that hold the nose piece in it was wayyy too big.  Very uncomforable and does not work as well as others I have tried.  I would not recommend this product..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing about it was the silicone.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of these based on the reviews I read here. Turns out, they&#x27;re very easy to put in. They stay in, and they stop my snoring  - completely. They&#x27;re very soft and I barely notice them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started wearing them as I write.  It might just be me, but I actually find myself feeling more creative and my thoughts are clear. I&#x27;m definitely sleeping better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, my spouse and father-in-law all now use these and are very happy to have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to give any &amp;#34;negative&amp;#34; feedback - make sure you wash them thoroughly when you first get them. I used mine straight away the first night because it looked clean and was free of any residue/dust etc.  However, the next morning, my nostrils were red and I felt like I had a mild sunburn. It cleared up in a few hours and I washed my nasivents and have had no further experiences like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great product I am glad to have purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I had to do some \\&quot;trimming surgery\\&quot; to get this product to fit without irritation to my nose.  I ordered the Woody Knows and comparing the 2 items, this has less irritation and can easily be trimmed to fit.  Clean with 91% alcohol daily, about 1/3 of a cap full.  I still snore a little, but the increase of dilation of my nostrils keeps me breathing so much better throughout the night.  Once you trim to fit, they will stay in your nose all night with comfort and you will increase your oxygen and will snore less.  I also noticed that I have less sinus drainage in the back of my throat.  If you have sinus issues, the use of a Neti-Pot EVERY OTHER DAY and using this product will help.  Using a Neti-Pot everyday with reduce the good bacteria that you do need in your nostrils and sinus areas.  You can research this fact online \\&quot;Mayo Clinic\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> As you can see, the size is listed as medium.  However, the package says Large and indeed they are Large. Too big to be really comfortable.  But they work.  If they were actually medium, they&#x27;d be quite good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fit.  Strap is too big and hangs down noticably.  Even after cutting plugs down they were too big and bulky</li>
            <li> I went with Medium because thinking that I&#x27;m around a medium size built person. I should have gotten small then maybe it would have worked. They should have better ordering instructions.</li>
            <li> I tried these for four nights in a row and I felt like I slept better, my wife said she didn&#x27;t hear snoring. But I wasn&#x27;t sure..you know how it is , you don&#x27;t hear your own snoring. So one night I didn&#x27;t sleep with them without telling her. The next day she said &amp;#34;you snored all night&amp;#34;. So that&#x27;s the proof I have. While I had them in me I apparently snored a few times but it was much lighter and quieter. They are a little uncomfortable, and I have to get in the right mindset with them. If anyone has any tips on how to make them feel more comfortable let me know.</li>
            <li> These really work.  They do get a little stained and don&#x27;t look that good but still work well.  There may be a way to clean them so they look like new but I have not found anyway yet.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m sleeping much better.  It takes less time for me to get quality sleep using this device.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husbnd who snores terribly.  When he wears them, there isn&#x27;t much differene in how much he snores.  Maybe it is reducued slightly, but not enough to be satisfied with.  Also, they have fallen out during the night.  He stopped using them because they weren&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I can finally breathe normally with my mouth closed. My snoring has almost completely stopped and it allows me to get a full nights sleep. I would recommend this product. It feels comfortable in my nostrils, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work falls out of the nose wife said it did not work at all</li>
            <li> I wish I could say &amp;#34;Wow! This really worked for me.&amp;#34; ;but it didn&#x27;t. However - - I did notice a difference in effectiveness (for the better) when I moved from the dry Sacramento CA climate to the higher moisture climate of Post Falls ID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy and comfortable to wear, and I really do recommend buying the &amp;#34;trial pack&amp;#34; so you can find the proper size for your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> Works great - much improved air flow in my nostrils.  This works much better than the breath right strips.  I should have ordered the starter pack with the four sizes first as recommended.  Instead - I ordered the medium.  I thought the medium would work for me since I have a large nose.  The medium turned out to be way too big.  Next, I ordered the small which also felt too large.  Finally, I ordered the XSmall which turned out to be the most comfortable for me.  I wear this when I sleep and also when I exercise.</li>
            <li> I have tried many nasal  type products, this is the best yet, they are soft and stay in place overnight.  Plan to order extra for back-up</li>
            <li> My husband use them every night and the work very well. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It opened my nostrils and stayed put most of the night...but the material is so thick that it caused my nasal air ways to be blocked and I end up having a hard time breathing.</li>
            <li> I snore and I wake up a lot at night gasping or feeling as though I&#x27;m choking. I&#x27;ve tried mouth guards and ugh--I don&#x27;t like any type of restriction or such, makes me very claustrophobic, so those were a huge no go and hurt my jaw. These however, they&#x27;re amazing. I swear, I can breathe MUCH better at night--I never wake myself up, and my sleep has vastly improved. I&#x27;m convinced I breathe better than I do just normally, when I use these. I thought they&#x27;d make me feel panicky, but not at all. I did suffer a bit of nose and nose area chafing at first because I was touching them too much--but that&#x27;s gone away and now it&#x27;s just sweet dreams for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if just holding your nose nasal passages would cure snoring anyway,  but it was worth a try.  Not too much money lost for the venture anyway.</li>
            <li> A little better than the softer alternatives available but doesn&#x27;t totally relieve congestion or help with sleep apnea.</li>
            <li> It does not compliment the A P A P Machine very well. But on it&#x27;s own it is satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;Because of my full time on the A P A P machine I haven&#x27;t really done much research on the NasiVent Tube</li>
            <li> If you want to waste you money you would think to purchase these.  Nasi Vent tube does not work at all.</li>
            <li> didnt work well. unfortunately outside of the return period.</li>
            <li> Not for me. Little annoying.</li>
            <li> The best of its kind. Good for obstructive sleep apnea, too.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever..was able to stop taking heavy duty anti histamine and cured upper airway resistance syndrome...my brother was able to get tid of his cpap machine and just use these!!</li>
            <li> These stay in all night and do improve your breathing.  I&#x27;m not sure it improves the snoring.</li>
            <li> Fell out multiple times so I couldn&#x27;t really say.  How unhelpful for you folks, sorry</li>
            <li> From what I understand about snoring, everyone is different. If you have tried a number of products and none have worked, then give this a shot. It would not be on the top of my list though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly neutral on this product. I would say I have an average sized nose, but these are not comfortable to wear. They can be cut to size but there is a piece sticking out from the edge that is designed to lock itself inside the rim of your nostrile. It makes them uncomfortable. I tried them a few times and they did open up my nasal passage, but didn&#x27;t help my snoring. Also when I woke up my nose felt dry and required some picking to feel normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it but they may be good for exercising if you have trouble breathing from the nose. They are discreet enough that most people would not pay attention to them in public.</li>
