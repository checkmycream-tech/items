    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For best results you should have the eye cream that goes with it.</li>
            <li>It was quite impressive.</li>
            <li>It is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>These products are the best.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best eye serum that I&#x27;ve found in years!!</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best anti-aging product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>If you want a refreshed, well-slept look, this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It works amazing!!</li>
            <li>I am always receiving compliments on my eyes and how great they look.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s and in great shape.  </li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>but it seems that most do because you get the best results.</li>
            <li>These products have lessened my darkness but most of all have flattened the bags beautifully!</li>
            <li>Illuminating cream has some remarkable healing qualities too....</li>
            <li>They ask me what I use on my eyes and compliment me on how good they look for  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>The Illuminating Cream is very nice and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know who these people are who write amazing reviews for some of these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The reduction in the puffiness and lines is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>This does not appear to be an effective long-term treatment.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product for years that would help with eye bags and nothing on the market seemed to be truly effective until I tried this eye tuck.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER had any product deliver these kind of results....</li>
            <li>Seriously, no one can know how wonderfully they work unless they give them a try.</li>
            <li>After 3 months I continue to be surprise and super happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I heard so many rave reviews about this that I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I did some more research on the web and watched the commercials/</li>
            <li>It was just too much to keep hearing all these great stories and seeing the pics I had to buy it.</li>
            <li>All smooth as if I were in my 20s!</li>
            <li>Even without the products on, my eyes are much better than they use to be.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s more like 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>I never saw any notable difference with the exception of my wallet being lighter.</li>
            <li>so this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>If you want an instant fix this is the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li>, I mostly use it with together</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and decided, against my better judgement, to try the product.  </li>
            <li>With sadness I have to report that once applied the product crusted and flaked on my skin - the most tender part of the face, under the eyes.  </li>
            <li>That I seemed more relaxed.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for apprx a month and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love it for the way it flattens and freezes my crows feet.  </li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s why people speak so highly of this product as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very effective with that problem.</li>
            <li>Easy Eye Solutions Instant Tuck is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The long term effect is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from dreaded eye bags for years and nothing worked for them until I found easy eye solutions and believe me I tried everything that was suggested or marketed.</li>
            <li>It is so light and easy to apply...</li>
            <li>It is not only a great moisturizer and treatment for the under eye</li>
            <li>woman says she puts a tiny drop of the serum on her hand and then adds a drop of concealer or foundation and mixes the two then \\&quot;pats\\&quot; the serum under the eye area -- and this works great for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may smooth the eye area a bit, but would probably not repurchase.</li>
            <li>the application is important, and with EES</li>
            <li>Foundation gives a good, natural and evening-out color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy Eye Solutions Instant Tuck is a remarkable eye product.</li>
            <li>When I look in the mirror I can see a difference, it really works!!!</li>
            <li>they answer all your questions and product orders in a in a comprehensive and friendly manner.</li>
            <li>I originally found the serum on their website.</li>
            <li>I found about this product a few years ago on the EDS forum and found that most of the reviews were great.</li>
            <li>One full pump is too much for both eyes, so you need to use a very light finger when getting the product out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I did play around with it the first few weeks to find the best results for  me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to wait a few minutes and let them sink first before applying the serum.</li>
            <li>And make sure your makeup, moisturizer and anything else you apply under the eyes is fully absorbed first.</li>
            <li>I also found this on the EDS forum and those ladies were so helpful with offering their tried and true methods of application.  </li>
            <li>The price is not bad when you consider how well it works.</li>
            <li>The friendly and efficient customer service is worth noting...</li>
            <li>All in all this product is worthy of 4 stars.</li>
            <li>They smooth the whole undereye area and even lines will disappear.  </li>
            <li>Trust me: it is WELL worth</li>
            <li>Just think how effective it is for dark circles and fine lines</li>
            <li>I can suspect is that maybe they&#x27;re not using it right?</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve tried alot of different products but have the most noticeable and quick differences with EES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really appears as if i got an lower eye tuck!</li>
            <li>There is no gluey feeling whatsoever!</li>
            <li>It was mother that first started using these products.  </li>
            <li>My father looks terrific and has so much more confidence.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have bought which actually does what it says, I love it :))</li>
            <li>I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a 5 star product and more.</li>
            <li>If this isn&#x27;t an easy option for you, you can set your hair dryer on COOL and dry the product faster.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much, you&#x27;ll get that whitish film so start out with a tiny amount first and then add more if you need too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were so surprised that a cream gave such amazing results.</li>
            <li>I hope it might help others because this really has been nothing short of a MIRACLE for my eye bags! :-)</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking to make a positive change in their appearance.</li>
            <li>Understanding the best application is a small amount needed, I have my youthful normal eyes back!  </li>
            <li>This is the first product i can say that had an instant significant result.</li>
            <li>I am ready to order again after 4 months.</li>
            <li>have spent more on OTC pricey products -- like this -- that don&#x27;t work than it would have cost me to seek a surgical solution.  </li>
            <li>Feeling taken in yet again, and very foolish.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a full size bottle, the only place you can buy a sample bottle online is at:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow this link and watch this live video of how well it works for one woman with very puffy eyes.....</li>
            <li>My parents had the typical baggy puffy eyes that most people get as they age.  </li>
            <li>There are many ways to apply it and different methods for different people.</li>
            <li>My main gripe is how overpriced it is.  </li>
            <li>but you realize you only need to use less and the product will perform beautifully and last many months by using less!    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>It always did - even in high school.</li>
            <li>I also use the other Easy Eye Solutions product, the Illuminating Eye care.  </li>
            <li>you normally use a lot of eye cream, moisturizers, sunscreen or  creamy concealers (around the eye area)</li>
            <li>I began to see results very quickly, and have stopped using my Cover Girl concealer entirely which I used to use religiously.  </li>
            <li>Easy enough for even a male like me to use.</li>
            <li>Especially the right one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to keep your face very still for at least five minutes after application.  </li>
            <li>Like any new cream or serum</li>
            <li>After applying both with make up all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>It took about a week before I got them to tuck in and tried a lot of different ways to apply (went through a bit of product the first week)</li>
            <li>first read about it on the Essential Day forum and am so surprised when some people here on Amazon say that they didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>I was starting to get the usual morning puffiness but also notice that these little lines and creases were showing more and more.</li>
            <li>The product works and is good - forget about the eye cream and other products in the line though, they&#x27;re pointless.  </li>
            <li>It has little light effects to make the under eye area lighter.</li>
            <li>This is a treatment that offers two products.</li>
            <li>If too much product is applied a bit of white or caking can happen</li>
            <li>(actually just the  really close friends :</li>
            <li>and actually when I started I didn&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few products she can actually use :-)ra.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the few products she can actually use :-)</li>
            <li>but they always left my lower lid area feeling dry and irritated, easy eye solutions moisturizers at the same time  </li>
            <li>I bought the other cream that goes with it which is very light and hides dark shadows for some eliminating the need for concealer</li>
            <li>It has a very slight temporary tightening and leaves a glue-like substance that easily rubs off, but unless you rub it all off, it leaves white bumps under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>However, if you have major issues with dark circles and swelling it is worth the expense.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it instantly firm my under eye area and smooth out all the crinkles and wrinkles, but had an accumulative effect.</li>
            <li>There is definitely a learning curve, especially when it comes to using too much.  </li>
            <li>Then put a small drop of whatever foundation you use right next to the serum and gently mix the two together.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>As far as the product lasting a year I disagree.  </li>
            <li>only website that offers the sample size bottle is the: \\&quot;Anti-Aging Beauty Zone.com\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li>My friend has such sensitive skin</li>
            <li>For most people I didn&#x27;t tell them but some of my girlfriends I let in on the secret.</li>
            <li>The products firmed my under eyes, got rid of the lines and certainly the puffiness and my dark circles were gone.  </li>
            <li>But if your problem is just dark circles, don&#x27;t put too much hope into this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t typically have a problem with eye bags unless I&#x27;ve eaten something very salty before bed.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone that has dark circles and puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li>and you have a very visible layer of white under your eyes, regardless of how little of the product you use.</li>

            <li> I also use the other Easy Eye Solutions product, the Illuminating Eye care.  </li>
            <li> you normally use a lot of eye cream, moisturizers, sunscreen or  creamy concealers (around the eye area)</li>
            <li> I began to see results very quickly, and have stopped using my Cover Girl concealer entirely which I used to use religiously.  </li>
            <li> Easy enough for even a male like me to use.</li>
            <li> Especially the right one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very important to keep your face very still for at least five minutes after application.  </li>
            <li> Like any new cream or serum</li>
            <li> After applying both with make up all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> It took about a week before I got them to tuck in and tried a lot of different ways to apply (went through a bit of product the first week)</li>
            <li> first read about it on the Essential Day forum and am so surprised when some people here on Amazon say that they didn&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> I was starting to get the usual morning puffiness but also notice that these little lines and creases were showing more and more.</li>
            <li> The product works and is good - forget about the eye cream and other products in the line though, they&#x27;re pointless.  </li>
            <li> It has little light effects to make the under eye area lighter.</li>
            <li> This is a treatment that offers two products.</li>
            <li> If too much product is applied a bit of white or caking can happen</li>
            <li> (actually just the  really close friends :</li>
            <li> and actually when I started I didn&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few products she can actually use :-)ra.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few products she can actually use :-)</li>
            <li> but they always left my lower lid area feeling dry and irritated, easy eye solutions moisturizers at the same time  </li>
            <li> I bought the other cream that goes with it which is very light and hides dark shadows for some eliminating the need for concealer</li>
            <li> It has a very slight temporary tightening and leaves a glue-like substance that easily rubs off, but unless you rub it all off, it leaves white bumps under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> However, if you have major issues with dark circles and swelling it is worth the expense.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it instantly firm my under eye area and smooth out all the crinkles and wrinkles, but had an accumulative effect.</li>
            <li> There is definitely a learning curve, especially when it comes to using too much.  </li>
            <li> Then put a small drop of whatever foundation you use right next to the serum and gently mix the two together.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> As far as the product lasting a year I disagree.  </li>
            <li> only website that offers the sample size bottle is the: \\&quot;Anti-Aging Beauty Zone.com\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> My friend has such sensitive skin</li>
            <li> For most people I didn&#x27;t tell them but some of my girlfriends I let in on the secret.</li>
            <li> The products firmed my under eyes, got rid of the lines and certainly the puffiness and my dark circles were gone.  </li>
            <li> But if your problem is just dark circles, don&#x27;t put too much hope into this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically have a problem with eye bags unless I&#x27;ve eaten something very salty before bed.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone that has dark circles and puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li> and you have a very visible layer of white under your eyes, regardless of how little of the product you use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve purchased this and don&#x27;t like it, I highly suggest you try again using less product.  </li>
            <li> but it does not last long.  </li>
            <li> It is not unusual to have a white residue under you eyes when product dries.  </li>
            <li> But, it lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I wonder how long it will take for me to pay for it.....  </li>
            <li> Working long hours and commuting takes a toll.</li>
            <li> The Peter Thomas Roth product works better, and it&#x27;s less expensive .</li>
            <li> I have bought other products that do similar to this</li>
            <li> It was different than any other eye product I had ever tried before.  </li>
            <li> And this does not irritate or dry her skin.</li>
            <li> And this does not irritate or dry her skin.</li>
            <li> Also it seems to dry out the skin under the eyes, creating wrinkles that weren&#x27;t there before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am one that cannot cry as my eyes will take days to go down, these products take that problem away also, instantly!     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried putting on just a little bit on,  but no matter what it appears to leave a white film.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> I never really thought these were products I would benefit from.  </li>
            <li> I tried a second time to apply over a heavy moisturizer and it continued to crust and flake.  </li>
            <li> I have spent $$$ looking for a product that could help with my eyes and I have found it..</li>
            <li> but for those who of you who say that it&#x27;s worthless ---- honestly I don&#x27;t think you all took the time to work with</li>
            <li> , I found out you can buy a smaller sample size bottle for less than half the cost if you just want to try</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have months to sit around and wait for results with other products or thousands to spend on surgery</li>
            <li> I wish I listened to the other people who ordered this product.</li>
            <li> now on, I&#x27;m definitely sticking only to Amazon verified purchases reviews at the very least.</li>
            <li> One being the Illuminating Eye Cream and the other the Eye Tuck Serum that also treats dark circles.</li>
            <li> Bags create shadows that are dark</li>
            <li> It tightens and firms the baggy tissue under the eyes and helps with the dark discoloration.   </li>
            <li> I had dark circles as well that I would cover with concealer.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market claiming to help with bags and dark circles.</li>
            <li> My dark circles have also reduced quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I looked old and tired.  </li>
            <li> Using a half pump for both eyes</li>
            <li> I started using these products a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> As time has gone on I now need less to tuck the bags</li>
            <li> Product piles up under the eye area, feels like glue on even after applying just a little bit.   </li>
            <li> Still I haven&#x27;t found anything else that sucks in loose skin and eye bags as well, so there you go.</li>
            <li> you need so little, and it isnt&#x27; heavily scented...</li>
            <li> wasted over $100 on these products.</li>
            <li> It works in just a few minutes and you can feel the product working.  </li>
            <li> After just a few application, people kept making comments , asking if I had changed my hair , etc.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who wrote the rave reviews of this product (a couple of places on the internet) - but except for an initial cosmetic change within a few minutes after using the stuff (which goes away rapidly), I see no difference in under-eye appearance, and the darkness is perhaps worse.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products over the years that \\&quot;claimed\\&quot; they worked for dark circles and puffy eyes, only to leave me frustrated with no results in the end.  </li>
            <li> I have tried at least two other eye firming products before but nothing like this.  </li>
            <li> Press the pump very slowly and carefully because you don&#x27;t want a lot of the serum.</li>
            <li> I find this products expensive to use daily ($104.00 for both).  </li>
            <li> My mother did mention that because of the fat deposit she was not sure the products would tuck, but they did.  </li>
            <li> The secret is applying correctly.  </li>
            <li> So, I share my secret with them</li>
            <li> , P.S. someone said it&#x27;s irritating......??</li>
            <li> This item does not work and is even irritating.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it was ridiculous when reading that in a review!</li>
            <li> but I do have the world&#x27;s worst dark circles and have spent thousands on laser treatments, peels, and injections trying to rid myself of them.</li>
            <li> so you lose half your pump every time you go to use it which for an expensive product like this is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the small dot or two tapping like crazy  and evenly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not make any difference with my circles.</li>
            <li> That is absurd</li>
            <li> sorry..........</li>
            <li> say it&#x27;s expensive $74.00 for a 1/2 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> I used the serum on a weird rash that covered my arm and it cleared it up within hours.  </li>
            <li> I took before and after pictures and even I was shocked at the difference.</li>
            <li> We took it along on our vacation to Mexico and my wife used it to treat a bad sunburn on her chest...and it worked!  </li>
            <li> Bought this product based on on-line reviews and it is horrible.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this product based on on-line reviews and it is horrible.  Product piles up under the eye area, feels like glue on even after applying just a little bit.   Once outside product looks white and needs to be removed.  Wish I hadn&#x27;t fell for the review, wasted over $100 on these products.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  If applied correctly your eyes have a much younger look.  The secret is applying correctly.  It is not unusual to have a white residue under you eyes when product dries.  If this happens you need to pat water over the area.  As far as the product lasting a year I disagree.  I only use the product a couple of times a week. Using a half pump for both eyes I am ready to order again after 4 months. For best results you should have the eye cream that goes with it. The Illuminating (sp) Eye goes on prior th the Instant Eye Tuck.    I find this products expensive to use daily ($104.00 for both).  However, if you have major issues with dark circles and swelling it is worth the expense.  Note: If you have fat deposits (puffies) the product reduces the swelling some but NOTHING but surgery gets rid of fat deposits.    Working in the cosmetic industry for years I know that there is NO miracle topical. Beware of miracle claims. All in all this product is worthy of 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I heard so many rave reviews about this that I decided to try it.  I&#x27;m 29 and have no bags but I do have the world&#x27;s worst dark circles and have spent thousands on laser treatments, peels, and injections trying to rid myself of them. Unfortunately, this product did not make any difference with my circles. Bags create shadows that are dark and I think that&#x27;s why people speak so highly of this product as I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very effective with that problem. But if your problem is just dark circles, don&#x27;t put too much hope into this.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product while in a skin care forum that I have been in for years. Several women were raving about it and even had some before and after pictures. It was quite impressive. I did some more research on the web and watched the commercials/videos they had on youtube. I lurked around that thread for awhile reading about the experiences of the users before I tried it. It was just too much to keep hearing all these great stories and seeing the pics I had to buy it. This is a treatment that offers two products. One being the Illuminating Eye Cream and the other the Eye Tuck Serum that also treats dark circles. You are not required to get both products but it seems that most do because you get the best results. There are many ways to apply it and different methods for different people. The Illuminating Cream is very nice and goes on easy. It has little light effects to make the under eye area lighter. After applying both with make up all I can say is WOW!  It really appears as if i got an lower eye tuck! All smooth as if I were in my 20s! I&#x27;m 42. I have almost had an accident while driving because I kept looking in my mirror! Now men use this too. a lot of them. So you do not need make up at all for it to work. The price is not bad when you consider how well it works. And think about what you would spend on a lower eye job. For my circles I see immediate results as it helps my concealer do its job and that has never happened before. It is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products over the years that \\&quot;claimed\\&quot; they worked for dark circles and puffy eyes, only to leave me frustrated with no results in the end.  I looked these products up on YouTube and I saw the before/after videos and was just amazed.  I had to give them a try.  It works in just a few minutes and you can feel the product working.  It tightens and firms the baggy tissue under the eyes and helps with the dark discoloration.   I have even let my friends and family try this product and they are amazed by the results.  I highly recommend this to anyone that has dark circles and puffy eyes.  This product is a godsend!</li>
            <li> I started using these products a year and a half ago.  I am always receiving compliments on my eyes and how great they look.  These products have lessened my darkness but most of all have flattened the bags beautifully! Even without the products on, my eyes are much better than they use to be. The EES products have definitely worked as a treatment over time for this area and I will never be without them.  Understanding the best application is a small amount needed, I have my youthful normal eyes back!  They smooth the whole undereye area and even lines will disappear.  I am one that cannot cry as my eyes will take days to go down, these products take that problem away also, instantly!     I have never been happier with a product, it&#x27;s a daily must for me.  There is no gluey feeling whatsoever! That is absurd and I thought it was ridiculous when reading that in a review! In fact I feel nothing is on my eyes at all!  If too much product is applied a bit of white or caking can happen but you realize you only need to use less and the product will perform beautifully and last many months by using less!    If I could, I would give these products a 100 star rating!  Seriously, no one can know how wonderfully they work unless they give them a try. I have dropped all thoughts of lower eye Blepharoplasty surgery, so I Thank you deeply from my heart, creator of EES!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who wrote the rave reviews of this product (a couple of places on the internet) - but except for an initial cosmetic change within a few minutes after using the stuff (which goes away rapidly), I see no difference in under-eye appearance, and the darkness is perhaps worse. This does not appear to be an effective long-term treatment. My suggestion is to either save your money and try something else (no \\&quot;treatment\\&quot; probably works too well with the possible exception of surgery), try to conceal it somehow, or just accept the darkness and move on.</li>
            <li> It was mother that first started using these products.  Then my father got on the band wagon.  My parents had the typical baggy puffy eyes that most people get as they age.  Instantly these products went to work.  My parents look years younger.  In fact some of my mother&#x27;s friends thought she had a cosmetic procedure for her eyes.  My father looks terrific and has so much more confidence. My mother did mention that because of the fat deposit she was not sure the products would tuck, but they did.  Later I started using them.  I never really thought these were products I would benefit from.  I am in my 30&#x27;s and in great shape.  I was starting to get the usual morning puffiness but also notice that these little lines and creases were showing more and more. I had dark circles as well that I would cover with concealer. The products firmed my under eyes, got rid of the lines and certainly the puffiness and my dark circles were gone.  Yes gone!  I couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it so my friends also joined in.  These products are the best. The long term effect is wonderful.  There is a bit of a trial and error with the applications in the beginning but it does not last long.  I highly recommend them.  They work just as promised.  I also use the other Easy Eye Solutions product, the Illuminating Eye care.  It is not only a great moisturizer and treatment for the under eye but it doubles as a concealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for since April of 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first read about it on the Essential Day forum and am so surprised when some people here on Amazon say that they didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can suspect is that maybe they&#x27;re not using it right? I did play around with it the first few weeks to find the best results for  me. If you use too much, you&#x27;ll get that whitish film so start out with a tiny amount first and then add more if you need too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you normally use a lot of eye cream, moisturizers, sunscreen or  creamy concealers (around the eye area) it&#x27;s best to wait a few minutes and let them sink first before applying the serum. That helps alot too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One woman says she puts a tiny drop of the serum on her hand and then adds a drop of concealer or foundation and mixes the two then \\&quot;pats\\&quot; the serum under the eye area -- and this works great for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry.......... but for those who of you who say that it&#x27;s worthless ---- honestly I don&#x27;t think you all took the time to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works and it&#x27;s the best eye serum that I&#x27;ve found in years!! I&#x27;ve been searching for something like this that tightens without drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say it&#x27;s expensive $74.00 for a 1/2 ounce bottle. But, it lasts a long, long time. The website says it could last up to 6 months. For me it&#x27;s more like 3-4 months. But I&#x27;m always sharing a drop here and there with friends. They ask me what I use on my eyes and compliment me on how good they look for  my age......So, I share my secret with them (actually just the  really close friends :-))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I found out you can buy a smaller sample size bottle for less than half the cost if you just want to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only website that offers the sample size bottle is the: \\&quot;Anti-Aging Beauty Zone.com\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, P.S. someone said it&#x27;s irritating......?? My friend has such sensitive skin she&#x27;s even allergic to aloe vera. And this does not irritate or dry her skin. It&#x27;s one of the few products she can actually use :-)ra. And this does not irritate or dry her skin. It&#x27;s one of the few products she can actually use :-)</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market claiming to help with bags and dark circles. I never saw any notable difference with the exception of my wallet being lighter. This is the first product i can say that had an instant significant result. My bags that i couldnt cover even with makeup instantly were smoothed over and tightened. this is now the only product i rely on for my eye issues. It works amazing!! I don&#x27;t have months to sit around and wait for results with other products or thousands to spend on surgery so this is the next best thing. If you want an instant fix this is the perfect product for you.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best anti-aging product I&#x27;ve ever used. It has taken YEARS off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a member of the EDS forum, and there are a lot of women there with all different types of skin, skin issues, etc. This product has worked for a lot of our members, but it sometimes takes a lot of trial and error. Trust me: it is WELL worth persevering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how it works for me:&lt;br /&gt;1. Press the pump very slowly and carefully because you don&#x27;t want a lot of the serum. We&#x27;re talking the size of a grain of rice! (Otherwise, you get the \\&quot;white flake\\&quot; and \\&quot;glue-like\\&quot; problems that others have described).&lt;br /&gt;2. Press the serum on to the upper side of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;3. Then put a small drop of whatever foundation you use right next to the serum and gently mix the two together.&lt;br /&gt;4. Dab onto the bottom of the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You DON&#x27;T need to use concealer with the product because the effect is whitening. Foundation gives a good, natural and evening-out color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what worked for me. I hope it might help others because this really has been nothing short of a MIRACLE for my eye bags! :-)</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dreaded eye bags for years and nothing worked for them until I found easy eye solutions and believe me I tried everything that was suggested or marketed. It took about a week before I got them to tuck in and tried a lot of different ways to apply (went through a bit of product the first week) but once I got there I have never looked back and will never be without it now.   As time has gone on I now need less to tuck the bags and I never wake in the morning with puffy eyes, they are tucked in until after my shower, then it is time to apply for the day.   I bought the other cream that goes with it which is very light and hides dark shadows for some eliminating the need for concealer, I mostly use it with together but if I am in a hurry I just use this one.  I have bought other products that do similar to this but they always left my lower lid area feeling dry and irritated, easy eye solutions moisturizers at the same time  This is the only product that I have bought which actually does what it says, I love it :))</li>
            <li> I wish I listened to the other people who ordered this product. For me it didn&#x27;t do anything. Try to find something else. This is not for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my puffy eyes. I even had eye surgery to remove the fat pads, but my eyes still looked puffy. Especially the right one. It always did - even in high school. I found about this product a few years ago on the EDS forum and found that most of the reviews were great. Some didn&#x27;t like it, but I know realize it&#x27;s the way you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long, long way. And make sure your makeup, moisturizer and anything else you apply under the eyes is fully absorbed first. I wait about 10 minutes, then apply the serum. I love it!! I feel it&#x27;s like a girdle for my eyes...sort of pulls everything in and up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a full size bottle, the only place you can buy a sample bottle online is at: Anti-Aging Beauty Zone.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow this link and watch this live video of how well it works for one woman with very puffy eyes.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided, against my better judgement, to try the product.  With sadness I have to report that once applied the product crusted and flaked on my skin - the most tender part of the face, under the eyes.  I tried a second time to apply over a heavy moisturizer and it continued to crust and flake.  Plus, through it all I noticed no change in the appearance of my under eye bagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent more on OTC pricey products -- like this -- that don&#x27;t work than it would have cost me to seek a surgical solution.  I think I have finally learned my lesson.  Hummm --  I wonder how long it will take for me to pay for it.....  Feeling taken in yet again, and very foolish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give a short summary of this product. Overpriced potion that does nothing as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t perform as claimed in the literature. All it does is make you look like a cartoon when it dries and you have a very visible layer of white under your eyes, regardless of how little of the product you use. Also it seems to dry out the skin under the eyes, creating wrinkles that weren&#x27;t there before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically this is what happens: You put it on. It dries. Turns white and flakes, and you have to wash it off or else you walk around looking like a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know who these people are who write amazing reviews for some of these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on, I&#x27;m definitely sticking only to Amazon verified purchases reviews at the very least.</li>
            <li> I found this product just Ok.  I did not see any miraculous results from it. It may smooth the eye area a bit, but would probably not repurchase.</li>
            <li> The product works and is good - forget about the eye cream and other products in the line though, they&#x27;re pointless.  My main gripe is how overpriced it is.  It also dries in the pump so you lose half your pump every time you go to use it which for an expensive product like this is disappointing.  Still I haven&#x27;t found anything else that sucks in loose skin and eye bags as well, so there you go.</li>
            <li> Easy Eye Solutions Instant Tuck is wonderful. Working long hours and commuting takes a toll. I thought nothing would help with my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; eyes. I read some reviews of this product and thought why not. I was willing to try anything. After just a few application, people kept making comments , asking if I had changed my hair , etc. That I seemed more relaxed. For most people I didn&#x27;t tell them but some of my girlfriends I let in on the secret. They were so surprised that a cream gave such amazing results. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to make a positive change in their appearance.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  It is so light and easy to apply...you need so little, and it isnt&#x27; heavily scented...I began to see results very quickly, and have stopped using my Cover Girl concealer entirely which I used to use religiously.  Also, the product lasts quite awhile.  The friendly and efficient customer service is worth noting...they answer all your questions and product orders in a in a comprehensive and friendly manner. Try it out!</li>
            <li> Do not buy! Does not work. Leaves a white residue then peels off. I&#x27;ve tried putting on just a little bit on,  but no matter what it appears to leave a white film.  Rip off!</li>
            <li> Save your money ladies, this doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It has a very slight temporary tightening and leaves a glue-like substance that easily rubs off, but unless you rub it all off, it leaves white bumps under your eyes.  I was really hoping this would work.  The Peter Thomas Roth product works better, and it&#x27;s less expensive .</li>
            <li> I have spent $$$ looking for a product that could help with my eyes and I have found it.. I originally found the serum on their website. Now that Amazon has it, that is a savings for a product I will be repeatly purchasing.  I have been using it for apprx a month and LOVE it. Like any new cream or serum the application is important, and with EES it&#x27;s the small dot or two tapping like crazy  and evenly. I will include this in my makeup routine daily .! When I look in the mirror I can see a difference, it really works!!!</li>
            <li> Easy Eye Solutions Instant Tuck is a remarkable eye product. I have been looking for a product for years that would help with eye bags and nothing on the market seemed to be truly effective until I tried this eye tuck. This product works immediately and also is a treatment that will have cumulative affect on the under eye area. I put the product on and within five minutes I have eyes like I did when I was in my 20&#x27;s...I am 54. I have used the product for months and I can already see improvement in my under eye area. I took before and after pictures and even I was shocked at the difference. I have NEVER had any product deliver these kind of results....I look years younger...even when it is allergy season or I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep. This is one product I will NEVER be without. Also the pump bottle has enough applications to last a year. It is definitely a 5 star product and more.</li>
            <li> Before I started using the Instant Eye Tuck I looked old and tired.  I bought the product and used it daily.  It was different than any other eye product I had ever tried before.  Not only did it instantly firm my under eye area and smooth out all the crinkles and wrinkles, but had an accumulative effect. The reduction in the puffiness and lines is amazing. I also use the Illuminating Eye Care by the same company.  My dark circles have also reduced quite a bit. I had no issues with the applications.  It was easier than I thought it would be and actually when I started I didn&#x27;t expect much but I have seen such a difference that they are now part of my regular routine.</li>
            <li> Easy enough for even a male like me to use. 30 seconds in the morning and malar bags were minimized.</li>
            <li> I just received my third bottle of this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years.  I also found this on the EDS forum and those ladies were so helpful with offering their tried and true methods of application.  There is definitely a learning curve, especially when it comes to using too much.  One full pump is too much for both eyes, so you need to use a very light finger when getting the product out of the bottle.  I don&#x27;t typically have a problem with eye bags unless I&#x27;ve eaten something very salty before bed.  I love it for the way it flattens and freezes my crows feet.  It&#x27;s not crucial, but it definitely helps to use the moisturizer partner before applying the serum.  It will brighten your eye and help prevent flaking of the serum.  It&#x27;s very important to keep your face very still for at least five minutes after application.  If this isn&#x27;t an easy option for you, you can set your hair dryer on COOL and dry the product faster.  I do this a lot because my kids are always coming into the bathroom and just the process of speaking makes your facial muscles move.  If you&#x27;ve purchased this and don&#x27;t like it, I highly suggest you try again using less product.  It&#x27;s not a miracle in a bottle...only a surgeon can do that.  If you want a refreshed, well-slept look, this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use the instant eye tuck and and illuminating serum...we&#x27;ve tried alot of different products but have the most noticeable and quick differences with EES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Illuminating cream has some remarkable healing qualities too....I used the serum on a weird rash that covered my arm and it cleared it up within hours.  We took it along on our vacation to Mexico and my wife used it to treat a bad sunburn on her chest...and it worked!  Just think how effective it is for dark circles and fine lines....fabulous!</li>
            <li> I have tried at least two other eye firming products before but nothing like this.  Not only did my under eye puffiness disapear with in minutes the puffiness has shrunk and not as severe as it used to be before I started using the Instant Eye Tuck.  I do not apply every day because I no longer have to.  After 3 months I continue to be surprise and super happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This item does not work and is even irritating.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;m still searching for a product that actually works. It deserves 0 stars.</li>
    </ol>
