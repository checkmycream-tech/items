            <li>Good product for the money.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product.</li>
            <li>not as good as the salon Cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and am always happy that I can still find it.  </li>
            <li>Purchased Nexxus Promend from Target instead - much better!</li>

            <li>Really nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>I liked the old&lt;br /&gt;formula better.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and have tried everything.  </li>
            <li>So glad Paul Mitchell products are still around.</li>
            <li>Product is light but gives nice body to my ultra fine hair.</li>
            <li>A better price than the hair salon when postage is free.</li>
            <li>Very quick service.</li>
            <li>hydrating shine and curl definition great product also good for blow dried hair.</li>

            <li>If you need more, then only takes a bit more.</li>
            <li>Great product - hard to find elsewhere</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>Never forgot how good my hair felt using these products, especially when I paid much more for something that did me no good at all.</li>
            <li>I apply a little of this product and it becomes smooth and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Ebay.</li>
            <li>My hair loves this product and the ONE conditioner, which is benefits your skin as it is washed out of your hair and glides over your body, then really controls your hair as well.</li>
            <li>The price at Amazon is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I also use and highly recommend Paul Mitchell Strength.</li>
            <li>It is not available in many stores.  </li>
            <li>Tried giving it the benefit of the doubt since it has such good reviews - used it for a couple of weeks and all it did was leave my hair with a hard residue.</li>
            <li>Just beware - this seller has some old stock they&#x27;re trying to peddle!</li>
            <li>Not exactly like the original</li>
            <li>Not only does it last long in the hair and feels smooth and not tacky/sticky/heavy like cheap products, but the 6.8 ozs has lasted me about 2 months of daily use.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and a little water helps to reset hair.</li>
            <li>It was a little on the expensive side, but works great!</li>
            <li>They are probably just trying to get rid of an old stock.</li>
            <li>This seller passed off an old tube of this product on us.  </li>
            <li>So far, this is it.  </li>
            <li>Always consistent, long shelf life.</li>
            <li>Hair stays soft and silky when combed out.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product yet, but the bottle I received looks old and dirty, and quite possibly even used. I&#x27;m weary of trying it, but oh well, hopefully it will still be good. Perhaps get this one from a salon or other store that carries it.</li>
            <li> I like Paul Mitchell Cream Conditioner.  Sorry I can&#x27;t find it elsewhere, but I&#x27;m happier now.  Thanks to Ebay.</li>
            <li> This a great product. My hair has a lot of static when its cold out and there&#x27;s no humidity. I use a tiny amount after I wash or wet my hair and I will have no static at all.  It&#x27;s a good conditioner too.  Good product for the money.</li>
            <li> Very quick service. I love this product and am always happy that I can still find it.  I should start stocking multiples in case it gets discontinued...</li>
            <li> This is a really good product. For some years, I began trying other brands but here I am again. Never forgot how good my hair felt using these products, especially when I paid much more for something that did me no good at all. My hair loves this product and the ONE conditioner, which is benefits your skin as it is washed out of your hair and glides over your body, then really controls your hair as well. I have colored hair and I am not young. So, any product that takes 20 years off the way my hair feels deserves my patronage. As they say: Sometimes you don&#x27;t know what you have until it&#x27;s gone. I also use and highly recommend Paul Mitchell Strength. After using it on my towel dried hair, I later felt like I had been to the salon after styling. So glad Paul Mitchell products are still around.</li>
            <li> BEWARE IF BUYING FROM PHARMAPACKS! When I opened it, this product had a liquid consistency with clumps, yellow color, and an unpleasant scent. Tried giving it the benefit of the doubt since it has such good reviews - used it for a couple of weeks and all it did was leave my hair with a hard residue. Realized it must be expired or tampered with Paul Mitchell. Asked Pharmapacks for a refund, they refused. They are probably just trying to get rid of an old stock. Extremely dissatisfied. Such a waste of money, threw it in the trash. Purchased Nexxus Promend from Target instead - much better!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years (maybe 20+).  My husband now uses it too and loves it!  This seller passed off an old tube of this product on us.  The packaging changed quite awhile ago to the tube that is pictured.  I know because I have purchased it a few times since the change.  I did not return it because it did not smell bad and the cream had not separated so I assume that it has a long shelf life.  Just beware - this seller has some old stock they&#x27;re trying to peddle!</li>
            <li> really helps with static electricity.  I have very fine hair and have tried everything.  So far, this is it.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the best product in the world! It holds hair in a flexible place.</li>
            <li> Not exactly like the original but it works. I have not found  another product like it.</li>
            <li> hydrating shine and curl definition great product also good for blow dried hair.</li>
            <li> Great hair stuff. A better price than the hair salon when postage is free. Always consistent, long shelf life. Easy to apply and a little water helps to reset hair. Bought this for my wife, but we both use it.</li>
            <li> Even though Paul Mitchell says they only changed the packaging and not the formula, I think it&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair softer than it used to and it competes with the setting lotion in it.  I liked the old&lt;br /&gt;formula better.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best hair styling product on the market.  I always buy it from Amazon.  It is not available in many stores.  The price at Amazon is reasonable.  It comes in a few days.</li>
            <li> Great product, but about $2 cheaper at Walmart. You only need a dime size amount to rub between hands then apply. If you need more, then only takes a bit more. Not only does it last long in the hair and feels smooth and not tacky/sticky/heavy like cheap products, but the 6.8 ozs has lasted me about 2 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> Product is light but gives nice body to my ultra fine hair. All gels I have tried are too heavy  and curls fall flat</li>
            <li> Great product. It was a little on the expensive side, but works great!</li>
            <li> I shampoo and when my hair is damp I apply a little of this product and it becomes smooth and tangle free.  No conditioner in the shower!  I have been using this product for years!</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot! I love it!</li>
            <li> Great price and availability.  I was unable to find this item in any of our local salons. Really nice product.</li>
            <li> great product - good price</li>
            <li> not as good as the salon Cream.  it seemed watery.</li>
            <li> Great product - hard to find elsewhere</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Hair stays soft and silky when combed out.</li>
            <li> great.  Makes my hair shine like when my hairdresser wshes my hair.</li>
