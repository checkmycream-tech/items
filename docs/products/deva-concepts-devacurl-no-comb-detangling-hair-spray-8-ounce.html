    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this line for our hairy family!</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with the no-poo shampoo and conditioner and it works great!</li>
            <li>BEST DETANGLER EVER!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Love this!!!</li>
            <li>so I love the versatility!!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful spiral curls.</li>
            <li>Works great for curly hair.</li>
            <li>It did not do a great job of detangling my hair.</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>This item is great for detangling my hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but the best detangling product I have ever used is</li>
            <li>Works about as good as Johnson and Johnson, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>good detangler..</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and product was great!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this detangling spray!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>The kid&#x27;s detangler by Suave works better than this!  </li>
            <li>But the seller I bought mine through, Beautylicious was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best product for super curly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s A 10 and seems to detangle better.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fine, nothing offensive or overly strong.</li>
            <li>I use the light gel.</li>
            <li>One thing I will say that&#x27;s great about this product is that it keeps the hair on the top of my head from looking oily a few days after a wash.</li>
            <li>I will stick to my tried and true method of detangling in the shower with conditioner in my hair.</li>
            <li>She originally sent me the spray gel, but I contacted her and told her it wasn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>These products are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>We did not have to struggle with the brush AT ALL, in fact the brush slid right through our hair.</li>
            <li>So far I have liked the Deva prodcut line, I use the No Poo, but this seems like it has a ton of alcohol in it and has almost a sticky feeling after you spray in your hair, definitely does not make it easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>After it dries I have to use my fingers and lightly pull apart the curls, that&#x27;s how nice and tight they form.</li>
            <li>The key is to make sure the spray is hitting your hair, not just misting the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li>I love Deva  products, but the Deva One condition keeps my hair from tangling, so this was really not necessary for me.  </li>
            <li>All Deva products are good, but this really helps tame down the frizz and makes my daughters hair more manageable for both of us!</li>
            <li>Product very thin/watery.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to style.  </li>
            <li>(my daughter&#x27;s hair is completely straight and a bit thinner than mine).</li>
            <li>I got this spray to see if I could use it as a rewetter, but because it is more like water, there wasn&#x27;t much hold and styling for the wet curls.</li>
            <li>Spray it into your wet hair and EASILY comb through with fingers.  </li>
            <li>I find that if I have let my hair go to many days before washing or used hair spray on it - it is a matted mess.  </li>
            <li>Concentrate more in heavily tangled areas.</li>
            <li>, she didn&#x27;t realize it was a new product b/c</li>
            <li>her wholesaler told her it was the same thing, but she was amazing, she tracked down the actual detangler and sent it to me for no additional cost.</li>
            <li>Brush through then take your hand and smooth hair down t close the cuticle!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I tried it this morning on dry very curly hair...</li>

            <li> purchased this item yesterday from a retailer and used it on my hair dry then on it after washing.  </li>
            <li> I wait until I towel dry my hair, then spray in the Miracle Leave-In Product.</li>
            <li> Just sort of an overpriced average detangler, and as far as no-comb, that&#x27;s NOT true.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice on wet hair now, once on dry.  </li>
            <li> Can use on wet or dry hair</li>

            <li> Oh it did seem to add a little sheen and a wee bit moisture.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I leave my hair soaked dripping on the towel around my body for a few moments, then I scrunch it over the sink to get out the excess water and form my curls.</li>
            <li> Just a few pumps in towel dried hair</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning our hair as usual in the shower we towel dried our hair and sprayed on Dive No-Comb Detangler......</li>
            <li> I am not one to usually write negative  reviews, but this was a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes spritz it on my dry hair and rub my fingers through to tame a few strands after sleeping to get rid of that crazy bed-head mess!</li>
            <li> Left hair dirty feeling.</li>

            <li> 8/4/13 Update:  Went from 2 stars to 1.  This stuff is not good.  Had to use a ton and then my hair was yucky feeling.  Next on my list is Kinky Curly....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item yesterday from a retailer and used it on my hair dry then on it after washing.  It required a comb, brush and patience.  For this money and the claims the comb should just fall through.  Also after running errands I came home to a rats nest again.  I will say not as BAD as without the product but nevertheless it is going back.  Back to the drawing board. Oh it did seem to add a little sheen and a wee bit moisture.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and product was great!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders for curly girls.  Spray it into your wet hair and EASILY comb through with fingers.  The key is to make sure the spray is hitting your hair, not just misting the bathroom floor.  Concentrate more in heavily tangled areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting some nasty snarls in my curly hair. It helps detangle them but I have to use a lot and it takes time to sort the snarls out still. The smell is fine, nothing offensive or overly strong.</li>
            <li> My curly hair gets tangled around the crown of my head and this spray helps, but doesn&#x27;t totally remove the tangles. I still have to carefully comb through the knots to totally get them out. One thing I will say that&#x27;s great about this product is that it keeps the hair on the top of my head from looking oily a few days after a wash.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help me with the insane matts I get in my long, thick, curly hair.  I have always stuck by Devachan products and use the shampoos, conditioner, mousse and deep conditioning treatment.  However, this didn&#x27;t work for me at all either on dry or wet hair.  No need for me to spend money on a detangler that doesn&#x27;t work... I&#x27;ve used it twice on wet hair now, once on dry.  I will stick to my tried and true method of detangling in the shower with conditioner in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Can use on wet or dry hair so I love the versatility!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I will definitely reorder this product in the future as needed and will recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best product for super curly hair. All Deva products are good, but this really helps tame down the frizz and makes my daughters hair more manageable for both of us!</li>
            <li> Works great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE the Deva line of products!!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for me.  I just recently started using a detangle spray.  I find that if I have let my hair go to many days before washing or used hair spray on it - it is a matted mess.  My hair is so dry it knots up really badly.</li>
            <li> Product very thin/watery.  Seemed like I had to use a lot and still did not detangle. Left hair dirty feeling. Returns are not accepted on used products. Return policy not listed anywhere I could find except contact seller.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> These products are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. It did not do a great job of detangling my hair. Also it left a film on my hair which weighed down my curls.</li>
            <li> This works well. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this line for our hairy family!</li>
            <li> Love this detangling spray! The trick is to use it when you just finish in the shower, still standing in the tub. Spray on soaking wet hair, use a WET BRUSH ( this thing is a miracle for thick curly hair) Brush through then take your hand and smooth hair down t close the cuticle! I leave my hair soaked dripping on the towel around my body for a few moments, then I scrunch it over the sink to get out the excess water and form my curls. My hair is the thickest hair ever and my curls come out like ringlets! Beautiful spiral curls. After I scrunch it I use the light gel. Then leave it alone.After it dries I have to use my fingers and lightly pull apart the curls, that&#x27;s how nice and tight they form. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love Deva  products, but the Deva One condition keeps my hair from tangling, so this was really not necessary for me.  If you have curly hair, you should NEVER brush or comb your hair anyway - only use your fingers for that!</li>
            <li> I am not one to usually write negative  reviews, but this was a waste of my money.  The kid&#x27;s detangler by Suave works better than this!  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this spray to see if I could use it as a rewetter, but because it is more like water, there wasn&#x27;t much hold and styling for the wet curls. I use it before I comb my hair but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference if I don&#x27;t use it before combing.</li>
            <li> I have problems with tangled hair.  This product works great.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the no-poo shampoo and conditioner and it works great! I sometimes spritz it on my dry hair and rub my fingers through to tame a few strands after sleeping to get rid of that crazy bed-head mess!</li>

            <li> I tried it this morning on dry very curly hair...good detangler..but I had to wet my hair afterwards because my hair stuck out</li>
            <li> I have permed hair... This item is great for detangling my hair. Just a few pumps in towel dried hair and I&#x27;m ready to style.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> So far I have liked the Deva prodcut line, I use the No Poo, but this seems like it has a ton of alcohol in it and has almost a sticky feeling after you spray in your hair, definitely does not make it easy to comb through. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> BEST DETANGLER EVER!!!!!  My teenage daughter &amp; I started using this detangler last year. We both have hair down to our waist so our hair gets tangled very easily, especially after washing. We do not color treat our hair but my hair is wavy and thick (my daughter&#x27;s hair is completely straight and a bit thinner than mine). After washing and conditioning our hair as usual in the shower we towel dried our hair and sprayed on Dive No-Comb Detangler......I was amazed! We did not have to struggle with the brush AT ALL, in fact the brush slid right through our hair. We have been using this product ever since.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at my salon.  Since I use the DevaCurl Low-Poo Shampoo and One Conditioner (and I like both) I thought I&#x27;d buy this product.  It&#x27;s okay, but the best detangling product I have ever used is It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Leave-In Product.  It takes less of the It&#x27;s A 10 and seems to detangle better.  My hair is thick and color-treated, so it&#x27;s prone to tangling when I wash it.  I used to put detangler in after I shampooed in the shower, then rinse it out, but with the It&#x27;s A 10 I wait until I towel dry my hair, then spray in the Miracle Leave-In Product.</li>
