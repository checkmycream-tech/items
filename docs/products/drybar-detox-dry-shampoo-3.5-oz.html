            <li>Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This is legitimately the best dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried-</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo for blondes.</li>
            <li>but I also use it after styling my hair for more texture and it&#x27;s good to take oil out of your hair if you accidentally put to much moisture or oil in your hair.</li>
            <li>An excellent dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>As well, and most important to me, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>Still great product that I use daily.  </li>
            <li>this is for the regular one that is great for blondes.</li>
            <li>Great product, i just wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li>It works well in my dark blond hair, smells great and comes in a cute bottle.  </li>
            <li>Great dry shampoo</li>
            <li>I have to say this is a great dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>Also Brunettes, make sure to really rub product in with fingers</li>
            <li>It is by far the best dry shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, feminine.  </li>
            <li>But this one makes my hair look fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>But overall after having tried many others this is my favorite for now.</li>
            <li>There is no white residue and it has a nice fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $20 at Sephora or online.</li>
            <li>I spray my roots as soon as I blow dry to absorb the oil as it comes and my hair will look freshly washed for three or four days!!!</li>
            <li>and I have been able to go an extra day between shampooing.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li>and I have used many different brands!  </li>
            <li>Gives your hair sooo much volume!</li>
            <li>love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo of all time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always been this way because my hair is a lot of work and it would also dry out too much if I washed it more.  </li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s just spray-on rice starch.</li>
            <li>Great product for those with thin or thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper at sephoras for $20.</li>
            <li>I like the residue because i have light blonde hair and when my darker roots come in it does brighten them up!</li>
            <li>I do have blonde hair and have heard this isn&#x27;t good for dark hair colors.</li>
            <li>with this one I have gone as many as 4 days (3 days with my hair down, put it up the 4th).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other brands before and nothing compares to this one!</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Might pay a little more</li>
            <li>I used to use Provina (but the packaging was terrible) and Alterna (only lasted 2 days), and I&#x27;m thrilled to say that Drybar&#x27;s is the best.</li>
            <li>Many dry shampoos left my hair oily or sticky...even more so than before I sprayed it which makes no sense because dry shampoo is supposed to have the opposite effect.  </li>
            <li>This stuff, for whatever reason, leaves my hair looking brand new.</li>
            <li>A little &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; at first, but the perfume they put in there dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used; it makes my hair feel less weighty and leaves the least residue.</li>
            <li>Not that I have room to complain as it&#x27;s my own fault for running late!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little expensive on this website, but it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>I am a complete convert-</li>
            <li>It goes on well and has complete coverage of my gray.  </li>
            <li>It is difficult to find a good one.</li>
            <li>Finally one that makes my greasy hair look normal on day two.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different dry shampoos and this one is my favorite yet.  </li>
            <li>I even use a small amount on freshly washed hair for texture and oil absorption.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and works quickly, not leaving a wet residue when you get close to your scalp.</li>

            <li> I use dry shampoo just to freshen and give it lift from being slept on.  </li>
            <li> But this dry shampoo leaves my hair feeling oil-free and dry.  </li>
            <li> I know this is a dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a dry shampoo that has allowed me to wear my hair down the next day after washing-</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t rub it in carefully I look like I have grey roots which is not a look I am going for.  </li>
            <li> My fav dry shampoo of all time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos but nothing comes close.</li>
            <li> I wish people would look carefully at which product they&#x27;re leaving a review for (I&#x27;m lookin&#x27; at you, &amp;#34;yogi.&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star.</li>
            <li> I use my hands to fluff it through</li>
            <li> but it works, you just have to spray alot and for the cost its not really smart buy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so be careful.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, too.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think it would work well on someone with dark hair.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone with dark hair.</li>
            <li> This was hands down a winner.  </li>
            <li> but it does leave a slight residue.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and long and my scalp not even a little oily, so I wash my hair every 9 days or so.  </li>
            <li> Just a little too perfumey</li>
            <li> As thin hair absorbs less oil, those of us with thinning hair have issues with oil, even the same day you shampoo.</li>
            <li> The dye helps thin hair to look thicker and helps to avoid the white residue, but it gets on your pillowcase.  </li>
            <li> Four stars because it does help if I&#x27;m getting out of bed a little too late to shower, but I wish it would stay looking that way throughout the workday rather than wearing out a bit too soon.  </li>
            <li> but when I went into a makeup store and tried two other brands of root concealers the lady suggested this one after the other ones were too expensive or too goopy.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair and have to shampoo every morning and still oily by evening!!!!</li>
            <li> People who know the Drybar scent, know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder legnth thin blond hair.</li>
            <li> In addition to being completely ineffective, this is the worst smelling hairspray I&#x27;ve ever encountered.</li>
            <li> But beyond 4-6 hours, it leaves a weird visible texture and nothing but a shower will solve it.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too bad for me, but I can imagine it might be an unappealing after effect for a brunette.</li>
            <li> Other brands would leave residue and make my hair look even worst.</li>
            <li> It is steep for what it is and that&#x27;s too bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at this price though-</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> YES! I love this dry shampoo! Finally one that makes my greasy hair look normal on day two. And it smells great! I will forever buy this product.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend who works at Sephora. This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used; it makes my hair feel less weighty and leaves the least residue. Any dry shampoo is going to leave a bit of residue; it just needs to be worked into the hair a bit. I&#x27;m not offended by the smell, which does dissipate. Really, it&#x27;s just spray-on rice starch. This one&#x27;s just a really good spray-on rice starch!</li>
            <li> Great product for those with thin or thinning hair.  I have had the best results by shaking well, spay about 5 inches from scalp, separating hair into 1 inch sections, then hitting it w/some heat using a blow-drier.  The heat activates oil absorption and boost body.  The only drawback is that it builds up in your hair.  I use the product for brunettes, which has brown dye in it.  The dye helps thin hair to look thicker and helps to avoid the white residue, but it gets on your pillowcase.  Thankfully it has always washed out, but it looks a bit gross if you do not change your pillowcase often.  Still great product that I use daily.  As thin hair absorbs less oil, those of us with thinning hair have issues with oil, even the same day you shampoo. It also leaves a residue on surfaces in the bathroom that you will notice when cleaning. I even use a small amount on freshly washed hair for texture and oil absorption.</li>
            <li> I wish people would look carefully at which product they&#x27;re leaving a review for (I&#x27;m lookin&#x27; at you, &amp;#34;yogi.&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this dry shampoo.  I tell everyone I know that it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used numerous throughout the years.  My hair is thick and long and my scalp not even a little oily, so I wash my hair every 9 days or so.  Before you go thinking it&#x27;s gross, I assure you, it is not.  It&#x27;s always been this way because my hair is a lot of work and it would also dry out too much if I washed it more.  I use dry shampoo just to freshen and give it lift from being slept on.  This dry shampoo smells fantastic.  People who know the Drybar scent, know what I mean.  Clean, fresh, feminine.  As well, and most important to me, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  Nothing.  I would have to wash my hair more if it did because, sometimes, I use it 2-3 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of cost has been mentioned.  It is steep for what it is and that&#x27;s too bad.  I would buy more and give it as gifts.  Minus 1 star.</li>
            <li> The immediate effect of applying this is the appearance of grease-free hair.  YES!  But beyond 4-6 hours, it leaves a weird visible texture and nothing but a shower will solve it.  Four stars because it does help if I&#x27;m getting out of bed a little too late to shower, but I wish it would stay looking that way throughout the workday rather than wearing out a bit too soon.  Not that I have room to complain as it&#x27;s my own fault for running late!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I can go 4 days without washing my hair! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so be careful. It smells fresh and works quickly, not leaving a wet residue when you get close to your scalp. One of the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Just a little too perfumey but it works, you just have to spray alot and for the cost its not really smart buy. But it was nice to try. I wouldnt pay for it but if I had another gift card I would get it. Also Brunettes, make sure to really rub product in with fingers otherwise you look like you have spraypaint on.</li>
            <li> I will always have this is stock at home. Great dry shampoo but I also use it after styling my hair for more texture and it&#x27;s good to take oil out of your hair if you accidentally put to much moisture or oil in your hair.The scent is very clean too. This stuff is addictive, buy at your own risk!! I do have blonde hair and have heard this isn&#x27;t good for dark hair colors.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.  Love the smell and I have been able to go an extra day between shampooing.  I will most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo of all time and I have used many different brands!  It is difficult to find a good one. Many dry shampoos left my hair oily or sticky...even more so than before I sprayed it which makes no sense because dry shampoo is supposed to have the opposite effect.  But this dry shampoo leaves my hair feeling oil-free and dry.  Caution, it does leave my hair with a white dust look for a bit of time.  I&#x27;m blonde so it&#x27;s not too bad for me, but I can imagine it might be an unappealing after effect for a brunette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different dry shampoos and this one is my favorite yet.  It works well in my dark blond hair, smells great and comes in a cute bottle.  The powder comes out very light so I don&#x27;t think it would work well on someone with dark hair.  If I don&#x27;t rub it in carefully I look like I have grey roots which is not a look I am going for.  But overall after having tried many others this is my favorite for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands...some more expensive, some less.  This is the best so far....shake well and spray at the roots and massage into the scalp.  Instantly makes a 3 day post-shower hair into something you wouldn&#x27;t be embarrassed to be outside with!  A little goes a long way, too.  A little &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; at first, but the perfume they put in there dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Gives volume and takes care of excess oil. Smells amazing too. Definitely recommend it. I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos but nothing comes close. Might pay a little more but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> In addition to being completely ineffective, this is the worst smelling hairspray I&#x27;ve ever encountered. As an added bonus, the residual smell stays in your lungs for a long while after application.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, works well.</li>
            <li> This is legitimately the best dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried- and I have tried so many. This stuff, for whatever reason, leaves my hair looking brand new. It gives your hair texture too. I have shoulder legnth thin blond hair. I&#x27;ve never had a dry shampoo that has allowed me to wear my hair down the next day after washing- with this one I have gone as many as 4 days (3 days with my hair down, put it up the 4th). I am a complete convert- I used to use Provina (but the packaging was terrible) and Alterna (only lasted 2 days), and I&#x27;m thrilled to say that Drybar&#x27;s is the best. The one thing I&#x27;d say is that I don&#x27;t love th scent- but some people do, so I think it&#x27;s personal taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shake before using, spray about 6 inches from your hair. I use my hands to fluff it through and/or I brush it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note- this is for the regular one that is great for blondes. They also make one for brown hair!</li>
            <li> I have to say this is a great dry shampoo! I&#x27;ve used many other brands before and nothing compares to this one! Other brands would leave residue and make my hair look even worst. But this one makes my hair look fresh and clean. I know this is gross but I am on day 4 and my hair does not look greasy/dirty at all and it smells amazing!!! Much cheaper at sephoras for $20. Well&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price!</li>
            <li> My fav dry shampoo of all time! It&#x27;s a little expensive on this website, but it&#x27;s a great product! Gives your hair sooo much volume!</li>
            <li> Great product, i just wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo for blondes. It smells great and makes your hair look even lighter when giving volume!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Drybar Detox.  It is by far the best dry shampoo I have ever used.  I have extremely oily hair and have to shampoo every morning and still oily by evening!!!! I spray my roots as soon as I blow dry to absorb the oil as it comes and my hair will look freshly washed for three or four days!!! It&#x27;s a miracle.  There is no white residue and it has a nice fresh smell. Well worth the $20 at Sephora or online. I am completely addicted!!!!</li>
            <li> An excellent dry shampoo! I&#x27;m shocked at this price though- Thedrybar.com and Sephora both sell this for $20... Why the %100 mark up?!</li>
            <li> I know this is a dry shampoo but when I went into a makeup store and tried two other brands of root concealers the lady suggested this one after the other ones were too expensive or too goopy.  This was hands down a winner.  It goes on well and has complete coverage of my gray.  Thanks for an excellent product!  And I&#x27;m a housewife, not a paid spokesperson.</li>
            <li> I like this dry shampoo a lot but it does leave a slight residue. I like the residue because i have light blonde hair and when my darker roots come in it does brighten them up! Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for anyone with dark hair.</li>
