            <li>Great product but Aveda&#x27;s Volumizing Tonic has not been in a glass bottle for quite some time now.</li>
            <li>Great product, and</li>
            <li>I also use Aveda Confixor with it, so, both leave my hair with a very nice shine and with volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used this for years successfully.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, though.</li>

            <li>Great product for fine hair.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I haven&#x27;t experimented many times with this product yet.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product as it gives body but is very light.</li>
            <li>Good for fine hair to add volume.</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve found so far is &amp;#34;got 2b spiked up.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>Used sparingly this gives hair more body and volume.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle had more volume though.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work well with making my hair appear fuller, but it smells great!</li>
            <li>Aveda better always make this product.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that my hair stays feeling thicker even in the most humid of conditions.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on the volume I get.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found a better product</li>
            <li>It also has a mild pleasant scent, not perfume like at all (I am very sensitive to smells and this one is really nice).</li>
            <li>This product gives volume to my fine hair without weight or the feeling that there is anything in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Reviews must be accurate :</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great.</li>
            <li>There are better, more effective products out there, for a whole lot less money.  </li>
            <li>That alone is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The formula leaves hair looking very glossy &amp; clean yet provides volume.</li>
            <li>This curl will actually hold without dragging hair down, it&#x27;s an excellent product.</li>
            <li>just enough volume, leaves hair soft  Good stuff</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and most products weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine long hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past three months, and coming to the end of my first bottle, I think i&#x27;ll reorder, which, considering the price, is a good recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found lots of things that add body, but this is the only one which does so without spoiling the fresh and clean look of hair.</li>
            <li>but I am always looking because there are so many new products constantly coming out.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything and this is the only thing that helps my fine hair from just hanging</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend giving it a try, if you want a light natural and healthy way to add a little volume and control to your hair.</li>
            <li>Great product for thin hair.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like spending too much money on hair products, but this has proven to be reliable and lasts awhile.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair grow so much</li>
            <li>delivery time is quite fast too.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser introduced me to this line of products, and it makes a world of difference for my otherwise straight, lifeless hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it!!!</li>
            <li>What I can say so far is I can&#x27;t see much difference in volume and it makes my very fine hair extremely fly-away.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of different hair volumizers, with varying degrees of success.  </li>
            <li>I live in the tropics, in South Florida, so, my hair frizzes up, and with this product, it is far more manageable, and much less frizzy.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and does not make your hair feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li>like the mild, organic leafy fragrance, and the manageability it adds to my wet hair, which tangles after shampoo, even with conditioning.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li>, that has a natural curl.</li>
            <li>Without product, my hair is baby fine, and hard to style.</li>
            <li>Aveda has other styling products that are also good for volumizing thin hair.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but for me, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well it worked, you spritz it on before curling and it provides for a LASTING curl.</li>
            <li>I will stick to tried and true Bumble and Bumble Thickening Hairspray, that one is worth every penny, is expensive</li>
            <li>This product adds volume to fine limp hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I have fine and thin hair.  </li>
            <li>It did nothing for my hair on good days and bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Not at all up to the reputation it has. It did nothing for my hair on good days and bad</li>
            <li> Used sparingly this gives hair more body and volume. With long hair it helps to spray toward the roots.</li>
            <li> Great product for fine hair.</li>

            <li> This stuff works great for volumizing your routes. I wish the bottle had more volume though. Other than that, it works great.</li>
            <li> I go to an Aveda salon and was exposed to this tonic there.  Just a few pumps and I noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> This product is an alternative for hair spray.  Makes hair manageable without sticky hair spray!! Also seem to have made my color last longer.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product!  I have very fine hair and this helps with styling.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I haven&#x27;t experimented many times with this product yet. What I can say so far is I can&#x27;t see much difference in volume and it makes my very fine hair extremely fly-away.</li>
            <li> This product works to add volume to thin hair.  I was surprised by the results.  Now I stock up.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have fine and thin hair.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find products that can help with volume.  This did absolutely nothing.  You could fill the bottle with water and have the same effect.  The best I&#x27;ve found so far is &amp;#34;got 2b spiked up.  But I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and most products weigh it down.  I am very satisfied with this product as it gives body but is very light.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...gives your hair body without a lot of product. Easy to apply and does not make your hair feel heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveda Volumizing Tonic for years.  I usually stay away from any styling products because they make my hair look coarse and unattractive.  Not this.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product! Not only does it work well with making my hair appear fuller, but it smells great!</li>
            <li> Great product but Aveda&#x27;s Volumizing Tonic has not been in a glass bottle for quite some time now. Aveda does not support the purchase unless made in a salon or experience center.</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s drying my hair our more! Reviews must be accurate :(&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend at all. Buy something else</li>
            <li> I water mine down about 1/2 so it last longer.  It give my hair that extra umph when I need it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hair at all. No volumizing, no lift. I will stick to tried and true Bumble and Bumble Thickening Hairspray, that one is worth every penny, is expensive but I spray very little and it does the job every time, so 1 bottle lasts me about 2 years (shoulder length hair)</li>
            <li> Aveda better always make this product. I mean forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past three months, and coming to the end of my first bottle, I think i&#x27;ll reorder, which, considering the price, is a good recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the mild, organic leafy fragrance, and the manageability it adds to my wet hair, which tangles after shampoo, even with conditioning. It adds volume, without weighing my hair down, or having it dry crunchy. I also use Aveda Confixor with it, so, both leave my hair with a very nice shine and with volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and what works for my hair, may not for someone else. I have very fine long hair, that has a natural curl. Without product, my hair is baby fine, and hard to style. I live in the tropics, in South Florida, so, my hair frizzes up, and with this product, it is far more manageable, and much less frizzy. That alone is worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend giving it a try, if you want a light natural and healthy way to add a little volume and control to your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending too much money on hair products, but this has proven to be reliable and lasts awhile. Third purchase of this in last 5 years. Lifts hair at root and does give noticeable volume.</li>
            <li> This product adds volume to fine limp hair without weighing it down. It has a slight moisturizing effect without being greasy. It also has a mild pleasant scent, not perfume like at all (I am very sensitive to smells and this one is really nice). If you are looking to boost your hair volume and texture I recommend giving this a try. It is a little pricey but for me, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair grow so much but it did make my hair look volumized.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery time is quite fast too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for hair!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that my hair stays feeling thicker even in the most humid of conditions.</li>
            <li> Used this for years successfully. The formula leaves hair looking very glossy &amp; clean yet provides volume. Other products seem to build up or make hair dull and fuzzy looking.

            <li> My hair dresser introduced me to this line of products, and it makes a world of difference for my otherwise straight, lifeless hair.  I get many compliments on the volume I get. I use it with the phomollient styling foam</li>
            <li> Use it daily - I have tried everything and this is the only thing that helps my fine hair from just hanging</li>
            <li> Smells ahhhhhhmazing......just enough volume, leaves hair soft  Good stuff</li>
            <li> This was a bit of a disappointment, as it really didn&#x27;t do anything noticeable to the volume of my hair.  And it&#x27;s way too expensive.  There are better, more effective products out there, for a whole lot less money.  Not a good buy.  Won&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different hair volumizers, with varying degrees of success.  This one tops them all.  I will be reordering this.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great! A few sprays and it gives my hair extra volume and body.</li>
            <li> Aveda makes quality products. I used this product, however, it comes in a small container and doesn&#x27;t last that long.  Aveda has other styling products that are also good for volumizing thin hair.</li>
            <li> This product gives volume to my fine hair without weight or the feeling that there is anything in my hair.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good for fine hair to add volume. Haven&#x27;t found a better product but I am always looking because there are so many new products constantly coming out. This is a good product, though.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it worked, you spritz it on before curling and it provides for a LASTING curl. This curl will actually hold without dragging hair down, it&#x27;s an excellent product. I&#x27;ve been a fan for years, as soon as i start running low, i reorder because this has become a staple in my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Great product, and it smell great too!</li>
