            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really say that it smells like lavender, which could be a good thing for those that don&#x27;t like that scent.</li>
            <li>I was worried that it would not contain much Shea butter, but it seems to be good.</li>
            <li>Addictive:  because nothing else works as good as this lotion!</li>
            <li>It also absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong for those with allergies to scents.</li>

            <li>So hydrating and healing; kills minor bacterial infections; removes aches and pain; is calming, and it smells good - all in one jar!   </li>

            <li>This is a new and lovely fragrance!</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and thick, but it absorbs very fast and the  fragrance is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I did not like this as well as the Original Tree Hut Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>that the Original Shea Butter from Tree Hut.  </li>

            <li>Item as described, perfectly packaged, and recieved in earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer a more natural fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well and soaks right in.</li>
            <li>I have been in beauty care for 39 years and look for products with the right ingredients.</li>
            <li>does feel greasy at first but soaks right in and feels &amp;</li>
            <li>My two year old loves it on her feet as well :) High recommend.</li>
            <li>So much relief without spending a fortune!  </li>
            <li>My first whiff upon opening the jar almost knocked me out.</li>
            <li>The gift is always accepted, butter very rich with proper scent.</li>
            <li>I feel misled by both the packaging and all the positive reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I wished that it came in larger/more economical containers, other than that, love it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li>This body butter is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from straight sunflower and jojoba oils to Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corps and Korres&#x27; Body Butter.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>but I guess I use too much because my mother says I smell like it even hours after I use it.</li>
            <li>and it really nourishes your skin and nails.  </li>
            <li>but I like the other one better.</li>
            <li>Then take a bath in it, and feel so much better - will toss all other lotions because they don&#x27;t work like this one.</li>
            <li>I love the lite smell of lavender and it real keep my skin soft and moist during this dry winter.</li>
            <li>This stuff works way better and lasts longer than those more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I use daily and the lovely texture is dubbed White Gold!  </li>
            <li>Decent stuff for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I live in a low humidity area and this was less effective</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as a belly butter during pregnancy, and I&#x27;m 37 weeks with no stretch marks thus far!</li>
            <li>Would &#x27;love&#x27; a bigger container to cut down on cost.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and texture of this body butter very much and would recommend it to anyone long body butter and lavender</li>

            <li>/&gt;It keeps your skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li>So far this product is what it says it is.  </li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>Though it does make my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>it also moisturizes very well and has improved the condition of my skin and my son&#x27;s who has really dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing; my skin hasn&#x27;t felt dry and itchy this winter.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, thick and smooth, smell is ok but not great.  </li>
            <li>I only use it at night because the smell would be too overwhelming during the day and not a pleasant feeling on your skin in the heat.</li>
            <li>There is no SLIDING into bed, you take the whole sheet down with you as you climb in, you are that sticky.  </li>
            <li>I live in Colorado in a dry climate and suffer from chronic dry skin.</li>

            <li> and I was in terrific need of something to combat some dry skin.</li>
            <li> but the next day or say after 8 hours, its same rough .&lt;br</li>
            <li> went a long way.  </li>
            <li> The texture is a bit strange, sort of lumpy.</li>
            <li> My husband found it helps his dry skin and my sister also loves it after I recommended it to her.  </li>
            <li> This one is not worth trying, especially those of you with sensitivities.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but this is an epic failure it smells musky like a man.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have used other body scrubs that works wonder for my skin..</li>
            <li> However, the smell seems a bit off to me and because of that I don&#x27;t use it as much as my other products.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with extremely dry skin on my face for a few years now.</li>
            <li> The price is a lot less with amazon than stores.</li>
            <li> When i got this i opened it and put some on just to see how it felt and trust me a little</li>
            <li> The texture is also a little weird.&lt;br</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with these natural ingredients !</li>
            <li> The texture is a little on the greasy side and starts to feel a little heavy after a bit.</li>
            <li> Nothing feminine cozy about it.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money in this one.</li>
            <li> After only a couple of weeks my face has stopped flaking and is not red and painful.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful and while I usually love thick butters because they&#x27;re so moisturizing, this one is too heavy</li>
            <li> I usually buy this body butter from City Market, but ordered from Amazon to try this scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably why it was so hard for me to find it.</li>
            <li> I was not thrilled with the scent</li>
            <li> I do a job where a greasiness would have negative effects</li>
            <li> We live in cold country and thumb tips will split (painful) from dry weather.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is very thick and fragrant!</li>
            <li> I have tried every expensive moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li> Just so expensive, don&#x27;t understand why.</li>
            <li> I found it unpleasant.</li>
            <li> :( ..</li>

            <li> i bought this to keep a check on my ingrowing hair stubs.. and phase out roughness of skin..&lt;br /&gt;after application skin remains smooth for the day.. but the next day or say after 8 hours, its same rough .&lt;br /&gt;i have used other body scrubs that works wonder for my skin..&lt;br /&gt;this didnt..:( ..</li>
            <li> The scent of this body butter is nice and light but the consistency is a bit lumpy.  It moisturizes well and soaks right in.</li>
            <li> I hate this scent. I LOVE TREE HUT but this is an epic failure it smells musky like a man. Nothing feminine cozy about it. I promise there is no way anyone would like this scent. It&#x27;s probably why it was so hard for me to find it. I wasted my money in this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very thick and fragrant! I only use it at night because the smell would be too overwhelming during the day and not a pleasant feeling on your skin in the heat. Works well at moisturizing at night though.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful, absolutely delicious. it also moisturizes very well and has improved the condition of my skin and my son&#x27;s who has really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and great packaging.  The price was very good so I bought it to replace the Neutrogena one, but it is not the same.  For the price it is great but if you can afford it buy the Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> When i got this i opened it and put some on just to see how it felt and trust me a little went a long way.  The smell was not over powering and it had my skin looking marvelous, I will be getting some more of this.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom for a gift. She loves it. Large jar and smells really nice. Not too strong for those with allergies to scents.</li>
            <li> The Tree Hut body butter is very nice and silky; it goes on nice and smooth and has a great scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful and while I usually love thick butters because they&#x27;re so moisturizing, this one is too heavy and it feels sticky. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Advertised as organic olive oil but that is negated by the addition of toxic ingredients like Cyclopentasiloxane and Cyclohexasiloxane.  What a shame.</li>
            <li> I love  this product; it feels great on my skin and the fragrance is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps your skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li> For the price this can&#x27;t be be beat.  The smell is heaven and it is a nice rich cream, I really enjoy using it and price is great!</li>
            <li> So far this product is what it says it is.  My gf has used many products and stands by the Tree Hut brands.  Will use again!</li>
            <li> it leaves a greasy feeling on your skin, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful.  Has a light scent, not too overbearing.  It felt wonderful on the skin.  I didn&#x27;t find it to be overly greasy.  I plan on purchasing this Olive and Shea Body Butter again.  That&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if something was different with my jar, but I just never clicked with the smell. I found it unpleasant. Could just be my body chemistry. I did like the texture and moisturizing ability of the lotion...worked great on my dry skin, but I could&#x27;ve smelled better.</li>
            <li> I did not like this as well as the Original Tree Hut Shea Butter.  I assumed I would feel much more moisture with the olive oil added, but I did not.  I live in a low humidity area and this was less effective that the Original Shea Butter from Tree Hut.  It is a good product but I like the other one better.</li>
            <li> I love the way Tree Hut body butter makes my skin feel...the day AFTER I put it on.  The day OF..everything sticks to me...my clothes, my sheets.  There is no SLIDING into bed, you take the whole sheet down with you as you climb in, you are that sticky.  But that day after...WOW...your skin is like that proverbial baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> This body butter is very moisturizing. However, though it is called &amp;#34;Olive and Shea body butter,&amp;#34; it has almost no olive in it. Olive is the 15th or so ingredient on the label, the fragrance is even before it. The texture is also a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;So if you are just getting something to be moisturizing, this is a fine option. But if you are getting something specifically with olive oil in it to take advantage of the anti-oxidant, anti-aging properties of olive oil, this is not the product you want.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and this new product- I love lavendar and it is about time that Tree Hut made this product</li>
            <li> Item as described, perfectly packaged, and recieved in earlier than expected.  Will buy again. I don&#x27;t have anything else to say.</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado in a dry climate and suffer from chronic dry skin. I&#x27;ve tried everything from straight sunflower and jojoba oils to Kiehl&#x27;s Creme de Corps and Korres&#x27; Body Butter. This stuff works way better and lasts longer than those more expensive brands. I usually buy this body butter from City Market, but ordered from Amazon to try this scent. I wished that it came in larger/more economical containers, other than that, love it. Haven&#x27;t found anything else that works nearly as good.</li>
            <li> Addictive:  because nothing else works as good as this lotion! My skin drinks it in - where ever applied - works on the toughest/driest parts of the body.  So hydrating and healing; kills minor bacterial infections; removes aches and pain; is calming, and it smells good - all in one jar!   I use daily and the lovely texture is dubbed White Gold!  Would &#x27;love&#x27; a bigger container to cut down on cost. Then take a bath in it, and feel so much better - will toss all other lotions because they don&#x27;t work like this one.</li>
            <li> The texture is a bit strange, sort of lumpy. Though it does make my skin feel soft. However, the smell seems a bit off to me and because of that I don&#x27;t use it as much as my other products. It&#x27;s not what I expected. I have a couple of different chamomile and lavender products that smell amazing and compared to the others that I have... This one doesn&#x27;t smell even close to the others. The packaging was great, it was delivered on time... But I won&#x27;t order this one again.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with extremely dry skin on my face for a few years now. I have tried every expensive moisturizer on the market. I bought a Tree Hut product at a yard sale and liked it so much I looked them up. When I saw this product I had to try it (along with the shower wash). Both products are great. After only a couple of weeks my face has stopped flaking and is not red and painful. So much relief without spending a fortune!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li> I have been in beauty care for 39 years and look for products with the right ingredients. This cream has Shea butter to soften the skin and lavender, it smells great and I use it on men &amp; women. The price is a lot less with amazon than stores. Try it you won&#x27;t  ever use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Gail E.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic ! all perfect in quality and time for delivery. The gift is always accepted, butter very rich with proper scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely  and the effect was just what I wanted  I told a lot of friends about it</li>
            <li> My wife loved it, and the smell, absolutely fantastice. We purchased before and wil continue buying in the future. These work great for gifts too.</li>
            <li> Love this body butter. Very hydrating.  Scent not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I feel misled by both the packaging and all the positive reviews on Amazon. My first whiff upon opening the jar almost knocked me out. I&#x27;ve smelled better things from the drugstore perfume aisle. The ingredient list would rival a drugstore cosmetics aisle, too:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Glycerin, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Glyceryl Stearate, Cetearyl Alcohol, Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower) Seed Oil, PEG-100 Stearate, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, PEG-8 Beeswax, Lanolin Alcohol, Polysorbate 80, Laureth-4, Fragrance, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower Extract, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Xanthan Gum, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Methylisothiazolinone, Phenylethanol, PPG-2-Methyl Ether, Disodium Edta, BHT, Caramel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The Natural Brand of Beautiful Skin?&amp;#34; Pffft. This one is not worth trying, especially those of you with sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or sticky. Best body butter I have ever had.Even bought some for presents.Love how it keeps you moisterized.</li>
            <li> I love it but I guess I use too much because my mother says I smell like it even hours after I use it. She thinks it smells like aftershave. I&#x27;m going to try a couple difference scents next time.</li>
            <li> This is a great body butter. The texture is nice and thick, but it absorbs very fast and the  fragrance is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> this body butter is so soothing and it really nourishes your skin and nails.  This is a new and lovely fragrance!</li>
            <li> Thick body butter, wonderful product. I had tried the almond and shea scent previously, knew it was a good product, but absolutely LOVE this scent! I&#x27;ve been using this as a belly butter during pregnancy, and I&#x27;m 37 weeks with no stretch marks thus far! Also great for super dry skin like on legs this winter after shaving, no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I love the lite smell of lavender and it real keep my skin soft and moist during this dry winter.</li>
            <li> Great &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34;, it smells good and really does a good job. I gave it to friends for Christmas and they really loved it too!!!.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because I love the scent of Lavender and I was in terrific need of something to combat some dry skin. It arrived quickly and was just as advertised. I was not thrilled with the scent but that was only because I wanted a deeper lavender presense. I gave it to my daughter and she is thrilled with the scent and the skin softening ability of this product.</li>
            <li> Stuff is great. Just so expensive, don&#x27;t understand why.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and texture of this body butter very much and would recommend it to anyone long body butter and lavender</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my go to lotion, I really only use it in a pinch. The texture is a little on the greasy side and starts to feel a little heavy after a bit. Although I find the scent too perfumey my daughter likes it. It doesn&#x27;t smell horrible but I prefer a more natural fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, including to coconut and some other natural ingredients, so have been shopping for olive oil based organics. This stuff is great! My two year old loves it on her feet as well :) High recommend.</li>
            <li> the smell is not over powering but it is very nice smell.  does feel greasy at first but soaks right in and feels &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> Actually I bought this scented version for a gift.  I bought the unscented for myself.  It is the best lotion product I have bought in 50 years.  It is GREAT.  We live in cold country and thumb tips will split (painful) from dry weather.  With diligent use of this on fingertips, the tiny splits heal or are staved off before the hurting begins.  It also absorbs very quickly.  I do a job where a greasiness would have negative effects and if I rub it in good, it leaves no greasy residue on my work.  I will be a devoted user of Tree Hut Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, in fact it&#x27;s time for me to order more.  My husband found it helps his dry skin and my sister also loves it after I recommended it to her.  I also find it helpful for healing scrapes and scratches on legs and arms.  How can you go wrong with these natural ingredients !</li>
            <li> I bought this and gave as a gift at Christmas.  Arrived on time, thick and smooth, smell is ok but not great.  My friend who received it loved it she will keep it by her bedside.</li>
            <li> Decent stuff for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for about six months and still love it. The smell is nice, but not overpowering, which is a problem I have with most lotions. I wouldn&#x27;t really say that it smells like lavender, which could be a good thing for those that don&#x27;t like that scent. It is very moisturizing; my skin hasn&#x27;t felt dry and itchy this winter. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I really like Tree Hut Body Scrub as it is very easy to be absorbed by your skin and make your skin smooth..</li>
            <li> It is like a special treat for my skin...very soothing and reviving.  The scent is refreshing and calming. It is great!</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for a friend and they loved it.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Tree Hut Body Butters.  This one is one of my favorites because of the scent.  The lavender is very relaxing and is great to use after the Lavender and Chamomile Body Wash.</li>
            <li> Oh boy!! Pretty fragrance, not overwhelming feels great!</li>
            <li> I loved this combination of Olive, Lavender and Chamomile Shea butter.  I was worried that it would not contain much Shea butter, but it seems to be good.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just a lavender and chamomile person. This is a great cream to use at bedtime to ward off that non-sleepy feeling. Just the right thing for me and besides, husband loves the scent too! Be sure to try it.</li>
