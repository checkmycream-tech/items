            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Good Luck to you!</li>
            <li>but it works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for My Skin and My Dog&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>Smells great too.</li>
            <li>and they are great for skin irritations, after shower moisturizer, cracked hands, and for helping the sunburn on my hands.</li>
            <li>and I know they have been verified as a \\&quot;good</li>
            <li>Quick service and great product as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I hope others have better luck than I did..</li>
            <li>so I thought the ozonated oil should be even better.</li>
            <li>I order mostly olive oil</li>
            <li>Seems okay.  </li>
            <li>I have used most of the oils in this line-</li>
            <li>Truly a pro company with a solid reputation and excellent product- say no to copy cats!</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for dry feet and hands.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this product, it is light weight and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize when I first started to use that it was a wonderful anti-aging creme, my skin looks smooth and is very soft.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS FINE KEEPS SKEEN CLEAN AND SAFE FROM ANY DESEASE</li>
            <li>Has help tremendously!</li>
            <li>I think coconut retains a lot of its original smell when ozonated.</li>
            <li>Somehow the ozone in the coconut oil really does make it work better.</li>
            <li>I have used the olive oil more than the coconut oil so far</li>
            <li>first-</li>
            <li>I returned the whole order.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Absolutely a must try- start with the avocado or the jojoba</li>
            <li>Really helped with bug bites</li>
            <li>Be careful if you open it when it is warm and liquid</li>
            <li>smaller than I expected, but a nice product</li>
            <li>It really help clear up a skin rash</li>
            <li>have rashes and sensitive skin, so I thought this would be mild enough to help.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very strong smell for hours hard to use because of it</li>
            <li>and at first I thought this could be a factor, but after discontinuing everything and starting new allergy patch testing, this tested fine and other allergies were discovered.  </li>
            <li>this oil was advertised to make the skin soft.</li>
            <li>it comes to health products they should be save and clearly marked.</li>
            <li>Very very disappointing, I had great results with pure coconutoil</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and not red anymore.  </li>
            <li>Oh, I also think the ozonated oil is the only thing that treats poison ivy -- by my 4yr old daughter&#x27;s summer experience.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to help my dry skin condition.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> IT WORKS FINE KEEPS SKEEN CLEAN AND SAFE FROM ANY DESEASE</li>
            <li> I have used the olive oil more than the coconut oil so far but it works great. My skin feels softer!</li>
            <li> Quick service and great product as advertised.  I just began using it to evaluate the efficacy.  So far it seems to help my dry skin condition.</li>
            <li> Using Ozonated Coconut made my skin flake. You&#x27;d think it being an oil it would make your skin mositurized, but for some reason it did the opposite.  I&#x27;m using it in the little hair that I have left, I understand it may help to promote hair growth?  As for being unscented, it smells for some reason, I think I would of prefered the scented. I hope others have better luck than I did..Good Luck to you!</li>
            <li> results are not really as reported in advertisements</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Somehow the ozone in the coconut oil really does make it work better.</li>
            <li> this oil was advertised to make the skin soft. Well in my case, I got a rash where I applied it. It lasted two days.  I was really afraid to give it another try. Very very disappointing, I had great results with pure coconutoil so I thought the ozonated oil should be even better. In the package the seller had added a little white gel pouch with no description . This is dangerous, because I  thought it would be a trial version of the oil. As I did not know what it was, I did not open it . I returned the whole order.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to health products they should be save and clearly marked.</li>
            <li> Great for My Skin and My Dog&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> Very strong smell for hours hard to use because of it</li>
            <li> I did a couple of reviews for this brand. I order mostly olive oil but this time it was for a lady. I think coconut retains a lot of its original smell when ozonated. Oh, I also think the ozonated oil is the only thing that treats poison ivy -- by my 4yr old daughter&#x27;s summer experience.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  But, it does have a persistent O3 odor;  not too bad; not nearly as strong as the olive oil version.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for dry feet and hands. Smells great too. Be careful if you open it when it is warm and liquid~I ruined my fav tshirt.</li>
            <li> Been using the the same brand but the Jojoba ozonated oil Acne for Roscea.  Has help tremendously! My skin is clear and not red anymore.  Didn&#x27;t realize when I first started to use that it was a wonderful anti-aging creme, my skin looks smooth and is very soft.</li>
            <li> Seems okay.  Definitely has that ozone smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have rashes and sensitive skin, so I thought this would be mild enough to help.&lt;br /&gt;It does moisturize, but did nothing for my rashes.&lt;br /&gt;I started having worse rashes (hot, red, stinging, itching) and at first I thought this could be a factor, but after discontinuing everything and starting new allergy patch testing, this tested fine and other allergies were discovered.  Will wait and retry at a later date, then give a final review.</li>
            <li> I have used most of the oils in this line- and they are great for skin irritations, after shower moisturizer, cracked hands, and for helping the sunburn on my hands. Absolutely a must try- start with the avocado or the jojoba first- the sunflower is awesome on face! Really helped with bug bites and I use it with my rx muscle cream to help the skin irritations I get. - seriously, this company KNOWS what they are doing, they are the first in the industry, they KNOW the products, work with educated, knowledgeable consultants in the B and B/cosmecutical industry- the base oils are already FDA checked and approved- and I know they have been verified as a \\&quot;good practices\\&quot; manufacturer- (cleanliness, sterility, proper equipment etc) This is not just someone in their kitchen adding stuff together from a recipe off the interwebs. Truly a pro company with a solid reputation and excellent product- say no to copy cats!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I preferred the Sunflower oil.</li>
            <li> hhhmmmm not sure about this one</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this product, it is light weight and not greasy. It really help clear up a skin rash i had</li>
            <li> This coconut oil has cleared up a skin infection that several other products failed to clear. I will always keep this in the medicine cabinet.  catlover</li>
            <li> smaller than I expected, but a nice product</li>
