            <li>Very happy with the deodorant.</li>
            <li>Works great one me!</li>
            <li>GREAT</li>
            <li>It helped a lot and is very effective as a deodorant.</li>
            <li>So the combination of a great razor and this amazing deo has helped lighten my underarms and it didn&#x27;t take forever!</li>
            <li>Tips for successful results: Find a hair removal method that won&#x27;t darken the underarms,gently exfoliate, and moisturize(Cleartone keeps the underarms moisturized).</li>
            <li>This product was in all a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells horrible(strong deodorant smell) and dosnt do anything to protect you from sweating if your the type of person that likes to smell good</li>
            <li>love it going to buy this again!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>Its amazing how this deodorant stops sweat and finishes the marks on my clothes too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It still moisturizes and deodorizes, too, so its just amazing</li>
            <li>and I have to say that this is amazing.</li>
            <li>Not even a nice deodorant.</li>
            <li>America is catching up!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>However, now my armpits are perfect and not dark.</li>
            <li>have very light olive-skinned tone</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I am really glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i found this set.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works</li>
            <li>I either need to reapply many times a day, or layer another deodorant on top.</li>
            <li>so I could make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my underarms any more toned or brighter.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I suspect I&#x27;ll see even more over a longer length of time.</li>
            <li>Firstly I just want to say the scent isn&#x27;t really pleasant.</li>
            <li>It smells great, heals my armpits, fixes the discoloration, and smooths out an area that is sometimes very sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is a much more advanced version of this product.</li>
            <li>I even strong armed my husband into trying it</li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t as strong as Degree Clinical Protection Motion Sense</li>
            <li>Smell is not too strong and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant because it smells good and keeps my underarms soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty nice, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>and it has already made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>and I see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>This product would most likely work beautifully for an average woman, but it does not work great for me.</li>
            <li>just getting better and better, i would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I does keep me smelling fresh all day, so that part works!</li>
            <li>I got this product as a sample and was really excited to try it.</li>
            <li>It did lighten after two days of my first use, but nothing more happened.</li>
            <li>My left armpit is beautiful again :) no dark spots or scars.</li>
            <li>I am a woman of medium skin tone, and i agree that it does not have full affect on women of color.</li>
            <li>and pretty quickly, too!</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference really quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>It seems just fine to me when i work out so also no sweating much (depends on your body though)</li>
            <li>so honestly I was surprised that it irritated me so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell can be quite powerful; it takes a while for you to get use to it.</li>
            <li>and I felt that it was right for me.</li>
            <li>It works for the first week, then It no longer keeps me feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference in the first 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this kind because I have dark hair</li>
            <li>Since then, I started getting enlarged lymph nodes here and there and I am damn sure that it is because of this product only !!!</li>
            <li>but I wanted them lighter because that somehow looks hot</li>
            <li>this did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>It is such a great feeling knowing that everyday items are so cheap.</li>
            <li>It smells and feels really good going on but half way into the day I can&#x27;t stand the smell of myself!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Dove deodorant and even though sometimes I use different kinds for a change I always go back to dove.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really need the deodorant.</li>
            <li>Which is a shame because I REALLY wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always felt really embarrassed by my darkened armpits.</li>
            <li>It really had evened out the skintone under my arms.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a deep brown complected African descent woman who scars very easily.</li>
            <li>I have worn the shirt many times using other deodorants, so I concluded that there is an ingredient in this particular brand that caused the bleeding.  </li>
            <li>But I was interested in the \\&quot;clear tone\\&quot; concept of this</li>
            <li>highly recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li>is COMPLETELY gone!!</li>
            <li>I have always had darker underarms and it has made me very self conscious.  </li>
            <li>My right armpit recently healed from the folicititis and I had to start over with this deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is my new deodorant.</li>
            <li>As far as just an anti-perspirant, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>It barley made a difference in my underarm darkness on a scale from 1 to ten on how much lighter my underarms are i will give it a 3 it didnt do much att all i stopped using it</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will use up the stick as well as the second one I have and see if I can go back to the original dove deodorant without my skin darkening again.</li>
            <li>Switching to epilating from shaving was the first big improvement, but I still had some darkness in the armpits.</li>
            <li>Dove product works pretty good - similar to the hardcore Mitchum antiperspirant so very little in sweaty wet pits.</li>
            <li>had the opportunity as an Amazon Vine user to try out [[ASIN:B006VTIP8S Dove Clinical Protection, Clear Tone Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant, Skin Renew, 1.7 oz]].</li>
            <li>I started using the Dove Clinical Protection Antiperspirant/Deodorant Clear Tone Skin Renew three days ago</li>
            <li>Ad says it helps to make clear tone in your skin, I do not think so.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have abnormally sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how ineffective this is as a deodorant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this deodorant could bring the color all the way back to my real skin tone</li>
            <li>French whitening cream does a better job than this waste of money.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as other brands I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m fresh all day, despite hauling toddlers, babies, dogs, and</li>
            <li>But to my dismay I haven&#x27;t seen any significant difference since I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li>I have light skin &amp; my underarms WERE a dark brown color but after using this for around 2 weeks, I can definitely tell that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>The actual deodorant itself protected well enough, but I cannot say it lasts as long as the original line does, though it comes close.</li>
            <li>Few weeks afterwards, my armpits are about 80% back to being scar free.</li>
            <li>I also have had major issues with underarm darkness since...</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out what the cause was until one morning when I realized that I had accidently purchased Clear Tone deoderant instead of my regular dove.  </li>
            <li>Just thought I&#x27;d share my review in case anyone had a similar reaction or had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Coarse hair and sensitive underarm skin.  </li>
            <li>I started noticing results after a few weeks, this product didnt work over night but the results are worth the wait</li>
            <li>It does improve the skin area, however it does take a LONG TIME, perhaps a few months for it to show significantly.</li>
            <li>It may work on me if I had much lighter skin or if my underarms were slightly dark and the deodorant would cure the issue.</li>
            <li>I do not get heavy perspiration, and I have a pretty stationary job.</li>
            <li>At least, the scent is not bad.</li>
            <li>I am very light-skinned but have black hair</li>
            <li>However, I chose this one in particular because of its claims to helps with dark underarm skin.  </li>

            <li> I am very light-skinned but have black hair</li>
            <li> However, I chose this one in particular because of its claims to helps with dark underarm skin.  </li>
            <li> Once I saw the commercial to this new deodorant that helps lighten dark armpits, I thought of \\&quot;Finally!!</li>
            <li> I have a medium brown skin tone and my underarms were definitely a darker grey color compared to my actual skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m olive complexion and have always been self conscious about my dark underarms.</li>
            <li> I personally think the pricing of the product is a bit too much, they need to knock down a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this to replace my other go to brands both in that it would be able to keep the funk at bay for a day, AND also improve my underarm skin.</li>
            <li> I picked up Dove Clear Tone in Pink Rosa at the grocery store a few weeks back</li>
            <li> (I burn in the sun instantly without sunblock) and jet black body hair that&#x27;s always embarrassed me, especially how it darkens my armpits.</li>
            <li> I am asian and a lot of asian deodorants tend to have skin whitening solutions, but they tend to be more expensive and hard to find.</li>
            <li> This product has definitely improved the underarm skintone, but it does not work as well as other Dove products as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> usually swear by Degree Clinical Protection, Women Sheer Powder, Motion Sense, especially when going to the gym daily.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, even he said he smelled SO bad by the end of the day he couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a woman who has been plagued with dark armpits since I was a teen.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on Xtreme Brite gel works on dark underarms, so I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing that next.</li>
            <li> but I am so pleased with the results even though I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> It sucks that dove discontinued the clear tone deodorant they had before this one.</li>
            <li> So, be careful before using this product.</li>
            <li> so I figured to protect my sensitive armpit skin with a thick oil.</li>
            <li> While this hasn&#x27;t made the darkness disappear completely, I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use it regularly, it is seriously minimized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before trying this, I used other Dove deodorants and never had this problem.</li>
            <li> I felt like this deodorant failed me not only on the \\&quot;clear tone\\&quot; part but on the deodorant part.</li>
            <li> I had folicititis on my right armpit from a bad razor which left a lot of scarring and darkening skin on my armpit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily for the past month and a half.</li>
            <li> I used to be self-conscious about my dark underarms and had no idea how to lighten them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for about a month and it has lightened the dark area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman of color so dark underarms,elbows, and knees are par for the course.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a lark at the grocery store - my dark underarms have always bothered me.</li>
            <li> I am filipino descent and had dark armpits.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin</li>
            <li> I was hoping this deodorant would remove the embarrassing dark areas in my underarms.</li>
            <li> what have you up and down stairs all day.</li>
            <li> I even dab a little on a scar I have had for awhile and it is slowly lightening the scar as well, oddly enough.</li>
            <li> Literally half an hour after I put this stuff on, I have already sweat through it.</li>
            <li> I saw it in the store for $2 less</li>
            <li> I also had previous scarring from just shaving.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin, and my underarms were almost black before</li>
            <li> I was really very skeptical that this deodorant would work and rightly</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no change which is very unfortunate, I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I saw very little to no results and it only had left a lot of residue in underarms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have this dark shadow!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve stopped shaving a lot less often(its winter!)</li>
            <li> might add that the difference I&#x27;ve seen hasn&#x27;t been dramatic, but it&#x27;s totally something that I can notice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the past few weeks my underarms have been sore, as if I have an abraison or skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I read these reviews and bought this product and have been using this product for past one week.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does leave white residue on clothes but that isn&#x27;t one of its selling points.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work :[</li>
            <li> Its hard to find this deo at stores now.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment :tears:</li>
            <li> It is so bad I am reminded of the enclosed ape exhibit of our local zoo, it is that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Nair shower max, when necessary and use castor oil as a base to protect my skin.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but tried this anyway.  </li>
            <li> How silly it is that I trusted the ad.</li>
            <li> I really hate how someone can falsely advertise their product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its amazing how this deodorant stops sweat and finishes the marks on my clothes too.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I started to see results within the 2 days of me wearing it!Its just getting better and better, i would highly recommend this product.It seems just fine to me when i work out so also no sweating much (depends on your body though) love it going to buy this again!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this before I purchased it and I felt that it was right for me. I&#x27;ve been using it now for a total of about 2 weeks &amp; I&#x27;ve seen a difference! I can&#x27;t believe it. I have light skin &amp; my underarms WERE a dark brown color but after using this for around 2 weeks, I can definitely tell that it&#x27;s working. I didn&#x27;t have any side effects or rashes develop because of this - and I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;I might add that the difference I&#x27;ve seen hasn&#x27;t been dramatic, but it&#x27;s totally something that I can notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because I&#x27;m not done with the deodorant yet &amp; when I am, I&#x27;ll change my rating based off it&#x27;s changes.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I have always had darker underarms and it has made me very self conscious.  I picked up Dove Clear Tone in Pink Rosa at the grocery store a few weeks back and it has already made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for around 3 months now and the darkness I used to have under my arms is COMPLETELY gone!! I started noticing results after a few weeks, this product didnt work over night but the results are worth the wait so be patient ladies!</li>
            <li> For the past few weeks my underarms have been sore, as if I have an abraison or skin irritation.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what the cause was until one morning when I realized that I had accidently purchased Clear Tone deoderant instead of my regular dove.  I don&#x27;t have abnormally sensitive skin so honestly I was surprised that it irritated me so much but as soon as I switched the irritation cleared up (no pun intended).  Just thought I&#x27;d share my review in case anyone had a similar reaction or had sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product was in all a good purchase. It does indeed lighten the under arms. However, it leaves a white residue on clothes if not applied with care and appears white on the armpit, does not blend.</li>
            <li> I read these reviews and bought this product and have been using this product for past one week. Since then, I started getting enlarged lymph nodes here and there and I am damn sure that it is because of this product only !!! Finally I quit using it from yesterday. So, be careful before using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. I used to be self-conscious about my dark underarms and had no idea how to lighten them but, when I saw this in the store, I decided to try it. It actually works- and pretty quickly, too! I even dab a little on a scar I have had for awhile and it is slowly lightening the scar as well, oddly enough. It still moisturizes and deodorizes, too, so its just amazing and I am really glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily for the past month and a half. Firstly I just want to say the scent isn&#x27;t really pleasant. Secondly, it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I saw absolutely no change which is very unfortunate, I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> This product would most likely work beautifully for an average woman, but it does not work great for me. I sweat. A lot. Literally half an hour after I put this stuff on, I have already sweat through it. I does keep me smelling fresh all day, so that part works! But putting &#x27;antiperspirant&#x27; in the name is a stretch.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant because it smells good and keeps my underarms soft and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t irate my underarms at it.</li>
            <li> Even after hair removal I&#x27;d have this dark shadow! Once I learned it was antiperspirant irritation in part I tried this product. It helped a lot and is very effective as a deodorant. Unfortunately it does leave white residue on clothes but that isn&#x27;t one of its selling points.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find this deo at stores now. I&#x27;m glad i found this set. Within 3 weeks of use i could start noticing my darkness was fading. Love this product!</li>
            <li> It sucks that dove discontinued the clear tone deodorant they had before this one. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to help with the darkness at all. I&#x27;m assuming it doesn&#x27;t work for those of color. The smell is pretty nice, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;m olive complexion and have always been self conscious about my dark underarms. After  2 weeks I noticed a difference and I have blackheads under my arms and they are clearing up. About it working as a deodorant I&#x27;m sure it works i just don&#x27;t sweat so I don&#x27;t really need the deodorant.</li>
            <li> I know they cannot put that it probably wont work for women of color on the label, but I think they should have waited before putting this product out. Women of color tend to have darker underarms, elbows, knees, etc; and I don&#x27;t think that they put everyone in consideration. Which is a shame because I REALLY wanted this to work. As far as just an anti-perspirant, it&#x27;s decent. But I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This product has definitely improved the underarm skintone, but it does not work as well as other Dove products as a deodorant. I either need to reapply many times a day, or layer another deodorant on top. I do not get heavy perspiration, and I have a pretty stationary job. I was surprised by how ineffective this is as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have a medium brown skin tone and my underarms were definitely a darker grey color compared to my actual skin tone. I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for about a month and it has lightened the dark area. I don&#x27;t think this deodorant could bring the color all the way back to my real skin tone but I am so pleased with the results even though I was very skeptical. The actual deodorant itself protected well enough, but I cannot say it lasts as long as the original line does, though it comes close. I will use up the stick as well as the second one I have and see if I can go back to the original dove deodorant without my skin darkening again.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a sample and was really excited to try it. It smells and feels really good going on but half way into the day I can&#x27;t stand the smell of myself! It is so bad I am reminded of the enclosed ape exhibit of our local zoo, it is that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before trying this, I used other Dove deodorants and never had this problem. I even strong armed my husband into trying it so I could make sure it wasn&#x27;t just me. Sure enough, even he said he smelled SO bad by the end of the day he couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is off in this deodorant blend. I&#x27;m not giving up on Dove, but I am NEVER buying this mix!</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for a couple of weeks.  This product caused the color to bleed on my red and white shirt.  I have worn the shirt many times using other deodorants, so I concluded that there is an ingredient in this particular brand that caused the bleeding.  Beware when wearing red!</li>
            <li> I was really very skeptical that this deodorant would work and rightly so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually swear by Degree Clinical Protection, Women Sheer Powder, Motion Sense, especially when going to the gym daily. I use it twice a day. But I was interested in the \\&quot;clear tone\\&quot; concept of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very light olive-skinned tone (I burn in the sun instantly without sunblock) and jet black body hair that&#x27;s always embarrassed me, especially how it darkens my armpits. I felt like this deodorant failed me not only on the \\&quot;clear tone\\&quot; part but on the deodorant part. It just wasn&#x27;t as strong as Degree Clinical Protection Motion Sense and I had to reapply several times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the opportunity as an Amazon Vine user to try out [[ASIN:B006VTIP8S Dove Clinical Protection, Clear Tone Antiperspirant &amp; Deodorant, Skin Renew, 1.7 oz]]. It is a much more advanced version of this product. I started using the Dove Clinical Protection Antiperspirant/Deodorant Clear Tone Skin Renew three days ago and I noticed a difference really quickly. I am very light-skinned but have black hair and I&#x27;ve always felt really embarrassed by my darkened armpits. It&#x27;s only been three days and I&#x27;m sold. I already see a difference. This is my new deodorant. And I have no problem wearing sleeveless shirts now.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this product but nothing happened. It didn&#x27;t make my underarms any more toned or brighter. What ever it claims to do it doesn&#x27;t. I really hate how someone can falsely advertise their product.</li>
            <li> My underarms are the same color as my skin but I wanted them lighter because that somehow looks hot this did absolutely nothing! Not even a nice deodorant. My sister always uses my deodorant because she always mis-places hers but she also doesn&#x27;t like this one because it leaves stains on clothes and also somehow makes your underarms sweat. Cheaper in Wal-mart BTW I saw it in the store for $2 less</li>
            <li> GREAT I LOVE THIS PRODUCT WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a Bengali girl (brown skintone) and I have to say that this is amazing. I had folicititis on my right armpit from a bad razor which left a lot of scarring and darkening skin on my armpit. I also had previous scarring from just shaving. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now. My left armpit is beautiful again :) no dark spots or scars. My right armpit recently healed from the folicititis and I had to start over with this deodorant. Few weeks afterwards, my armpits are about 80% back to being scar free. I absolutely love this! It smells great, heals my armpits, fixes the discoloration, and smooths out an area that is sometimes very sensitive. I love it!!!! Highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I am a woman of medium skin tone, and i agree that it does not have full affect on women of color. I don&#x27;t know if it has affect on the fairer women either though. I see some difference in my underarm skin (i have been using this for a couple of months), so I will continue this product until i find another product of another brand that promises the same results.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this to replace my other go to brands both in that it would be able to keep the funk at bay for a day, AND also improve my underarm skin. But I have to say, it works. I&#x27;m a woman of color so dark underarms,elbows, and knees are par for the course. But after using it for a couple weeks now I can definitely see improvement in the color of the skin. I suspect I&#x27;ll see even more over a longer length of time. And as for funk protection? It gets an A grade. Works just as well as other brands I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;m fresh all day, despite hauling toddlers, babies, dogs, and what have you up and down stairs all day.</li>
            <li> It works for the first week, then It no longer keeps me feeling fresh. If I sweat, It does not protect me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Dove deodorant and even though sometimes I use different kinds for a change I always go back to dove. I was so excited to find this kind because I have dark hair and I&#x27;ve always had problems with it since I started shaving and I would be humiliated, wondering if people thought I forgot to shave when I actually didn&#x27;t. I also have very sensitive skin. So the combination of a great razor and this amazing deo has helped lighten my underarms and it didn&#x27;t take forever! I&#x27;m definitely going to buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a deep brown complected African descent woman who scars very easily. Bruises, mosquito bites, shaving you name it. I also have had major issues with underarm darkness since...well it feels like forever. Coarse hair and sensitive underarm skin.  I ordered 3 sticks because my sister who has a similar issue, said it works.  Been using it for 2 months and I see a huge difference. Tips for successful results: Find a hair removal method that won&#x27;t darken the underarms,gently exfoliate, and moisturize(Cleartone keeps the underarms moisturized). Kinda gross, but I&#x27;ve stopped shaving a lot less often(its winter!) so my underarms can have a break. I used Nair shower max, when necessary and use castor oil as a base to protect my skin. When I use to perm my hair, I used Vaseline to protect my skin and Nair has similar qualities so I figured to protect my sensitive armpit skin with a thick oil. It worked! I haven&#x27;t had a razor bump in months. Very happy with the deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works great one me! I bought it as a lark at the grocery store - my dark underarms have always bothered me. While this hasn&#x27;t made the darkness disappear completely, I&#x27;ve noticed that if I use it regularly, it is seriously minimized. I have brown skin, and my underarms were almost black before, now they are just a shade darker than the rest of me.</li>
            <li> It does improve the skin area, however it does take a LONG TIME, perhaps a few months for it to show significantly.</li>
            <li> I am a woman who has been plagued with dark armpits since I was a teen. I am asian and a lot of asian deodorants tend to have skin whitening solutions, but they tend to be more expensive and hard to find. Once I saw the commercial to this new deodorant that helps lighten dark armpits, I thought of \\&quot;Finally!! America is catching up!\\&quot;. But to my dismay I haven&#x27;t seen any significant difference since I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months. It did lighten after two days of my first use, but nothing more happened. I really wanted this product to work :[&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell can be quite powerful; it takes a while for you to get use to it. I personally think the pricing of the product is a bit too much, they need to knock down a few bucks. I read reviews on Xtreme Brite gel works on dark underarms, so I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing that next. Sadly, I will not be repurchasing this product. Big disappointment :tears:</li>
            <li> Smell is not too strong and it lasts all day. I do not know if it makes the skin tone even..have not paid attention to that.&lt;br /&gt;If I notice anything I will update.</li>
            <li> Works well as a deodarant.  However, I chose this one in particular because of its claims to helps with dark underarm skin.  After two months of daily or twice daily use, I have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells horrible(strong deodorant smell) and dosnt do anything to protect you from sweating if your the type of person that likes to smell good this is not for you. It barley made a difference in my underarm darkness on a scale from 1 to ten on how much lighter my underarms are i will give it a 3 it didnt do much att all i stopped using it but my underarms are lighter but i think its because i exfoliate them and not from this.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS! I am filipino descent and had dark armpits. Switching to epilating from shaving was the first big improvement, but I still had some darkness in the armpits. I am a sweaty type, so I&#x27;ve always used something like Mitchum which works quite well, so I was hesitant to try another antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove product works pretty good - similar to the hardcore Mitchum antiperspirant so very little in sweaty wet pits. However, now my armpits are perfect and not dark. YAY! I&#x27;ll be using this product from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note, your mileage may vary - your armpits could be a sign of health issues, so get that checked out too. And yeah, stop shaving.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but tried this anyway.  It really had evened out the skintone under my arms.  I saw a difference in the first 2 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> We all need deodorant, then why not buy in bulk? It is such a great feeling knowing that everyday items are so cheap.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and I have been using this product for two months. I was hoping this deodorant would remove the embarrassing dark areas in my underarms. Unfortunately, I saw very little to no results and it only had left a lot of residue in underarms. It may work on me if I had much lighter skin or if my underarms were slightly dark and the deodorant would cure the issue. But I don&#x27;t. French whitening cream does a better job than this waste of money.</li>
            <li> Ad says it helps to make clear tone in your skin, I do not think so. It does not change at all. How silly it is that I trusted the ad. At least, the scent is not bad.</li>
