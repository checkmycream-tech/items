            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for 10 days to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a good multi chrome gel polish sold in the USA</li>
            <li>The product lasted a good two weeks.</li>
            <li>So happy that I am able to use my polishes.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>wear wasn&#x27;t as good as a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; gel polish- it started lifting at the sides on most of my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The finish is good and I&#x27;m confident the nails will be durable.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li>This gel when finished is shinier than most, which is a wonderful improvement off of many of the top coat gels available.  </li>
            <li>So nice that now I can buy any favorite color polish and know it won&#x27;t chip off after 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>So far so GREAT!!</li>
            <li>It allows me to use my favorite non gel polish.</li>
            <li>I do top it off with the CND UV Top Coat</li>
            <li>I have found that when you add drop for drop of polish that the colors become diluted, this is because there is actually more gelibility product than polish.</li>
            <li>How much better could nail polish get?</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works better than advertised.</li>
            <li>When you mix the gel and the polish, you will probably need more polish than gel.</li>
            <li>Like a dream come true!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use .</li>
            <li>Removal was also easy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen anything available that compares to this.  </li>
            <li>So when I stumbled upon this I was soooo excited.  </li>
            <li>Soaking took much longer than 10 minutes/nail (probably more like 15-18 minutes/nail), and I couldn&#x27;t even get it off 3 nails.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used this with high end and salon quality polishes with great success.  </li>
            <li>It is truly an amazing product and I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I have a large nail polish collection, and like to do no-chip manicures at home for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll all come right off.</li>
            <li>The final coat of &amp;#34;Fix It&amp;#34; gave a beautiful shine - Only problem is that the color on my nails was NOT the color in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this as a way of getting more durability out of my large collection of normal nail polish and also to use with some interesting colours not available in gel</li>
            <li>Mixing was relatively easy using a palette and a nail art brush - I did as recommended and used more drops of nail polish relative to the gelibility, but the color ended up more like a slightly translucent crelly.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>One thing I had to make sure of was getting even parts of the regular polish and gelibility polish.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I changed the polish was because of the out growth, I know it would of lasted 3 weeks for sure.</li>
            <li>I mixed it in a dappen dish that clean by using the lint free cotton soaked in alcohol that was used to wipe off the final tacky layer from the gel after curing in an LED light.  </li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t go wrong and I would highly suggest you give it a try and see how wonderful it is.</li>
            <li>You can use any regular nail polish that you want which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I really, really, really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>It ended up being very time-consuming to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now I can by the cheap regular polish in any color and have it as a gel!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am quite pleased with the effect, and the blue shimmer that makes the original nail polish has endured (though not very visible in my pic).</li>
            <li>However, after THREE attempts to achieve the desired effect, I must sadly give up  The process was great - the polished mixed well and went on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t as long as Gelibility is available.  </li>
            <li>I used this with a new Essie fall color and it has been bullet proof for 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better would be a larger size of the fixit.</li>
            <li>There was absolutely no chipping, peeling and absolutely now wear at the free edge.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>I love the concept - which would allow for a vast selection of colors rather than be limited to those offered by gel polish manufacturers.  </li>
            <li>Gelibility is a little expensive but considering the $$ I save being able to use all my favorite regular polishes, I think the cost is worth it!</li>
            <li>The only thing I may try in the future is using a small dropper to make sure I am getting the same amount of gel to polish ratio when I mix -- so far I have been fine just letting a little drip off of the brush from the polish and gel into the dish before I mix with the polish brush and apply -- but there could be colors for which a precise measurement of the ratio between polish and gel would be helpful.  </li>
            <li>Pure and simple</li>
            <li>Tip; when taking polish off buff entire nail and really soak your cotton ball or paper towel in remover... let soak for 15 min.</li>
            <li>I ordered this directly from the company and used it immediately.  </li>
            <li>I am a manicurist for nearly 25 yrs now.</li>
            <li>It does make the polish lighter than normal but an extra coat solves that.</li>
            <li>The only downfall and the reason for four and not five stars is that if you let the polish sit it will start to dry so you have to constantly mix it or use it quickly.</li>
            <li>bad, it is a great idea.  </li>
            <li>I am on day 2 now, I have been pretty rough on my nails and not a chip!!</li>
            <li>I use an 18W LED for 60 seconds rather than 30 just to be certain it is cured, and it has worked extremely well.  </li>

            <li> so Ill be fine if I don&#x27;t get 14 days out of this either.</li>
            <li> You also need more coats than usual since it dilutes the color of the polish, so your nails feel very thick.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long it lasts</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am a true believer.</li>
            <li> I had a tough time to get the Gelibility product to mix well with the polis, The end result was a very streaky mani.</li>
            <li> I had to really carefully buff it away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done my own gel nail polish dozens of times and this was by far the worst removal process.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, it changed the color of the polish I used; what was supposed to be pale pink turned out white.  </li>
            <li> and it is truly wearing just like other brands of gel.  </li>
            <li> This polish holds up to an active lifestyle.</li>
            <li> did this manicure using a Colours by Llarowe pink with a faint bluish shimmer - normally opaque in two coats.</li>
            <li> It was also hard to get the layers as thin as I would normally with a regular gel polish and the end effect was quite thick - I would use the softest brush you have as I struggled to get even coverage with the one I used (making it harder to get opacity).</li>
            <li> It does make the nail lacquer slightly less opaque, but I then apply 3 coats instead of 2.  </li>
            <li> When you mix the polishes, it turns them into a gloopy mess...</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this, but I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have been using gel polish at home for the past few years, and was waiting until someone would come up with a way to turn existing polish into a gel form.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, just buy gel polishes- don&#x27;t waste your money, time, and the health of your nails on this one!</li>
            <li> No more Gelish or Shellac for me.</li>
            <li> My nails were perfectly healthy before I used this, and now those 3 nails are weak, thin and sore :( :</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone, unless you had a regular nail polish you desperately needed to turn into a gel.  </li>
            <li> Seriously :0)</li>
            <li> But that wasn&#x27;t tough, an eye dropper was all that I needed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;The worst part of the polish was the removal- it was horrible!!  </li>

            <li> I really, really, really wanted to like this product.  I love the concept - which would allow for a vast selection of colors rather than be limited to those offered by gel polish manufacturers.  However, after THREE attempts to achieve the desired effect, I must sadly give up  The process was great - the polished mixed well and went on smoothly.  The final coat of &amp;#34;Fix It&amp;#34; gave a beautiful shine - Only problem is that the color on my nails was NOT the color in the bottle.  Each wound up with an orange hew - including the mauve I chose to wear on Easter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long it lasts - I only went days - I could not tolerate the color change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, it is a great idea.  Perhaps there is something in my body chemistry - don&#x27;t know.  It just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> Gelibility is awesome! It allows me to use my favorite non gel polish. Plus it appears my manicure lasts longer than a gel manicure. Gelibility is a little expensive but considering the $$ I save being able to use all my favorite regular polishes, I think the cost is worth it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this, but I was really disappointed.  When you mix the polishes, it turns them into a gloopy mess... I think it&#x27;s because the regular polish starts drying a bit.  You also need more coats than usual since it dilutes the color of the polish, so your nails feel very thick.  It ended up being very time-consuming to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, it changed the color of the polish I used; what was supposed to be pale pink turned out white.  That wasn&#x27;t the end of the world, but it was strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wear wasn&#x27;t as good as a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; gel polish- it started lifting at the sides on most of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of the polish was the removal- it was horrible!!

            <li> Love this stuff!  It work perfectly.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  Love it!  So nice that now I can buy any favorite color polish and know it won&#x27;t chip off after 24 hours.  I do top it off with the CND UV Top Coat and I&#x27;m good for 10 days to 2 weeks. Great product.</li>
            <li> WOW!! So far so GREAT!! Applies and looks the same as Gelish or Shellac. I am on day 2 now, I have been pretty rough on my nails and not a chip!! I never get 14 days out of my gel polish so Ill be fine if I don&#x27;t get 14 days out of this either. It does make the polish lighter than normal but an extra coat solves that. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This changed my gel polish world forever! I couldn&#x27;t find a good multi chrome gel polish sold in the USA but with this product, all my polish can be gel polish. The only thing that would make it better would be a larger size of the fixit.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this as a way of getting more durability out of my large collection of normal nail polish and also to use with some interesting colours not available in gel polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did this manicure using a Colours by Llarowe pink with a faint bluish shimmer - normally opaque in two coats. Mixing was relatively easy using a palette and a nail art brush - I did as recommended and used more drops of nail polish relative to the gelibility, but the color ended up more like a slightly translucent crelly. It was also hard to get the layers as thin as I would normally with a regular gel polish and the end effect was quite thick - I would use the softest brush you have as I struggled to get even coverage with the one I used (making it harder to get opacity). I wouldn&#x27;t use your regular nail polish brush unless you don&#x27;t care about contaminating it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am quite pleased with the effect, and the blue shimmer that makes the original nail polish has endured (though not very visible in my pic). I couldn&#x27;t get them as neat as I would with a regular gel - but this is probably just a case of practice. The finish is good and I&#x27;m confident the nails will be durable.</li>
            <li> I used this with multiple different colors of nail polish and the color seems to be holding well. I have found that when you add drop for drop of polish that the colors become diluted, this is because there is actually more gelibility product than polish. I have found that adding two drops of polish to one drop of gelibility solves this problem. The only downfall and the reason for four and not five stars is that if you let the polish sit it will start to dry so you have to constantly mix it or use it quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I have been doing gel polish at home for years, but always had a ton of regular polish colors that I missed using.  So when I stumbled upon this I was soooo excited.  I have been using it now for months and it is truly wearing just like other brands of gel.  One thing I had to make sure of was getting even parts of the regular polish and gelibility polish.  But that wasn&#x27;t tough, an eye dropper was all that I needed.  Pure and simple this stuff is amazing!  Like a dream come true!  now I can by the cheap regular polish in any color and have it as a gel!  How much better could nail polish get? Seriously :0)</li>
            <li> Amazing! So happy that I am able to use my polishes.</li>
            <li> It works great. Easy to use .</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have a large nail polish collection, and like to do no-chip manicures at home for special occasions.  This set allows me to mix my regular nail polishes into gel, UV cure no chip polish.  So far I have used this with high end and salon quality polishes with great success.  It does make the nail lacquer slightly less opaque, but I then apply 3 coats instead of 2.  Will repurchase when I&#x27;m done with this set.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Have used it over the last 6 months and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I&#x27;ve expanded my nail polish just by adding these two bottles to my collection. I&#x27;m a beach addict; always in the sand and sea. This polish holds up to an active lifestyle. Tip; when taking polish off buff entire nail and really soak your cotton ball or paper towel in remover... let soak for 15 min. It&#x27;ll all come right off.</li>
            <li> I had a tough time to get the Gelibility product to mix well with the polis, The end result was a very streaky mani.But it was as durable as my regular gel polish.</li>
            <li> changes the color of the nail polishes</li>
            <li> I ordered this directly from the company and used it immediately.  I have been using gel polish at home for the past few years, and was waiting until someone would come up with a way to turn existing polish into a gel form.  This gel when finished is shinier than most, which is a wonderful improvement off of many of the top coat gels available.  It provides access to any nail color desired and and allows me to use colors of regular nail polish without needing to purchase additional gels.  I am truly impressed at the ease and great results.  Removal was also easy. I will definitely continue to buy this.  I mixed it in a dappen dish that clean by using the lint free cotton soaked in alcohol that was used to wipe off the final tacky layer from the gel after curing in an LED light.  I use an 18W LED for 60 seconds rather than 30 just to be certain it is cured, and it has worked extremely well.  The only thing I may try in the future is using a small dropper to make sure I am getting the same amount of gel to polish ratio when I mix -- so far I have been fine just letting a little drip off of the brush from the polish and gel into the dish before I mix with the polish brush and apply -- but there could be colors for which a precise measurement of the ratio between polish and gel would be helpful.  I haven&#x27;t seen anything available that compares to this.  There is one product that turns polish to gel -- but it is configured in such a manner that you are to use one bottle of the gel per bottle of polish to mix -- and this defeats the purpose of saving on gel purchases.  I haven&#x27;t tried that product -- and I won&#x27;t as long as Gelibility is available.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product and I am so happy that I tried it. You can use any regular nail polish that you want which is a huge plus. The product lasted a good two weeks. The only reason I changed the polish was because of the out growth, I know it would of lasted 3 weeks for sure. There was absolutely no chipping, peeling and absolutely now wear at the free edge.  It is truly an amazing product and I will definitely continue to use it. No more Gelish or Shellac for me. You just can&#x27;t go wrong and I would highly suggest you give it a try and see how wonderful it is. Needless to say I am a true believer.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Works better than advertised.</li>
            <li> This works!  I am a manicurist for nearly 25 yrs now. I used this with a new Essie fall color and it has been bullet proof for 2 weeks!  When you mix the gel and the polish, you will probably need more polish than gel. Just a tip I picked up reading a blogger&#x27;s review.</li>
