            <li>The price is good for the amount of use I get from it in that time.  </li>
            <li>so you aren&#x27;t accidentally hitting them all the time and good power.  </li>
            <li>Also good for drying craft projects and clothes.</li>
            <li>Very good, light weight and efficient.</li>

            <li>(I had a gift card), but I&#x27;ve been very happy with this economical option.  </li>
            <li>If I had wavy or curly hair, the diffuser would be used more, but it&#x27;s a great option as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still a Great Deal, Love my Hair Dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased . . .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for almost a year now, and I love it, it works great, not any issues with it at all, and</li>

            <li>This one had quite good reviews, and I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this purchase! :)</li>
            <li>This dryer has the great balance, the comfortable handle, the easy-to-use switches.</li>

            <li>I bought this 4 years ago and it is still amazing.</li>

            <li>it works on any kind of hair and gets the job done fast love it!!!!!</li>
            <li>I did receive it on that date, but it would have been nice</li>
            <li>The diffuser is a joke - you might as well blow on your own hair.  </li>
            <li>Since I have some curl to my hair, it&#x27;s nice to have the diffuser that fits the dryer.</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely and delivered on time.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair, and the finger diffuser is perfect for dryer my hair without messing up my curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used and liked Vidal Sassoon dryers, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>I do my own wash and set</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice inexpensive hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I liked the dryer...while it worked.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair dryer I have had so far.  </li>
            <li>far I have been very happy with this blow drier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited about this dryer because it was cheap, included the accessories I needed and looked to be good quality from the description and reviews, but I guess not!</li>
            <li>I find it easy to use and very effective and easy to move around.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li>, it looks pretty sophisticated with beautiful controls for just 13.28 dollars + tax.</li>
            <li>This dryer worked great when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>the shipment was great, it was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>so holding it while drying is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This came quickly, and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Strong airflow and nice setting options.</li>
            <li>The hairdryer looks elegant, of very light weight.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this Vidal Sassoon dryer.</li>
            <li>and I love the diffuser attachment for my curls.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it works well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably okay for the price.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it as the best in the market now and one of the strongest hair dryers!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck.</li>
            <li>Bought this model for its separate heat and speed controls, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I will be returning it and for just a couple of dollars more getting a better one.</li>
            <li>Nothing better</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>This was OK with me.  </li>
            <li>for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love it :) haven&#x27;t used the attachments.</li>
            <li>and I should have known better :)</li>

            <li>The dryer functions okay.  </li>

            <li>If it lasts 6 - 12 months I will be well satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am highly pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the purchase....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok dryer, but defiantly not durable.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend uses this more than I do.  </li>
            <li>In the winter I do tend to get static in my hair, so I decided to buy this model with the ionizing feature.  </li>
            <li>oh my I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>Plus it has been 7 years, I have moved and travelled many many times, and it has not gone out on me.  </li>
            <li>(although I could&#x27;ve used 6 inches more, but..)</li>
            <li>Love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>get some more..</li>
            <li>love it love</li>

            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this hair dryer for many years and like the amount of heat and air flow options.  </li>
            <li>Favorite hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine creates wacky sculptures</li>
            <li>ok but heavey&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s extremely light which makes it very easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in order to use it when I moved, I tried it and it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>So excited they are still making it!  </li>
            <li>The filter is also very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Also, buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks, it looks stylish in the image, but looks cheap in reality.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL, GOOD GRIP.</li>
            <li>The cap falls off too easily.</li>
            <li>The attachments easily fall off.</li>
            <li>Well yes, it does come off for easy cleaning alright</li>
            <li>front pieces fall off too easy and often.</li>
            <li>This dryer does not blow strong.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product almost a year ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive hair dryer, this thing was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>The blow drier is not too noisy and the temperature settings, warm and hot do the job.  </li>
            <li>I love the cool feature on this dryer.</li>
            <li>It works perfect and is very hot to dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s just fine for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine thinning hair.</li>
            <li>It was fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their hair dryers are the best so far almost professional!</li>
            <li>I love this dryer, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been using!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really huge though.</li>
            <li>Love the bright red color too.</li>
            <li>I read a review today and in October another woman experienced the same thing I did.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t lose it in a drawer if you can fit it in one.</li>
            <li>Also it is light and well balanced</li>
            <li>Great dryer especially for the price.    </li>
            <li>It is light weight but is not made with quality material it is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m cheap, so I bought this instead</li>
            <li>great color is red!</li>
            <li>Before I was using a cheap Revlon dryer, but this one is by far better quality, more efficient, and better for my hair.</li>
            <li>tried a SalonSalon hair dryer at a friends house which was fabulous - turns out</li>
            <li>Maybe if it had a comb attachment to it would have been more useful but just not for me.</li>
            <li>The diffuser didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold and a fantastic deal</li>
            <li>It feels like cheap flimsy plastic to the touch</li>
            <li>He seems to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>This is nothing but a cheap piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold -</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far it is a good product.</li>
            <li>SHE LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER MORE THAN THE ONE IVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST,WHICH WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE.THIS</li>
            <li>Seems to be good so far.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some reviewers, I find the temperature separation between cool - warm - hot good, with each setting producing noticeable but not extreme temperature change.</li>
            <li>The cool shot button also works well, and is easy to use and hold in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This VS hair dryer is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful and does not burn my hair</li>
            <li>They took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item.</li>
            <li>Very strong and fast.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s already got my money&#x27;s worth out of it!</li>
            <li>I was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s pretty fabulous!</li>
            <li>The dryer is light weight and full of options.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, a good product for the money!</li>
            <li>It is happening more and more frequently now.</li>
            <li>The back cover comes off for easy cleaning and it does, nicely and the screen is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Strong and powerful.</li>
            <li>He gets a bath every week and using the high speed with the warm setting he drys really quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a tried and true model by Vidal Sassoon.  </li>
            <li>Works well and looks really cool also</li>
            <li>so I guess its true</li>
            <li>and I cannot say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li>The temperature and output controls are fantastic;  it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>But regardless, this hair dryer is good enough to not make me want to buy another one just yet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to handle, has several settings available, and the accessories are easy to attach.  </li>
            <li>I love my new hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  </li>
            <li>Quick drying but still leaves my frizzy</li>
            <li>and I needed a quick replacement.  </li>
            <li>people may need more power, for me it is more than enough!</li>
            <li>Gets very hot and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a good hair dryer for most people, but my hair is very fine and flyaway wispy, so I am personally unhappy with it .  </li>
            <li>Pretty Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It has the option to turn the ions on and off which helps in a good blow dry.</li>
            <li>Not bad, does a good job but feels a little cheap.</li>
            <li>I turned the heat setting down to warm and was able to finish drying my hair.</li>
            <li>the exact one we wanted!</li>
            <li>My fine hair just wants to frizz since I don&#x27;t use &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; to control it and this dryer hasn&#x27;t done anything to solve the problem.</li>
            <li>thanks for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li>Thank you for having this available for me to purchase at a decent price!</li>
            <li>In person it is a much darker red, not as bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for a few months, then shorted out and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser and friends laugh at me when I tell them about it.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading a review about it on another website, and figured it was worth a try since it was so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>It is ok, but not like the old one.</li>
            <li>I use it on warm and low</li>
            <li>I unplug everything else from it when using the dryer… which I didn&#x27;t have to do before, but now if I don&#x27;t, the dryer shuts off even more frequently.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would do for thicker hair, but it is neither too hot or too cool.</li>
            <li>I use the warm, low setting for my hair, and the results are great--smooth, non frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the second Vidal Sassoon of this kind I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>This replaced a smaller Vidal Sassoon hair dryer which I really liked, but it broke.  </li>
            <li>works great so far and comes with the extra parts (which i haven&#x27;t yet used).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s too powerful either.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is definitely worth</li>
            <li>For the price it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it was marked high, but blew out and temp wise was more like low.  </li>
            <li>but this gets my hair dry quickly and comes with a diffuser attachment, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I disposed it right away.</li>
            <li>It get&#x27;s the job done with the right amount of heat setting.</li>
            <li>It has 2 heat settings and a hot and warm mode for drying and setting respectively.</li>
            <li>love that there is an actual setting for cool air plus the button for a shot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, keeps the frizz down and LOVE the attachments.</li>
            <li>This particular dryer is very powerful, yet lighter weight than others I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair in under 5 minutes, it&#x27;s light and easy to handle, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and the ruby red color brightens my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Therefore, if you are not careful you will be drying on warm instead of high.  </li>
            <li>The concentrated hair drying attachment that was stated in the description of the product as coming off for easy cleaning, unlike most other models.  </li>
            <li>The price seemed reasonable and it was a quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Since this is Spring, the air has had enough humidity that I have not yet been able to figure out if this feature is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if I use the Warm setting it takes a century to dry it</li>
            <li>This model&#x27;s high setting is a good speed and allows you to dry your hair without it blowing all over the place.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from this product !</li>
            <li>Still dries very fast.</li>
            <li>I turned it on for only 30 seconds and it quickly overheated and turned bright orange inside and could potentially have caught on fire.</li>
            <li>A funny thing though.</li>
            <li>I had this same hair dryer for many years (10+) that I burned out the motor.</li>
            <li>This is the first hair dryer that I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time yesterday and the dryer shut off halfway through the drying process.</li>
            <li>I know it is because of the safety feature that turns it off once it is too hot.</li>
            <li>I recently bought 2 more in case the manufacturer decides to stop production.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the Diffuser, so I sold it on Ebay and the hair dryer paid for itself  ;-)</li>
            <li>I have had to change it back as many as 20 times in one hair drying session.  </li>
            <li>Was happy to change to this hair dryer after my former one (another brand beginning with R which I&#x27;d only had for a year) started sparking so much</li>
            <li>Update 4 1/2 months later - hairdryer stopped, glowed, and then didn&#x27;t work any more.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but I&#x27;ve been using it just over a year</li>
            <li>The hot setting is almost too hot, so I use medium.</li>
            <li>This item is exactly what I replaced.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>Works so fast!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, this is my third one.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get in the red color.</li>
            <li>yesterday it smelled funny and stopped heating.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted six years.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with it and will buy the same brand again..</li>
            <li>, so I have to use the Hot setting.</li>
            <li>first of all exellent shipping got here fast&lt;</li>
            <li>I had a similar dryer that lasted many years until I dropped it on the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li>pretty close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- 3 heat settings - and the &amp;#34;very hot&amp;#34; is actually hot enough&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know I have purchased  5 in total and 3 are functional which includes my latest purchase.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, although I rarely use it, as styled hair is not a priority for me.</li>
            <li>So far, in the month that I have had this dryer, it has NEVER disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I used HIGH warm speed to blow dry then used Medium Hot to style my BOB.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, easy to handle and quick to dry.</li>
            <li>It is super light and dries my long hair in minutes.</li>
            <li>I love the multi settings to dry your hair and it was exactly what I was looking for as a gift for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>It works great and has the same specs as my other model.</li>
            <li>I really need to rethink the length of my hair, too much work!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li>This dryer offers all the options you need and delivers the good solid service in an almost professional manner.  </li>
            <li>Description says full size dryer but could have a little more power.</li>
            <li>The back filter piece comes off too easily.</li>
            <li>and I really like it because the high setting speed is just right for styling your hair...</li>
            <li>, I would certainly buy this hair dryer again.  </li>
            <li>This blower has large shoes to fill.</li>
            <li>Certainly recommend others to buy!very trustworthy.</li>
            <li>That one is great for thick hair like mine!</li>
            <li>Other dryers suck my wifes hair into the intake, very fine hair.</li>
            <li>They blow a decent hot air which saves u time  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27; s a pretty decent hair drier for the price.</li>
            <li>Very high powered drying with 3 heat settings, and 3 power settings.  </li>
            <li>And I did try other brands, which I returned, as no other dryer ever got hot enough to straighten my frizzy hair, so I&#x27;m really glad I was able to find an exact match here.</li>
            <li>Out of nowhere, it would not blow hot air if it is on high.</li>
            <li>It also comes with the curl enhancer which helps in creating voluminous natural waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by how light it is</li>
            <li>The cold shot button is great for syling too!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li>Really like the way it streamlines the air.  </li>
            <li>I think, for a few bucks more, you can do smaller and better</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>With much expectation, I opened the item just to find out it would not work.</li>
            <li>and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>This one, not so much.</li>
            <li>FOR MY WIFE WITCH HAS A LOT OF HAIR AND IS VERY PICKY ON WHAT SHE USES FOR IT.</li>
            <li>I would recommend if it is reasonably priced</li>
            <li>recommend this dryer highly!  </li>
            <li>light weight but enough drying power.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the concept of &amp;#34;Ceramic&amp;#34; hair dryer (I thought</li>
            <li>The color is much prettier here on Amazon than in person.  </li>
            <li>Also I use it on my daughters with much thinner hair and also on cooler setting</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It makes my hair straight.</li>
            <li>but I expected more.</li>
            <li>Really crappy dryer.</li>
            <li>Highly  recommend!</li>
            <li>it came really fast, she loves it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>But I guess you can&#x27;t really expect that for around twenty bucks.</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really owned another blow dryer</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the diffuser does much, but I really don&#x27;t care about that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much appreciated around here.  </li>
            <li>But if you are counting on getting the whole enchillada --check the box as soon as it comes in.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and I really want to return this item！I</li>
            <li>works well drys hair fast</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use and does not strain my arm as much as other heavier dryers.</li>
            <li>My old dryer quit working---so had to wait for you to prepare shipment--whatever that is!!!</li>
            <li>Update: after using this hair drier for 2 years, one day the handle got super hot and red and burnt smell started coming out of it.</li>
            <li>The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn&#x27;t get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as most other dryers.      </li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, I would recommend looking for a hair dryer with a high, medium and low.</li>
            <li>I like that it has several heat settings, although the high heat isn&#x27;t super hot.  </li>
            <li>Her hair looks much healthier too, since we replaced the older, non-ionic hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>The attachments go on hard and the finger diff-user is just so large that it really can&#x27;t be used effectively.  </li>
            <li>A little bigger than expected but works perfect and dries hair in seconds..</li>
            <li>It is a little loud, but overall it works great.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t effect the ability to connect the attachments; though I wonder how long this will work?  </li>
            <li>I was looking at much more expensive dryers, and I really don&#x27;t think one of them would have been better.</li>
            <li>That is if I wanted to waste more of my money and get another cheap dryer that would not last even a year!</li>
            <li>My fine, thin hair gets way too much static build-up from this model.</li>
            <li>I had an older model that looked just like this but was gray.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my 20 year old misty tone 1500 - it is really not any better at all.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer lasted maybe two weeks after which time it sounded like something broke internally and was quickly followed by a burning smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Replaced older model that I had had for over 5 years.</li>
            <li>I always bought this particular model at Wal Mart.  </li>
            <li>I use this blow dryer at least 4x/week and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a little over a year, and all of a sudden it just stopped blowing hot, or even warm air.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      </li>
            <li>Feels like you&#x27;re in a wind tunnel at high speed.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>This one dries super fast and my hair is left soft and isn&#x27;t frizzy.</li>
            <li>It is litterally the same exact dryer!</li>
            <li>worked ok for a little while, then the power and heat went out.</li>
            <li>The construction of this hair dryer is very cheap and even if the one I received was just a defect, I don&#x27;t think it would last very long if it did work at all.</li>
            <li>Speed - the highest speed is adequate, but it&#x27;s not as fast as my old Vidal Sasson hair dryer (RIP, old friend)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this to anyone who needs a basic hair dryer for not a lot of money, and if past experience can be repeated, this thing could last you a good half decade or more, depending on how often you knock yours off the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>and it last long like 3years or maybe more.</li>
            <li>The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  </li>
            <li>This is worth it especially the price!</li>
            <li>Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don&#x27;t have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  </li>
            <li>I do have some problem though to set the right side of my hair using my left hand.  </li>
            <li>I immediately returned it and got my money back right away.</li>
            <li>secondly the controls are right by my hand</li>
            <li>The first thing I did after pulling the new hair dryer out of its box was to adhere the back cover to the main body of the dryer using some heavy-duty tape.  </li>
            <li>The endcap was not in the box and the other two accessories didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>The only reason that I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it&#x27;s pretty noisy on the high setting which I use a lot.</li>
            <li>Just bought a new $20.00 one at Walmart and even it has a  2 year guarantee on it.</li>
            <li>so I use it as it is until my new one arrives.</li>
            <li>and I am going to have to buy a new one</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m debating on buying a new one.</li>
            <li>My new one didn&#x27;t so I ended up throwing it away and getting a Revlon Turbo 1875.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I could have purchased a more expensive model and felt justified</li>
            <li>It has several different settings available.  </li>
            <li>Very loud and sounds like an afterburner out of an F-16.</li>
            <li>It is very loud as I think one reviewer stated.  </li>
            <li>Works as described, but is very loud.</li>
            <li>so I use it very frequently.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like what is pictured with the exception of the writing, which is white on my model.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried the dryer only one setting worked</li>
            <li>so I am sure it would hurt someone, particularly a small child.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a minute before I heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in, the coils inside were turning red hot</li>
            <li>When the item first arrived, the back lid (air vent) didn&#x27;t close all the way</li>
            <li>and it still works on the same way as the first day.</li>
            <li>Also, I thought the diffuser was going to be bigger, but it does its job pretty well as it is.</li>
            <li>Unfortunatley, since I had that thing for 7-8 years, they don&#x27;t appear to make the EXACT same model, but this one comes</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality hair dryer that works for all hair types.</li>
            <li>Hope it will work fine, though the noise seems to bother me a little.</li>
            <li>I dry my hair on the high hot setting.</li>
            <li>This was a purchase to replace my old dryer - which was the exact same brand/type - of nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li>if it last half as long I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>My old one was boring gray, so I really enjoy the new bright colorful look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quiet, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t have that loud buzzy/high frequency noise some dryers have.  </li>
            <li>This model is a little heavier, but it dries quickly and that is my main requirement for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully to dry my hair without the frizz and dryness of most other brands that I have tried (even ones that say they are &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The outlet was tripped but still intact, the fire dept said it was clearly a wiring issue within the hairdryer itself.  </li>
            <li>it was oval as the picture wasn&#x27;t too clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble with this one.</li>
            <li>I was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument, tried out different options, nothing would work.</li>
            <li>I have very short, straight, thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I have a one year old and do not have time to fool around with drying my hair</li>
            <li>Wow they just don&#x27;t make them like they used to.&lt;br /&gt;Previous hair dryer lasted 10+ years.  </li>
            <li>we are trying to go eat from him, I would just not bother drying and curling my hair and instead would just rock my natural fro</li>
            <li>This would not be the case if the back cover had not broken and been tossed years ago.  </li>
            <li>My old blow dryer broke</li>
            <li>Too much power even on low.</li>
            <li>old Revlon</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find this hair dryer lived up to it&#x27;s claims.  </li>
            <li>My daughter have natural hair</li>
            <li>I really like the different setting for the heat and the speed.</li>
            <li>Fast forward almost 7 years later</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t bring myself to do it since my old one still works.</li>
            <li>I ordered this the end of December and its completely stopped working the end of February.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;this dryer leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I therefore ordered this model that looks a lot like my old one.  </li>
            <li>but it behaves like my old one.  </li>
            <li>Kinda loud</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I pushed the button on the plug to reset the dyrer and it turned back on for a few more seconds of drying then shut off.</li>
            <li>I have had an ionic dryer many years ago and had trouble finding one that actually works as they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li>I needed a full size dryer because I have long hair and it gets caught in the air intake of the lighter weight, smaller travel versions.  </li>
            <li>Started it out on low/warm for a few minutes to make sure it worked properly.</li>
            <li>This dryer does a good job and wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li>After heating hair, cool it down before removing the hair from the brush and the curl lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I think it does dry faster, but my old machine was pretty worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does dry sections quickly, but not quickly enough for my hair type.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I am a creature of habit, but when I dropped my old Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (for probably the 500th time) and broke the back cage off, I just wanted to replace it with the same exact model.  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer to replace a virtually identical but much older Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (the VS781),which had finally stopped working after probably a decade.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I did next day morning was to ship this back to Amazon and got a Conair Ion Shine Ceramic 1875.</li>
            <li>Even the low setting is way too high for my hair.</li>
            <li>some other dryers I have blow too fast on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many other 1875w dryers and this one was a bit louder than my previous ones.</li>
            <li>but with this new dryer I can do my hair and still get out of the house quickly (relatively, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This replaced my very old Sassoon Quiet Dryer.</li>
            <li>It makes drying my thick head of hair a rather extensive process with having to turn it off, let it cool down, and then reset the surge protector, which otherwise works fine.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I reordered it from Amazon and the price was definitely less expensive than the store bought one.  </li>
            <li>I have long dark hair that is prone to grease, this dryer makes my hair manageable and makes it feel clean.</li>
            <li>Got it to replace a 20 year old dryer that was on its last leg.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too early to comment on whether it&#x27;s built to last -</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like it is too loud-</li>
            <li>And make ur hair has a style, by the way I have a thick but smooth wavy hair</li>
            <li>She hates loud noises like this and the vacuum</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the concetrator falls off really easily.</li>
            <li>It died and I wanted to replace it because this was the only dryer I had found that was powerful enough to dry my thick hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It dries my thick, wavy hair quickly and leaves it shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Not too heavy, buttons in the right place</li>
            <li>It looks like it at first glance, but it does not have the ionizer function that the look-alike previously sold on Amazon had.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as it used to, but never the less.</li>
            <li>Does not supply as much heat as reported by other reviews.</li>
            <li>This dryer lasts much longer then any other hair dryer I have used.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t bought a new dryer in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Vidal Sassoon digital dryer, which is no longer being made, that finally went out.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that the concentrator is remains stationary which means I must turn the dryer to direct the flow of air, but it&#x27;s not a big issue.  </li>
            <li>And now the last and &amp; most frustrating feature of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s my very long hair dry fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it often on myself because my hair gets overly dry from blow drying frequently</li>
            <li>Color - my old one was grey, but this red is kinda</li>
            <li>&quot; setting is not quite hot enough for me since I style my hair with a round metal brush while drying, but it still works o.k.  </li>
            <li>I had the same hair dryer a few years ago and it got hot.  </li>
            <li>They are light weight but weak dryers.  </li>
            <li>the diffuser&#x27;s teeth are not long enough for us curly headed girls.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair in half the time of my old professional hair dryer.</li>
            <li>For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I&#x27;ve got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn&#x27;t benefit from a strong airflow.  </li>
            <li>I have thin, fine blond hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly straight, but some dryers manage to make it look a little frizzy, which is a mystery to me.  </li>
            <li>I did not realize how large and heavy it is compared to my last salon dryer.</li>

            <li> The price is good for the amount of use I get from it in that time.  </li>
            <li> so you aren&#x27;t accidentally hitting them all the time and good power.  </li>
            <li> Also good for drying craft projects and clothes.</li>

            <li> (I had a gift card), but I&#x27;ve been very happy with this economical option.  </li>
            <li> If I had wavy or curly hair, the diffuser would be used more, but it&#x27;s a great option as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still a Great Deal, Love my Hair Dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for almost a year now, and I love it, it works great, not any issues with it at all, and</li>

            <li> it works on any kind of hair and gets the job done fast love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I did receive it on that date, but it would have been nice</li>
            <li> The diffuser is a joke - you might as well blow on your own hair.  </li>
            <li> Since I have some curl to my hair, it&#x27;s nice to have the diffuser that fits the dryer.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, and the finger diffuser is perfect for dryer my hair without messing up my curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used and liked Vidal Sassoon dryers, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I do my own wash and set</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice inexpensive hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I liked the dryer...while it worked.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have had so far.  </li>
            <li> far I have been very happy with this blow drier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited about this dryer because it was cheap, included the accessories I needed and looked to be good quality from the description and reviews, but I guess not!</li>
            <li> I find it easy to use and very effective and easy to move around.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li> , it looks pretty sophisticated with beautiful controls for just 13.28 dollars + tax.</li>
            <li> This dryer worked great when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> the shipment was great, it was extremely fast!</li>
            <li> so holding it while drying is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This came quickly, and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> Strong airflow and nice setting options.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer looks elegant, of very light weight.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this Vidal Sassoon dryer.</li>
            <li> and I love the diffuser attachment for my curls.</li>
            <li> but I am sure it works well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably okay for the price.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it as the best in the market now and one of the strongest hair dryers!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck.</li>
            <li> Bought this model for its separate heat and speed controls, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I will be returning it and for just a couple of dollars more getting a better one.</li>
            <li> Nothing better</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> This was OK with me.  </li>
            <li> for many years.  </li>

            <li> Excellent article, very low price and ussesfull.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> If it lasts 6 - 12 months I will be well satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am highly pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love the color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the purchase....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok dryer, but defiantly not durable.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this more than I do.  </li>
            <li> In the winter I do tend to get static in my hair, so I decided to buy this model with the ionizing feature.  </li>
            <li> oh my I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> Plus it has been 7 years, I have moved and travelled many many times, and it has not gone out on me.  </li>
            <li> (although I could&#x27;ve used 6 inches more, but..)</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> get some more..</li>
            <li> love it love</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this hair dryer for many years and like the amount of heat and air flow options.  </li>
            <li> Favorite hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine creates wacky sculptures</li>
            <li> ok but heavey&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s extremely light which makes it very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in order to use it when I moved, I tried it and it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> So excited they are still making it!  </li>
            <li> The filter is also very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Also, buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks, it looks stylish in the image, but looks cheap in reality.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL, GOOD GRIP.</li>
            <li> The cap falls off too easily.</li>
            <li> The attachments easily fall off.</li>
            <li> Well yes, it does come off for easy cleaning alright</li>
            <li> front pieces fall off too easy and often.</li>
            <li> This dryer does not blow strong.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product almost a year ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive hair dryer, this thing was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> The blow drier is not too noisy and the temperature settings, warm and hot do the job.  </li>
            <li> I love the cool feature on this dryer.</li>
            <li> It works perfect and is very hot to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s just fine for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have fine thinning hair.</li>
            <li> It was fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their hair dryers are the best so far almost professional!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been using!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really huge though.</li>
            <li> Love the bright red color too.</li>
            <li> I read a review today and in October another woman experienced the same thing I did.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t lose it in a drawer if you can fit it in one.</li>
            <li> Also it is light and well balanced</li>
            <li> Great dryer especially for the price.    </li>
            <li> It is light weight but is not made with quality material it is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m cheap, so I bought this instead</li>
            <li> great color is red!</li>
            <li> Before I was using a cheap Revlon dryer, but this one is by far better quality, more efficient, and better for my hair.</li>
            <li> tried a SalonSalon hair dryer at a friends house which was fabulous - turns out</li>
            <li> Maybe if it had a comb attachment to it would have been more useful but just not for me.</li>
            <li> The diffuser didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold and a fantastic deal</li>
            <li> It feels like cheap flimsy plastic to the touch</li>
            <li> He seems to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This is nothing but a cheap piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold -</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far it is a good product.</li>
            <li> SHE LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER MORE THAN THE ONE IVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST,WHICH WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE.THIS</li>
            <li> Seems to be good so far.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some reviewers, I find the temperature separation between cool - warm - hot good, with each setting producing noticeable but not extreme temperature change.</li>
            <li> The cool shot button also works well, and is easy to use and hold in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This VS hair dryer is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful and does not burn my hair</li>
            <li> They took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item.</li>
            <li> Very strong and fast.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s already got my money&#x27;s worth out of it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s pretty fabulous!</li>
            <li> The dryer is light weight and full of options.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, a good product for the money!</li>
            <li> It is happening more and more frequently now.</li>
            <li> The back cover comes off for easy cleaning and it does, nicely and the screen is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Strong and powerful.</li>
            <li> He gets a bath every week and using the high speed with the warm setting he drys really quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a tried and true model by Vidal Sassoon.  </li>
            <li> Works well and looks really cool also</li>
            <li> so I guess its true</li>
            <li> and I cannot say enough good about this product.  </li>
            <li> The temperature and output controls are fantastic;  it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> But regardless, this hair dryer is good enough to not make me want to buy another one just yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to handle, has several settings available, and the accessories are easy to attach.  </li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  </li>
            <li> Quick drying but still leaves my frizzy</li>
            <li> and I needed a quick replacement.  </li>
            <li> people may need more power, for me it is more than enough!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good hair dryer for most people, but my hair is very fine and flyaway wispy, so I am personally unhappy with it .  </li>
            <li> Pretty Cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It has the option to turn the ions on and off which helps in a good blow dry.</li>
            <li> Not bad, does a good job but feels a little cheap.</li>
            <li> I turned the heat setting down to warm and was able to finish drying my hair.</li>
            <li> the exact one we wanted!</li>
            <li> My fine hair just wants to frizz since I don&#x27;t use &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; to control it and this dryer hasn&#x27;t done anything to solve the problem.</li>
            <li> thanks for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Thank you for having this available for me to purchase at a decent price!</li>
            <li> In person it is a much darker red, not as bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for a few months, then shorted out and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser and friends laugh at me when I tell them about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading a review about it on another website, and figured it was worth a try since it was so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> It is ok, but not like the old one.</li>
            <li> I use it on warm and low</li>
            <li> I unplug everything else from it when using the dryer… which I didn&#x27;t have to do before, but now if I don&#x27;t, the dryer shuts off even more frequently.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it would do for thicker hair, but it is neither too hot or too cool.</li>
            <li> I use the warm, low setting for my hair, and the results are great--smooth, non frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the second Vidal Sassoon of this kind I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> This replaced a smaller Vidal Sassoon hair dryer which I really liked, but it broke.  </li>
            <li> works great so far and comes with the extra parts (which i haven&#x27;t yet used).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s too powerful either.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is definitely worth</li>
            <li> For the price it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it was marked high, but blew out and temp wise was more like low.  </li>
            <li> but this gets my hair dry quickly and comes with a diffuser attachment, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I disposed it right away.</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s the job done with the right amount of heat setting.</li>
            <li> It has 2 heat settings and a hot and warm mode for drying and setting respectively.</li>
            <li> love that there is an actual setting for cool air plus the button for a shot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it, keeps the frizz down and LOVE the attachments.</li>
            <li> This particular dryer is very powerful, yet lighter weight than others I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair in under 5 minutes, it&#x27;s light and easy to handle, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and the ruby red color brightens my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you are not careful you will be drying on warm instead of high.  </li>
            <li> The concentrated hair drying attachment that was stated in the description of the product as coming off for easy cleaning, unlike most other models.  </li>
            <li> The price seemed reasonable and it was a quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> Since this is Spring, the air has had enough humidity that I have not yet been able to figure out if this feature is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if I use the Warm setting it takes a century to dry it</li>
            <li> This model&#x27;s high setting is a good speed and allows you to dry your hair without it blowing all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I expected more from this product !</li>
            <li> Still dries very fast.</li>
            <li> I turned it on for only 30 seconds and it quickly overheated and turned bright orange inside and could potentially have caught on fire.</li>
            <li> A funny thing though.</li>
            <li> I had this same hair dryer for many years (10+) that I burned out the motor.</li>
            <li> This is the first hair dryer that I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time yesterday and the dryer shut off halfway through the drying process.</li>
            <li> I know it is because of the safety feature that turns it off once it is too hot.</li>
            <li> I recently bought 2 more in case the manufacturer decides to stop production.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the Diffuser, so I sold it on Ebay and the hair dryer paid for itself  ;-)</li>
            <li> I have had to change it back as many as 20 times in one hair drying session.  </li>
            <li> Was happy to change to this hair dryer after my former one (another brand beginning with R which I&#x27;d only had for a year) started sparking so much</li>
            <li> Update 4 1/2 months later - hairdryer stopped, glowed, and then didn&#x27;t work any more.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but I&#x27;ve been using it just over a year</li>
            <li> The hot setting is almost too hot, so I use medium.</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I replaced.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> Works so fast!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, this is my third one.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get in the red color.</li>
            <li> yesterday it smelled funny and stopped heating.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted six years.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with it and will buy the same brand again..</li>
            <li> , so I have to use the Hot setting.</li>
            <li> first of all exellent shipping got here fast&lt;</li>
            <li> I had a similar dryer that lasted many years until I dropped it on the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li> pretty close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- 3 heat settings - and the &amp;#34;very hot&amp;#34; is actually hot enough&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know I have purchased  5 in total and 3 are functional which includes my latest purchase.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, although I rarely use it, as styled hair is not a priority for me.</li>
            <li> So far, in the month that I have had this dryer, it has NEVER disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I used HIGH warm speed to blow dry then used Medium Hot to style my BOB.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, easy to handle and quick to dry.</li>
            <li> It is super light and dries my long hair in minutes.</li>
            <li> I love the multi settings to dry your hair and it was exactly what I was looking for as a gift for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> It works great and has the same specs as my other model.</li>
            <li> I really need to rethink the length of my hair, too much work!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li> This dryer offers all the options you need and delivers the good solid service in an almost professional manner.  </li>
            <li> Description says full size dryer but could have a little more power.</li>
            <li> The back filter piece comes off too easily.</li>
            <li> and I really like it because the high setting speed is just right for styling your hair...</li>
            <li> , I would certainly buy this hair dryer again.  </li>
            <li> This blower has large shoes to fill.</li>
            <li> Certainly recommend others to buy!very trustworthy.</li>
            <li> That one is great for thick hair like mine!</li>
            <li> Other dryers suck my wifes hair into the intake, very fine hair.</li>
            <li> They blow a decent hot air which saves u time  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27; s a pretty decent hair drier for the price.</li>
            <li> Very high powered drying with 3 heat settings, and 3 power settings.  </li>
            <li> And I did try other brands, which I returned, as no other dryer ever got hot enough to straighten my frizzy hair, so I&#x27;m really glad I was able to find an exact match here.</li>
            <li> Out of nowhere, it would not blow hot air if it is on high.</li>
            <li> It also comes with the curl enhancer which helps in creating voluminous natural waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by how light it is</li>
            <li> The cold shot button is great for syling too!</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but it gets the job done</li>
            <li> Really like the way it streamlines the air.  </li>
            <li> I think, for a few bucks more, you can do smaller and better</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> With much expectation, I opened the item just to find out it would not work.</li>
            <li> and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> This one, not so much.</li>
            <li> FOR MY WIFE WITCH HAS A LOT OF HAIR AND IS VERY PICKY ON WHAT SHE USES FOR IT.</li>
            <li> I would recommend if it is reasonably priced</li>
            <li> recommend this dryer highly!  </li>
            <li> light weight but enough drying power.  </li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the concept of &amp;#34;Ceramic&amp;#34; hair dryer (I thought</li>
            <li> The color is much prettier here on Amazon than in person.  </li>
            <li> Also I use it on my daughters with much thinner hair and also on cooler setting</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It makes my hair straight.</li>
            <li> but I expected more.</li>
            <li> Really crappy dryer.</li>
            <li> Highly  recommend!</li>
            <li> it came really fast, she loves it</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> But I guess you can&#x27;t really expect that for around twenty bucks.</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really owned another blow dryer</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the diffuser does much, but I really don&#x27;t care about that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very much appreciated around here.  </li>
            <li> But if you are counting on getting the whole enchillada --check the box as soon as it comes in.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and I really want to return this item！I</li>
            <li> works well drys hair fast</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use and does not strain my arm as much as other heavier dryers.</li>
            <li> My old dryer quit working---so had to wait for you to prepare shipment--whatever that is!!!</li>
            <li> Update: after using this hair drier for 2 years, one day the handle got super hot and red and burnt smell started coming out of it.</li>
            <li> The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn&#x27;t get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as most other dryers.      </li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, I would recommend looking for a hair dryer with a high, medium and low.</li>
            <li> I like that it has several heat settings, although the high heat isn&#x27;t super hot.  </li>
            <li> Her hair looks much healthier too, since we replaced the older, non-ionic hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The attachments go on hard and the finger diff-user is just so large that it really can&#x27;t be used effectively.  </li>
            <li> A little bigger than expected but works perfect and dries hair in seconds..</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but overall it works great.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t effect the ability to connect the attachments; though I wonder how long this will work?  </li>
            <li> I was looking at much more expensive dryers, and I really don&#x27;t think one of them would have been better.</li>
            <li> That is if I wanted to waste more of my money and get another cheap dryer that would not last even a year!</li>
            <li> My fine, thin hair gets way too much static build-up from this model.</li>
            <li> I had an older model that looked just like this but was gray.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my 20 year old misty tone 1500 - it is really not any better at all.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer lasted maybe two weeks after which time it sounded like something broke internally and was quickly followed by a burning smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replaced older model that I had had for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> I always bought this particular model at Wal Mart.  </li>
            <li> I use this blow dryer at least 4x/week and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a little over a year, and all of a sudden it just stopped blowing hot, or even warm air.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      </li>
            <li> Feels like you&#x27;re in a wind tunnel at high speed.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This one dries super fast and my hair is left soft and isn&#x27;t frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is litterally the same exact dryer!</li>
            <li> worked ok for a little while, then the power and heat went out.</li>
            <li> The construction of this hair dryer is very cheap and even if the one I received was just a defect, I don&#x27;t think it would last very long if it did work at all.</li>
            <li> Speed - the highest speed is adequate, but it&#x27;s not as fast as my old Vidal Sasson hair dryer (RIP, old friend)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this to anyone who needs a basic hair dryer for not a lot of money, and if past experience can be repeated, this thing could last you a good half decade or more, depending on how often you knock yours off the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> and it last long like 3years or maybe more.</li>
            <li> The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  </li>
            <li> This is worth it especially the price!</li>
            <li> Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don&#x27;t have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  </li>
            <li> I do have some problem though to set the right side of my hair using my left hand.  </li>
            <li> I immediately returned it and got my money back right away.</li>
            <li> secondly the controls are right by my hand</li>
            <li> The first thing I did after pulling the new hair dryer out of its box was to adhere the back cover to the main body of the dryer using some heavy-duty tape.  </li>
            <li> The endcap was not in the box and the other two accessories didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> The only reason that I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it&#x27;s pretty noisy on the high setting which I use a lot.</li>
            <li> Just bought a new $20.00 one at Walmart and even it has a  2 year guarantee on it.</li>
            <li> so I use it as it is until my new one arrives.</li>
            <li> and I am going to have to buy a new one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m debating on buying a new one.</li>
            <li> My new one didn&#x27;t so I ended up throwing it away and getting a Revlon Turbo 1875.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I could have purchased a more expensive model and felt justified</li>
            <li> It has several different settings available.  </li>
            <li> Very loud and sounds like an afterburner out of an F-16.</li>
            <li> It is very loud as I think one reviewer stated.  </li>
            <li> Works as described, but is very loud.</li>
            <li> so I use it very frequently.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like what is pictured with the exception of the writing, which is white on my model.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried the dryer only one setting worked</li>
            <li> so I am sure it would hurt someone, particularly a small child.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a minute before I heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in, the coils inside were turning red hot</li>
            <li> When the item first arrived, the back lid (air vent) didn&#x27;t close all the way</li>
            <li> and it still works on the same way as the first day.</li>
            <li> Also, I thought the diffuser was going to be bigger, but it does its job pretty well as it is.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatley, since I had that thing for 7-8 years, they don&#x27;t appear to make the EXACT same model, but this one comes</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality hair dryer that works for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Hope it will work fine, though the noise seems to bother me a little.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair on the high hot setting.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase to replace my old dryer - which was the exact same brand/type - of nearly 10 years.</li>
            <li> if it last half as long I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> My old one was boring gray, so I really enjoy the new bright colorful look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quiet, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t have that loud buzzy/high frequency noise some dryers have.  </li>
            <li> This model is a little heavier, but it dries quickly and that is my main requirement for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully to dry my hair without the frizz and dryness of most other brands that I have tried (even ones that say they are &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The outlet was tripped but still intact, the fire dept said it was clearly a wiring issue within the hairdryer itself.  </li>
            <li> it was oval as the picture wasn&#x27;t too clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no trouble with this one.</li>
            <li> I was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument, tried out different options, nothing would work.</li>
            <li> I have very short, straight, thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have a one year old and do not have time to fool around with drying my hair</li>
            <li> Wow they just don&#x27;t make them like they used to.&lt;br /&gt;Previous hair dryer lasted 10+ years.  </li>
            <li> we are trying to go eat from him, I would just not bother drying and curling my hair and instead would just rock my natural fro</li>
            <li> This would not be the case if the back cover had not broken and been tossed years ago.  </li>
            <li> My old blow dryer broke</li>
            <li> Too much power even on low.</li>
            <li> old Revlon</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this hair dryer lived up to it&#x27;s claims.  </li>
            <li> My daughter have natural hair</li>
            <li> I really like the different setting for the heat and the speed.</li>
            <li> Fast forward almost 7 years later</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t bring myself to do it since my old one still works.</li>
            <li> I ordered this the end of December and its completely stopped working the end of February.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this dryer leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I therefore ordered this model that looks a lot like my old one.  </li>
            <li> but it behaves like my old one.  </li>
            <li> Kinda loud</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I pushed the button on the plug to reset the dyrer and it turned back on for a few more seconds of drying then shut off.</li>
            <li> I have had an ionic dryer many years ago and had trouble finding one that actually works as they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> I needed a full size dryer because I have long hair and it gets caught in the air intake of the lighter weight, smaller travel versions.  </li>
            <li> Started it out on low/warm for a few minutes to make sure it worked properly.</li>
            <li> This dryer does a good job and wasn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li> After heating hair, cool it down before removing the hair from the brush and the curl lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I think it does dry faster, but my old machine was pretty worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does dry sections quickly, but not quickly enough for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am a creature of habit, but when I dropped my old Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (for probably the 500th time) and broke the back cage off, I just wanted to replace it with the same exact model.  </li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace a virtually identical but much older Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (the VS781),which had finally stopped working after probably a decade.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I did next day morning was to ship this back to Amazon and got a Conair Ion Shine Ceramic 1875.</li>
            <li> Even the low setting is way too high for my hair.</li>
            <li> some other dryers I have blow too fast on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many other 1875w dryers and this one was a bit louder than my previous ones.</li>
            <li> but with this new dryer I can do my hair and still get out of the house quickly (relatively, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This replaced my very old Sassoon Quiet Dryer.</li>
            <li> It makes drying my thick head of hair a rather extensive process with having to turn it off, let it cool down, and then reset the surge protector, which otherwise works fine.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I reordered it from Amazon and the price was definitely less expensive than the store bought one.  </li>
            <li> I have long dark hair that is prone to grease, this dryer makes my hair manageable and makes it feel clean.</li>
            <li> Got it to replace a 20 year old dryer that was on its last leg.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too early to comment on whether it&#x27;s built to last -</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like it is too loud-</li>
            <li> And make ur hair has a style, by the way I have a thick but smooth wavy hair</li>
            <li> She hates loud noises like this and the vacuum</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the concetrator falls off really easily.</li>
            <li> It died and I wanted to replace it because this was the only dryer I had found that was powerful enough to dry my thick hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It dries my thick, wavy hair quickly and leaves it shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> Not too heavy, buttons in the right place</li>
            <li> It looks like it at first glance, but it does not have the ionizer function that the look-alike previously sold on Amazon had.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as it used to, but never the less.</li>
            <li> Does not supply as much heat as reported by other reviews.</li>
            <li> This dryer lasts much longer then any other hair dryer I have used.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought a new dryer in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Vidal Sassoon digital dryer, which is no longer being made, that finally went out.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that the concentrator is remains stationary which means I must turn the dryer to direct the flow of air, but it&#x27;s not a big issue.  </li>
            <li> And now the last and &amp; most frustrating feature of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s my very long hair dry fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often on myself because my hair gets overly dry from blow drying frequently</li>
            <li> Color - my old one was grey, but this red is kinda</li>
            <li> &quot; setting is not quite hot enough for me since I style my hair with a round metal brush while drying, but it still works o.k.  </li>
            <li> I had the same hair dryer a few years ago and it got hot.  </li>
            <li> They are light weight but weak dryers.  </li>
            <li> the diffuser&#x27;s teeth are not long enough for us curly headed girls.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in half the time of my old professional hair dryer.</li>
            <li> For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I&#x27;ve got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn&#x27;t benefit from a strong airflow.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, fine blond hair</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly straight, but some dryers manage to make it look a little frizzy, which is a mystery to me.  </li>
            <li> I did not realize how large and heavy it is compared to my last salon dryer.</li>
            <li> This new version is definitely not as powerful.  </li>
            <li> but I like it for when I need my thick hair to dry quickly.</li>
            <li> I can get the blow look with a low heat setting on my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Then, if I want to put it back on, I have to wait at least 5 minutes, because it is too hot to touch.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (like to the middle of my back)</li>
            <li> The last time it fell off the dryer and inside the toilet</li>
            <li> and they last a long time, pumping out high, low and medium heat predictably day after day.  </li>
            <li> Hair dryers don&#x27;t last forever, you have to get a new one every few years.</li>
            <li> The settings for the hot and cold on this are right at the finger tips where you hold the dryer.  </li>
            <li> The hottest setting isn&#x27;t too hot and the cold setting is just right.</li>
            <li> But we just didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to hunt around in local stores to find a replacement for the one we&#x27;d had for so long.</li>
            <li> something in the $30 - $40 range which will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Hope this one last as long</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> like that this blow drier has an extra long cord and an outlet safety switch.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty thick and this dryer dries my hair in under 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super shiny today probably due to the wind tunnel effect, and got dry in 5 minutes when it usually takes 10.  </li>
            <li> Bought a new hair dryer a few years ago and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> the new one cost less than the shipping costs!</li>
            <li> I guess what do you want for a cheap dryer, but I hoped it would last a little bit longer at the very least.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly to dry my curls without frizz &amp; in half the time of my old hairdryer...perfect size and weight for me.  </li>
            <li> I seriously have the thickest most ridiculously hard to dry hair</li>
            <li> of the way the dryer is built, the attachment pieces cannot be twisted to an angle I&#x27;m comfortable with.</li>
            <li> I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> and it is not nearly satisfactory for me, so</li>
            <li> As long as my wife loves it...</li>
            <li> We used to have a professional hair dryer but to heavy</li>
            <li> I did notice that it hesitated to turn on for a half second before we used it for the last time.</li>
            <li> Just only use about one and half month, when I was using it and the Dryer stopped working suddenly.</li>
            <li> and I can get my whole head done in under 10 minutes, I mean</li>
            <li> It does not take long to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> (except for the color) I have long hair &amp; it dries my hair in about 5min!</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d bring back the other one.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish they&#x27;d change is make the plug a little smaller</li>
            <li> Due to the grill malfunction I only gave this product 4 stars - otherwise this would have been a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> and I manage to dry my hair with only one hand, while combing with the other hand.</li>
            <li> / storing it is a very, very minor issue.</li>
            <li> Then again, I bought the product to dry my hair, and hanging</li>
            <li> I literally get my hair dry in 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry in no time at all.  </li>
            <li> You start wondering why its not getting dry.  </li>
            <li> so its all it easier to come her hair when it&#x27;s blow dry</li>
            <li> Still take a loooong time to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmm If you have a lot of hair to blow dry</li>
            <li> I do NOT blow dry my hair every day, maybe once or twice a week....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll dry your hair eventually</li>
            <li> I just received it today and tried it out this evening to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair that tends to split ends</li>
            <li> the dry damaged hair look go away.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t  use it to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Everyone is using it to dry their hair.</li>
            <li> This model has a cold button that comes in handy when setting curls and waves with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> , maybe I&#x27;ll spend a few extra dollars on one that will last....</li>
            <li> My only complaints so far, it is a little heavy for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing crazy special, but it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I set it down on a table and left for the day.</li>
            <li> it gets plenty hot but doesn&#x27;t blow too hard so that I can style with a round brush while drying.  </li>
            <li> Lasted almost a year and a half with regular use.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because my previous conair hair dryer short circuited and wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Now it takes only five minutes to dry my hair (long and thick Asian hair)!</li>
            <li> I considered shelling out some serious cash to buy a high end blow-dryer</li>
            <li> so you can plug in two appliances (e.g. hairdryer and straightener) at the same time in a tight space.</li>
            <li> cause they all seem to have a very limited life span.  </li>
            <li> No need to waste your hard earned cash on a high end dryer; this one does the job!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer seemed to be just what I wanted, but was a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the concentrator does not swivel, causing me to twist my hand while holding it, instead of moving the concentrator into a different position.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that fluff&#x27;s up your hair, I have not mastered using it yet.</li>
            <li> It is not very intuitive with the design of the shape.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s colored which makes it harder to blow!&lt;br</li>
            <li> An unknown carrier called Ensenda was chosen to deliver this to me.</li>
            <li> But it is missing the crucial ionizer feature.</li>
            <li> I expected an Ion Select dryer, but got a tourmaline ceramic model instead.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected .</li>
            <li> When I returned a few hours later, it had melted into an unrecognizable puddle.</li>
            <li> One thing i didn&#x27;t like is that the concentrator can only be put one one way (like in the pic) because the opening is oval rather than round, i had a feeling</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> Not much to say</li>
            <li> but I also have thick, naturally kiny-curly (4a/b) hair.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine, and I noticed it&#x27;s not as loud and annoying as some other one&#x27;s my wife had before!</li>
            <li> I bought this other one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two other hair dryers died in one week.  </li>
            <li> It worked like every other blow dryer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Other than that</li>
            <li> It would have lasted longer if I wasn&#x27;t so rough with it!  </li>
            <li> There are no exposed screws on which my hair can get caught, as there were on other dryers I&#x27;ve tried to use.  </li>
            <li> not sure what someone with thicker hair would do.&lt;br /&gt;Im not returning it because I bought it for 2nd home and will stash in the guest bath.  </li>
            <li> I had my other Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for 22 years.</li>
            <li> STILL use this hair dryer, it&#x27;s crazy because I&#x27;ve not realized how fast time flies!!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer she cannot destroy in a very limited period of time has yet to be invented.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the \\&quot;hot\\</li>
            <li> It is average</li>
            <li> The dryer is not powerful at all</li>
            <li> Heavier and clumsy to use, but the ion as well as defusier does work well with short hair.....</li>
            <li> Not worth paying return shipping</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the concentrator nossle falls off and goes flying across the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn&#x27;t have this issue.         </li>
            <li> My last dryer took FOR.EV.ER so to avoid getting stared down by my husband and watching the hate build in his eyes because I was taking so long to get ready and thus withholding whatever meal</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is that the hanging loop built into the cord is very small, and it requires that I install a new hanger for the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This is not the dryer of previous years.</li>
            <li> I am replacing my previous model because the motor is burning out.  </li>
            <li> I had it less than 24 hours and literally one use and it is gone.</li>
            <li> So basically, I do half my hair with the concentrator on the blow dryer, and once it falls off (cause it always does)</li>
            <li> If you held the cord where it attached to the base at just the right angle it would work again, so the dryer itself was actually still kicking after 7 years.</li>
            <li> It dries great and doesn&#x27;t make weird noises or show sparks or do any of the weird scary thing some of my others have.</li>
            <li> Blows hot and cold.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, unbelievable dryer for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical about this new ION technology, but I&#x27;m now a believer.</li>
            <li> It still takes at least 10-15 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this for anyone that has thick hair that takes a while to dry like mine.</li>
            <li> Previously had one which I had bought at the store a few years ago and the switch broke.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> It does the job well, but it is a little heavier than I&#x27;d like it to be.  </li>
            <li> Little power and the attachment popped off all 3 times I used it before returning it without any effort while drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> The cold air button is key, and so is the different speed settings.</li>
            <li> I also really like the 3 temp settings, the cold shot button, the weight, and the color.</li>
            <li> I have had a few of them</li>
            <li> Bought this model a few years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few years</li>
            <li> It lasted for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> The filter cover broke off after a few months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> I had this hair dryer for approximately seven years before it finally broke.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the ions do anything, that seems a little gimmicky.</li>
            <li> I have medium, long, thick, wave hair!</li>
            <li> I find the handle to be a little bit on the small size.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to find a decent priced dryer with 3 heat settings and a cold blast.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li> Not sure about claims of controlling frizziness.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is a few inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 Conair dryers which have failed me in the last couple of years....</li>
            <li> That I could deal with but that was just one small detail.  </li>
            <li> I have tried buying expensive dryers thinking they would last longer.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if this would happen with any model that has the cap separately.</li>
            <li> does its job but looks small</li>
            <li> My old blow dryer was really bad, so I looked up to read a lot of reviews.</li>
            <li> This switch does tend to block the outlet above it, so some people may find this a bit inconvenient on a crowded bathroom electrical plug setup (I just installed a power strip on my bathroom</li>
            <li> Not safe!</li>
            <li> It makes it a bit difficult to style my bangs, because i usually have the narrow tip extension facing vertically, not horizontally.</li>
            <li> and I was in serious need of finding this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon that it forced me out of a pathetic choice.</li>
            <li> The plastic is weak.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but whenever i use it theres a weird smell that comes out.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than others and does just what I wanted it to do!</li>
            <li> nothing worse.</li>
            <li> It was broken.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, and it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> Lightweight - so your arm won&#x27;t get tired holding it&lt;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it. Works great doesnt over heat! Perfect buy!</li>
            <li> Love the dryer. A funny thing though. I have short hair and the attachment that fluff&#x27;s up your hair, I have not mastered using it yet. I am afraid I will knock  myself out. My hairdresser and friends laugh at me when I tell them about it. Otherwise, easy to handle and quick to dry.</li>
            <li> I had this same hair dryer for many years (10+) that I burned out the motor. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon! It is litterally the same exact dryer! (except for the color) I have long hair &amp; it dries my hair in about 5min! The cold shot button is great for syling too!</li>
            <li> I love this Vidal Sassoon dryer. Do not be fooled by its size and &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34;. It is super light and dries my long hair in minutes. It has 2 heat settings and a hot and warm mode for drying and setting respectively. It has the option to turn the ions on and off which helps in a good blow dry. It comes with the nozzle attachment for focussed drying and prevention of frizzies. It also comes with the curl enhancer which helps in creating voluminous natural waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by how light it is and I manage to dry my hair with only one hand, while combing with the other hand.</li>
            <li> This is the first hair dryer that I&#x27;ve ever owned so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but it gets the job done and I love the diffuser attachment for my curls. Great product.</li>
            <li> Very high powered drying with 3 heat settings, and 3 power settings.  Really like the way it streamlines the air.  Have not tried the diffuser yet but I am sure it works well.  Got it to replace a 20 year old dryer that was on its last leg.  Only one coil was working.  Dries my hair in about a third of the time.  Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Bought this dryer January 28th,all is well until this morning . I was blow drying my hair when all of a sudden ,sparks flew,smoke started coming out of the dryer, and then it just caught  fire. Couldn&#x27;t believe it! I never had this happen to me. I read a review today and in October another woman experienced the same thing I did. All I can say is Beware ladies!</li>
            <li> I like it! Now it takes only five minutes to dry my hair (long and thick Asian hair)! It&#x27;s really huge though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really BIG. It&#x27;s really red. It&#x27;s just a really big, really red blow dryer. It&#x27;s probably okay for the price. You won&#x27;t lose it in a drawer if you can fit it in one. Did I mention that it&#x27;s really big? Not sure about claims of controlling frizziness. My fine hair just wants to frizz since I don&#x27;t use &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; to control it and this dryer hasn&#x27;t done anything to solve the problem. I think, for a few bucks more, you can do smaller and better</li>
            <li> The product works perfectly. Other dryers suck my wifes hair into the intake, very fine hair. This dryer does not do that. When she is happy so am</li>
            <li> The hairdryer looks elegant, of very light weight.  I used HIGH warm speed to blow dry then used Medium Hot to style my BOB.  I do have some problem though to set the right side of my hair using my left hand.  It is not very intuitive with the design of the shape.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Vidal Sassoon hair dryer and it last long like 3years or maybe more. I bought this other one.&lt;br /&gt;Their hair dryers are the best so far almost professional! They blow a decent hot air which saves u time  And make ur hair has a style, by the way I have a thick but smooth wavy hair and it&#x27;s colored which makes it harder to blow!&lt;br /&gt; I definitely recommend it as the best in the market now and one of the strongest hair dryers!&lt;br /&gt;I will always buy this brand of hair dryers because now I trust them.</li>
            <li> DRIES VERY WELL, GOOD GRIP.</li>
            <li> Works great. I replaced my Sharper Image ion dryer after 10 years with this model. It works great and has the same specs as my other model. Only at a fraction of the price! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer to replace a virtually identical but much older Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (the VS781),which had finally stopped working after probably a decade.  The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn&#x27;t get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn&#x27;t blow as hard as most other dryers.      For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I&#x27;ve got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn&#x27;t benefit from a strong airflow.  Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don&#x27;t have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  That doesn&#x27;t happen with this Vidal Sassoon model.  The oval-shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow.      I also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently.  With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  So as a rule, I use the dryer with the ion setting in the \\&quot;off\\&quot; position except when drying the ends of my shoulder-length hair.  Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn&#x27;t have this issue.         I&#x27;ve had this dryer for only about 5 weeks, so it&#x27;s too early to comment on whether it&#x27;s built to last - I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  This model might not be just right for every head of hair, but for mine, it&#x27;s perfect.  I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time.</li>
            <li> The cap falls off too easily.</li>
            <li> This is a tried and true model by Vidal Sassoon.  I have had a few of them and they last a long time, pumping out high, low and medium heat predictably day after day.  This model has a cold button that comes in handy when setting curls and waves with a round brush.  After heating hair, cool it down before removing the hair from the brush and the curl lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Her hair looks much healthier too, since we replaced the older, non-ionic hair dryer.  I bought this after reading a review about it on another website, and figured it was worth a try since it was so inexpensive.  She&#x27;s already got my money&#x27;s worth out of it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a Vidal Sassoon full-sized dryer in town. I&#x27;ve had no trouble with this one. It does what it is supposed to do. I like the features of different speeds and temperature settings. I&#x27;ve been buying this brand for some time now. Hair dryers don&#x27;t last forever, you have to get a new one every few years. I use it every day and it gets a lot of use. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Makes a good dryer for my daughter to take to college with her.... would recommend it again and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This VS hair dryer is very powerful.  Feels like you&#x27;re in a wind tunnel at high speed.  It&#x27;s not quiet, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t have that loud buzzy/high frequency noise some dryers have.  I like that it has several heat settings, although the high heat isn&#x27;t super hot.  Great dryer over all.  My hair is super shiny today probably due to the wind tunnel effect, and got dry in 5 minutes when it usually takes 10.  If I had to buy this dryer again, I&#x27;d pay double for it!  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Works well and looks really cool also</li>
            <li> So far so good.  She&#x27;s happy with the dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer offers all the options you need and delivers the good solid service in an almost professional manner.  I find it easy to use and very effective and easy to move around.  Three speeds and heat levels give you every option plus it has an ionic mode as well.  For the money a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is a few inches past my shoulders. I dry my hair on the high hot setting. I used this for the first time yesterday and the dryer shut off halfway through the drying process. I know it is because of the safety feature that turns it off once it is too hot. I pushed the button on the plug to reset the dyrer and it turned back on for a few more seconds of drying then shut off. I turned the heat setting down to warm and was able to finish drying my hair. I do not recommend this for anyone that has thick hair that takes a while to dry like mine. It does dry sections quickly, but not quickly enough for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Bought this model a few years ago and I really like it because the high setting speed is just right for styling your hair...some other dryers I have blow too fast on the high setting.  This model&#x27;s high setting is a good speed and allows you to dry your hair without it blowing all over the place.  Also it is light and well balanced so holding it while drying is very comfortable.  I recently bought 2 more in case the manufacturer decides to stop production.</li>
            <li> I had been shopping with Amazon for about 3.5 yrs and never had one instance of a bad experience. After a lot of research, I nailed to buy this item. I was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days. I was eagerly waiting for it. An unknown carrier called Ensenda was chosen to deliver this to me. They took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item. With much expectation, I opened the item just to find out it would not work. I was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument, tried out different options, nothing would work. I took the drier to 4 different power points in the house, no luck. To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck. The first thing I did next day morning was to ship this back to Amazon and got a Conair Ion Shine Ceramic 1875. Also, buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks, it looks stylish in the image, but looks cheap in reality. The control buttons are also bad. I m very happy with my conair, it looks pretty sophisticated with beautiful controls for just 13.28 dollars + tax. Thanks to Amazon that it forced me out of a pathetic choice. I love Amazon as always!!</li>
            <li> I had an older model that looked just like this but was gray.  It died and I wanted to replace it because this was the only dryer I had found that was powerful enough to dry my thick hair quickly.  This new version is definitely not as powerful.  It is ok, but not like the old one.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for the 2 speed settings and 3 temps and it works very well.  The only complaint I have is that the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting is not quite hot enough for me since I style my hair with a round metal brush while drying, but it still works o.k.  So far it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Bought this model for its separate heat and speed controls, and I&#x27;m pleased with the results. Unlike some reviewers, I find the temperature separation between cool - warm - hot good, with each setting producing noticeable but not extreme temperature change. The cool shot button also works well, and is easy to use and hold in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is that the hanging loop built into the cord is very small, and it requires that I install a new hanger for the blow dryer. Then again, I bought the product to dry my hair, and hanging / storing it is a very, very minor issue.</li>
            <li> This is a good dryer. The cord is just too short</li>
            <li> Beware! This is not the dryer of previous years. It looks like it at first glance, but it does not have the ionizer function that the look-alike previously sold on Amazon had. This dryer has the great balance, the comfortable handle, the easy-to-use switches. But it is missing the crucial ionizer feature. My fine, thin hair gets way too much static build-up from this model. I wish they&#x27;d bring back the other one. I loved it! This one, not so much.</li>
            <li> It is average but you get what you paid for. Quick drying but still leaves my frizzy which is okau since I straighten my hair afterwards. It does its job, it just isn&#x27;t spectacular.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE WITCH HAS A LOT OF HAIR AND IS VERY PICKY ON WHAT SHE USES FOR IT. SHE LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER MORE THAN THE ONE IVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST,WHICH WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE.THIS IS A GREAT BUY,AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> So far, in the month that I have had this dryer, it has NEVER disappointed.  It is light and easy to use.  It comes with the 2 attachments for diffuse or pointing.    Great dryer especially for the price.    I have not had a \\&quot;bad hair day\\&quot; since I have this.    Recommend totally.</li>
            <li> It is not what I had hoped it would be. It is light weight but is not made with quality material it is cheap plastic. I will be returning it and for just a couple of dollars more getting a better one.</li>
            <li> Lasted about a year.  I&#x27;m back to Remington, I used Remington hair dryers for years and they last the longest.  Just bought a new $20.00 one at Walmart and even it has a  2 year guarantee on it.</li>
            <li> Hair dryer and attachments are great. The only thing I wish they&#x27;d change is make the plug a little smaller so you can plug in two appliances (e.g. hairdryer and straightener) at the same time in a tight space.</li>
            <li> Does not supply as much heat as reported by other reviews. The attachments easily fall off.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this one.  The dryer is not powerful at all and if anything it think it makes my hair flatter when I want to make volume.  Not sure why but I ended up getting different one.  I got rid of box so I cant even return!</li>
            <li> This dryer worked great when I first bought it.  I&#x27;ve had it a little over a year, and all of a sudden it just stopped blowing hot, or even warm air.  I guess what do you want for a cheap dryer, but I hoped it would last a little bit longer at the very least.</li>
            <li> Two other hair dryers died in one week.  This came quickly, and in good condition.  I seems to do a good job, and to offer options for heat and power.  I&#x27;d purchase from the vendor again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned. It works great on me and even better on my mini poodle. He gets a bath every week and using the high speed with the warm setting he drys really quickly. I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I literally get my hair dry in 3 minutes. The ion tech helps the hair from being freezie. Not a big fan of the big attachment, its too big for my head. Overall a great product. Must buy.</li>
            <li> Our blow dryer died recently. Panic!! But we just didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to hunt around in local stores to find a replacement for the one we&#x27;d had for so long. I took a chance and looked on Amazon and there it was ... the exact one we wanted! It has a lot of power and we&#x27;re very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have had so far.  It dries great and doesn&#x27;t make weird noises or show sparks or do any of the weird scary thing some of my others have.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive hair dryer, this thing was pretty amazing. Lasted almost a year and a half with regular use.</li>
            <li> It worked like every other blow dryer I have ever had. Nothing better nothing worse. I would recommend if it is reasonably priced</li>
            <li> My old blow dryer was really bad, so I looked up to read a lot of reviews. This one had quite good reviews, and I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this purchase! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer after multiple reviews. I received the dryer as scheduled, and opened it, and plugged it in, and it didn&#x27;t turn on. I tried pressing the reset button then yellow button then reset button and nothing, and then I tried multiple plugs in my house, nothing. It was broken. I was so sad. I realized that I had just got a bad egg, and looked under the reviews if it had happened to anyone else, and it did to one other person. I immediately returned it and got my money back right away. I would purchase from them again, since I knew it wasn&#x27;t intentional.</li>
            <li> This is the hair dryer I have been looking for.  I have had an ionic dryer many years ago and had trouble finding one that actually works as they are supposed to.  I tried this one that my daughter had,  and bought the same one.  I have very short, straight, thinning hair. This dryer does not frizz my already fragile hair.  It works beautifully to dry my hair without the frizz and dryness of most other brands that I have tried (even ones that say they are &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;  My only complaint is that the concentrator does not swivel, causing me to twist my hand while holding it, instead of moving the concentrator into a different position.&lt;br /&gt;  Other than that, I would certainly buy this hair dryer again.  Bonus - A GREAT price for a GREAT dryer.  Much less expensive than others and does just what I wanted it to do!</li>
            <li> i love it. it works on any kind of hair and gets the job done fast love it!!!!! i would tell any one to buy it!</li>
            <li> I seriously have the thickest most ridiculously hard to dry hair and I can get my whole head done in under 10 minutes, I mean, that&#x27;s pretty fabulous! I have a one year old and do not have time to fool around with drying my hair and I was in serious need of finding this product. Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought a new hair dryer a few years ago and it stopped working. Wow they just don&#x27;t make them like they used to.&lt;br /&gt;Previous hair dryer lasted 10+ years.  But this one is wonderful. Noise level is pleasant. Lightweight for this 110 pound girl.&lt;br /&gt;Love the heat options. Does a wonderful job. I hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> Odd shaped barrel and pathetic power.  Not worth the price, and it wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> The biggest piece of junk on amazon. Lasted 3 days longer than 30 day warranty.</li>
            <li> I considered shelling out some serious cash to buy a high end blow-dryer but then I realized that&#x27;s stupid...and I&#x27;m cheap, so I bought this instead and I honestly could not be happier!  I have long hair (like to the middle of my back) and it&#x27;s pretty thick and this dryer dries my hair in under 10 minutes.  My last dryer took FOR.EV.ER so to avoid getting stared down by my husband and watching the hate build in his eyes because I was taking so long to get ready and thus withholding whatever meal we are trying to go eat from him, I would just not bother drying and curling my hair and instead would just rock my natural fro but with this new dryer I can do my hair and still get out of the house quickly (relatively, anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this dryer highly!  No need to waste your hard earned cash on a high end dryer; this one does the job!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works great.  My hair is dry in no time at all.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how large and heavy it is compared to my last salon dryer. Hope it will work fine, though the noise seems to bother me a little.</li>
            <li> You kept telling me you were preparing it for shipment, and that I would get it on the estimated date.  I did receive it on that date, but it would have been nice is you had promptly sent it out--I could have had it sooner.  My old dryer quit working---so had to wait for you to prepare shipment--whatever that is!!!</li>
            <li> I expected an Ion Select dryer, but got a tourmaline ceramic model instead.  This was OK with me.  I bought the blow dryer last week to replace my VS547 1875 watt Ionic dryer that I have had for about 8 years.  It looks exactly like what is pictured with the exception of the writing, which is white on my model.  The tourmaline ceramic model does not have an ion switch and does not say ion select anywhere on it, but the model number printed in the plastic is still VS547.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice:  I am replacing my previous model because the motor is burning out.  This would not be the case if the back cover had not broken and been tossed years ago.  Now the screen covering the air intake fan is bent in and causes all sorts of problems.  The first thing I did after pulling the new hair dryer out of its box was to adhere the back cover to the main body of the dryer using some heavy-duty tape.  Lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could have purchased a more expensive model and felt justified (I had a gift card), but I&#x27;ve been very happy with this economical option.  It dries my thick, wavy hair quickly and leaves it shiny and soft.  The switches and speed/heat options are ideal.  It is durable and has lasted me for years.  It would have lasted longer if I wasn&#x27;t so rough with it!  I would rate it five stars if not for the back cover problem.</li>
            <li> Beyond my expectations.  I have had Vidal Sasoon dryers  for many years.  They were reliable and very good. I will continue their products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing crazy special, but it gets the job done! The cold air button is key, and so is the different speed settings. If I had wavy or curly hair, the diffuser would be used more, but it&#x27;s a great option as well.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair, good price, it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This dryer does not blow strong.  We need to use the concentrator attachment for it to work at all well.  The diffuser is a joke - you might as well blow on your own hair.  I bought this to replace my 20 year old misty tone 1500 - it is really not any better at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 Conair dryers which have failed me in the last couple of years....This has ION select so you can use this feature if you want or turn it off.</li>
            <li> worked ok for a little while, then the power and heat went out.</li>
            <li> This was a purchase to replace my old dryer - which was the exact same brand/type - of nearly 10 years. One morning it just stopped heating up, so I hurried to the store for another, but couldn&#x27;t find anywhere! Thank goodness for Amazon ^_^ My old one was boring gray, so I really enjoy the new bright colorful look. And I did try other brands, which I returned, as no other dryer ever got hot enough to straighten my frizzy hair, so I&#x27;m really glad I was able to find an exact match here.</li>
            <li> Previously had one which I had bought at the store a few years ago and the switch broke.  I loved it so much that I reordered it from Amazon and the price was definitely less expensive than the store bought one.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great color is red! Love it :) haven&#x27;t used the attachments.</li>
            <li> My old blow dryer broke and I needed a quick replacement.  The price seemed reasonable and it was a quick delivery.  The hair dryer is flimsy and the nozzle continues to fall off from day one.  I never had the time to pack it up and send it back. Bad me for not returning it.</li>
            <li> light weight but enough drying power.  I like the different heat settings. And having the diffuser attachment is a big plus. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love it, keeps the frizz down and LOVE the attachments. Since I have some curl to my hair, it&#x27;s nice to have the diffuser that fits the dryer. Packaged nicely and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Heavier and clumsy to use, but the ion as well as defusier does work well with short hair.....well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer and It&#x27;s affordable. Before I was using a cheap Revlon dryer, but this one is by far better quality, more efficient, and better for my hair.</li>
            <li> Very loud and sounds like an afterburner out of an F-16. Blows hot and cold.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer lasted maybe two weeks after which time it sounded like something broke internally and was quickly followed by a burning smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried taking it apart to see if I could simply try removing whatever piece had gotten caught in the motor/fan to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, had to trash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting a nicer hairdryer...something in the $30 - $40 range which will last a long time.  This was crap and I should have known better :)</li>
            <li> my wife love it Does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried the dryer only one setting worked and it was marked high, but blew out and temp wise was more like low.  I sent it back immediately.  I didn&#x27;t not like the &#x27;feel&#x27; of this dryer anyway, so I went for another brand instead of exchanging for another of the same.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the concept of &amp;#34;Ceramic&amp;#34; hair dryer (I thought ceramic was a straightener/curling iron thing?) but this gets my hair dry quickly and comes with a diffuser attachment, so that&#x27;s nice. I&#x27;ve had it for a few years and it&#x27;s still going strong!</li>
            <li> The color is much prettier here on Amazon than in person.  In person it is a much darker red, not as bright and shiny.  The attachments go on hard and the finger diff-user is just so large that it really can&#x27;t be used effectively.  The back cover comes off for easy cleaning and it does, nicely and the screen is easy to clean.  The angle attachment works good.  For the price, it is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a Great Deal, Love my Hair Dryer.  I didn&#x27;t use the Diffuser, so I sold it on Ebay and the hair dryer paid for itself  ;-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good hair dryer for most people, but my hair is very fine and flyaway wispy, so I am personally unhappy with it .  Even the low setting is way too high for my hair. If you have fine hair, I would recommend looking for a hair dryer with a high, medium and low. The medium setting seems to necessitate a lower low speed.</li>
            <li> I gave it away. The thing blew me into Kansas. Too much power even on low. Low should be low.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful and does not burn my hair</li>
            <li> My favorite  blow dryer . Very strong and fast. I can browdry my sister&#x27;s 4a/b curly hair in 20 -30 min and my type 3 hair in 7-10  min.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for only once or twice and now the dryer doesn&#x27;t work when turned on. I followed the instruction written on the tag hanging on the product when it turns off automatically, but nothing happens. )):</li>
            <li> I can spike my hair really good with this</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a decent priced dryer with 3 heat settings and a cold blast.&lt;br /&gt;Our old Revlon one bit the dust after 2 years.  This one is desireable because it is lighter with all the same features.&lt;br /&gt;And the price is great.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer seemed to be just what I wanted, but was a huge disappointment.  It is very loud as I think one reviewer stated.  That I could deal with but that was just one small detail.  The attachment for the hair curling I could not work, although that may just be me.  The settings for the hot and cold on this are right at the finger tips where you hold the dryer.  Therefore, if you are not careful you will be drying on warm instead of high.  You start wondering why its not getting dry.  I have had to change it back as many as 20 times in one hair drying session.  And now the last and &amp; most frustrating feature of the dryer.  The concentrated hair drying attachment that was stated in the description of the product as coming off for easy cleaning, unlike most other models.  Well yes, it does come off for easy cleaning alright, it just blows it across the room as you are drying your hair.  You just don&#x27;t want anyone else in the room with you for you never know where the line of fire may be.  It blows off with quite a force so I am sure it would hurt someone, particularly a small child.  I owned a Vidal Sassoon Dryer before but never one like this.  I cannot recommend this product and will not purchase another one of this brand.  It was inexpensive so I guess its true, you get what you pay for.  Not worth paying return shipping so I use it as it is until my new one arrives.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair, and the finger diffuser is perfect for dryer my hair without messing up my curls. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality hair dryer that works for all hair types.</li>
            <li> The dryer functions okay.  The plastic is weak.  Second time I used the attachments, the dryer body chipped.  Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t effect the ability to connect the attachments; though I wonder how long this will work?  I will return to the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; brand with my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use. Lightweight and not too noisy compared to others. The included attachments are great.</li>
            <li> Works as expected . I don&#x27;t use it often on myself because my hair gets overly dry from blow drying frequently but I like it for when I need my thick hair to dry quickly. Also I use it on my daughters with much thinner hair and also on cooler setting and it works great! I even used it on our dog after her bath . She hates loud noises like this and the vacuum but she put up with it quite happily id say while I was combing out her hair. She pretends to hate baths but I know she loves the scrubbing/ attention</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  I like how it feels in my hand, dries the hair well.  Only thing is, they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Pretty Cheaply made. back n front pieces fall off too easy and often. Not worth it!</li>
            <li> Was happy to change to this hair dryer after my former one (another brand beginning with R which I&#x27;d only had for a year) started sparking so much I was afraid that it was going to set my hair on fire! This one dries super fast and my hair is left soft and isn&#x27;t frizzy. Have gotten many compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve started using this dryer. I also really like the 3 temp settings, the cold shot button, the weight, and the color. The only reason that I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that it&#x27;s pretty noisy on the high setting which I use a lot. Update 4 1/2 months later - hairdryer stopped, glowed, and then didn&#x27;t work any more. Sending it back to manufacturer for replacement. Just don&#x27;t make them like they used to!! Formerly gave this a four-star rating.</li>
            <li> Tired of buying &amp;#34;Chi&amp;#34; products and the expensive rest.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this with comparable features of the spendy ones.&lt;br /&gt;The girls are happy. That&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
            <li> I  like this hair dryer.  This is my second one.  It lasted for quite a few years.  Would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Excellent... A++.+.+.++++++.  It works perfect and is very hot to dry hair.  Excellent article, very low price and ussesfull. Thanks</li>
            <li> Just so-so. Rear exhaust cover prone to falling off.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find this hair dryer lived up to it&#x27;s claims.  I am very happy about this purchase and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Purchase this item use it once and it&#x27;s already in the box to be return. My daughter have natural hair so its all it easier to come her hair when it&#x27;s blow dry and this could bit do the job at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good hair dryer for the price.  I do find that it smells like it&#x27;s burning on High/Hot. I use it on warm and low so it&#x27;s just fine for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a SalonSalon hair dryer at a friends house which was fabulous - turns out it costs $169!  Way out of my budget. This one will probably last a year and then I&#x27;ll probably buy another Sassoon tourmaline ceramic - helps keep the fly aways from flying away!</li>
            <li> This is my second vidal sassoon dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second one for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it has 3 heat and 2 speed settings.&lt;br /&gt;I may just get another for future use.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair straight. I love it. The smaller nozzel focuses the heat where i want it. Strong and powerful.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having this available for me to purchase at a decent price! A welcome addition to my wife&#x27;s beautiy gadgets.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this product ! Still take a loooong time to dry my hair. Mmmmmm If you have a lot of hair to blow dry I wouldn&#x27;t recommended</li>
            <li> A little bigger than expected but works perfect and dries hair in seconds..</li>
            <li> Purchased in April and it just died (beginning of July). I do NOT blow dry my hair every day, maybe once or twice a week....so avoid buying this at all costs! It&#x27;s in my garbage can now and I am going to have to buy a new one, maybe I&#x27;ll spend a few extra dollars on one that will last....</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but I&#x27;ve been using it just over a year and now every time I turn it on, it trips my surge protector just a couple minutes in. It makes drying my thick head of hair a rather extensive process with having to turn it off, let it cool down, and then reset the surge protector, which otherwise works fine. I unplug everything else from it when using the dryer… which I didn&#x27;t have to do before, but now if I don&#x27;t, the dryer shuts off even more frequently. I just purchased another dryer from another brand as result.</li>
            <li> It does the job well, but it is a little heavier than I&#x27;d like it to be.  I needed a full size dryer because I have long hair and it gets caught in the air intake of the lighter weight, smaller travel versions.  There are no exposed screws on which my hair can get caught, as there were on other dryers I&#x27;ve tried to use.  I&#x27;ve always used and liked Vidal Sassoon dryers, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife.  The hair dryer she cannot destroy in a very limited period of time has yet to be invented.  I have tried buying expensive dryers thinking they would last longer.  That was an illusion.  No need to spend big bucks cause they all seem to have a very limited life span.  This one works just as well as the $70 unit it replaced.  If it lasts 6 - 12 months I will be well satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical about this new ION technology, but I&#x27;m now a believer. I have fine thinning hair. The ION setting truly does increase hair density and minimizes frizz. I don&#x27;t know how it would do for thicker hair, but it is neither too hot or too cool. The additional speeds and heat settings provide plenty of choices. I&#x27;m very pleased . . . especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Not big on heat styling my hair anyway but I expected more. It&#x27;s a subpar blow dryer at best. It&#x27;ll dry your hair eventually but I also have thick, naturally kiny-curly (4a/b) hair. Maybe if it had a comb attachment to it would have been more useful but just not for me. I can get the blow look with a low heat setting on my flat iron.</li>
            <li> Warning! This dryer will catch on fire! I was excited about this dryer because it was cheap, included the accessories I needed and looked to be good quality from the description and reviews, but I guess not! I just received it today and tried it out this evening to dry my hair. Started it out on low/warm for a few minutes to make sure it worked properly. It was fine so I moved it up to high/warm and continued. I used it for a minute before I heard crackling sounds from inside and looked in, the coils inside were turning red hot so I turned it off. About a minute later I turned it back on low to see if it was a fluke, the dryer started to hum quietly (not at the speed/sound it was just at when working properly) and then caught on fire! Smoke coming out of both ends, inside red hot and small flames. Needless to say it is unusable and I will be returning for a refund. I had it less than 24 hours and literally one use and it is gone. Do not buy. I was fooled by the good reviews, maybe I received a defective product but I will not be trying again.</li>
            <li> The diffuser didn&#x27;t fit. Really crappy dryer.</li>
            <li> I had an old Vidal Sassoon digital dryer, which is no longer being made, that finally went out. I bought this as a replacement. I don&#x27;t like it as well as the digital, but it works. The hot setting is almost too hot, so I use medium. Still dries very fast.</li>
            <li> Hair dyer stopped working within one month.  Not reliable!!</li>
            <li> This item is exactly what I replaced. Thank you</li>
            <li> Works as described, but is very loud. The back filter piece comes off too easily. It is what it says it is. We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I chose this dryer based on the great ratings it got. I am highly pleased with it. Works well, has all the temp. settings needed. I was looking at much more expensive dryers, and I really don&#x27;t think one of them would have been better. Highly  recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for her to use it for college. it came really fast, she loves it and it&#x27;s very affordable. thank you. 😊</li>
            <li> I have medium, long, thick, wave hair! I hadn&#x27;t bought a new dryer in a very long time.  This one has the power I need without making me go deaf using it.  It still takes at least 10-15 minutes to dry my hair but, I think it would with any dryer.  I really need to rethink the length of my hair, too much work! My only complaint is that the concentrator nossle falls off and goes flying across the bathroom.  For the price I&#x27;m pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this blow dryer for almost a year now, and I love it, it works great, not any issues with it at all, and I love the color.</li>
            <li> Very good, light weight and efficient. Loved the price and product!!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it promises. I like the 3 temperatures and 3 speeds. Comfortable to hold and a fantastic deal</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Curly hair here. I think it does dry faster, but my old machine was pretty worn out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that there is an actual setting for cool air plus the button for a shot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My finger always ached after using my last one, which only had that blue button and not the addt&#x27;l setting.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer started a fire in my home 3 weeks ago. It was left plugged in but not left on. It did not overheat. I did notice that it hesitated to turn on for a half second before we used it for the last time. I set it down on a table and left for the day. When I returned a few hours later, it had melted into an unrecognizable puddle. Burned the table and the floor beneath it. The outlet was tripped but still intact, the fire dept said it was clearly a wiring issue within the hairdryer itself.  Please make sure to unplug your hairdryers after use!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had the same Vidal Sassoon dryer for years.  Someone big stepped on the plug which made it unsafe to use.  I love this dryer, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been using! I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the purchase....thanks for the quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Great product and price. Strong airflow and nice setting options. Get&#x27;s my very long hair dry fast. Replaced older model that I had had for over 5 years. Hope this one last as long</li>
            <li> It feels like cheap flimsy plastic to the touch but it&#x27; s a pretty decent hair drier for the price. One thing i didn&#x27;t like is that the concentrator can only be put one one way (like in the pic) because the opening is oval rather than round, i had a feeling it was oval as the picture wasn&#x27;t too clear. I like holding the hair dryer in a different way but with the concentrator being oval i can not adjust it to my needs.    Update: after using this hair drier for 2 years, one day the handle got super hot and red and burnt smell started coming out of it. I disposed it right away. Not safe! Be careful.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the ions do anything, that seems a little gimmicky. But the airflow, speed, and design of this hair dryer are all excellent.</li>
            <li> Not bad, does a good job but feels a little cheap. Description says full size dryer but could have a little more power. Doesn&#x27;t look or feel like a real expensive hair dryer... But I guess you can&#x27;t really expect that for around twenty bucks.</li>
            <li> Very good. We recommend it for multiples use for home and traveling when the the hotels do not have dryer.</li>
            <li> Had this item for a year now and it just broke on me, so I figured I needed to write a review to warn buyers. When the item first arrived, the back lid (air vent) didn&#x27;t close all the way but it really didn&#x27;t bother me much. I&#x27;ve had many other 1875w dryers and this one was a bit louder than my previous ones. About a week ago, the hair dryer stopped producing warm/hot air and now it just blows cold air. Had to throw it out and purchase a different hair dryer. This might just be a one time scenario... but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had been using an awful 8 year old, non-ionized dryer until I purchased this one... and I cannot say enough good about this product.  The temperature and output controls are fantastic;  it was definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer! I love the multi settings to dry your hair and it was exactly what I was looking for as a gift for my daughter.  She wanted the Ion tool so it was perfect for her. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this dryer.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  It simply has no blowing strength. It simply emits air, it doesn&#x27;t blow it.  I have thin, fine blond hair and it is not nearly satisfactory for me, so not sure what someone with thicker hair would do.&lt;br /&gt;Im not returning it because I bought it for 2nd home and will stash in the guest bath.  Hopefully, I won&#x27;t get complaints.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long. It&#x27;s an ok dryer, but defiantly not durable.</li>
            <li> The filter cover broke off after a few months.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT!! JUST WHAT I WANTED!!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses this more than I do.  He seems to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair that tends to split ends and I have started to wear my hair longer.  The blow drier is not too noisy and the temperature settings, warm and hot do the job.  I find the handle to be a little bit on the small size.  In the winter I do tend to get static in my hair, so I decided to buy this model with the ionizing feature.  Since this is Spring, the air has had enough humidity that I have not yet been able to figure out if this feature is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this blow drier has an extra long cord and an outlet safety switch.  This switch does tend to block the outlet above it, so some people may find this a bit inconvenient on a crowded bathroom electrical plug setup (I just installed a power strip on my bathroom wall).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have been very happy with this blow drier.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair dryer! Works so fast! Good quality!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, this is my third one.  great speed light weight.  only wish they lasted longer.  but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Worked great for a few months, then shorted out and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this hair dryer. It does the job it is designed for. I really like the different setting for the heat and the speed. My only complaints so far, it is a little heavy for me. I like that I was able to get in the red color.</li>
            <li> I loved it but It did break after 8 months</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll think in six months if the dryer konks out on me.  But for now, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I use the warm, low setting for my hair, and the results are great--smooth, non frizzy hair.  My hair is fairly straight, but some dryers manage to make it look a little frizzy, which is a mystery to me.  Anyway, I&#x27;m very pleased, and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> As long as my wife loves it...I&#x27;m happy.  She loves red and finally she has one with all the features she desires in a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is defective and dangerous. The hair dryer did not work on the low setting, the fan did not spin. I turned it on for only 30 seconds and it quickly overheated and turned bright orange inside and could potentially have caught on fire. The construction of this hair dryer is very cheap and even if the one I received was just a defect, I don&#x27;t think it would last very long if it did work at all.</li>
            <li> Good Hair dryer but the diffuser&#x27;s teeth are not long enough for us curly headed girls. I ended up with frizzy hair. Boo.</li>
            <li> oh my I am so pleased. I had my other Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for 22 years. it went through me and 2 daughters and still works. I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as it used to, but never the less. This blower has large shoes to fill. if it last half as long I will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer in November 2013....yesterday it smelled funny and stopped heating.  I loved it until this happened....think a dryer should last longer than a year.  I will be trying another brand now....</li>
            <li> This is worth it especially the price!</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but overall it works great.</li>
            <li> Great dryer when it worked.  I purchased this hair dryer in January 2014.  Only used it twice a week on the low heat setting up until now.  Yesterday while using the dryer on the low setting the motor speed suddenly became very low and the thermal switch inside kicked the heating element off.  This is the second Vidal Sassoon of this kind I&#x27;ve purchased.  The first one lasted six years.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Works wonderful for my curls.  My perm was mostly straight and dead looking and just using this once with the diffuser made my curls come back to life and the dry damaged hair look go away.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I always bought this particular model at Wal Mart.  Wal Mart no longer carries this dryer.  This dryer lasts much longer then any other hair dryer I have used.  That is why I keep buying the Vidal Sassoon Ion dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer in 2008. Fast forward almost 7 years later and it still works on the same way as the first day. I do my own wash and set so I use it very frequently. The noise level is no different than the one in the hair saloon. It doesn&#x27;t get too hot. Plus it has been 7 years, I have moved and travelled many many times, and it has not gone out on me.  The reason why I am giving 3 stairs is because of the removable cap. It keeps coming off multiple times while I use the dryer. It is happening more and more frequently now. The last time it fell off the dryer and inside the toilet it goes :( I haven&#x27;t really owned another blow dryer so I&#x27;m not sure if this would happen with any model that has the cap separately. I&#x27;m debating on buying a new one. I just can&#x27;t bring myself to do it since my old one still works.</li>
            <li> This replaced a smaller Vidal Sassoon hair dryer which I really liked, but it broke.  I wanted something of similar quality, so I ordered this as a replacement.  This model is a little heavier, but it dries quickly and that is my main requirement for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this the end of December and its completely stopped working the end of February.  Think the motor burnt out.  Smelled terrible and Amazon says it&#x27;s too late to return.  2 months!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly to dry my curls without frizz &amp; in half the time of my old hairdryer...perfect size and weight for me.  Love the bright red color too.</li>
            <li> I loved this VS firstly its cord is perfect length (although I could&#x27;ve used 6 inches more, but..) secondly the controls are right by my hand I don&#x27;t have to move my hand and look and then select what I want, it&#x27;s a breeze to me. vuv it so. thanks</li>
            <li> Good effective dryer for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the way the dryer is built, the attachment pieces cannot be twisted to an angle I&#x27;m comfortable with.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moWKAC42CVAW73]]This video will not play on some devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice inexpensive hair dryer. Not much to say so I made a video. Hope you find it useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended forr the price.</li>
            <li> This is nothing but a cheap piece of junk.  Save your money and buy an ionic dryer instead... Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> has different settings for temperature and power. works great so far and comes with the extra parts (which i haven&#x27;t yet used).</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;• lightweight (best feature)&lt;br /&gt;• strong force of air if you want it&lt;br /&gt;• multiple heat controls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;• I don&#x27;t think the diffuser does much, but I really don&#x27;t care about that.</li>
            <li> I bought this product almost a year ago and it is still going strong. Very comfortable to use and does not strain my arm as much as other heavier dryers. It get&#x27;s the job done with the right amount of heat setting. The hottest setting isn&#x27;t too hot and the cold setting is just right. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The dryer is light weight and full of options.  I am quite pleased with it and will buy the same brand again..</li>
            <li> This particular dryer is very powerful, yet lighter weight than others I&#x27;ve owned.  It&#x27;s very easy to handle, has several settings available, and the accessories are easy to attach.  My only criticism is that the concentrator is remains stationary which means I must turn the dryer to direct the flow of air, but it&#x27;s not a big issue.  Am making a recommendation to the company to make the change.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer.  Works great.  The filter is also very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I loved what this dryer did for my curls.  However, the motor started to smoke after just two weeks of use.  I suppose I could have just gotten a lemon, but my last Vidal Sassoon dryer did the very same thing, only after a lot longer.  I wonder if there&#x27;s something faulty with how they are made.  But some people say theirs have lasted.  Hmmmm..  Wish I knew.</li>
            <li> Works great! I see no need to spend a lot of money on another dryer. This one does its job and a good one at that!</li>
            <li> My wife is happy with it, that&#x27;s all I needed! Seems to work fine, and I noticed it&#x27;s not as loud and annoying as some other one&#x27;s my wife had before!</li>
            <li> This model does NOT have the ion feature. I like that, but I don&#x27;t  use it to dry hair.</li>
            <li> Great dryer for the money</li>
            <li> One of the cheaper options for a hair dryer. I like the color and the diffuser works well for those with curly hair!</li>
            <li> Perfect STUFF!  WIFE LOVE IT!! Certainly recommend others to buy!very trustworthy. .should get some more..love it love it love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product in order to use it when I moved, I tried it and it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li> Little power and the attachment popped off all 3 times I used it before returning it without any effort while drying my hair.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have a weakness for Vidal Sassoon but this blowdryer didn&#x27;t blow my mind. lol. However, it&#x27;s extremely light which makes it very easy to handle. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s too powerful either. Also, I thought the diffuser was going to be bigger, but it does its job pretty well as it is. I have a LOT of curly hair and if I use the Warm setting it takes a century to dry it, so I have to use the Hot setting. Thank god it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This dryer does a good job and wasn&#x27;t too expensive. It has several different settings available.  I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> We used to have a professional hair dryer but to heavy so i replaced it for this one and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> first of all exellent shipping got here fast&lt;br /&gt;this dryer leaves my hair soft and shiny,i have curly hair and my hair ends up curlier and all in place&lt;br /&gt;all in all i give this 4 thumbs up.....this product is so fetch!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t over heat and works super fast.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I gave 4 stars is because the attachment falls off when it warms up. I don&#x27;t need the attachments, not a big deal, but that&#x27;s what it does.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain about the quality of this product.  It&#x27;s very much appreciated around here.  Everyone is using it to dry their hair.</li>
            <li> I had the same hair dryer a few years ago and it got hot.  My new one didn&#x27;t so I ended up throwing it away and getting a Revlon Turbo 1875.  That one is great for thick hair like mine!</li>
            <li> I have long dark hair that is prone to grease, this dryer makes my hair manageable and makes it feel clean. I love it</li>
            <li> I liked the dryer...while it worked. Out of nowhere, it would not blow hot air if it is on high. Customer service told me i have to mail it back to them and pay for shipping - the new one cost less than the shipping costs! That is if I wanted to waste more of my money and get another cheap dryer that would not last even a year! So dissapointing</li>
            <li> I had a similar dryer that lasted many years until I dropped it on the bathroom floor.  It was a great dryer.  I therefore ordered this model that looks a lot like my old one.  Not only that, but it behaves like my old one.  I love it.  But.  It was supposed to come with several accessories, a diffuser, a concentrator and an endcap.  The endcap was not in the box and the other two accessories didn&#x27;t fit (I think they needed the endcap). I didn&#x27;t return the dryer because this wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.  I have very short hair and didn&#x27;t need or want the accessories.  But if you are counting on getting the whole enchillada --check the box as soon as it comes in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid they will quit making this model so I keep a spare on hand.  It&#x27;s the best as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Gets very hot and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This dryer is one the best I had ever used.  It does not take long to dry my hair. I would recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am a creature of habit, but when I dropped my old Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (for probably the 500th time) and broke the back cage off, I just wanted to replace it with the same exact model.  Unfortunatley, since I had that thing for 7-8 years, they don&#x27;t appear to make the EXACT same model, but this one comes pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable to hold - the proportion and shape of the the handle are excellent&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight - so your arm won&#x27;t get tired holding it&lt;br /&gt;- 3 heat settings - and the &amp;#34;very hot&amp;#34; is actually hot enough&lt;br /&gt;- Price - under $20!&lt;br /&gt;- Color - my old one was grey, but this red is kinda sassy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What disappointed me:&lt;br /&gt;- Speed - the highest speed is adequate, but it&#x27;s not as fast as my old Vidal Sasson hair dryer (RIP, old friend)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this to anyone who needs a basic hair dryer for not a lot of money, and if past experience can be repeated, this thing could last you a good half decade or more, depending on how often you knock yours off the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I had this hair dryer for approximately seven years before it finally broke. I never used any of the attachments so I can&#x27;t comment on those, but the blow dryer itself worked great. What finally broke was actually the cord it seems. If you held the cord where it attached to the base at just the right angle it would work again, so the dryer itself was actually still kicking after 7 years.</li>
            <li> They last a year.  I bought ten for my shop 2 caught fire and 2 never turned back on. They are light weight but weak dryers.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer because my previous conair hair dryer short circuited and wouldn&#x27;t work anymore. This hair dryer is definitely worth it&#x27;s cost; it does it&#x27;s job and that&#x27;s pretty much it. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but whenever i use it theres a weird smell that comes out. I actually didn&#x27;t notice that the mouth was oval-shaped, or i wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product. It makes it a bit difficult to style my bangs, because i usually have the narrow tip extension facing vertically, not horizontally. But regardless, this hair dryer is good enough to not make me want to buy another one just yet.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair dryer for many years and like the amount of heat and air flow options.  The only drawback is it only last about 2 years.  It is sporadic in its ability to provide heat after that.  I know I have purchased  5 in total and 3 are functional which includes my latest purchase.  The price is good for the amount of use I get from it in that time.  So overall a value purchase.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair dryer.  Not too heavy, buttons in the right place so you aren&#x27;t accidentally hitting them all the time and good power.  This is my 3rd one over about 10+ years.  So excited they are still making it!  I keep a spare in the closet at all times.</li>
            <li> I love the cool feature on this dryer. I like the accessories it comes with, definitively a great buy for your money.</li>
            <li> Love the air pressure on this dryer!</li>
            <li> For the price it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone looking for the same thing.</li>
            <li> Kinda loud but I use ear plugs for that.  It&#x27;s lightweight and it&#x27;s got a lot of power for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the shipment was great, it was extremely fast! Thank you !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I STILL use this hair dryer, it&#x27;s crazy because I&#x27;ve not realized how fast time flies!! I bought this 4 years ago and it is still amazing. It&#x27;s 8/2017 now .....buy this dryer. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Heating element went out of it in 7 months. Had to return to factory at my expense before they would replace it. Postage would have been $8-11 and I would be without a dryer for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This replaced my very old Sassoon Quiet Dryer. It dries my hair very similarly- it gets plenty hot but doesn&#x27;t blow too hard so that I can style with a round brush while drying.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like it is too loud- I plug up my ears while using it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this dryer. It dries my hair in under 5 minutes, it&#x27;s light and easy to handle, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and the ruby red color brightens my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the attachments so I cannot comment on them. A friend of mine creates wacky sculptures so I&#x27;m going to donate both attachments to his art endeavors. I can&#x27;t wait to see how he uses them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve had is the grill in the back falls off. It&#x27;s not a big deal, but it is a tad annoying when I&#x27;m in a hurry because I have to stop and reattach it. Due to the grill malfunction I only gave this product 4 stars - otherwise this would have been a 5 star review.</li>
            <li> Ordered as gift and they were thrilled with quality, price and shipping!</li>
            <li> Seems to be good so far.  I have only had it for 1 week.</li>
            <li> Works very well, although I rarely use it, as styled hair is not a priority for me. I bought it after I told my hairdresser I didn&#x27;t have a blow dryer. She said, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s not something to brag about!&amp;#34; Also good for drying craft projects and clothes.</li>
            <li> I use this blow dryer at least 4x/week and so far so good. I have had it for about a month now. The only complaint I have is that the concetrator falls off really easily. Then, if I want to put it back on, I have to wait at least 5 minutes, because it is too hot to touch. So basically, I do half my hair with the concentrator on the blow dryer, and once it falls off (cause it always does) I just do the rest of my hair without it. Other than that, a good product for the money!</li>
            <li> Just only use about one and half month, when I was using it and the Dryer stopped working suddenly. it&#x27;s some part of inside the dryer was broken I guess and I really want to return this item！I was very angry about the quality of this dryer!</li>
            <li> works well drys hair fast</li>
            <li> ok but heavey&lt;br /&gt;nice does its job but looks small was supprized how heavey it was.&lt;br /&gt;has all the heat adjustmentas I was looking for</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works great.  I have been using since it came and It works as described.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, unbelievable dryer for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may need more power, for me it is more than enough!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer! Dries my hair in half the time of my old professional hair dryer. It leaves my hair shiny and soft. Great dryer at a perfect price!</li>
