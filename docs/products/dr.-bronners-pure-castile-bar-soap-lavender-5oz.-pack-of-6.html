            <li>B001ET77OI Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap,</li>
            <li>My favorite soap :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this soap for about 7 years, and still prefer it to most everything.  </li>
            <li>Peppermint variant is my favorite, but they are all good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just LOVE this soap....</li>
            <li>We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender soap and use nothing else.</li>
            <li>The scent is appealing...</li>
            <li>I was using Fels Naptha and some other bar soaps to make my own laundry soap but this works the best.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, leaves me feeling fresh, clean and relaxed.</li>
            <li>Rinses so clean and smells amazing all day.</li>
            <li>Nice and sudsy and clean without drying or itching my scalp.  </li>
            <li>This soap is nice and mild, lathers and cleans well, rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I am also using it for bathing, and it is wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>and clean super good</li>
            <li>Excellent straight up real lavender.</li>
            <li>It works great and contains no harsh chemicals at all!</li>
            <li>cup of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap (shredded or graded as finely as you</li>
            <li>good merchandise clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Lovely scents available.  </li>
            <li>Smell great and not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>Just seems like a good ethical company.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  </li>
            <li>I have kids with sensitive skin and this soap works great and the smell isn&#x27;t strong either.</li>
            <li>These soaps seem to have very good ingredients, and they last a good while with normal use.</li>
            <li>Packaging is a plus printed with 100% water based ink and definitely support fair trade!</li>
            <li>Just follow with a very mild rinse of water and vinegar to get it out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>Because finding it isn&#x27;t easy .</li>
            <li>There is something so old-school and easy about just using a bar of soap as opposed to liquid soap and all those germy space-wasting loofahs and poofs all over the shower.</li>
            <li>The soap is too strong.</li>
            <li>Smell is strong but fades.</li>
            <li>The detergent works fine, but the scent does not linger in the clothes.</li>
            <li>Scent disappears out of shower which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>pure and simple soaps that smell wonderful</li>
            <li>It is so gentle and so effective.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and it glides smoothly.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, as we are making the switch to cruelty free brands.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>But now I enjoy putting lotion on my skin</li>
            <li>(R&amp;G products sometimes make me sneeze like I do with my mom&#x27;s cheap perfumes).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet, but I personally know those who have, and they say it works great for shampoo too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great soap which wife loves, cheaper than can be bought locally, eases sore bodies!</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>This is one that I can say that you get a great scent and nothing extra.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I chose Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, because it is all natural, non-toxic, and fair trade.</li>
            <li>I have had a love affair with this soap from the first time I tried it around 10 years.  </li>
            <li>It has a fragrant smell and makes rich, creamy lather.</li>
            <li>It is worth it!</li>
            <li>I rarely even need to use body lotion anymore!</li>
            <li>I love the lavender scent (which does not linger after rinsing), it lathers nicely, and leaves my skin feeling clean and not dry (tho not moisturized either -</li>
            <li>Like the fresh scent !</li>
            <li>I have tried several fragrances (rose and tea tree), but the Lavender is now my favorite.</li>
            <li>It cleans really well, and most importantly, my skin has improved since using it.  </li>
            <li>I feel really clean after shower &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells clean.....</li>
            <li>Our clothes get clean.  </li>
            <li>Super strong soap for super heros.  </li>
            <li>Such a pleasant scent and hopefully safe and pure.</li>
            <li>This bar provides a rich foamy lather and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I love that it has pure ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love Dr Bronners products in general, but this soap is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how nicely this soap lathers.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap so much.  </li>
            <li>not at all overwhelming, and it lathers very well.</li>
            <li>My husband is very particular about any soap he use due to his sensitive skin but he marks this one one of the best and being a natural soap, I feel great knowing my family is using it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to grate up and dissolves fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to still have chemical free products such as this one.</li>
            <li>I saw such wonderful reviews and wanted to find a face wash that had some of the essential oils in it that people were raving about.</li>
            <li>Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and this particular one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1 cup of arm and hammer&#x27;s super washing soda</li>
            <li>&gt; Any other kind (including organic ones or glycerin) will leave me with itchiness, redness, and more dryness.</li>
            <li>new brand of soap from now on.(it&#x27;s more expensif...</li>
            <li>I love this soap because of its pure and natural ingredients, because it is fair trade, and because this company is so ethical and committed to issues that I passionately believe in - namely, the promotion of and significant monetary contribution to non-GMO projects, Hemp farming, and more.  </li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin and blister with most antibacterial soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love you they come in a easy to open package.</li>
            <li>Pure soap with no chemicals that can penetrate your skin is so important.</li>
            <li>These are the REAL DEAL, no \\&quot;pseudo-chemical-artificial\\&quot; ingredients that are cheap.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has no artificial ingredients and no animal testing</li>
            <li>I plan on trying the rose and tea tree scents next, as well as buy the unscented for my husband to try, so</li>
            <li>The bars of soap are more sudsy than the old, store bought soap we used to get.</li>
            <li>Also love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>and I love this natural fragrance.</li>
            <li>I use this to personally make my own laundry detergent and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Interesting</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>For most of my adult life I used Dove Unscented and was content.</li>
            <li>so I bought her a years worth for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
            <li>cup of borax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mix and place in container and your set.&lt;br /&gt;your load doesn&#x27;t require much to come out clean and smelling fresh</li>
            <li>It strips the oil right out of you.</li>
            <li>IT ALSO LATHERS VERY WELL AND RINSES CLEAN LEAVING NO RESIDUE.</li>
            <li>It lathers wonderfully in the shower, I use it as my facial cleanser and even grate up a bar for my laundry detergent (I add some other ingredients too)!  </li>
            <li>Could you get a better general bathroom soap?</li>
            <li>I love Dr. bornner&#x27;s product in general but not this one.</li>
            <li>Lasts long, smells nice, is cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>The lavender scent it really nice and not overly perfumey either, and it leaves my skin soft without a residue and never dried out.  </li>
            <li>and this is gentle and with healthy ingredients from a conscious company.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable</li>
            <li>Love the smell and love that it&#x27;s natural and uses organic ingredients (or at least more than others).</li>
            <li>Lasts long and has a very strong scent besides all the benefits of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soaps</li>
            <li>It is evident that THEY CARE, about our skin, about the environment and about those who provide them with the ingredients that they use.</li>
            <li>Came to our front door on the exact day stated.packaging</li>
            <li>Literally, the first night I washed my face with this bar my skin showed improvement.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>First time for this scent....</li>
            <li>I had no idea the soap came in so many different scents!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First, I lather up the bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably try that next. :-)</li>
            <li>but it has not failed me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Expensive though it is, my skin shows it is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use anything else unless I could make this exact soap at home.  </li>
            <li>for the soap itself, in the past I would use gel body wash because it lathers up really well, and I never cared for bar soap as I would end up going through it rather quickly just to get a good lather, but when I tried this I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it lathers up!  </li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender soap--very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin too much.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and lasts longer than other bars I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I really like the soap, it leaves my skin smooth, not dried out.</li>
            <li>Positive:    </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap on facebook in bulk for much less than I was spending on a per bar</li>
            <li>I like the scent so much that I keep my extra unused soaps in my clothing drawers to keep my clothes smelling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see that this soap is purely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-One Hemp LAVENDER PURE - CASTILE SOAP MADE WITH ORGANIC OILS</li>
            <li>I love this natural pure-castile soap, and because of its price (about 5 dollars or more) usually just purchased one or two bars at a time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a little under a week now and am so thrilled I made the switch.  </li>
            <li>and you feel clean but not dry!</li>
            <li>If you get it in your eyes it will really burn.</li>
            <li>It also perfumes your whole bathroom as it sits in your soap dish.  </li>
            <li>Extravagant way to feel environmentally responsible.</li>
            <li>, next time, I&#x27;ll go with the scent free.</li>
            <li>was very neat .thank</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really add moisture-</li>
            <li>both the stainless steel and the porcelin sink in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that I need to use much lotion after washing with this</li>
            <li>I went straight to the derm and they prescribed Epiduo and Aczone, which costs hundreds of dollars and takes months to see ANY changes in skin.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>Product as described fast shipment</li>
            <li>Really like it and will buy it again</li>
            <li>The whole bathroom smells like lavender.</li>
            <li>Also was delivery was really fast.</li>
            <li>$21 for six bars was really pushing it but $25</li>
            <li>It cleans very well and there is no sulfates which I think was making my head itchy.</li>
            <li>Works very well to make laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Its very fragrant and calming.</li>
            <li>Buying on Amazon is very economical compared to the local store.</li>
            <li>recommended by friend, long lasting, great lasting fragrance, gentle, all purpose face and bath soap, I bought a large pack.</li>
            <li>Today their are many other options but will always support this company.</li>
            <li>I added to my homemade detergent and it left my clothes smelling of lavender and clean no noticeable stains</li>
            <li>I usually buy it locally but this 6 bar pack was a great deal.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Using a straight razor, it glides fairly well, little dragging, I&#x27;ll definitely reorder. .</li>
            <li>It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li>It has been three days of using this along with Dickinsons morning and night and my cycstic acne, black heads, and Sebaceous Filaments are clearing up like magic.</li>
            <li>it takes less soap to make more lather.</li>
            <li>I love lavender scented anything, and this bar has a slight scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t help my husband acne skin at all which was a main reason I bought.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and i heard the bar was more gentle to wash your face with but that same day after using it i looked in the mirror and notice i had flaky dry patches</li>
            <li>These soaps are a little better for your body.  </li>
            <li>Although it dries my skin a little bit more than the store bought soaps</li>
            <li>Very real natural lavender scent.   </li>
            <li>Even my face, which is really sensitive, takes to it really well.  </li>
            <li>very cremy and soft foam</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s really comforting to know that it&#x27;s all natural,</li>
            <li>Whatever is applied to the skin is not only absorbed into the skin but into the body.  </li>
            <li>only drawback is the price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>But after a couple of showers I was able to tolerate it &amp; luckily it&#x27;s not so strong that it conflicts with my body lotion.</li>
            <li>My dermatitis stays calm as long as I keep using this particular soap.</li>
            <li>This is my family&#x27;s new soap.</li>
            <li>In turn, it&#x27;s not as easy to wash off your skin leaving a slight residue unless thoroughly rinsed.</li>
            <li>Very softly lavender.</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin, but could&#x27;t be happier with this soap.</li>
            <li>My grandson has very sensitive skin and can use this.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin which breaks out into a rash if I use any soap with sodium laurel or sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li>I use this soap for everything since I have very sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the liquid version too, but it doesn&#x27;t foam nearly as well.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, red-prone skin and everything</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The first time I&#x27;ve ever used organic soap&#x27;but it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, the bars last a lot longer than the commercial soap I used to buy (Irish Spring).  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>IF YOU USE conventional products in addition to this soap and do not see incredible results, it is due to the toxins in the conventional skin products.  </li>
            <li>I just never felt like my hair or scalp was clean after using the other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and almost every soap, even natural soaps irritate me.</li>
            <li>These essential oils are pure</li>
            <li>I like to keep my cleansing products as pure as possible.  </li>
            <li>Great for washing dirty balls</li>
            <li>and my skin is clear.</li>
            <li>realize it&#x27;s a natural lavender oil smell, but for me it&#x27;s terrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helped some but wasn&#x27;t really clearing me up enough.</li>
            <li>If you are moving to organic natural soaps and deodorants, this is where you should begin.</li>
            <li>and i didn&#x27;t have them early.</li>
            <li>~ in case you&#x27;re ever around sensitive people.</li>
            <li>Now we use them all of the time and introduce the soap to our visiting guests who frequent the islands.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my 3 year old son with no problem.     </li>
            <li>I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  </li>
            <li>I also use their liquid soap as shampoo for my 1-year old and shampoo for my dog with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and so does my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>I buy this soap because it is natural, you can use it for your hair and body and it lasts longer than bodywash.</li>
            <li>This soap is all natural.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m all for the organic, natural care products, bronner&#x27;s bar soap didn&#x27;t hold up to the test.</li>
            <li>The package doesn&#x27;t just claim that the ingredients are all natural; it delivers as promised.  </li>
            <li>I tried this soap when throwing out all of my old toxic beauty products.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough for my baby&#x27;s skin, too.</li>
            <li>No residue &amp; leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I ground up the soap bar and added it to natural laundry detergent I made.</li>
            <li>Also can shave the bar down and mix with water for lovely smelling hand soap that wont dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, it did burn down in my area with the very first use.</li>
            <li>I really wish I would have started using it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>I normally use an Ivory body bar, a tea tree facial bar, and sometimes use Roger and Gallet.</li>
            <li>It has not ruined them and turns them back to new.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands too much</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would work for my skin since its dry</li>
            <li>Easy to ring without any residue or negative feeling.</li>
            <li>So, I am a 26yr old female who recently just developed adult acne after years of manageable skin.</li>
            <li>The soap is extremely basic which strips the skin of your natural oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old guy who has used a lot of different soaps over the years.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS THE ONLY BAR SOAP THAT DOES NOT CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTIONS ON SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the lavender scent so far</li>
            <li>but I went back to my old soap after I went through my order.</li>
            <li>I also use this as my only hand soap and it keeps my hands soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s male with somewhat oily skin and hair, sensitive skin with detergent allergies and acne.</li>
            <li>only soap I&#x27;ve found so far that does not cause any itching or allergic reactions on my skin; also, the lavender does not sting my eyes like peppermint.</li>
            <li>The bar disintegrated super fast and went through a bar almost every week compared to it&#x27;s competitors of other types of natural soaps which lasted at least 2-3 weeks tops for two people.</li>
            <li>After learning of some of the harmful chemicals used in commercial soaps, hair (especially) and skin products, I decided to switch to all natural solutions.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li>: I do not use any other type of commercially produced conventional skin product - only Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and 100% extra virgin cold-pressed coconut oil, and more recently, Moon Valley Organics.</li>
            <li>Technically, it may not be as expensive as one might think, because it lathers so very easily</li>
            <li>i have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This lavender soap works well, but it loses it&#x27;s lavender scent rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the price for the bulk is worth it when, but the convenience factor definitely helps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped my young daughter&#x27;s dry skin patches immensely.</li>
            <li>But, this soap makes you (personally) feel for a little while that you are one of the peddles on the lavendar, and it cleans really well too.</li>

            <li> Anyway, I hit on this one, and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> but my hands feel so much better because they are not stripped of everything like the anti-bacterial soaps</li>
            <li> This is sooo much better.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the more milder scent of lavender &amp; not this earthy-like smell.</li>

            <li> B001ET77OI Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap,</li>
            <li> My favorite soap :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for about 7 years, and still prefer it to most everything.  </li>
            <li> Peppermint variant is my favorite, but they are all good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this soap....</li>
            <li> We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender soap and use nothing else.</li>
            <li> The scent is appealing...</li>
            <li> I was using Fels Naptha and some other bar soaps to make my own laundry soap but this works the best.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, leaves me feeling fresh, clean and relaxed.</li>
            <li> Rinses so clean and smells amazing all day.</li>
            <li> Nice and sudsy and clean without drying or itching my scalp.  </li>
            <li> This soap is nice and mild, lathers and cleans well, rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I am also using it for bathing, and it is wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> and clean super good</li>
            <li> Excellent straight up real lavender.</li>
            <li> It works great and contains no harsh chemicals at all!</li>
            <li> cup of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap (shredded or graded as finely as you</li>
            <li> good merchandise clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Lovely scents available.  </li>
            <li> Smell great and not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just seems like a good ethical company.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  </li>
            <li> I have kids with sensitive skin and this soap works great and the smell isn&#x27;t strong either.</li>
            <li> These soaps seem to have very good ingredients, and they last a good while with normal use.</li>
            <li> Packaging is a plus printed with 100% water based ink and definitely support fair trade!</li>
            <li> Just follow with a very mild rinse of water and vinegar to get it out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> Because finding it isn&#x27;t easy .</li>
            <li> There is something so old-school and easy about just using a bar of soap as opposed to liquid soap and all those germy space-wasting loofahs and poofs all over the shower.</li>
            <li> The soap is too strong.</li>
            <li> Smell is strong but fades.</li>
            <li> The detergent works fine, but the scent does not linger in the clothes.</li>
            <li> Scent disappears out of shower which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> pure and simple soaps that smell wonderful</li>
            <li> It is so gentle and so effective.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and it glides smoothly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, as we are making the switch to cruelty free brands.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> But now I enjoy putting lotion on my skin</li>
            <li> (R&amp;G products sometimes make me sneeze like I do with my mom&#x27;s cheap perfumes).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet, but I personally know those who have, and they say it works great for shampoo too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great soap which wife loves, cheaper than can be bought locally, eases sore bodies!</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT</li>
            <li> This is one that I can say that you get a great scent and nothing extra.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I chose Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, because it is all natural, non-toxic, and fair trade.</li>
            <li> I have had a love affair with this soap from the first time I tried it around 10 years.  </li>
            <li> It has a fragrant smell and makes rich, creamy lather.</li>
            <li> It is worth it!</li>
            <li> I rarely even need to use body lotion anymore!</li>
            <li> I love the lavender scent (which does not linger after rinsing), it lathers nicely, and leaves my skin feeling clean and not dry (tho not moisturized either -</li>
            <li> Like the fresh scent !</li>
            <li> I have tried several fragrances (rose and tea tree), but the Lavender is now my favorite.</li>
            <li> It cleans really well, and most importantly, my skin has improved since using it.  </li>
            <li> I feel really clean after shower &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells clean.....</li>
            <li> Our clothes get clean.  </li>
            <li> Super strong soap for super heros.  </li>
            <li> Such a pleasant scent and hopefully safe and pure.</li>
            <li> This bar provides a rich foamy lather and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love that it has pure ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love Dr Bronners products in general, but this soap is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how nicely this soap lathers.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap so much.  </li>
            <li> not at all overwhelming, and it lathers very well.</li>
            <li> My husband is very particular about any soap he use due to his sensitive skin but he marks this one one of the best and being a natural soap, I feel great knowing my family is using it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to grate up and dissolves fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to still have chemical free products such as this one.</li>
            <li> I saw such wonderful reviews and wanted to find a face wash that had some of the essential oils in it that people were raving about.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and this particular one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1 cup of arm and hammer&#x27;s super washing soda</li>
            <li> &gt; Any other kind (including organic ones or glycerin) will leave me with itchiness, redness, and more dryness.</li>
            <li> new brand of soap from now on.(it&#x27;s more expensif...</li>
            <li> I love this soap because of its pure and natural ingredients, because it is fair trade, and because this company is so ethical and committed to issues that I passionately believe in - namely, the promotion of and significant monetary contribution to non-GMO projects, Hemp farming, and more.  </li>
            <li> have very sensitive skin and blister with most antibacterial soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love you they come in a easy to open package.</li>
            <li> Pure soap with no chemicals that can penetrate your skin is so important.</li>
            <li> These are the REAL DEAL, no \\&quot;pseudo-chemical-artificial\\&quot; ingredients that are cheap.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has no artificial ingredients and no animal testing</li>
            <li> I plan on trying the rose and tea tree scents next, as well as buy the unscented for my husband to try, so</li>
            <li> The bars of soap are more sudsy than the old, store bought soap we used to get.</li>
            <li> Also love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> and I love this natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use this to personally make my own laundry detergent and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Interesting</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> For most of my adult life I used Dove Unscented and was content.</li>
            <li> so I bought her a years worth for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
            <li> cup of borax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mix and place in container and your set.&lt;br /&gt;your load doesn&#x27;t require much to come out clean and smelling fresh</li>
            <li> It strips the oil right out of you.</li>
            <li> IT ALSO LATHERS VERY WELL AND RINSES CLEAN LEAVING NO RESIDUE.</li>
            <li> It lathers wonderfully in the shower, I use it as my facial cleanser and even grate up a bar for my laundry detergent (I add some other ingredients too)!  </li>
            <li> Could you get a better general bathroom soap?</li>
            <li> I love Dr. bornner&#x27;s product in general but not this one.</li>
            <li> Lasts long, smells nice, is cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent it really nice and not overly perfumey either, and it leaves my skin soft without a residue and never dried out.  </li>
            <li> and this is gentle and with healthy ingredients from a conscious company.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> Love the smell and love that it&#x27;s natural and uses organic ingredients (or at least more than others).</li>
            <li> Lasts long and has a very strong scent besides all the benefits of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soaps</li>
            <li> It is evident that THEY CARE, about our skin, about the environment and about those who provide them with the ingredients that they use.</li>
            <li> Came to our front door on the exact day stated.packaging</li>
            <li> Literally, the first night I washed my face with this bar my skin showed improvement.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> First time for this scent....</li>
            <li> I had no idea the soap came in so many different scents!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First, I lather up the bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably try that next. :-)</li>
            <li> but it has not failed me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive though it is, my skin shows it is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else unless I could make this exact soap at home.  </li>
            <li> for the soap itself, in the past I would use gel body wash because it lathers up really well, and I never cared for bar soap as I would end up going through it rather quickly just to get a good lather, but when I tried this I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it lathers up!  </li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender soap--very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin too much.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and lasts longer than other bars I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I really like the soap, it leaves my skin smooth, not dried out.</li>
            <li> Positive:    </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap on facebook in bulk for much less than I was spending on a per bar</li>
            <li> I like the scent so much that I keep my extra unused soaps in my clothing drawers to keep my clothes smelling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see that this soap is purely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-One Hemp LAVENDER PURE - CASTILE SOAP MADE WITH ORGANIC OILS</li>
            <li> I love this natural pure-castile soap, and because of its price (about 5 dollars or more) usually just purchased one or two bars at a time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a little under a week now and am so thrilled I made the switch.  </li>
            <li> and you feel clean but not dry!</li>
            <li> If you get it in your eyes it will really burn.</li>
            <li> It also perfumes your whole bathroom as it sits in your soap dish.  </li>
            <li> Extravagant way to feel environmentally responsible.</li>
            <li> , next time, I&#x27;ll go with the scent free.</li>
            <li> was very neat .thank</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really add moisture-</li>
            <li> both the stainless steel and the porcelin sink in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that I need to use much lotion after washing with this</li>
            <li> I went straight to the derm and they prescribed Epiduo and Aczone, which costs hundreds of dollars and takes months to see ANY changes in skin.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> Product as described fast shipment</li>
            <li> Really like it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> The whole bathroom smells like lavender.</li>
            <li> Also was delivery was really fast.</li>
            <li> $21 for six bars was really pushing it but $25</li>
            <li> It cleans very well and there is no sulfates which I think was making my head itchy.</li>
            <li> Works very well to make laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Its very fragrant and calming.</li>
            <li> Buying on Amazon is very economical compared to the local store.</li>
            <li> recommended by friend, long lasting, great lasting fragrance, gentle, all purpose face and bath soap, I bought a large pack.</li>
            <li> Today their are many other options but will always support this company.</li>
            <li> I added to my homemade detergent and it left my clothes smelling of lavender and clean no noticeable stains</li>
            <li> I usually buy it locally but this 6 bar pack was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Using a straight razor, it glides fairly well, little dragging, I&#x27;ll definitely reorder. .</li>
            <li> It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li> It has been three days of using this along with Dickinsons morning and night and my cycstic acne, black heads, and Sebaceous Filaments are clearing up like magic.</li>
            <li> it takes less soap to make more lather.</li>
            <li> I love lavender scented anything, and this bar has a slight scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t help my husband acne skin at all which was a main reason I bought.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and i heard the bar was more gentle to wash your face with but that same day after using it i looked in the mirror and notice i had flaky dry patches</li>
            <li> These soaps are a little better for your body.  </li>
            <li> Although it dries my skin a little bit more than the store bought soaps</li>
            <li> Very real natural lavender scent.   </li>
            <li> Even my face, which is really sensitive, takes to it really well.  </li>
            <li> very cremy and soft foam</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s really comforting to know that it&#x27;s all natural,</li>
            <li> Whatever is applied to the skin is not only absorbed into the skin but into the body.  </li>
            <li> only drawback is the price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> But after a couple of showers I was able to tolerate it &amp; luckily it&#x27;s not so strong that it conflicts with my body lotion.</li>
            <li> My dermatitis stays calm as long as I keep using this particular soap.</li>
            <li> This is my family&#x27;s new soap.</li>
            <li> In turn, it&#x27;s not as easy to wash off your skin leaving a slight residue unless thoroughly rinsed.</li>
            <li> Very softly lavender.</li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin, but could&#x27;t be happier with this soap.</li>
            <li> My grandson has very sensitive skin and can use this.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin which breaks out into a rash if I use any soap with sodium laurel or sodium laureth sulfate.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for everything since I have very sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the liquid version too, but it doesn&#x27;t foam nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, red-prone skin and everything</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The first time I&#x27;ve ever used organic soap&#x27;but it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, the bars last a lot longer than the commercial soap I used to buy (Irish Spring).  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> IF YOU USE conventional products in addition to this soap and do not see incredible results, it is due to the toxins in the conventional skin products.  </li>
            <li> I just never felt like my hair or scalp was clean after using the other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and almost every soap, even natural soaps irritate me.</li>
            <li> These essential oils are pure</li>
            <li> I like to keep my cleansing products as pure as possible.  </li>
            <li> Great for washing dirty balls</li>
            <li> and my skin is clear.</li>
            <li> realize it&#x27;s a natural lavender oil smell, but for me it&#x27;s terrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helped some but wasn&#x27;t really clearing me up enough.</li>
            <li> If you are moving to organic natural soaps and deodorants, this is where you should begin.</li>
            <li> and i didn&#x27;t have them early.</li>
            <li> ~ in case you&#x27;re ever around sensitive people.</li>
            <li> Now we use them all of the time and introduce the soap to our visiting guests who frequent the islands.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my 3 year old son with no problem.     </li>
            <li> I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  </li>
            <li> I also use their liquid soap as shampoo for my 1-year old and shampoo for my dog with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and so does my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> I buy this soap because it is natural, you can use it for your hair and body and it lasts longer than bodywash.</li>
            <li> This soap is all natural.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m all for the organic, natural care products, bronner&#x27;s bar soap didn&#x27;t hold up to the test.</li>
            <li> The package doesn&#x27;t just claim that the ingredients are all natural; it delivers as promised.  </li>
            <li> I tried this soap when throwing out all of my old toxic beauty products.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough for my baby&#x27;s skin, too.</li>
            <li> No residue &amp; leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I ground up the soap bar and added it to natural laundry detergent I made.</li>
            <li> Also can shave the bar down and mix with water for lovely smelling hand soap that wont dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, it did burn down in my area with the very first use.</li>
            <li> I really wish I would have started using it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I normally use an Ivory body bar, a tea tree facial bar, and sometimes use Roger and Gallet.</li>
            <li> It has not ruined them and turns them back to new.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands too much</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would work for my skin since its dry</li>
            <li> Easy to ring without any residue or negative feeling.</li>
            <li> So, I am a 26yr old female who recently just developed adult acne after years of manageable skin.</li>
            <li> The soap is extremely basic which strips the skin of your natural oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old guy who has used a lot of different soaps over the years.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS THE ONLY BAR SOAP THAT DOES NOT CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTIONS ON SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the lavender scent so far</li>
            <li> but I went back to my old soap after I went through my order.</li>
            <li> I also use this as my only hand soap and it keeps my hands soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s male with somewhat oily skin and hair, sensitive skin with detergent allergies and acne.</li>
            <li> only soap I&#x27;ve found so far that does not cause any itching or allergic reactions on my skin; also, the lavender does not sting my eyes like peppermint.</li>
            <li> The bar disintegrated super fast and went through a bar almost every week compared to it&#x27;s competitors of other types of natural soaps which lasted at least 2-3 weeks tops for two people.</li>
            <li> After learning of some of the harmful chemicals used in commercial soaps, hair (especially) and skin products, I decided to switch to all natural solutions.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li> : I do not use any other type of commercially produced conventional skin product - only Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and 100% extra virgin cold-pressed coconut oil, and more recently, Moon Valley Organics.</li>
            <li> Technically, it may not be as expensive as one might think, because it lathers so very easily</li>
            <li> i have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This lavender soap works well, but it loses it&#x27;s lavender scent rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the price for the bulk is worth it when, but the convenience factor definitely helps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped my young daughter&#x27;s dry skin patches immensely.</li>
            <li> But, this soap makes you (personally) feel for a little while that you are one of the peddles on the lavendar, and it cleans really well too.</li>
            <li> I felt cleaner than I have with other soaps and it still left my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Even when labeled \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; or \\&quot;with vitamine e\\&quot; other soaps were all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Relatively long lasting bar.</li>
            <li> Gotta say I am disappointed in the soap read all these good reviews...</li>
            <li> but my skin is still dry on my second bar now...</li>
            <li> I will keep buying these as they keep my skin moist and don&#x27;t dry up like regular soaps.</li>
            <li> The soap is at a high cost for six bars but the bars are thick in my opinion and will last you a long enough time.</li>
            <li> It literally left me with flaky skin and took the little oil off the face that i barely had.</li>
            <li> My wife pointed out that since I started using this harder soap, she has to occasionally treat the drain pipe with Liquid Plumber.  </li>
            <li> I do remember this was a problem in my parents house too, as all soap was much harder back in those days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All organic ingredients and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the other scents fall apart just as fast,</li>
            <li> So it last long compared to other product.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I have tried other soaps and am always amazed at how dry my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for soap that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Not for people with dry faces.</li>
            <li> they were so dry and</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel softer and not so dry.  </li>
            <li> 5.It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.   </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> my dry skin just loves it.  </li>
            <li> Helps mositurize dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I began to have problems with dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, when getting one bar at a time, of a product that chain stores just don&#x27;t carry (at least in my area), the prices tends to be rather high.  </li>
            <li> A single 5 oz bar costs $4.79 at Target vs $4.16 here, plus</li>
            <li> I have severe chemical sensitivities, so I have to be careful with soap and other personal products.</li>
            <li> It appears the harder soap is congealing in the trap after the hot water has flushed the tub down after the shower, and it&#x27;s leaving a layer of scum that attaches to the trap as the last of the water cools down.  </li>
            <li> 4.It doesn&#x27;t fall apart in the shower, although it is a little softer than regular soap.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra for a product that resonates with my values.</li>
            <li> My second complaint is how harsh it is on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t leave it on a wet dish soap.   </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I love natural soaps but some smell weird or almost fake.</li>
            <li> I could not prevent and would be forced to use conditioner, but so far I haven&#x27;t had that problem.  </li>
            <li> The scent is soft and subtle and not over powering.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to stay longer than the other fragrances for me.</li>
            <li> (like other can do)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is completely due to size, but also to the &amp;#34;hardness&amp;#34; of the bar.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy anymore-I wished it didn&#x27;t do this b/c other than that</li>
            <li> I will say that I noticed my skin is a tiny bit dryer than usual</li>
            <li> I chose this product because all the other soaps that I&#x27;ve used that you&#x27;d buy in the stores have harmful chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not melted in the water as you can read in other review.</li>
            <li> It seems to leave an odd film in my sinks-</li>
            <li> I have always hated bar soaps, so I have been rather surprised by how much I enjoy using this bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; at all due to how dry I feel after using this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell any lavender scent in this soap and sometimes I can smell even a sour smell.</li>
            <li> I grate the bar soap &amp; then chop in the food processor to break down even finer.</li>
            <li> Amazon beats the price; hands down.</li>
            <li> My dry skin is a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have that slight greasy coating I get from using another soap brand.</li>
            <li> Typically my household uses body wash, so I&#x27;m going to take a couple of the bars and prepare a liquid soap as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap for a lot of things in the past, I&#x27;ve never really used the bar soap.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t get dry or tangled either, which it used to after using those bottled shampoos (which I will not name here), and I was forced to apply conditioner afterwards.  </li>
            <li> This is one of life&#x27;s little luxuries.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;my little pleasure)</li>
            <li> I switched to the cold cream bars that left me with a overall film.</li>
            <li> Yet, it doesn&#x27;t maker my skin feel all dried out either.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend is very particular with the soap she uses and I tried about a half dozen local organic soaps and she hated all of them.</li>
            <li> I hate the way it makes my body and hands feel too like super waxy.</li>
            <li> But after that no more.</li>
            <li> and I used it in the shower on my hair after I had shampooed with my usual suave.</li>
            <li> Another thing is in the winter my hair gets extremely staticky with the cold, dry weather, and this was something I figured</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper to buy in bulk and lavender is hard to find in the supermarket</li>

            <li> won&#x27;t buy again not trying to be negative</li>

            <li> Expensive for bar soap</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell that I don&#x27;t like.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great soap with good lather and a calming fragrance. I always buy it as a treat for family members.</li>
            <li> Forget Dove, this is the beat soap for my skin. The best of all, it&#x27;s organic!!!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  The lavender scent is wonderful and the soap is very sudsy which is important to me.</li>
            <li> I love, love this soap! It is gentle and smells delicious! The only soap I use for my kids&#x27; bath.</li>
            <li> I have had a love affair with this soap from the first time I tried it around 10 years.  I have not found a soap that compares or even comes close to this brand.  The scent is heavenly, the lathering wonderful and yet the soap is so gentle, rinses clean and is not drying.  Being USDA certified organic and Fair Trade certainly is not bad either.</li>
            <li> Smells very strong, i put them in my drawers to scent my clothes</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s magic soaps are THE ANSWER for anybody with skin conditions. I have psoriasis and this is the only soap that I can use with gusto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Any other kind (including organic ones or glycerin) will leave me with itchiness, redness, and more dryness. Even when labeled \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; or \\&quot;with vitamine e\\&quot; other soaps were all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s now for 8 years. I prefer the bars to the liquid.&lt;br /&gt; Lately I have started using it for my hair (no sulfates) and applying \\&quot;pureology\\&quot; conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Just look at the variety of essential oils used in each bar: coconut, palm oil, jojoba, lavender and hemp. These are the REAL DEAL, no \\&quot;pseudo-chemical-artificial\\&quot; ingredients that are cheap. These essential oils are pure luxury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I want to thank this company for its excellent products. It is evident that THEY CARE, about our skin, about the environment and about those who provide them with the ingredients that they use. I hope they keep the good work for years and years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soaps for several years. They are excellent products that are good for the environment, yet gentle and effective cleaning for your skin. I have tried several fragrances (rose and tea tree), but the Lavender is now my favorite. It has a fragrant smell and makes rich, creamy lather. The scent seems to stay longer than the other fragrances for me. You can smell the freshness even if the package hasn&#x27;t been opened. I love this soap and hope you will too.</li>
            <li> Nice product smell awesome!! and clean super good</li>
            <li> Smells so amazing!  We use this in a homemade laundry detergent and it works great.  I mix this lavender scent with Jasmine essential oils and I just love it!! Gets the job done!</li>
            <li> We have been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for a while now and we love it! It works great and contains no harsh chemicals at all!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. The first time I&#x27;ve ever used organic soap&#x27;but it won&#x27;t be the last.I felt cleaner than I have with other soaps and it still left my skin soft. I think I&#x27;m going to try almond next.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap.  Not a fan of the liquid soaps they offer, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the bar soap.  The lavender smells amazing and you feel clean but not dry! I would recommend this to everyone.  Get rid of all your chemical filled soap bars and use something thats natural, good for the environment and works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I have senstive skin. And this is the perfect soap for me.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Lots  of lather and rinses  well.</li>
            <li> Negative:    I have two complaints. The soap doesn&#x27;t lather up as well as Dr. Bronners liquid soap. In turn, it&#x27;s not as easy to wash off your skin leaving a slight residue unless thoroughly rinsed. My second complaint is how harsh it is on sensitive skin. The soap is extremely basic which strips the skin of your natural oils. If you get it in your eyes it will really burn. I prefer a more neutral soap.    Positive:    Packaging is a plus printed with 100% water based ink and definitely support fair trade! Some people were complaining that it doesn&#x27;t smell like lavender, my opinion is it smells just like it.    Conlusion:    Dr. Bronner&#x27;s company started it all. In an array of chemicals in the 20th century they were the gleam of hope. Today their are many other options but will always support this company.</li>
            <li> smells divine, and is the only body soap I&#x27;ve found that helps keep my body acne at bay.  This also doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my eczema.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender soap--very mild and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin too much.</li>
            <li> I know this soap is expensive, however... This soap is amazing!  If you like lavender scent, then this is the soap for you.  What&#x27;s best is it&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.  It also perfumes your whole bathroom as it sits in your soap dish.  Just take a look at the ingredients I&#x27;ve listed below and you&#x27;ll see that this soap is purely natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to list some of the information on the bar (as well as ingredients in case you have any known allergies):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-One Hemp LAVENDER PURE - CASTILE SOAP MADE WITH ORGANIC OILS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:  Organic Coconut Oil, Organic Palm Oil, Sodium Hydroxide, Water, Lavandin Extract, Organic Olive Oil, Organic Fair Deal Hemp Oil, Organic Jojoba Oil, Lavender Extract, Sea Salt, Citric Acid, Tocopherol</li>
            <li> Such a pleasant scent and hopefully safe and pure.</li>
            <li> The soap is too strong. It strips the oil right out of you. It feels like something that should be cleaning a floor, not a person. Not sure how this is &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; at all due to how dry I feel after using this product.</li>
            <li> Gotta say I am disappointed in the soap read all these good reviews... I was hoping for soap that didn&#x27;t dry out my skin but my skin is still dry on my second bar now...won&#x27;t buy again not trying to be negative but when you read all the reviews how great the soap is and it&#x27;s just not for me I guess</li>
            <li> Excellent soap.  I use it for shampoo as well as body soap.  Just follow with a very mild rinse of water and vinegar to get it out of your hair.  Lovely scents available.  Extravagant way to feel environmentally responsible.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell any lavender scent in this soap and sometimes I can smell even a sour smell. Reminds me of Ivory soap. Leaves a lot of soap scum in shower/tub.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap bar I have ever used. Great suds, great smell, and my skin doesn&#x27;t get dry, even in the winter. Love it.</li>
            <li> This soap is nice and mild, lathers and cleans well, rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;Also doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands too much (like other can do)&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and blister with most antibacterial soaps.&lt;br /&gt;Thought I&#x27;d give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically I have no complaints .. except for one (the Lavender smell is awful)&lt;br /&gt;I realize it&#x27;s a natural lavender oil smell, but for me it&#x27;s terrible.&lt;br /&gt;My wife says it makes her nose itch?&lt;br /&gt;I keep hoping the smell from the bar goes away over time (and it does seem to diminish over time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, next time, I&#x27;ll go with the scent free.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I specifically use it to make my own laundry detergent (it is EXCELLENT for that!). It is so gentle and so effective.</li>
            <li> I was using the Tea tree version of this soap for my perioral dermatitis. It helped some but wasn&#x27;t really clearing me up enough. So I tried the lavender version and have had way better results. It also helps to deodorize the body better for some reason. My dermatitis stays calm as long as I keep using this particular soap. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really do love this soap.  I realize it is a luxury and when your in the shower and you suds us a wash cloth you feel like you have made it.  I love this scent as well as the Peppermint one.  They are both so soothing and I will continue to purchase before I run out.</li>
            <li> Buy this soap. Seriously. If you are moving to organic natural soaps and deodorants, this is where you should begin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old guy who has used a lot of different soaps over the years. The Dr Bronner bar soaps are the best yet. I also like that no animals were harmed in making this product.</li>
            <li> Not for people with dry faces. I was really hoping this would work for my skin since its dry and i heard the bar was more gentle to wash your face with but that same day after using it i looked in the mirror and notice i had flaky dry patches and i didn&#x27;t have them early. It literally left me with flaky skin and took the little oil off the face that i barely had. I hate the way it makes my body and hands feel too like super waxy. It also made me jawline itch so bad in the night. It is good for washing makeup brushes tho.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this soap .it was a great price.  Happy that we didn&#x27;t have to go to store for it. Because finding it isn&#x27;t easy . Came to our front door on the exact day stated.packaging was very neat .thank u</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to make homemade laundry detergent and for the lavender scent. The detergent works fine, but the scent does not linger in the clothes. I am also using it for bathing, and it is wonderful for dry skin. I like the fact that it has no artificial ingredients and no animal testing</li>
            <li> This is wonderful soap and I am very comfortable with its purity.  I highly recommend it.  It&#x27;s nice to still have chemical free products such as this one.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmmmmmm!!! I just love, love, love this soap. I even wash my hair with it. I love lavendar. You don&#x27;t exude the scent of lavendar, like you have perfume on after you use it either, which is good ~ in case you&#x27;re ever around sensitive people. But, this soap makes you (personally) feel for a little while that you are one of the peddles on the lavendar, and it cleans really well too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap! It leaves your body feeling clean and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Added comment on 4/19/16 - still my favorite soap.  Have bought a years&#x27;+ supply.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional comment added on 8/29/12 - My wife pointed out that since I started using this harder soap, she has to occasionally treat the drain pipe with Liquid Plumber.  (she&#x27;s very handy with knowing lots of stuff - I&#x27;d be lost without her)... anyway, she said that with the Irish Spring, she never had to do that.  It appears the harder soap is congealing in the trap after the hot water has flushed the tub down after the shower, and it&#x27;s leaving a layer of scum that attaches to the trap as the last of the water cools down.  It&#x27;s not a show-stopper, but it&#x27;s something I thought I should add to the review.  I do remember this was a problem in my parents house too, as all soap was much harder back in those days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review starts here:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for a while for &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; ingredient soaps, and I have bought several to try out.  However, when getting one bar at a time, of a product that chain stores just don&#x27;t carry (at least in my area), the prices tends to be rather high.  Anyway, I hit on this one, and I really love it.  The scent is pleasant, but not overpowering.  It cleans really well, and most importantly, my skin has improved since using it.  Interestingly, the bars last a lot longer than the commercial soap I used to buy (Irish Spring).  I don&#x27;t think this is completely due to size, but also to the &amp;#34;hardness&amp;#34; of the bar.  It lathers very well, but we do have a good water softener, so that does make for good lathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is so good, I can wash my hair with it, and it feels just as good as using a good natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really like the soap, it leaves my skin smooth, not dried out. I will get the unscented next time but he lavender, and the peppermint, both leave the bathroom smelling great!</li>
            <li> Could you get a better general bathroom soap? NO!</li>
            <li> I am a teacher and I wash my hands all day- they were so dry and itchy- I had given up!  I got this stuff and plan on buying the liquid, it smells great, lathers great, and best of all doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.  It doesn&#x27;t really add moisture- but my hands feel so much better because they are not stripped of everything like the anti-bacterial soaps do- Everyone should switch- I am going to get them for all my friends and family- good price on here too!    Later note- I did go get this in the liquid form and put it in my bathrooms and kitchen.  It seems to leave an odd film in my sinks- both the stainless steel and the porcelin sink in my bathroom.  It drove me nuts b/c it made the sinks look dirty.  Once I ran out I didn&#x27;t buy anymore-I wished it didn&#x27;t do this b/c other than that I liked it!</li>
            <li> Great soaps, when you can get them and this is the provider than has proven it can deliver a quality product. Nice work.</li>
            <li> Some may think that buying an organic soap should not matter since you wash it off within seconds. I disagree. You should know what you&#x27;re putting on your skin and Bronner&#x27;s is the best i found out there so far</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel softer and not so dry.  I would definitely recommend to others.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I do like this soap! Gentle on my skin. I feel really clean after shower &amp; yet my skin still has moisture to it. But  I still use my lotion. The bar lasts longer than regular soap cause the smallest amount makes A LOT of lather! And doesn&#x27;t leave behind soap scum. Yes! Although this is a bit pricey. I&#x27;ve decided to stop using regular soap. This is sooo much better. I just didn&#x27;t like this lavender scent. I thought I was getting the more milder scent of lavender &amp; not this earthy-like smell. Was very disappointed. But after a couple of showers I was able to tolerate it &amp; luckily it&#x27;s not so strong that it conflicts with my body lotion. Aside from that, I&#x27;d recommend this soap to any &amp; everyone, especially those with skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it did burn down in my area with the very first use. But after that no more.</li>
            <li> I have used this multiple times and will continue to purchase from Amazon.  I make my own powdered laundry soap and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is my favorite bar soap to use in it.  The lavender adds just enough fragrance.  It&#x27;s a great deal too...they are $5/bar at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this brand of soap.  I was introduced to Dr. Bronner by my daughter.  Now we use them all of the time and introduce the soap to our visiting guests who frequent the islands.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot, Don&#x27;t like the price. But works good</li>
            <li> I use it to wear my underwear. I put this soap in my bathroom, the lavender smell spreads everywhere. It is so nice, I even don&#x27;t need to use candle in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Excellent straight up real lavender. Scent disappears out of shower which is fine with me. The soap is at a high cost for six bars but the bars are thick in my opinion and will last you a long enough time.</li>
            <li> 1.This soap lathers so well.  2. It rinses off without residue.   3.The smell is just wonderful if you like lavender. Very real natural lavender scent.   4.It doesn&#x27;t fall apart in the shower, although it is a little softer than regular soap. So don&#x27;t leave it on a wet dish soap.   5.It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.   6.I love the fact that it is organic.  7.Made by a reputable company.  8.With now fair traded ingredients.   9.Coop America approved.  10.Minimum packaged. Plus you can recycle the paper packaging (no plastic).    I have very sensitive skin, and almost every soap, even natural soaps irritate me. But with this one I have not had that problem. I have been using for over a year now. I even use it on my 3 year old son with no problem.     I also use it for shaving my legs, bikini area and underarms with no irritation or bumps. It lathers well and it glides smoothly. I think the lavender helps my skin at shaving time.</li>
            <li> Good organic body soap. Easy to ring without any residue or negative feeling.</li>
            <li> Loves this soap! Relatively long lasting bar. I don&#x27;t feel that I need to use much lotion after washing with this - the oils soak into my skin nicely. This is the closest I&#x27;ve come to handmade soap.  The lavender scent is my favorite. Very softly lavender.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I use it to wash my face that has acne, and it clears it up! It is great just to have one bar that does everything! Also, the lavender scent is a very nice touch!</li>
            <li> This lavender soap works well, but it loses it&#x27;s lavender scent rather quickly. In the package, it smells great.  After one use, it smells like a weak version of the eucalyptus.  Super strong soap for super heros.  Not for people who like frou-frou soap that leaves a slime layer.</li>
            <li> Great soaps and soap products!  I tried some others but I always seem to end up coming back to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The line is just awesome!</li>
            <li> Use it to make DIY laundry soap. Smells divine.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this soap, it is so relaxing.  I bought this for my husband, as we are making the switch to cruelty free brands.  He has very sensitive skin, but could&#x27;t be happier with this soap.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap. Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap is made with organic oils. The lavender soap has a beautiful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great for washing dirty balls</li>
            <li> OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN USING THIS SOAP FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND IT IS THE ONLY BAR SOAP THAT DOES NOT CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTIONS ON SENSITIVE SKIN. IT ALSO LATHERS VERY WELL AND RINSES CLEAN LEAVING NO RESIDUE. BUYING ONLINE SAVES ABOUT 40% OFF MOST HEALTH STORE PRICES.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it! I use Dr. Bonner&#x27;s soaps for everything from bath soap to complection soap &amp; even to make laundry detergent to wash my clothes! I grate the bar soap &amp; then chop in the food processor to break down even finer. Add 1 cup soap to 1 cup 20 Mule Team Borax to 1 cup of Arm &amp; Hammer Washing soda. Use 3 tablespoons per load in your washer. Very inexpensive &amp; does a great job of cleaning. Low sudsing with no phosphates so you can use in HE washers. Good for your clothes, washing machine, septic system &amp; our environment! The lavender is my favorite scent for laundry detergent!    ckaras ~ Wake Forest, NC</li>
            <li> So, I am a 26yr old female who recently just developed adult acne after years of manageable skin. I FREAKED to say the least. I went straight to the derm and they prescribed Epiduo and Aczone, which costs hundreds of dollars and takes months to see ANY changes in skin. I was desperate and started looking into the OCM  (oil cleaning method) of skin care. I saw such wonderful reviews and wanted to find a face wash that had some of the essential oils in it that people were raving about. THIS IS IT! The hemp seed oil and the tea tree oil has done wonders. Literally, the first night I washed my face with this bar my skin showed improvement. I purchased it at Walgreens along with a bottle of Dickinson&#x27;s Witch hazel. It has been three days of using this along with Dickinsons morning and night and my cycstic acne, black heads, and Sebaceous Filaments are clearing up like magic. I am a true believer. I am buying a bar of this for everyone I love.</li>
            <li> The best soap I&#x27;ve ever used!  My dry skin is a thing of the past.  I now know if was caused by the soap I was using and I used many brands throughout the years.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Rinses so clean and smells amazing all day.</li>
            <li> Love Dr Bronners products in general, but this soap is my favorite. No residue after using it and smells great.</li>
            <li> Love Dr Bonners products.  First time for this scent....it is heavenly.  Will be buying LOTS MORE OF THIS.  Price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> Smell is perfect, and skin feels so soft after use.  It&#x27;s a keeper for sure!  It&#x27;s helped my young daughter&#x27;s dry skin patches immensely.</li>
            <li> I shred this and use it in my homemade laundry detergent as well as washing my hands with it. Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and this particular one.</li>
            <li> Lasts long and has a very strong scent besides all the benefits of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soaps</li>
            <li> I am in love with this soap!  I cannot say enough good things about it.  It smells amazing and lasts longer than other bars I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This soap is great! It smells wonderful, and we use it for hand and body soap.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap and I use it when I travel because it can also be used as shampoo. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy in bulk and lavender is hard to find in the supermarket so I&#x27;m happy with this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently been switching over to organic/natural products, and switching my soap was the easiest thing to do.  I didn&#x27;t buy this product on Amazon; I picked it up at my local Target to try it out.  Now that I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon, however, I will be purchasing it here from now on.  A single 5 oz bar costs $4.79 at Target vs $4.16 here, plus I have Prime, and the closest Target to me is over 40 miles away.&lt;br /&gt;As for the soap itself, in the past I would use gel body wash because it lathers up really well, and I never cared for bar soap as I would end up going through it rather quickly just to get a good lather, but when I tried this I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it lathers up!  I really wish I would have started using it a long time ago.  The lavender scent it really nice and not overly perfumey either, and it leaves my skin soft without a residue and never dried out.  Even my face, which is really sensitive, takes to it really well.  I even use it as my shampoo.  My hair is longer than shoulder-length, and I just work up the soap in my hands and apply it to my hair and walla!  Nice and sudsy and clean without drying or itching my scalp.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get dry or tangled either, which it used to after using those bottled shampoos (which I will not name here), and I was forced to apply conditioner afterwards.  Another thing is in the winter my hair gets extremely staticky with the cold, dry weather, and this was something I figured I could not prevent and would be forced to use conditioner, but so far I haven&#x27;t had that problem.  I really can&#x27;t believe it.  So thank you, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!  I plan on trying the rose and tea tree scents next, as well as buy the unscented for my husband to try, so thank you Amazon for making these products available!  I had no idea the soap came in so many different scents!</li>
            <li> Expensive for bar soap but we Love it. Smell is strong but fades. My grandson has very sensitive skin and can use this.</li>
            <li> Love love love this soap! Will be ordering agsin!</li>
            <li> I use this instead of Fels Naptha in my home made laundry soap. Leaves a hint of lavender smell, which most homemade soaps don&#x27;t do. Feel comfortable using this on my babies clothes and saves money on detergent! Also can shave the bar down and mix with water for lovely smelling hand soap that wont dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> We used this product to make liquid hand soap and laundry soap. Both turned out great! Very gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful. My husband and I use it in the shower. Of course I wish it was cheaper, but you get what you pay for. It is worth it!</li>
            <li> I initially found this soap at Whole Foods here in Houston and got some for me and my Mom to try.  She loved it and so did I.  It does not dry out your skin and it cleans thoroughly.  It only takes a little of it to build a good lather and you can tell it is cleaning your skin.  The smell is nice and you get an overall pleasant experience from using this type of soap.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have that slight greasy coating I get from using another soap brand.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this soap. I have kids with sensitive skin and this soap works great and the smell isn&#x27;t strong either.</li>
            <li> Product as described fast shipment</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is an awesome product. I also use their liquid soap as shampoo for my 1-year old and shampoo for my dog with sensitive skin. The bars of soap are more sudsy than the old, store bought soap we used to get. Will continue to order over and over again.</li>
            <li> very nice soap. Lasts long, smells nice, is cruelty-free. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  Really like it and will buy it again</li>
            <li> Love the scent!! Great lather too! I use this and so does my 6 year old. We both love it!</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Love lavender and frankly taking a shower is a treat when you get to use this soap. Great scent to wake you up. I even take it with me when I travel - cutting the bar in half.</li>
            <li> Great soap, you can even wash your hair with it.</li>
            <li> The lavender smells delicious.  It has a nice lingering scent.  It lathers well.  Using a straight razor, it glides fairly well, little dragging, I&#x27;ll definitely reorder. .</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is fantastic! I love the lavender!! Smells so wonderful and the bars of soap lasts longer than those cheaper brands. The only soap I buy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Soaps!!!  I will keep buying these as they keep my skin moist and don&#x27;t dry up like regular soaps.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Love anything from Dr Bronner!  All organic ingredients and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL! The whole bathroom smells like lavender. It&#x27;s so refreshing and it feels great.</li>
            <li> This is literally all i need in the shower.</li>
            <li> I buy this soap because it is natural, you can use it for your hair and body and it lasts longer than bodywash. My only issue with it is that it seems to be a bit drying so you have to make sure to lubricate your body afterwards to avoid the ash attack.</li>
            <li> Really nice soap for the shower or sink!  This will be one of our regular purchases in the future.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is very particular with the soap she uses and I tried about a half dozen local organic soaps and she hated all of them. I ordered these and she was very happy. The scent, the lather, everything was perfect for her. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Pure soap with no chemicals that can penetrate your skin is so important. I love all their products! Smell great and not harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is all natural.  It smells wonderful.  It lathers up well.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time. As expected.</li>
            <li> Dankest soap ever, though I prefer it in liquid form.</li>
            <li> Love this ORGANIC soap - has a wonderful aroma and leaves the skin soft. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this as a replacement for the solid cleanser that comes with the beauty blender, as well as a cleaner for the rest of my brushes. First, I lather up the bar of soap. Then, I swirl my brushes into it. So far, so good. The bristles are all in tact. It has not ruined them and turns them back to new. I&#x27;ve only used the lavender scent so far and it smells heavenly. Also love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap for a lot of things in the past, I&#x27;ve never really used the bar soap. While I&#x27;m all for the organic, natural care products, bronner&#x27;s bar soap didn&#x27;t hold up to the test. The bar disintegrated super fast and went through a bar almost every week compared to it&#x27;s competitors of other types of natural soaps which lasted at least 2-3 weeks tops for two people. Not sure if the other scents fall apart just as fast, but I went back to my old soap after I went through my order.</li>
            <li> This is one of life&#x27;s little luxuries. I love that it has pure ingredients. I have very sensitive skin which breaks out into a rash if I use any soap with sodium laurel or sodium laureth sulfate. This does not have either and my skin is clear. I will say that I noticed my skin is a tiny bit dryer than usual once I switched to using this soap every day twice a day. But now I enjoy putting lotion on my skin so I don&#x27;t care. There is something so old-school and easy about just using a bar of soap as opposed to liquid soap and all those germy space-wasting loofahs and poofs all over the shower.</li>
            <li> Sometimes people forget that our skin is an organ just like the heart, kidneys, etc.  Whatever is applied to the skin is not only absorbed into the skin but into the body.  I like to keep my cleansing products as pure as possible.  Dr Bronner&#x27;s has kept the same formula all these years.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years.  Occasionally I have tried other soaps and am always amazed at how dry my skin feels.  I bring this soap when I travel too.  Buying on Amazon is very economical compared to the local store.</li>
            <li> The soap is very nice.  The lavender scent is awful. I keep hoping that the chemical smell will go away.</li>
            <li> great for making soaps</li>
            <li> I buy this soap on a regular basis. I have severe chemical sensitivities, so I have to be careful with soap and other personal products. This soap works perfectly for my issues. Since I can&#x27;t find it locally, I buy it in quantity online.</li>
            <li> good merchandise clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I love you they come in a easy to open package. The hemp lavender soap smell great. I added to my homemade detergent and it left my clothes smelling of lavender and clean no noticeable stains</li>
            <li> Always a good buy! I use this soap for everything since I have very sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s a miracle product. Not sure if the price for the bulk is worth it when, but the convenience factor definitely helps. I use about one bar a month and I shower daily. Great soap, in all its forms and scents.</li>
            <li> My husband is very particular about any soap he use due to his sensitive skin but he marks this one one of the best and being a natural soap, I feel great knowing my family is using it.  We love the lavender scent!</li>
            <li> This soap gets me clean and the lavender smells wonderful.  I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I use this to make home made laundry soap and it gets out stains that commercial soaps did not.  I also use this as my only hand soap and it keeps my hands soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I love it this soap.  The package doesn&#x27;t just claim that the ingredients are all natural; it delivers as promised.  No foreign-sounding chemicals or mystery ingredients or dyes.  It is all-natural.  The aroma is very pleasant.  There&#x27;s nothing more calming than the scent of lavender infusing a warm, relaxing shower.  I was surprised at how nicely this soap lathers.  Typically my household uses body wash, so I&#x27;m going to take a couple of the bars and prepare a liquid soap as well.</li>
            <li> recommended by friend, long lasting, great lasting fragrance, gentle, all purpose face and bath soap, I bought a large pack.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing. Also was delivery was really fast.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bar soap. I have always hated bar soaps, so I have been rather surprised by how much I enjoy using this bar of soap. I tried this soap when throwing out all of my old toxic beauty products. I chose Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, because it is all natural, non-toxic, and fair trade. This bar provides a rich foamy lather and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. I rarely even need to use body lotion anymore! It is gentle enough for my baby&#x27;s skin, too. I highly recommend the liquid version too, but it doesn&#x27;t foam nearly as well.</li>
            <li> but not at this price. $21 for six bars was really pushing it but $25+ ? Get over yourselves. it&#x27;s not that good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap!  It lathers wonderfully in the shower, I use it as my facial cleanser and even grate up a bar for my laundry detergent (I add some other ingredients too)!  Its amazing and works wonders, but the best part is it is non toxic!!!</li>
            <li> The price here is GREAT. I have shopped around at the local stores that sell this and Amazon beats the price; hands down. This soap is GREAT. The lather is wonderful and lasting, the smell is light and delightful, and I really like this company.</li>
            <li> I just wrote about tis liquid soap.It&#x27;s the same opinion with the bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;Smells clean.....realy smell good....Good for my kind of aging skin.It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;my new brand of soap from now on.(it&#x27;s more expensif...so what....it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;my little pleasure)</li>
            <li> I love this soap so much.  This is my family&#x27;s new soap.</li>
            <li> These soaps seem to have very good ingredients, and they last a good while with normal use. I will order them again.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap! Lathers well, smells wonderful, and cleans like you would want from a soap.</li>
            <li> Love this for making laundry detergent.  I always find a bargain on Amazon over buying individual bars in the store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is the hype. I love Dr. bornner&#x27;s product in general but not this one. The smell does not like lavender. It has a weird smell that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mid-20&#x27;s male with somewhat oily skin and hair, sensitive skin with detergent allergies and acne. I love everything about this soap. I normally use an Ivory body bar, a tea tree facial bar, and sometimes use Roger and Gallet. Dr Bronner&#x27;s feels wonderful on my skin, it&#x27;s as smooth as Roger and Gallet but the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming. (R&amp;G products sometimes make me sneeze like I do with my mom&#x27;s cheap perfumes). The soap leaves me feeling like I&#x27;ve had a deeper cleaning than Ivory, and my acne is viably reduced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap in the shower all summer, all over, including my face. i have dry, sensitive skin but this soap agrees with me. I love the lavender scent (which does not linger after rinsing), it lathers nicely, and leaves my skin feeling clean and not dry (tho not moisturized either - but i use a body lotion for that). i&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Like the fresh scent ! I use it to make homemade laundry soap. Easy to grate up and dissolves fast!</li>
            <li> I am using it for last couple of months with out problem. So far best soap ever.</li>
            <li> I use Dr Bronner&#x27;s bar soap, liquid soap and lotion - all great products!  I love the lavender smell as it is not too intrusive and good for many uses.</li>
            <li> I have had an oily, itchy scalp since I can remember. I am now 32. I bought this at a health food store just to try it and I used it in the shower on my hair after I had shampooed with my usual suave. I just never felt like my hair or scalp was clean after using the other shampoos. One use of this on my hair and I am hooked!!!!!! My scalp is no longer itchy!!! It cleans very well and there is no sulfates which I think was making my head itchy. I no longer use any shampoo at all! I also tried the salon stuff, Matrix Amplify. I like this way better. My hair also is not as greasy the next day and I can go two days between washings. It lathers up beautifully and leaves no residue. I do use a suave conditioner afterwards. I haven&#x27;t tried any of Dr.Bronners conditioners yet. I&#x27;ll probably try that next. :-) I know I won&#x27;t use regular shampoo ever again!</li>
            <li> Pure and simple, this is a wonderful versatile product that smells great.  Bronner&#x27;s is the only soap I use in my household and I love this natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is always a great buy, no chemicals, great natural fragrance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a little under a week now and am so thrilled I made the switch.  I have very sensitive, red-prone skin and everything seems to upset it.  Not washing results in acne and washing and exfoliating results in rashes.  I now wash my face with this soap 1-2x a day and follow up with Thayers Witch Hazel.  It&#x27;s a dream.  The skin on my face is the best it&#x27;s been in ages.  This soap is gentle, lathers beautifully and smells just lovely.  I also use this in the shower on my body and my dry skin just loves it.  Because it lathers so well it works fantastically for shaving.  So glad I stocked up and bought 6.  And now my linen closet (storing the extras) smells fantastic as well!</li>
            <li> I love this soap because of its pure and natural ingredients, because it is fair trade, and because this company is so ethical and committed to issues that I passionately believe in - namely, the promotion of and significant monetary contribution to non-GMO projects, Hemp farming, and more.  My body feels good not being washed in chemicals that skin does not need and I don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra for a product that resonates with my values.</li>
            <li> The product used to be 5 stars before gmo corn based citric acid was added now it just makes corn allergic people like myself itchy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my skin and the smell is really nice if you like lavender like I do.  Lots of suds and creamy and as its more alkaline than acid my skin looks so much better.  I usually buy it locally but this 6 bar pack was a great deal.</li>
            <li> I use this to personally make my own laundry detergent and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Interesting how it takes oil to remove grease from your laundry but it has not failed me yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recipe is simple:&lt;br /&gt;1 cup of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap (shredded or graded as finely as you can)&lt;br /&gt;1 cup of arm and hammer&#x27;s super washing soda&lt;br /&gt;1 cup of borax&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mix and place in container and your set.&lt;br /&gt;your load doesn&#x27;t require much to come out clean and smelling fresh</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with it. It lathers up like a shampoo and makes my hair feel cleaner then regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I love it !</li>
            <li> I love this natural pure-castile soap, and because of its price (about 5 dollars or more) usually just purchased one or two bars at a time.  I was thrilled to find Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap on facebook in bulk for much less than I was spending on a per bar basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this soap through Amazon if the price remains this low.  Another great deal from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love the soap.  Lathers wonderfully and smells great.  Helps mositurize dry skin.  Works very well to make laundry detergent.  Recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> I was using Fels Naptha and some other bar soaps to make my own laundry soap but this works the best.  Its grates beautifully which was always a huge hassle for me before.  Dr Bonner&#x27;s works well in the food processor too.  I don&#x27;t have to fish out the clumps that won&#x27;t chop etc.  The lavendar smell is so wonderful.  Our clothes get clean.  I use a mixture of washing soda, Borax, and oxygen bleach along with this soap so maybe it&#x27;s just the combination, but it works!  I&#x27;m considering using this as my daily bath soap as well.</li>
            <li> Love it! No residue &amp; leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Great smell, and tremendous lather. I love that it&#x27;s all natural. Expensive though it is, my skin shows it is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Technically, it may not be as expensive as one might think, because it lathers so very easily it takes less soap to make more lather. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet, but I personally know those who have, and they say it works great for shampoo too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have semi-sensitive skin, prone to dryness and rashes. For most of my adult life I used Dove Unscented and was content. After learning of some of the harmful chemicals used in commercial soaps, hair (especially) and skin products, I decided to switch to all natural solutions. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Hemp-Lavender bars is one highly successful step toward that goal.</li>
            <li> Great soap which wife loves, cheaper than can be bought locally, eases sore bodies!</li>
            <li> The best.  Love it.  I have very sensitive skin and this is gentle and with healthy ingredients from a conscious company.  Keep in mind that this is not a moisturizing soap; I use coconut, avocado, or jojoba oil all over my body after showering.</li>
            <li> I use these to make my own laundry detergent. I shred the bars then food processor the shredded soap into &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34;, then mix with baking soda and washing soda. The soap dissolves well in the washing machine and leaves the clothes smelling great.</li>
            <li> After years of using I.S. I began to have problems with dry skin. I switched to the cold cream bars that left me with a overall film. The soap seemed to disintegrate over night. Checking reviews I decided to give Dr Bronners a try. Love the smell,  cleanliness, and the feel. The bars are more expensive but they last longer. My husband is a fan too.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because all the other soaps that I&#x27;ve used that you&#x27;d buy in the stores have harmful chemicals in it.  These soaps are a little better for your body.  Although it dries my skin a little bit more than the store bought soaps it&#x27;s not that bad as I use lotion afterwards.  The scent is soft and subtle and not over powering.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this soap.  She has stopped buying it because of costs more than soap used by the rest of the family so I bought her a years worth for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It was the fastest service I have ever had. It was amazing. I like to experience this kind of service again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my homemade laundry detergent, but I have used it in the shower as well!  The smell is incredible and my laundry smells awesome even after a week!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this soap didn&#x27;t work for me.  Smells great, good size, but when using it, it left my skin stinging, which made me question what was in it.</li>
            <li> love all Dr Bronner&#x27;s products. pure and simple soaps that smell wonderful</li>
            <li> only soap I&#x27;ve found so far that does not cause any itching or allergic reactions on my skin; also, the lavender does not sting my eyes like peppermint.</li>
            <li> very cremy and soft foam ~ I wash my hair with this soap.</li>
            <li> This lavender smelling soap is the best!  I like a soap to lather up and this fills the bill.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap in bar and liquid forms since 2004.  I won&#x27;t use anything else unless I could make this exact soap at home.  IMPORTANT: I do not use any other type of commercially produced conventional skin product - only Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and 100% extra virgin cold-pressed coconut oil, and more recently, Moon Valley Organics. IF YOU USE conventional products in addition to this soap and do not see incredible results, it is due to the toxins in the conventional skin products.  I shave with this soap, wash my hair with the liquid soap, and wash my body with the bar form.</li>
            <li> Always loved Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products - this was just a really good price</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome! It makes great lather really quickly, and smells great.[[ASIN:B001ET77OI Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soaps Pure-Castile Soap, All-One Hemp Lavender, 5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 6)]] The smell is wonderful while you&#x27;re in the shower, but not overpowering once you get out. It rinses off nice and easily and doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of oily feeling.  Yet, it doesn&#x27;t maker my skin feel all dried out either.  This is my soap from now on!  And it&#x27;s really comforting to know that it&#x27;s all natural, no harmful ingredients at all!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My favorite soap :) I love lavender scented anything, and this bar has a slight scent, not overpowering. Perfect amount of suds and I love that it&#x27;s organic and natural. Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for about 7 years, and still prefer it to most everything.  Peppermint variant is my favorite, but they are all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this soap....Use it for making homemade laundry detergent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not melted in the water as you can read in other review. So it last long compared to other product. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t help my husband acne skin at all which was a main reason I bought.&lt;br /&gt;Overally I like it.</li>
            <li> Great soap!!! All I use now.</li>
            <li> I ground up the soap bar and added it to natural laundry detergent I made. The lavender smelled amazing and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> We love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender soap and use nothing else. The scent is appealing...not at all overwhelming, and it lathers very well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells great, leaves me feeling fresh, clean and relaxed. I love natural soaps but some smell weird or almost fake. This is one that I can say that you get a great scent and nothing extra. I like the scent so much that I keep my extra unused soaps in my clothing drawers to keep my clothes smelling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I was making laundry detergent and decided to use this as the bar soap. Its very fragrant and calming. It seems to be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> We use this soap to make laundry as well as for bathing. Love the smell and love that it&#x27;s natural and uses organic ingredients (or at least more than others). Just seems like a good ethical company.</li>
