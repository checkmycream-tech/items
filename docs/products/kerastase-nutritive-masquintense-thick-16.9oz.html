            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Still works great.</li>

            <li>For my hair is the best because after use it I feel my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>but this is a superior product for me.</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on my hair even though I did not think may hair looked that great</li>
            <li>I love this product, it works great.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Before I ordered Masqueintense, I had the most severe breakage I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>you&amp;#34;ll love it,,like</li>
            <li>the price is much better than in the store.</li>
            <li>and I am a satisfied senior citizen</li>
            <li>I bought the large size as I love this product and the large size is perfect.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended it, and said that it was a good idea to do a hot treatment with it once a month.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;From years of experience and trying every combo, the best shampoo of their range to use in combo with Masquintense is &amp;#34;Kerastase Resistance bain de force&amp;#34; (34 oz) in summer, and &amp;#34;Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin 1 Complete Nutrition Shampoo&amp;#34; for normal hair in Winter.</li>
            <li>My hair gets really fantastic with it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this conditioner for few years and always get wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because since the product is super concentrated, you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it at any one time.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, and does wonders to my dry hair.</li>
            <li>Avoid bleaching your hair and using hot irons to straighten it at all costs!</li>
            <li>So totally worth the price...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the investment if you can afford it.</li>
            <li>This is a bit of a splurge, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I does magic for the texture of my hair - so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>might be worth it.  </li>
            <li>In fact, most of them seemed to further aggravate the tangling/breakage situation.</li>
            <li>while expensive- worked EXCELLENTLY for me.  </li>
            <li>I used it about three days a week at first...</li>
            <li>This is a great conditioner for thick hair.</li>
            <li>Anybody with dry, coarse, bleached hair will notice a great improvement in texture and shine.  </li>
            <li>Kerastase is the high end product of L&#x27;Oreal well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>bought Masquintense because I had heard that it was the best deep conditioner for people who needed serious hair repair, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint me.  </li>
            <li>This product not only conditions your hair but makes it smooth as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks,</li>
            <li>Then blow dry your hair straight and enjoy your new hair!</li>
            <li>What seemed like an entire section of my hair would break off (about an inch of length from the bottom...thankfully not the whole hair) in the comb the first couple times I washed it after bleaching.</li>
            <li>If you have dry hair, using the normal version + masqueintense will be more than enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasts for a long time and is better than any other conditioner out there.</li>
            <li>the product: I have super long, straight hair that tend to be dry.</li>
            <li>I always buy the salon sized tubs because its much more affordable that way, and its so powerful that on budget months when I can only afford a cheap shampoo it does a fantastic job of nullifying those nasty effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I use it once per week and it makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and it leaves my otherwise coarse and curly hair very silky and shinny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft, shiny, and manageable.  </li>
            <li>However if you do bleach and burn your hair, this is the only product that can really save your hair from brittleness and fly-away breaking.</li>
            <li>and I am just gonna have to live with my created-by-bleach layers), but my hair overall feels softer and is shinier and healthier looking than it was.</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this to people who damage their hair a lot (either through styling or coloring), or for people who have naturally dry or unmanageable hair.  </li>
            <li>*For those of you who need the reference, I have long, thick hair with a very fine texture.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I would rinse it out with lukewarm water (NOT hot water, because hot water strips the oil from</li>
            <li>After just one use of Masqueintense, I only had a couple of stray hairs come out when I would comb it, rather than the comb being full of what felt like plastic doll hair once it dried.</li>
            <li>other tips to growing ultra long hair are: to NEVER brush my hair when wet (it stretches and breaks it), but instead to use a salon style wide tooth shower detangling comb first; to only use a paddle brush (the other styles will strip your hair over time); to always brush my hair from the bottom, working the way up through the knots very gently; and to always use cool air when blowdrying.</li>
            <li>(it was easy to guess by the way they tried to tape over the broken part).</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way really like this product.  </li>
            <li> In the past decade, since using this product, my hair has never been more silky, lustrous, thick and long.</li>
            <li> and my hair felt dry to the touch, especially at the ends.  </li>
            <li> My hair is hopelessly dry and coarse, so I gambled that the astronomical cost of this conditioner ($75?!)</li>
            <li> Much of the breakage and stuff has been repaired or at least smoothed out by the moisture.  </li>
            <li> Kerastase could not possibly charge so much for products which are so poor.</li>
            <li> Gives hair new life - the smell is a little perfumy - lasts a really long time as a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this mask gives me a lot of moisture and makes it possible to wash my hair less often.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry</li>
            <li> Expensive but really, really worth it.  </li>
            <li> Kerastase products are expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> It did not improve the texture of my hair, did not add any moisture, and it didn&#x27;t even help when I tried to brush my wet hair after showering.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You do not have to use a lot so little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other conditioners and nothing could even come close to doing what Masqueintense does for my hair.</li>
            <li> I received this item in an extremely expedient time frame (1 or 2 days from time of placing the order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I am not sure I would order from the same retailer again.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> So even though this costs $50+, it will last you at least 6 months to a year if you use it</li>
            <li> If you go to the gym and can use the sauna, wash your hair and apply a small amount of Masquintese on your wet hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was pretty fried after experimenting with bleaching/ dying my hair some crazy colors...</li>
            <li> It gives the moisture without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> Of course, the damage that was already done is still there (i.e. Kerastase unfortunately cannot put back the hair that broke off</li>
            <li> have used this conditioner in the past</li>
            <li> only bad thing about this product is that because it&#x27;s so moisturizing, it can make your hair a little greasy if you use it too often...</li>
            <li> People stop me on the street and ask me for my secret</li>
            <li> however, the jar was broken and it was broken before it shipped</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best price for Kerastase Masquintense. It lasts for a long time and is better than any other conditioner out there.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years and I love it. It leaves my hair soft and manageable. So totally worth the price...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I use it once per week and it makes my hair soft and silky. great product.</li>
            <li> Kerastase is the only thing that can bring my hair back to life when I have bleached it to oblivion. Before I ordered Masqueintense, I had the most severe breakage I have ever seen. What seemed like an entire section of my hair would break off (about an inch of length from the bottom...thankfully not the whole hair) in the comb the first couple times I washed it after bleaching. After just one use of Masqueintense, I only had a couple of stray hairs come out when I would comb it, rather than the comb being full of what felt like plastic doll hair once it dried. My hair feels like hair again! Of course, the damage that was already done is still there (i.e. Kerastase unfortunately cannot put back the hair that broke off and I am just gonna have to live with my created-by-bleach layers), but my hair overall feels softer and is shinier and healthier looking than it was. I have tried other conditioners and nothing could even come close to doing what Masqueintense does for my hair. In fact, most of them seemed to further aggravate the tangling/breakage situation.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it leaves my otherwise coarse and curly hair very silky and shinny. Tip: If you go to the gym and can use the sauna, wash your hair and apply a small amount of Masquintese on your wet hair. Put on a shower cap and let the heat of the sauna do the work. You will achieve salon-like results. Then blow dry your hair straight and enjoy your new hair!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! It lasts forever</li>
            <li> This mascara is the best ever. My hair gets really fantastic with it. I ve been using it for some years now and nothing compares.</li>
            <li> This product not only conditions your hair but makes it smooth as well. Expensive but really, really worth it.  I love it!</li>
            <li> *For those of you who need the reference, I have long, thick hair with a very fine texture.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product- while expensive- worked EXCELLENTLY for me.  My hair was pretty fried after experimenting with bleaching/ dying my hair some crazy colors... I had a ton of breakage going on and my hair felt dry to the touch, especially at the ends.  I was worried that I was actually going to start losing my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought Masquintense because I had heard that it was the best deep conditioner for people who needed serious hair repair, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint me.  I used it about three days a week at first... I would towel-dry my hair in the middle of my shower, apply the product thoroughly throughout all of my hair from roots to ends, and let it sit for about ten minutes or so.  Then I would rinse it out with lukewarm water (NOT hot water, because hot water strips the oil from your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw results literally after 3 days. Now my hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been... it&#x27;s soft, shiny, and manageable.  Much of the breakage and stuff has been repaired or at least smoothed out by the moisture.  I still use this stuff about once every two to three days on the ends of my hair.  It&#x27;s nice because since the product is super concentrated, you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it at any one time.  So even though this costs $50+, it will last you at least 6 months to a year if you use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about this product is that because it&#x27;s so moisturizing, it can make your hair a little greasy if you use it too often... especially if you already have an oily scalp.  So don&#x27;t go overboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this to people who damage their hair a lot (either through styling or coloring), or for people who have naturally dry or unmanageable hair.  It&#x27;s worth the investment if you can afford it.</li>
            <li> For my hair is the best because after use it I feel my hair smooth and shiny. I use every day. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I received this item in an extremely expedient time frame (1 or 2 days from time of placing the order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this conditioner in the past and I think that it is one of the best conditioner&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> This is a bit of a splurge, but totally worth it. My hairdresser recommended it, and said that it was a good idea to do a hot treatment with it once a month.  Put it on, cover with a plastic shower cap and a towel, and apply heat with a blow dryer for 5-10 minutes and leave the mask on for a total of 30 minutes before rinsing. I does magic for the texture of my hair - so soft and silky. I also use it when I don&#x27;t have 30 minutes and leave it on for 2-3 minutes.  Still works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner for thick hair. It gives the moisture without feeling heavy. Kerastase products are expensive but worth it. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In the past decade, since using this product, my hair has never been more silky, lustrous, thick and long. People stop me on the street and ask me for my secret and I always say - Kerastase Masquintense!! I always buy the salon sized tubs because its much more affordable that way, and its so powerful that on budget months when I can only afford a cheap shampoo it does a fantastic job of nullifying those nasty effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From years of experience and trying every combo, the best shampoo of their range to use in combo with Masquintense is &amp;#34;Kerastase Resistance bain de force&amp;#34; (34 oz) in summer, and &amp;#34;Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin 1 Complete Nutrition Shampoo&amp;#34; for normal hair in Winter. If you have dry hair, using the normal version + masqueintense will be more than enough for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other tips to growing ultra long hair are: to NEVER brush my hair when wet (it stretches and breaks it), but instead to use a salon style wide tooth shower detangling comb first; to only use a paddle brush (the other styles will strip your hair over time); to always brush my hair from the bottom, working the way up through the knots very gently; and to always use cool air when blowdrying. Avoid bleaching your hair and using hot irons to straighten it at all costs! Otherwise it will never grow ultra-long. However if you do bleach and burn your hair, this is the only product that can really save your hair from brittleness and fly-away breaking.</li>
            <li> I start using this mask years ago and still is the best for my hair... I don&#x27;t need conditioner with this ever,, if you need something excellent for your hair try and you&amp;#34;ll love it,,like I do</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for few years and always get wonderful results.  It is pricy yes, but I feel I deserve it.  You do not have to use a lot so little goes a long way.  My hair is very dry but when I use this conditioner it gives my hair a wonderful shine.  I have received many compliments on my hair even though I did not think may hair looked that great but I guess it does.  If you are processing your hair in any way you will definitely benefit from this conditioner.  Anybody with dry, coarse, bleached hair will notice a great improvement in texture and shine.  If the conditioners on the market do nothing for you this product will. Kerastase is the high end product of L&#x27;Oreal well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way really like this product.  It works just like the instructions describe and I would definitely buy this product again. Thanks,</li>
            <li> Gives hair new life - the smell is a little perfumy - lasts a really long time as a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works great. Great quality, and does wonders to my dry hair. I would recommend it to everyone, and...the price is much better than in the store.</li>
            <li> My hair is hopelessly dry and coarse, so I gambled that the astronomical cost of this conditioner ($75?!) might be worth it.  It wasn&#x27;t.  It did not improve the texture of my hair, did not add any moisture, and it didn&#x27;t even help when I tried to brush my wet hair after showering.  I understand that fraudulent products sometimes make it through Amazon, and I have to imagine this was such a case.  Kerastase could not possibly charge so much for products which are so poor.</li>
            <li> This is one of Kerastase best products. I have used it for years and I am a satisfied senior citizen</li>
            <li> I bought the large size as I love this product and the large size is perfect. however, the jar was broken and it was broken before it shipped (it was easy to guess by the way they tried to tape over the broken part). Since the product looked intact and it was what I wanted I kept it but I am not sure I would order from the same retailer again.&lt;br /&gt;On the product: I have super long, straight hair that tend to be dry. this mask gives me a lot of moisture and makes it possible to wash my hair less often. my hair is shiny and well-nourished. I used Alterna for years and I loved it but this is a superior product for me.</li>
