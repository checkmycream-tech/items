            <li>En excellent developer, I will continue to use it always.</li>
            <li>This developer makes the best consistency with Topchic color.  </li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Good brand.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really good quality.  </li>
            <li>Its really a good developer and</li>
            <li>I love Topchic.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth spending a bit more on good quality hair products like this one.</li>
            <li>Bought this together with top chic colorant as recommended from Goldwell website.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Thick, creamy, smells amazing and does the job beautifully without frying my hair.</li>
            <li>It is so worth it!</li>
            <li>I have a nice, super blonde, brass free hair color!</li>
            <li>If you order this product, don&#x27;t forget to order the special mixer bottle in order to use it (and also</li>
            <li>I love being able to &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; with Goldwell products because the end results are always as expected.</li>
            <li>Good product - gives good and lasting coverage especially over the grey which can be stubborn at times.</li>
            <li>I would recommend that you REALLY talk to your  stylist about how to do stuff at home first. !</li>
            <li>For people who are trying to lighten their hair for the first time - you have to buy hair color AND developer in order for it to work.</li>

            <li>Then I switched to goldwell and it made my hair look much thicker, healthier and shiny.</li>
            <li>I feel confident that this product gives me true hair color, is predictably thick enough not to run during the process.</li>
            <li>I started out with the drugstore brands but they faded quickly and made my hair brassy and dry.</li>
            <li>It makes me sick thinking about it now, because it is so easy to do your own hair.</li>
            <li>would recomend this color to anyone who wants all over color, with 2oz tube color and 20 volume developer holds for several weeks without fading.</li>
            <li>However, I was surprised when I received the product</li>
            <li>The higher quality of this and other Goldwell professional grade hair care products makes it difficult (if not impossible) to go back to using anything else!</li>

            <li> If you get tired of constantly buying drugstore hair color at ten to fifteen dollars a pop, having this developer on hand and simply buying toners is a cost-saving alternative.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it with other colors besides Goldwell too.</li>
            <li> 40 volume developer is the strongest (if you have dark hair you will probably need this)</li>
            <li> , I have dirty blonde/light brown hair, see pic), then 20 volume developer.</li>

            <li> I love Topchic.  If you order this product, don&#x27;t forget to order the special mixer bottle in order to use it (and also factor in the cost of it - of course)!</li>
            <li> Good product - gives good and lasting coverage especially over the grey which can be stubborn at times. Good brand.</li>
            <li> I bought it with the topchic hair color and it&#x27;s really good quality.  Totally worth spending a bit more on good quality hair products like this one.</li>
            <li> delivered faster than promised.. and it&#x27;s easy to use. I would recommend that you REALLY talk to your  stylist about how to do stuff at home first. !</li>
            <li> Its really a good developer and I will use it regularly now. It is a big bottle and I like that there is plenty of the product for the price</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Timely delivery</li>
            <li> Bought this together with top chic colorant as recommended from Goldwell website. Works great! And the bottle should quite a long time.</li>
            <li> would recomend this color to anyone who wants all over color, with 2oz tube color and 20 volume developer holds for several weeks without fading. So much nicer than the store colors that do not hold the color</li>
            <li> The product packaging looks different than the picture shown on Amazon.  Goldwell has updated it&#x27;s packaging, but the product is similar.  However, I was surprised when I received the product</li>
            <li> This product works well. I&#x27;ve used it with other colors besides Goldwell too. I like that it can be purchased on Amazon with my color and I don&#x27;t have to wait for my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m never spending money at a salon again. I was spending $75 a month to keep up my platinumish blonde hair. It makes me sick thinking about it now, because it is so easy to do your own hair. I started out with the drugstore brands but they faded quickly and made my hair brassy and dry. Then I switched to goldwell and it made my hair look much thicker, healthier and shiny. I use it once a month and get a lot of compliments. For people who are trying to lighten their hair for the first time - you have to buy hair color AND developer in order for it to work. 40 volume developer is the strongest (if you have dark hair you will probably need this) next is 30 volume developer (what I use, I have dirty blonde/light brown hair, see pic), then 20 volume developer. Here is my formula: I mix 50ml (50ml&#x3D; almost 3 tbs) of 30 vol developer and 25ml of Goldwell hair color and let it sit for about 35-40 minutes. I have tried a couple different shades of Goldwell hair color, in that pic, I used 10N. I still thought it was a not blonde enough and a little brassy so I switched it to 12BN (which has a silverish tone to it, takes away the brass) and it&#x27;s perfect. I have a nice, super blonde, brass free hair color! Do the research, test out some different colors and save your $$$ you can do it! It is so worth it!</li>
            <li> I feel confident that this product gives me true hair color, is predictably thick enough not to run during the process. En excellent developer, I will continue to use it always.</li>
            <li> This developer makes the best consistency with Topchic color.  Stays where you put it &amp; doesn&#x27;t run.  The best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
