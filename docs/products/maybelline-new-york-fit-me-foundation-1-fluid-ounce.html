            <li>I love revlon color stay mousse cream foundation.</li>

            <li>This foundation is okay.</li>
            <li>LOVE the color and finish but isnt a &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I know its probably better for your skin to not use a perfumey smelling foundation</li>
            <li>This product has made my face look so natural and fresh and has blended perfect with my skin tone</li>
            <li>As with any liquid foundation of course I still feel that its there but its a lot more light and smooth than most.</li>
            <li>The color is alright, but seems fairly orange which I really don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, lasted a while, but not through the day</li>
            <li>Goes on easily w/ a sponge.</li>
            <li>Great foundation, does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>So smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and silky look.</li>
            <li>The coverage is light to medium and it doesn&#x27;t cake.</li>
            <li>I can see a difference when looking in the mirror since switching to Fit me foundation.</li>
            <li>Feels light and silky on the skin.</li>
            <li>So happy I could get my same one by scanning it and finding it here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite foundation!</li>
            <li>This works great with my very dry but acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Very build able coverage.  </li>
            <li>Recommended for anyone looking for a light foundation that can provide great coverage for blemishes and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>The problem I have is that it is super oily on me.</li>
            <li>Although it is easily applied, it is very oily.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to try new make foundation since I have big pores and this works great.</li>
            <li>Overall nice product.</li>
            <li>Again, keep that Mally compact handy and try different primers.</li>
            <li>- just that you have smooth, unblemished skin!  </li>
            <li>First of all I like the way this stuff smells.</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>This stuff applies really well with a brush applicator and does not harm my skin.</li>
            <li>I think this foundation is amazing for everyday use because it has SPF 18 and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Oh well, the price is not too bad and I will keep searching for that perfect foundation.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and breakout with anything I put on my face.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews,  but felt I should seeing that I bought this based off reviews :)</li>
            <li>not good for the warm skins color , i didnt like it</li>
            <li>This foundation from Maybelline is a little bit oily and I would like it to last more.</li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>Its so soft</li>
            <li>it gives me natural color.</li>
            <li>I was previously using an air foam that really felt like a whole extra layer of face.</li>
            <li>I had to slather on oil absorbing powder after application of Fit just to dull the wet look.</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;ll say the thing I hate most about my organic make up items is that they smell really weird.</li>
            <li> No more waiting for Wal-Mart to have in stock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be oily to begin with, and this made it so much worse!</li>
            <li> and I was shocked to see it on Amazon.</li>

            <li> So smooth.  It makes my skin feel silky. Nice coverage. Not heavy.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, lasted a while, but not through the day ( I did not use any primer, so maybe that makes a difference) Overall nice product.</li>
            <li> Great foundation, does not dry out my skin. Smooth and silky look.</li>
            <li> I like this foundation a lot! Its so soft but it does not have a lot of good coverage.</li>
            <li> This product has made my face look so natural and fresh and has blended perfect with my skin tone and I just feel so confident and good about how i look now. I defiantly look forward to buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation but the color was darker than I thought but I could still make it work. The coverage is light to medium and it doesn&#x27;t cake. I think this foundation is amazing for everyday use because it has SPF 18 and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite foundation! Blends great and covers well!</li>
            <li> love the coverage , recomended</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try new make foundation since I have big pores and this works great. I can see a difference when looking in the mirror since switching to Fit me foundation. It has not clogged my pores at all which I was concerned about. I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout since switching.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have lived most my life (I&#x27;m 34) wearing minimal makeup (usually a lil eye liner &amp; mascara), but as I get older I feel like I need a lil something to cover a few little wrinkles (yikes!). Anyway, after a long strew of buying incorrect colors, but trying to make it work anyway, I came across this on their site. It had a test to see what is best for you. It was so dead on, I was so surprised.  Others had tests, but didn&#x27;t work. This feels like you have no makeup on, and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or anything - just that you have smooth, unblemished skin!  I usually don&#x27;t write reviews,  but felt I should seeing that I bought this based off reviews :)</li>
            <li> I love it ! it is the perfect color for me and it spreads well on my skin, hide imperfections and it does not make my skin dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> I feel like the color and coverage on this product were good. The problem I have is that it is super oily on me. My skin tends to be oily to begin with, and this made it so much worse! Powder didn&#x27;t help to control the shine this creates.&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin, try the Dream Matte Mousse foundation, I love it.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily w/ a sponge. Covers nicely, although it is oily looking once applied, but using the matching powder brushed over- makes the finish matte- very nice!  Covers nicely all day. And this foundation is low on the toxic side, according to Skin Deep Cosmetic Database.</li>
            <li> Love it very smooth and not cakie</li>
            <li> Gave up my MAC for this brand! Phenomenal coverage. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Finish is oily, you will need a finishing powder. Also, it seems chalky to me. I love revlon color stay mousse cream foundation. Doesn&#x27;t need any powder</li>
            <li> not good for the warm skins color , i didnt like it</li>
            <li> Really like it. Like that it&#x27;s a bit watery spreads more evenly</li>
            <li> This foundation from Maybelline is a little bit oily and I would like it to last more. But it&#x27;s still good stuff.</li>
            <li> This foundation is okay. I have stopped buying it because I prefer the Dream Mousse. The color is alright, but seems fairly orange which I really don&#x27;t like at all.</li>
            <li> Very build able coverage.  Feels light and silky on the skin. Recommended for anyone looking for a light foundation that can provide great coverage for blemishes and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a great line! i&#x27;ll be getting the concealer soon, too. I reallly like this foundation it covers a lot but doesn&#x27;t make your face look cakey!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, Love this make up! It does not rub off or look crappy.&lt;br /&gt;I looked for it at Wal-Mart when I ran out and I was shocked to see it on Amazon. So happy I could get my same one by scanning it and finding it here at Amazon. Matches the same I had before. No more waiting for Wal-Mart to have in stock!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I thought this might be the foundation I was happy with. Not so. Although it is easily applied, it is very oily. Oily is not even a good description, it&#x27;s more like greasy! I had to slather on oil absorbing powder after application of Fit just to dull the wet look. Oh well, the price is not too bad and I will keep searching for that perfect foundation.</li>
            <li> LOVE the color and finish but isnt a &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34; product so oily girls will have to check every 2 hours or so. Again, keep that Mally compact handy and try different primers.</li>
            <li> I like it so much. it gives me natural color. it is very good for every day use.</li>
            <li> First of all I like the way this stuff smells. I know its probably better for your skin to not use a perfumey smelling foundation but I&#x27;ll say the thing I hate most about my organic make up items is that they smell really weird. This is also a lot lighter feeling on my skin than other foundations. As with any liquid foundation of course I still feel that its there but its a lot more light and smooth than most. I was previously using an air foam that really felt like a whole extra layer of face. I recommend trying to match your skin tone in a store somewhere, as I was a little off with my guess. Someone else commented that it looked like a mask on her face, well that is what happens when you don&#x27;t correctly match your skin tone. Its close enough for me that I will keep using it anyway, and probably buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Little lighter then I thought but still like it</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and breakout with anything I put on my face. This stuff applies really well with a brush applicator and does not harm my skin. I never breakout or get any irritation.</li>
            <li> Great product! This works great with my very dry but acne prone skin.The color is a perfect match for my skin tone.LOVE!!!!:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this Maybelline product, I love the coverage you get.  It does have a bit of a shine and I like to wear a little powder over it, and or mix it with moisterizer if I want lighter coverage.</li>
