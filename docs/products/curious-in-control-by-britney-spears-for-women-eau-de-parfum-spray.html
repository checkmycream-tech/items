            <li>Years ago when I was working in a jewelry store in the mall, I asked a customer what perfume she was wearing, because she smelled incredible.  </li>
            <li>Good job Claude Dir!</li>

            <li>so amazing...</li>
            <li>i seen so many good reviews i had to get it</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s fruity but not \\&quot;pick-off-the-tree-and-bite-down-on-it\\&quot; kind of way.</li>
            <li>Vanilla Bean Noel scent (which is kind of like cookie dough)</li>
            <li>It smells really nice</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much is smells very sexy and delicious !</li>
            <li>it smells good, not to strong of sent.</li>
            <li>Yes if you like warm gorgeous lightly fliral vanilla cream type of scents.</li>
            <li>I was really thrilled when I was able to get it.  </li>
            <li>I find it appropriate whether I&#x27;m at work, at church, going out, or just staying home and feel like smelling amazing.</li>
            <li>I love all of Britney&#x27;s perfumes, however I strongly dislike how they are advertised!</li>
            <li>it is very light &amp; guys would always ask, \\&quot;Hmmmm, what are you wearing\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>but this one is more tangy.</li>
            <li>Love the perfume, but it did not come with the puffer shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume b/c</li>
            <li>If you love Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27;</li>
            <li>The bottle and atomizer are way cute too.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance</li>
            <li>I also ordered the Ed Hardy Hearts and Daggers from the same seller and got the best customer service and</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s why I love the majority of her perfumes.</li>
            <li>But, I LOVE this perfume.  </li>
            <li>okay, so I tried a sample of In Control before looking around the store.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>Now thanks to amazon, I own all of Britney&#x27;s fragrances!</li>
            <li>If you enjoy fantasy, then you&#x27;ll love this.  </li>
            <li>Always impressed with brit and won&#x27;t buy any other perfume</li>
            <li>The best part is I ordered this and got it 4 days before expected delievery!</li>
            <li>It is a sweet, playful fragrance with a sexy, musky undertone.  </li>
            <li>In Control is my absolute favorite perfume!  </li>
            <li>It is light but has a woody undertone.</li>
            <li>and this lady came up to me and said omg you smell so good she wasnt the only person that told me that i been getting that all day i love it have to order another bottle ASAP.</li>
            <li>nothing like the original one.</li>
            <li>I know that when I&#x27;m able to, I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li>Repurchased because it brings back good memories.</li>
            <li>This scent is a must have if you like scents that are sweet but not over bearing.</li>
            <li>This perfume is on the sweet side.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet but not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>This smells a lot like Britney spears other perfume fantasy which is a great thing</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a more sophisticated scent to Britney&#x27;s \\&quot;Fantasy\\&quot;... but somewhat similiar.</li>
            <li>I would suggest The original \\&quot;Curious\\&quot; which has a soft pleasant scent, but this one is far from it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a calm version of fantasy even though I think this came out before fantasy.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this is by far my favorite..</li>
            <li>This is more of a milky, creamy, smooth, gorgeous vanilla with the florals in the dry down.  </li>
            <li>About 15 minutes later, the fruity beginning lightened, giving way to mild orchid sweetened with that beautiful dark vanilla.    </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This is the only perfume from Britney Spears&#x27; line that I really love (with the exception of Radiance; which I have not yet tested.)    </li>
            <li>I have to use about ten or more sprays to smell it, even then, it wares off within a hour.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, sexy, mature, mysterious, not overpowering, not shy either.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s supposed to smell like but for some odd reason, to me it smelled a mixture of juicy pear and apple.</li>
            <li>but it didnt mind since the scent was the real thing...</li>
            <li>Very crappy.</li>
            <li>fast shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really wish I knew who to write to, which manufacturer, or person in control of the continued distribution of this fragrance.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s Britney Spears!&amp;#34;  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but after work, I went straight to the fragrance store in the mall and bought a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love all the fragrances in the \\&quot;curious collection\\</li>
            <li>They both have a great vanilla dry down</li>
            <li>Curious in control Smells like cheap deodorant spray.</li>
            <li>Fresh fruits are totally gone at this point...</li>
            <li>If I bought it again it would have to have a normal spray applicator.</li>
            <li>but I can see how it has a twist of the original Curious.</li>
            <li>I thought the original Curious was...</li>
            <li>Not as good (plain) Curious.</li>
            <li>They are usually too floral or too potent for my liking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but it&#x27;s not too potent or too floral for my liking.  </li>
            <li>People may love her and people may hate her, but everyone has to admit that she has some of the most addicting scents ever!</li>
            <li>Wild</li>
            <li>This scent definitely does not disappoint and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like I&#x27;ve just tasted a velvety pie with an extremely moist, fleshy, and fruity middle (minus the cinnamon in most pies.)    </li>
            <li>I love it, but more than hate the name.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of stale.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a plain bottle with nothing else which is odd when the picture has more items on it..</li>
            <li>was happy to find this online, my daughter loves this fragrance (the only fragrance she wears) and it is next to impossible to find in stores.</li>

            <li> was happy to find this online, my daughter loves this fragrance (the only fragrance she wears) and it is next to impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I first stumbled onto In Control Curious at a Khol&#x27;s store a few years back.</li>
            <li> It is a fairly complex perfume that goes through fruity/floral/woody stages, all accented by a sweet, dark vanilla that never gets cloying, but is invariably present.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similar only it doesn&#x27;t have the sour fruity notes that fantasy has and no sugary cupcake either.  </li>
            <li> If you like that deep heavy smell go for it.</li>
            <li> It does not really spray even a mist out.</li>
            <li> This should of been in the Fantasy line instead of Curious</li>
            <li> Brittany Spears Curious</li>
            <li> The citrus scents do not really work with my body chemistry, but the musk, vanilla and orchid scents are always complementing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a perfume person.  </li>
            <li> The dry down had a woody but gourmand quality to it:</li>
            <li> For the past year, I&#x27;ve felt like I&#x27;ve finally found my signature fragrance.</li>
            <li> This perfume is somewhat difficult to find, particularly because it is not high in demand.  </li>
            <li> The perfume was not the thing on the image, the bottle was slightly diferent plus it doesnt have the atomizer... could have returned it</li>
            <li> Kinda upsets me a little.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can only find this fragrance on Amazon now, I&#x27;m assuming because it was a limited edition...</li>
            <li> Its like a mix of fruit punch,and plastic......just not appealing.</li>
            <li> The sad thing is that it was a limited edition, so they can be tricky to find.</li>
            <li> I am sad that this was a limited edition fragrance, because it is one of my all-time favorites.  </li>
            <li> In Control is a hard product to find.  </li>
            <li> At least in this phase of my life this perfume is my thing.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so hard to locate I probably would have returned it for false advertising.</li>
            <li> Too bad this is a limited edition.</li>
            <li> It will be a shame when this product becomes extinct.</li>
            <li> It has the musky lingering scent that I am addicted to.</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;m mad about is that it did not come with the little</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells great and arrive on time</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much is smells very sexy and delicious ! This smells a lot like Britney spears other perfume fantasy which is a great thing but this one is more tangy. I love this perfume and I will buy this again amd again! One thing I&#x27;m mad about is that it did not come with the little \\&quot;in control\\&quot; chain on the perfume bottle. It&#x27;s just a plain bottle with nothing else which is odd when the picture has more items on it.. Also I ordered this perfume from a different seller and it did have the chain on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance without even knowing how it smells i seen so many good reviews i had to get it and omg it smells so good. I was getting my hair done today 07/28/2011 and this lady came up to me and said omg you smell so good she wasnt the only person that told me that i been getting that all day i love it have to order another bottle ASAP.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume, but it did not come with the puffer shown in the picture. If it wasn&#x27;t so hard to locate I probably would have returned it for false advertising.</li>
            <li> nothing like the original one. Smells like cotton candy. If you like that deep heavy smell go for it. it is obvious i am not going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> The perfume was not the thing on the image, the bottle was slightly diferent plus it doesnt have the atomizer... could have returned it but it didnt mind since the scent was the real thing...</li>
            <li> This perfume is somewhat difficult to find, particularly because it is not high in demand.  I love this perfume b/c it is very light &amp; guys would always ask, \\&quot;Hmmmm, what are you wearing\\&quot;.... ;-) Overall it&#x27;s a more sophisticated scent to Britney&#x27;s \\&quot;Fantasy\\&quot;... but somewhat similiar.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume from Britney Spears&#x27; line that I really love (with the exception of Radiance; which I have not yet tested.)    On my skin, it opens with a burst of fruity notes: I believe it is supposed to be loquat fruit. To be honest, I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s supposed to smell like but for some odd reason, to me it smelled a mixture of juicy pear and apple. At this phase, the fruity notes are fleshed out with vanilla that has a \\&quot;dark\\&quot; quality. So it&#x27;s fruity but not \\&quot;pick-off-the-tree-and-bite-down-on-it\\&quot; kind of way. It makes me feel like I&#x27;ve just tasted a velvety pie with an extremely moist, fleshy, and fruity middle (minus the cinnamon in most pies.)    About 15 minutes later, the fruity beginning lightened, giving way to mild orchid sweetened with that beautiful dark vanilla.    The dry down had a woody but gourmand quality to it: Fresh fruits are totally gone at this point... A hint of the orchid combined with vanilla and crème brulèe. But note that the vanilla still leads in this phase as well.    It is a fairly complex perfume that goes through fruity/floral/woody stages, all accented by a sweet, dark vanilla that never gets cloying, but is invariably present.    Too bad this is a limited edition. Good job Claude Dir!</li>
            <li> If you love Bath &amp; Body Works&#x27; Vanilla Bean Noel scent (which is kind of like cookie dough), then you will want this perfume in your collection.  The bottle and atomizer are way cute too.  The scent lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li> I did not get what was advertised in the picture!!  The sprayer did not come with the perfume which was specifically why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Curious in control Smells like cheap deodorant spray. I would suggest The original \\&quot;Curious\\&quot; which has a soft pleasant scent, but this one is far from it. Its like a mix of fruit punch,and plastic......just not appealing.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance but I think the way you spray the perfume needs to be redesigned. It does not really spray even a mist out. If I bought it again it would have to have a normal spray applicator.</li>
            <li> I had got this for my birthday about 5 years ago. Repurchased because it brings back good memories. It smells kind of stale. I have to use about ten or more sprays to smell it, even then, it wares off within a hour. Very crappy. Wouldn&#x27;t repurchase or suggest to family or friends.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells like pears. It smells really nice</li>
            <li> The perfume is one of my favorites from brit. It is light but has a woody undertone. Always impressed with brit and won&#x27;t buy any other perfume</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing :) I am so happy I decided to order it. The best part is I ordered this and got it 4 days before expected delievery! I also ordered the Ed Hardy Hearts and Daggers from the same seller and got the best customer service and fast shipping!!&lt;br /&gt;This scent and Fantasy could be adopted sisters. They both have a great vanilla dry down and I just love that! This should of been in the Fantasy line instead of Curious but I can see how it has a twist of the original Curious. This scent is a must have if you like scents that are sweet but not over bearing.</li>
            <li> Brittany Spears Curious In Control is a hard product to find.  I was really thrilled when I was able to get it.  I am totally pleased</li>
            <li> For the past year, I&#x27;ve felt like I&#x27;ve finally found my signature fragrance. At least in this phase of my life this perfume is my thing. It&#x27;s sweet, sexy, mature, mysterious, not overpowering, not shy either. I really wish I knew who to write to, which manufacturer, or person in control of the continued distribution of this fragrance. It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s not in wider release. It will be a shame when this product becomes extinct. I hope that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites. Britney always kills it with her perfumes. Smells delightful and delicious. Lasts all day. You WILL get showered with compliments for wearing this perfume!</li>
            <li> I love all of Britney&#x27;s perfumes, however I strongly dislike how they are advertised! It shows that they come with a \\&quot;puffer\\&quot; but they do not. Kinda upsets me a little.</li>
            <li> People may love her and people may hate her, but everyone has to admit that she has some of the most addicting scents ever! I have almost every one of perfumes.. This one is my favorite. The citrus scents do not really work with my body chemistry, but the musk, vanilla and orchid scents are always complementing. I think that&#x27;s why I love the majority of her perfumes. Anyway, this is by far my favorite.. It has the musky lingering scent that I am addicted to. Every time I wear it, people always ask what perfume I have on and that I smell delicious (I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s a good thing.. lol). This scent definitely does not disappoint and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my FAVORITE perfumes! (tied with another for #1) Smells SO good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a perfume person.  They are usually too floral or too potent for my liking.  Body sprays are easier for me to deal with.  But, I LOVE this perfume.  In Control is my absolute favorite perfume!  I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it, but it&#x27;s not too potent or too floral for my liking.  I know that when I&#x27;m able to, I will definitely be buying more!</li>
            <li> I first stumbled onto In Control Curious at a Khol&#x27;s store a few years back. I thought the original Curious was... okay, so I tried a sample of In Control before looking around the store. As I walked around Khol&#x27;s, I wondered what they had done to the store to make the air smell so amazing... then I realized that it was me! :) I feel like this perfume was made for me. The sad thing is that it was a limited edition, so they can be tricky to find. I have never finished a bottle of perfume except for this scent. I find it appropriate whether I&#x27;m at work, at church, going out, or just staying home and feel like smelling amazing. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;P.S., The girls at work asked what scent I wear and where to get it for themselves, and the guys also asked what it was called, because they wanted some for their wives/girlfriends!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This perfume is on the sweet side. If this is what you like go for it. My daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> I am sad that this was a limited edition fragrance, because it is one of my all-time favorites.  Years ago when I was working in a jewelry store in the mall, I asked a customer what perfume she was wearing, because she smelled incredible.  She said, &amp;#34;Believe it or not, it&#x27;s Britney Spears!&amp;#34;  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, but after work, I went straight to the fragrance store in the mall and bought a bottle.  I will still wear this fragrance today, and I receive compliments from people saying I smell delicious.  It is a sweet, playful fragrance with a sexy, musky undertone.  Unfortunately, I can only find this fragrance on Amazon now, I&#x27;m assuming because it was a limited edition...</li>
            <li> ESTE PERFUME ES MUY DULCE, ME ESTOY ACOSTUMBRANDO A EL, EL EMBACE ES BELLO, Y LO MEJOR SE CONSERVA EL OLOR POR MUCHO TIEMPO</li>
            <li> was happy to find this online, my daughter loves this fragrance (the only fragrance she wears) and it is next to impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I love all the fragrances in the \\&quot;curious collection\\&quot; this one smells amazing and is a great night time perfume! I was so happy to find this on amazon, I&#x27;ve been searching for it for years. Now thanks to amazon, I own all of Britney&#x27;s fragrances! I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and am even happier with how quickly they delivered it to me!</li>
            <li> If you enjoy fantasy, then you&#x27;ll love this.  It&#x27;s similar only it doesn&#x27;t have the sour fruity notes that fantasy has and no sugary cupcake either.  This is more of a milky, creamy, smooth, gorgeous vanilla with the florals in the dry down.  It&#x27;s sweet but not too sweet.  It&#x27;s like a calm version of fantasy even though I think this came out before fantasy.  It would be good for work because it&#x27;s not too overwhelming, and it would also make a good night fragrance too and I think it could be worn in any season.  Would I purchase again?  Yes!  Wild I recommend?  Yes if you like warm gorgeous lightly fliral vanilla cream type of scents.</li>
            <li> My Daughter loves this , She wears it always ond it smells good, not to strong of sent.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. I love it, but more than hate the name. Not as good (plain) Curious.</li>
