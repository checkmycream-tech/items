    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is just the best stuff for rashes.  </li>
            <li>and I am soooooo impressed.  </li>
            <li>My mother got it for me when I was a teenager, and it worked great for getting rid of blackheads when I used it in conjunction with the soap.</li>
            <li>Works as good as it use to.</li>
            <li>cuticura is a good product</li>
            <li>My skin looked really good.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 20 years with great success.</li>
            <li>The newer version seems a bit more &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34;, not as nice for smoothing over areas where it is needed.  </li>
            <li>Best ointment on the market and definitely can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>It used to come in a can as a salve, though--much better way to provide it.  </li>
            <li>Love this ointment.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for so many things</li>
            <li>Also glad to find this.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING, GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>and prevents pain - although that only lasts for 30 minutes or so, still, it&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I think possibly the older version was more effective, but I am not positive about that.</li>
            <li>great stuff just hard to find!</li>
            <li>I found that it softened the blackheads I had, making it easy to remove them with cleansing grains and a homemade facial.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep you from itching and takes the rash away so fast.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend others to purchase and used this product.</li>
            <li>A little dab under a bandaid and that owee gets all better soon.</li>
            <li>THIS IS LUDRICOUS TO PAY THAT MUCH FOR ONLY ONE TUBE.  </li>
            <li>Because it contains aloe it is not as greasy as the old ointment.</li>
            <li>This is an old time remedy that still works.  </li>
            <li>I grew up with it and continue to use as an adult.</li>
            <li>Definitely helps heal old scabby wounds.</li>
            <li>The old ointment would probably last a lifetime where-as this newer product is limited by a shelf-life.</li>

            <li> I use it for everything, minor cuts, scrapes, and it even helps with pimples.</li>
            <li> It also works well for minor skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Similar (not exact) to campophenique, but easier to apply, as it&#x27;s a gel, rather than a liquid.</li>
            <li> We have used Cuticura since I was a little kid.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> misleading advertisement for this product.  was under assumption for $44.00 you get a box of this ointment, no  you ONLY GET ONE TUBE.  THIS IS LUDRICOUS TO PAY THAT MUCH FOR ONLY ONE TUBE.  DON&#x27;T BUY.</li>
            <li> Works as good as it use to.</li>
            <li> I use this ointment for psoriasis on my arms. Within 2 weeks, it was almost gone!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING, GOOD PRODUCT</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this ointment for twenty years because it works! I use it for everything, minor cuts, scrapes, and it even helps with pimples. Best ointment on the market and definitely can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 years with great success. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This ointment has been around for years. My mother got it for me when I was a teenager, and it worked great for getting rid of blackheads when I used it in conjunction with the soap. It also works well for minor skin irritations. Drawbacks for some people may be that it is greasy, and that it smells medicinal.  When I used it for acne I put it on at night and washed it off in the morning, and had to protect my pillow from the possibility of staining.  I found that it softened the blackheads I had, making it easy to remove them with cleansing grains and a homemade facial. My skin looked really good.</li>
            <li> This is just the best stuff for rashes.  It helps to keep you from itching and takes the rash away so fast.  great stuff just hard to find!</li>
            <li> This is an old time remedy that still works.  It used to come in a can as a salve, though--much better way to provide it.

            <li> It has a healing effect that u would not believe.fast and remarkable.thanks for having it.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product because I buy the soap for my moderate acne. I thought, why not give it a try, and I used it to treat my acne, my face was really red, itchy and my skin was dry and flaky. Two days after using it, along with the soap, my pimples and discomfort GONE! I will continue to use it and will update my review later.</li>
            <li> We have used Cuticura since I was a little kid. Back then it came in tins. This is the same stuff, now in a tube. A little dab under a bandaid and that owee gets all better soon.</li>
            <li> Love this ointment.  I grew up with it and continue to use as an adult.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for this product for my aunt and when I found it online, which is so convenient, I purchased for her as well as myself.  I have used it for so many things and I am soooooo impressed.  I would highly recommend others to purchase and used this product.</li>
            <li> Also glad to find this.</li>
