            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more !!</li>
            <li>It should still be a good practice mannequin for most things, but I was hoping for a little more length to practice braiding on.</li>
            <li>but I would suggest spending more to get a better one at a  professional store.</li>
            <li>They did make it right for me very quickly however.</li>
            <li>It arrived quick.</li>
            <li>it get nappy really fast,and the hair sheds easy.</li>
            <li>was worth the price</li>
            <li>But it do curl nice and you can constantly add heat</li>
            <li>i got what i was expecting , it also came in 3 days which was pretty quick.</li>
            <li>The hair styles easily and they all like fixing hair and trying new hair styles.  </li>
            <li>It had a very strong smell when i first opened it and last until it was shampooed.</li>
            <li>looks exactly like the picture.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>Was able to use it for several bleaching and color project&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I should have went with my first mine.</li>
            <li>came very quick and hair is super long</li>
            <li>also she did have black stains on her face but other than that its perfect</li>
            <li>Nice mannequine , it had good long thick hair !</li>
            <li>Scalp is very realistic.</li>
            <li>The hair is listed at 20-22&amp;#34;, but it certainly seems a lot shorter than that.</li>
            <li>It is very tapered and layered.  </li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loooooooovessential her manikin head</li>
            <li>The product was even better than I expected</li>
            <li>It came on time plus it didnt cost me as much.</li>
            <li>perfect for cutting hair and styles</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>The hair looks much longer in the pic.</li>
            <li>but I need to send back my item and obviously pay for the shipment my own.</li>
            <li>Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it :) there are some random strands of different colors hair that doesn&#x27;t make sense, like purple and white, but overall I&#x27;m happy with it and how it work</li>
            <li>My daughter, 17, is studying cosmetology in high school.</li>
            <li>It has little knots throughout the head, and when you comb it, more hair falls out.  </li>
            <li>(13yrs old) wants Helen for her birthday</li>
            <li>Alright quality for a beauty student and definitely worth the (low) price.</li>
            <li>The mannequin&#x27;s hair was very thin, and on top of that, it shed tremendously.  </li>
            <li>The hair looks much longer in the picture than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>So far I have cut, colored, and styled my manikins hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased Helen for my 10 year old daughter who loves to do hair, wash, cut, curl and braid.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old daughter loves doing hair, so I order this for her</li>
            <li>Well definitely be ordering a few more mannequins, soon.</li>
            <li>At first the some of the hair falls out but not much.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to creating elaborate styles, coloring it, but the hair is not strong enough, I want to return it and my money back ðŸ˜¢</li>
            <li>and she has a double stamped eye where it looks like she has two eye colors on top of the other and the other eye has no color.</li>
            <li>It was full but not to thick which made it great for cutting and thermal styles.....</li>
            <li>the hair is deceiving it looks much longer and thicker on the mannequin head not much to work with</li>
            <li>I feel they are giving me the most ridiculous excuse I&#x27;ve ever heard.</li>
            <li>I was a little weary of it because of the bad reviews, but I was really impressed by it.</li>
            <li>The hair was pretty thick for a doll head, and it was very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few doll heads for cosmetology school, and this one was the first one I bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I think it was a little shorter then advertised but not by much</li>

            <li> I was a little weary of it because of the bad reviews, but I was really impressed by it.</li>
            <li> The hair was pretty thick for a doll head, and it was very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few doll heads for cosmetology school, and this one was the first one I bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I think it was a little shorter then advertised but not by much</li>
            <li> Ive curled using a little hairspray, shampooed conditioned, blown dry, straightened with a hot iron 40 settings i used 25, and bleached and shes has held up well.</li>
            <li> After she finishes with this mannequin, it will go to my other daughter, who will then use it for Artwork (she&#x27;s a budding artist).</li>
            <li> She has practice numerous up-do&#x27;s, used a curling iron, flat iron, etc.</li>
            <li> I received this product and I thought the hair would have been longer but is not even as long as in the picture that they&#x27;re showing you as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter</li>
            <li> I bought it for my long class</li>
            <li> It was maybe 13 inched long at</li>
            <li> The mannequin I got has the hair 13&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li> She is now bald, along with several other mannequins, in my daughters room.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I would recommend spending the extra money for something you can actually use to do a few haircuts on.</li>
            <li> The hair is really human hair but the hair is really thin in the middle and not long enough!</li>
            <li> Good Mannequin, but the hair is very thin (not a full head) and it sheds a ridiculous amount.  </li>
            <li> Obviously cut previously.</li>
            <li> But, thinking outside the box for a little teen/ tween girl...SUCCESS.</li>
            <li> Her hair is so soft and shiny that it is a little hard to do french braids and stuff.</li>
            <li> Just some loose ends!</li>
            <li> These, manican head where lacking of hair density ,also the holes do not fit standard manican head stands</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected for a mannequin.</li>
            <li> The quality of the mannequin is not as expected.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and very Scraggly ends.</li>
            <li> her hair is so soft and thick</li>
            <li> When you have a 10 year old who loves to do hair but just doesn&#x27;t know if she is still in the doll phase, get her a creepy human hair head!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good Mannequin, but the hair is very thin (not a full head) and it sheds a ridiculous amount.  But for my daughter to just play in the hair and start styling on her own, its okay.</li>
            <li> The mannequin&#x27;s hair was very thin, and on top of that, it shed tremendously.  I bought it as a tool to assist my daughter in learning how to &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; hair....by the time we get to the &amp;#34;nitty gritty&amp;#34;, the training tool will be bald.  She is still enjoying herself, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I received this product and I thought the hair would have been longer but is not even as long as in the picture that they&#x27;re showing you as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter she likes it I love it</li>
            <li> I enjoy it :) there are some random strands of different colors hair that doesn&#x27;t make sense, like purple and white, but overall I&#x27;m happy with it and how it work :) I don&#x27;t mind the colored stands either :) great for beginners just messing around</li>
            <li> Helen is an amazing mannequin and if you get her you won&#x27;t regret it. Helen&#x27;s hair can be: curled, straightened, braided, washed, and much more! 10/10 I would buy her again!</li>
            <li> Not even 20&amp;#34; very disappointed. Obviously cut previously.</li>
            <li> The hair looks much longer in the picture than it actually is.  It is very tapered and layered.  The hair itself is nice and easy to work with.  I just wish it was longer.</li>
            <li> i love this mannequin i got what i was expecting , it also came in 3 days which was pretty quick. also she did have black stains on her face but other than that its perfect i would totally recommend it i would buy another one !</li>
            <li> Hair at the ends of this manikin is a little bit scraggly. I would just purchase the 18 - 19\\&quot; manikin if the sole purpose was cutting. But the hair is good quality, can take heat and cooperates.</li>
            <li> I got my manikin head for college and she has a double stamped eye where it looks like she has two eye colors on top of the other and the other eye has no color. And there is a big dent in her cheek. Not as presentable as I wished it would have been. It arrived quick. The hair was less than 20&amp;#34; im guessing mine was a defect. Just make sure these don&#x27;t look like this before you ship them out.</li>
            <li> Amazing and fast shipping , I love u guys always send my order early then I respecting :) the mannequin was great , and I would Order other one soon :) thank so much for the awesome job :)</li>
            <li> Started off nice and the lighter I tried to color it, the more hair fell out. I just bleached it and as I was brushing it out, HUGE clumps of hair came out. Going to try and save it to see if I can salvage what&#x27;s left of the hair. I do NOT recommend bleaching this hair.</li>
            <li> The hair is really human hair but the hair is really thin in the middle and not long enough! It was about 16 inches. I bought it for my long class and i had to modify the style. Its not good for long hair up-do&#x27;s. It&#x27;s good for shampoo set&#x27;s and for state board..</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loooooooovessential her manikin head</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to buy from here. The product was even better than I expected</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and she keep washing it and conditioning it the hair got matted and i had to trash it.</li>
            <li> looks exactly like the picture.  maybe about 10% less hair though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not come with pole or anything to mount to counter</li>
            <li> She works well for the price, we teach with her and she is easy to cut and color. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She has practice numerous up-do&#x27;s, used a curling iron, flat iron, etc. and the hair has held up well.</li>
            <li> The head seem a little small to me but my daughter loved anyways. It came on time plus it didnt cost me as much.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> What we needed great service!</li>
            <li> It had a very strong smell when i first opened it and last until it was shampooed. But i can practice State Board exam on it - blowdrying, thermal ironing at ease.</li>
            <li> Perefect i received exactly what I was expecting good piece for stylists to practice on good price would like to get a blonde one</li>
            <li> These, manican head where lacking of hair density ,also the holes do not fit standard manican head stands</li>
            <li> My mom bought Helen for me and she is a beautiful mannequin. All though she does have scraggly ends I can deal with it. Her hair is so soft and shiny that it is a little hard to do french braids and stuff. She also does look a bit different in then in the picture. But in a good way!!!</li>
            <li> Just as cheap as my school could get and I didn&#x27;t have to order 3</li>
            <li> STUNNING . perfect for cutting hair and styles came very quick and hair is super long was worth the price</li>
            <li> Hair was way shorter than listed in the description. It was maybe 13 inched long at it&#x27;s longest point. They did make it right for me very quickly however.</li>
            <li> The hair is listed at 20-22&amp;#34;, but it certainly seems a lot shorter than that. It should still be a good practice mannequin for most things, but I was hoping for a little more length to practice braiding on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few doll heads for cosmetology school, and this one was the first one I bought from Amazon. I was a little weary of it because of the bad reviews, but I was really impressed by it. The hair was pretty thick for a doll head, and it was very soft. Definitely impressed with the quality, and will repurchase once I cut off all the hair! :D</li>
            <li> This manikin definitely meets my expectations. I start cosmetology school in November at Paul Mitchell and wanted to get some practice in. So far I have cut, colored, and styled my manikins hair. Very little hair has fallen out. It has been extremely beneficial!</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed in this item it was a much smaller head than I was used to and the hair is deceiving it looks much longer and thicker on the mannequin head not much to work with I purchased the head to do up-dos on but not happy the hair is too thin</li>
            <li> Hair was lovely when received but as time went on the hair started to get horrible.</li>
            <li> Delivery was promptly.  Products in good order.  Would shop again.</li>
            <li> I didnt know what to expect so I ordered Helen and NIcole. I havent worked on Nicole yet but Helen and I have become buddies these last 36 hours, lol.  Ive curled using a little hairspray, shampooed conditioned, blown dry, straightened with a hot iron 40 settings i used 25, and bleached and shes has held up well. a little breakage but with a loop brush i eliminated that problem. go to ShannonJustShannon on FB to see pics. her hair is so soft and thick ive ordered a second today and the blonde version of her. Im going to color her hair now bye!</li>
            <li> very good product bought for my friend and she was very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> The hair on the head is very thin, shorter than expected. I was looking forward to creating elaborate styles, coloring it, but the hair is not strong enough, I want to return it and my money back ðŸ˜¢</li>
            <li> Will shop with this business again!! Resonable prices, great quality. Easy to work with, great hair. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I got these manikins for my grandchildren for x-mas.  They were a big hit.  The hair styles easily and they all like fixing hair and trying new hair styles.  The real human hair works great and the selling point for me</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money!  The hair sheds drastically everytime you comb or style it.  It has little knots throughout the head, and when you comb it, more hair falls out.  I wish I had read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> Not 22&amp;#34;, closer to 16&amp;#34;. But otherwise good condition and hair texture. Head is smaller than a real human head but that&#x27;s expected for a mannequin. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest perming because it feels chemically treated but holds up to heat styling. Alright quality for a beauty student and definitely worth the (low) price.</li>
            <li> The hair is coming off.. I was expecting a better product. The quality of the mannequin is not as expected.</li>
            <li> hair was not 18 inches it was thin and shed alot. waste on money.</li>
            <li> Poor quality and very Scraggly ends. And the length was shorter than stated. I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I would recommend spending the extra money for something you can actually use to do a few haircuts on.</li>
            <li> This was disgusting. There were scabs in the hair. I wanted to throw up. I can&#x27;t comment on the manageability for styling, because I immediately returned it. I did not even take the hair out of the ponytail that it came in because I was so disgusted, but I agree with the reviewers that said the hair was of uneven length and thin.</li>
            <li> perfect but the hair its not the best</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> Great doll....human hair, although it did have something mixed but it still got the job done. Was able to use it for several bleaching and color project&#x27;s. It was full but not to thick which made it great for cutting and thermal styles.....good doll. Ps. I think it was a little shorter then advertised but not by much</li>
            <li> My daughter, 17, is studying cosmetology in high school. She goes through mannequins like crazy. This mannequin was comparable in price to the ones they get through the school. But, she was a different name/face. As for her hair. It has been colored, curled, cut,and everything else that could be done to hair. She is now bald, along with several other mannequins, in my daughters room. After she finishes with this mannequin, it will go to my other daughter, who will then use it for Artwork (she&#x27;s a budding artist). Reduce, reuse, and recycle. Well definitely be ordering a few more mannequins, soon.</li>
            <li> She is a little thin on hair but, my daughter still likes it.</li>
            <li> hair was stiff and damaged</li>
            <li> This mannequin training hear was worth the purchase, it was sturdy, and the hair was good quality along with the lenth!</li>
            <li> hair was easy to work with</li>
            <li> The hair looks much longer in the pic. There are about 3 strands of hair that are the correct length, while the rest is about 2 -3 inches shorter. Its a little thin, but not too thin. I bought it with intentions of experimenting with color. It serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> I purchased Helen for my 10 year old daughter who loves to do hair, wash, cut, curl and braid.  Everything was going good until she washed the hair, it turned into a rock...HORRIBLE!!!!!</li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter loves doing hair, so I order this for her and she loves it! Now only if I can get her to stop.</li>
            <li> Great for cosmetology class</li>
            <li> This was a birthday present for my granddaughter and I am sure that she will love it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.  Was delivered within  two days of ordering</li>
            <li> its very thin and stringy. Its ok for the price but I would suggest spending more to get a better one at a  professional store.</li>
            <li> The mannequin I got has the hair 13&amp;#34; long. I just did contact the seller and said they measure the hair from the forehead to the tip.  I feel they are giving me the most ridiculous excuse I&#x27;ve ever heard. The gave me the option to ask for a refund but I need to send back my item and obviously pay for the shipment my own. The description for this item is incorrect. I&#x27;m not happy with it.</li>
            <li> When you have a 10 year old who loves to do hair but just doesn&#x27;t know if she is still in the doll phase, get her a creepy human hair head!!!  I swear - total silence has led me to rush upstairs on occasion only to find her AND my younger daughter braiding, curling, styling, brushing this dolls head!!!  We haven&#x27;t shampooed yet - because we haven&#x27;t applied product to it.  We bought the clamp separately...and have it mounted to a little step stool.  It&#x27;s great!!!  If you&#x27;re in beauty school, I am sure this will be great for you.  But, thinking outside the box for a little teen/ tween girl...SUCCESS.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, I used my marcel iron on her and my test turned out wonderfully ! When my school was selling heads at 120$ each I had to jump on this mannequin</li>
            <li> hair was 12 inches instead of 20 inches and did not come with a clamp</li>
            <li> Really nice mannequin head.  The only reason I did not give a five star rating is because they did not state up front that this was&lt;br /&gt;fake hair.  Otherwise, it served the purpose for my daughter at cosmotology school.</li>
            <li> Worked great for teaching a Ombre class</li>
            <li> Nice mannequine , it had good long thick hair ! I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more !!</li>
            <li> If you are considering buying this for you daughter (age 11) to play with - don&#x27;t.  The hair sheds like crazy, it is completely thin, uneven and scraggly.  While the measurement from the forehead to end is 22 only about 16&amp;#34; are actually usable.  It looks ridiculous in a pony tail and is completely pointless to french braid.  Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Hair looks a lot longer in the picture than the mannequin itself. The ends are terrible. But I just bought it to practice my braiding so I guess it&#x27;s ok for that. Scalp is very realistic.</li>
            <li> awesome mankin. she was just what i needed for my cosmetology class!</li>
            <li> I hate it it sucks!!!!</li>
            <li> good for color practice.  Okay for styling.  thin in the back so if your trying to do a braid you will run out of hair.</li>
            <li> The hair is very short and thin so I don&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in beauty school now and this is great! At first the some of the hair falls out but not much. Just some loose ends!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the head to be so small,  it was like a child&#x27;s head but the hair is good, I&#x27;m in cosmetology school and I guess I should be working with different shaped heads</li>
            <li> I got this for class and I&#x27;m not too thrilled. Of course I&#x27;ll still use it because its not too unmanageable. The class and I decided that how I got it was the definition of why not to cut close to the scalp when texturizing. 10/10 would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I would gave it 5 stars but after you wash the hair it get nappy really fast,and the hair sheds easy.But it do curl nice and you can constantly add heat</li>
            <li> really nice.  I bought it for my daughter to perfect curling, braiding, and flat ironing so she wouldn&#x27;t want to practice on my hair.  She loves it &amp; her cousin (13yrs old) wants Helen for her birthday so, I will be ordering again. Hair doesnt shed and holds a good curl.</li>
            <li> Hair not as thick or as long as pictured</li>
            <li> Beat my expectations :-)</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this mannequin I bought her for xmas; however, I was under the impression that it came with the stand. I hate when sellers do that!</li>
            <li> I brought this mannequin for my daughter for Christmas. When we opened the box and I saw the hair I was leery about the quality of the hair. I should have went with my first mine. After 2 months of only combing and styling the hair it has tangled to the point where you can&#x27;t comb through the hair.</li>
