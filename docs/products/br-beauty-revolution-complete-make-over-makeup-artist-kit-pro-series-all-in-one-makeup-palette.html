            <li> My wife loved this kit. She&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be so good, attractive, we&#x27;ll organized compartment and you donate have to buy brushes, because they are included.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teen daughter for Christmas. Seems to be of good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  Exactly as described. My child will love this--came on time, actually before. Thank you</li>
            <li> Very nice make up kit given as gift that has all your basic essentials plus much more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an appropriate quality for the price. We bought this for our 10-year-old daughter to play dress up with friends. I would never purchase this for a woman of any age. The brush qualities are very poor. The little girls love it but do not buy this for a teen or a woman that you care about.</li>
            <li> colors go on dark, but dont stay dark for long...eyeliner is good, i like it.</li>
            <li> It was good my mom reall liked it</li>
            <li> Got it for my sister for Christmas. She loves it. The set is beautiful and made of quality materials. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This kit is all you need to travel, or to use daily.  Compact, yet featuring all the colors you will need to enhance your&lt;br /&gt;complexion and eyes!  Brushes are included to help line your eyes or eyebrows, and to blend the colors perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The bronze, platinum and plum&#x27;s shimmering shadows will  enhance the sparkle in your eyes!  Goodness, the kit&lt;br /&gt;even comes with a pocket sized mascara! For your locker or the car, a must-have &#x27;quick-artist&#x27;s&#x27; kit!</li>
            <li> Just perfect, I love it</li>
