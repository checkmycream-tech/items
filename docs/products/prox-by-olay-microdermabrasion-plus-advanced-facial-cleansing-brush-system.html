            <li>It is literally the best face scrubber I have ever used, and I will buy more after it is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never used a microdermabrasion product, but I have heard from so many people that it is just wonderful.</li>
            <li>Great product for a good price</li>

            <li>love love this product!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect clean!  </li>
            <li>Honestly that is how good your skin looks and how good you feel about yourself!</li>
            <li>vert good for cleansing</li>
            <li>Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>A good product.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price range.</li>
            <li>really good quality product and the results are great!&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>i loved it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>and it feels good to me during and</li>
            <li>and it feels good to me during and after.    </li>
            <li>and maybe thats all it was good for...</li>
            <li>Bought one for myself because I was looking for a good cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>so this is a good thing.</li>
            <li>and it is good.</li>
            <li>Good price and good product</li>
            <li>but it is a really good product</li>
            <li>the unit is fairly lightweight and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>and it is good</li>
            <li>and while i loved that, I realized that sometimes it would still make my skin feel patchy.</li>
            <li>Also it shows good results if you use good cream after cleanising with it.</li>
            <li>: If you have pimples dont use it on that part of your face.&lt;br /&gt;I did not found Thermal Crystal Polisher that good, cz</li>
            <li>This one seems just as good as the others</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t explain it at all..but loved the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for weeks now just to give it a fair shot</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>I should have, however, listened to the reviews that this is not even as good as a washcloth, which is also cheaper.</li>
            <li>and surprisingly, the sonic vibration is what I ended up not liking about it.  </li>
            <li>My daughter tried it and loved it as well.</li>
            <li>Good for traveling too.</li>
            <li>great price for all you get, the brush is nice but the dermabrasion sponge is tricky to use.</li>
            <li>The 3 speeds are fantastic and the sponge head attachment works perfect on the highest setting just as the instructions suggest.</li>
            <li>Good product, recommend.</li>
            <li>Also did a good job of cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an I-Skin device which I loved.  </li>
            <li>Good price and faster deliver</li>
            <li>good quality&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>Really good product, works as advertised.</li>
            <li>After using it, when I apply my night creams it goes on smooth and seeps into my skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>ALL THAT GOOD</li>
            <li>What works for me for night cleansing: I use my fingers using a good quality face creamy cleanser, compatible to my skin type, to remove make up or environmental dirt.</li>

            <li>Maybe my unit was a dud and everyone else had a good one.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the clarisonic cleansing system, did my homework and found this, got good reviews and ordered it, even got $3 off coupon.</li>
            <li>This is so good I&#x27;m going to buy one for my mom for her Birthday.</li>
            <li>My wife said it did a really good job.  </li>
            <li>This is a good buy.</li>
            <li>I think it was a good buy and would recommend it to others and have already to my son and his daughter.</li>

            <li>Good quality for the price</li>
            <li>I think it is as good as the $100 ones found in department stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with how clean my face is after using the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>Lemme say its the best clean I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>The fact that it was a Cyber Monday Special deal was great!</li>
            <li>Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I used easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no fountain of youth to be sure, but it&#x27;s sure impressed the heck out of me.</li>
            <li>It is light, fits in your hand very nicely and does a great job.</li>
            <li>The mocroderm pad is very good too my face feels so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>im very sure this is not water resistant in any way.</li>
            <li>For the price it was great, love using the brush.</li>
            <li>The price was also very appealing.</li>
            <li>or so I will be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it, does a great job.</li>
            <li>face feels GREAT after using it :)</li>
            <li>This is a quality product, and it&#x27;s a great value for those looking for something comparable to the Clarisonic, but at a better price range.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the cleansers aren&#x27;t that great, but when used with something better, this thing is a beast.</li>
            <li>The three speed variation is great, works as well as clarisonic and has cleared up so many skin imperfections for me.</li>
            <li>The brush is great :)</li>
            <li>But I am most happy with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Works good and effective.</li>
            <li>This brush is still a great part of a regimen because it does keep the rest of your face very clean.</li>
            <li>Feeling very good, clean</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing price and product~ good~ nice cleansing system</li>

            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I love this ProX set!</li>
            <li>The product is great and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>The level of power it has is not quite as strong as I would like it to be, but works great.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to use and does a great job of cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>works fine, skin feels great after using it.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>but this microdermabrasion gel is AMAZING...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing reviews</li>
            <li>skin feels amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing cleansing system &amp; you can use any cleanser with it.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought the Clarisonic Mia after hearing amazing things about it online and from my friends that have it.  </li>
            <li>My face feels amazing</li>
            <li>works amazing.</li>
            <li>that is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping to find an amazing product at an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing tool.</li>
            <li>My mom also uses it and we both have noticed amazing results in just 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>the Amazing</li>
            <li>I felt amazing</li>
            <li>I have mostly stopped wearing makeup, because I think this product has made my skin so bright and has somehow evened out my skin</li>
            <li>It feels amazing during and after using.</li>
            <li>My face feels amazing after I use it.</li>
            <li>thats about as nice as i can be.  </li>
            <li>works really well and makes my face look and feel great afterwards!!</li>
            <li>I also think it is nice that you can use any type of wash/scrub you want with brushes and adjust pressure during use.</li>
            <li>I have had much better results from a good exfoliating face wash</li>
            <li>My skin feels good and looks better.</li>
            <li>Since they ran out, I use my own products.</li>
            <li>this is a nice tool and product.  </li>
            <li>So I was thrilled to get to try out the Olay Pro-X Cleaning System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used both brushes, and I liked that the spinning head rotated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, it does the job, massages face skin and cleans it really good.</li>
            <li>Quite nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>Your hands get kind of sore.</li>
            <li>As is all too often the case with this type of thing, just save up to get the nice version instead of wasting money on something that&#x27;s just so-so</li>
            <li>stars because I did like one of the scrubs that came with this kit (the one that gets warm when you apply it.)</li>
            <li>the Pro-X does a nice job.</li>
            <li>For me, it isn&#x27;t needed to be honest.</li>
            <li>I chose this product based on my own needs.</li>
            <li>For me, it isn&#x27;t needed to be honest.</li>
            <li>I chose this product based on my own needs.</li>
            <li>I use it with my Olay regenerist cleanser and it cleans so nicely.</li>
            <li>liked the brush and the cleanser, though it wasn&#x27;t super-scrubby, like an \\&quot;exfoliator\\&quot; is, in my experience.</li>
            <li>, ultimately: it&#x27;s a nice tool.</li>
            <li>But the pad/polisher combo doesn&#x27;t seem as nice.</li>
            <li>used the exfoliating tool with my own cleanser during my morning shower and then before bed I decided to try the thermal cream with the microdermabrasion head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice thing about this kit is that you can purchase the two brush head attachments separately</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice thing about this kit is that you can purchase the two brush head attachments separately</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>I even tried using the scrub with just my fingers like I use my microdermabrasion crystals, which was nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the product is Good.. :)</li>
            <li>Kind of self explanatory tho.</li>
            <li>and I have really liked using this product.</li>
            <li>but I do look forward to it though to be honest once I&#x27;m finished with the supplied cleanser</li>
            <li>I am loving this product i have used it twice and see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>The cleanser and crystals are nice, but I just use Cetaphil on my skin and then apply the spin brush or sponge.  </li>
            <li>The price of the whole set on Amazon is the best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Skin feels nice after use.</li>
            <li>Have not used their cleaning products yet, use my own.</li>
            <li>but I liked the fact that it has 3 rotation speed levels .</li>
            <li>foam head is nice, but I won&#x27;t replace it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping not, because as nice as this device is I don&#x27;t want to have to buy strictly Olay product in order to use it.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates nicely and my skin feels smoother than before.</li>
            <li>The brush feels nice on my face and is not abrasive.</li>
            <li>I also liked how it removed the skin flakes that I get from my nightly use of Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She points out that she uses her own cleanser, not the cleanser provided by</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would be awesome, cost efficient and amazing for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice product.. as described.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used with own cleanser</li>
            <li>I have been using this system over one month and honestly it works, I had some marks on my chin</li>
            <li>She really liked it.</li>
            <li>It is nice to feel my skin dewy again.</li>
            <li>And the &amp;#34;warming thermal scrub&amp;#34; stuff for the microderm does seem to warm for me.</li>
            <li>It feels nice to have your face rubbed, but that is the extent of what it does.</li>
            <li>but I have tried the manual Face brush and even though you do need to do the work on your own you can control the pressure and motion, which in the case of this face brush I feel like</li>
            <li>I used my friends Clarisonic and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>I even put in my own batteries.  </li>
            <li>But otherwise good deal and value for the price :)</li>
            <li>this is really nice</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE LOVE it!!  </li>
            <li>this product is great, especially compared to the systems out there that cost a lot more!!!</li>
            <li>My face is clean without irritation and the cost is great with the added coupon that Amazon kindly throws</li>
            <li>choice is not wrong very good</li>
            <li>very good and reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I kind of knew that I would love this product, but I have still been impressed by how much it has brightened my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased, and do recommend this for a more affordable option to clarisonic</li>
            <li>The Thermal Polish cream was nice with a very fine grit.</li>
            <li>I love this kit it really works as my skin is smoother and brighter, and the price was great!</li>
            <li>i think its perfect for anyone who wants something more than their hands but dont want to spend the 200 bucks.</li>
            <li>There are super pricey ones out there, but this one is absolutely great for the price.</li>
            <li>brush itself also has three speeds, and you change the speeds by pushing on buttons, which are very easy to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any real significant changes...</li>
            <li>I am glad to have a great product at a low cost.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to supply a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard about how amazing the clairsonic brush is and after this one is done I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll make the investment.</li>
            <li>No, it will not give you the look of a professional microdermabrasion, but in between it works perfect.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that the Olay scrubber would help smooth my skin as part of a routine, and some of the reviews indicate that it is a good product.</li>
            <li>The CS rep to whom I spoke said that this probably isn&#x27;t the best product for someone with sensitive skin, as I have.  </li>
            <li>I do love the warm tingle of the microdermabrasion scrub though.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Clarisonic, I own one</li>
            <li>Since my husband is one of the world&#x27;s most honest men, if he didn&#x27;t agree with this, he would have said something noncommittal to skirt the issue.  </li>
            <li>I honestly had better expectations for this.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is good and the skin looks polished and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and batteries included!</li>
            <li>Very drying so good moisturizer is a must!</li>
            <li>In this case, with the very good results I can clearly see, I won&#x27;t be taking them up on it, but it&#x27;s nice to know</li>
            <li>I love the product, My skin felt great and looked fresh.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it cleaned my skin and was very happy with the the overall performance.  </li>
            <li>Did an ok job wasn&#x27;t spectacular needs more heads</li>
            <li>Great delivery time and I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>the product is great does exactly what it says on the box</li>
            <li>and I am pretty happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to try microdermabreasion, and this is a great first try.</li>
            <li>great price, works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gift for my wife and she feel happy with it ;)</li>
            <li>That one was cool, but rubbing the crystals with your hands is fairly abrasive.</li>
            <li>I almost never leave the house without full makeup because I&#x27;m so fair</li>
            <li>I almost never leave the house without full makeup because I&#x27;m so fair</li>
            <li>and it is very comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li>What I like about this product is that your face is very smooth afterwords.  </li>
            <li>My face feels very smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>etc. is easy, but it would be nice to know what recommended duration you should use</li>
            <li>Enjoy the price most of all.!</li>
            <li>Very good, face skin&#x27;s alive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s there.ith the very good results I can clearly see, I won&#x27;t be taking them up on it, but</li>
            <li>so glad i got this 15$ cheaper than in stores</li>
            <li>vitagoods, way better brand</li>
            <li>Great Deal, thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>The color of my skin is more even over-all.</li>
            <li>The samples that come with it are okay</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel fabulous!</li>
            <li>After just 3 days, I noticed that most of my acne was gone.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy that I bought this.</li>
            <li>Was the best decision because my skin felt smoother after just one use and it is looks brighter after only 1 week.  </li>
            <li>My wife said it was just an OK product.</li>
            <li>As for having more radiant skin</li>
            <li>does a better job than hand scrubs or gloves..</li>
            <li>Now I just need to use it more often...</li>
            <li>I love using this product once a week.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have as many breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this unit.</li>
            <li>As many have said before there are no instructions included with the product.</li>
            <li>My fingers worked better.</li>
            <li>I only used it once/twice a week, always used good quality, fresh batteries and took excellent care of it.</li>
            <li>Clarisonic cost a lot more but well</li>
            <li>/&gt;you have a better chance doing it manually (and by that</li>
            <li>The device doesn&#x27;t do anything more than I can with my hands.</li>
            <li>I love the thermal crystal polish</li>
            <li>But despite this I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>most people answered &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>and I do love the Olay line of face products.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to use sandpaper, but it should exfoliate better.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been a magic wand, but my face has improved a bit since I started to use this.</li>
            <li>but it is better and easier than washing your face with your hands.</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase the Clairisonic, but wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend &amp;#</li>
            <li>I love this my face feels so much more cleaner</li>
            <li>I love Olay and this product did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li>Best facial thing I have bought EVER!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon provided me this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Amazon provided me this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Maybe used along with a Clarisonic brush the effect I want would be better.</li>
            <li>I love this machine.</li>
            <li>love this brush and its speeds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with how well this product works.</li>
            <li>I sincerely hope it works as well for you as it did for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System Kit my HIGHEST recommendation!ndation!</li>
            <li>I felt it could use more power.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I haven&#x27;t found a microdermabrasion treatment yet that I have been satisfied with and, when given the chance to try Olay&#x27;s version, I went for it.  </li>
            <li>I am sure you will see results.</li>
            <li>Went in with fairly moderate expectations and have been impressed.</li>
            <li>After one use of the Clarisonic, my skin was smoother and my makeup went on much better.</li>
            <li>and I feel pleased with the difference</li>
            <li>One is I thought it would be more powerfull rotation.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all I need is to tug more wrinkles around my eyes...</li>
            <li>I still have the two cleansers it came with after many face washes as you just need a dab.</li>
            <li>Perhaps someone else has had better results.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and we both love it.</li>
            <li>Just an ok item.</li>
            <li>Will be investing in a better model.</li>
            <li>I really love the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working like magic...</li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Overall, Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li>It was an okay deal although it said that I would get 3.00 off but it didn&#x27;t,</li>
            <li>my face is more radiant than ever , would recommend.</li>
            <li>This was the best price for similar products.</li>
            <li>Over all satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product and will more than likely buy again once this one gives out.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I still like mine better.</li>
            <li>the Pro X Cleansing System, in addition to the cleansing tool and exfoliating cream, you get another head attachment for microdermabrasion and a thermal cream for even more thorough exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my pores look so much better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my pores look so much better</li>
            <li>I like this product just wish it had more power.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>and it was dropped one too many times and had stopped working after 2 years</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for about four months now and my skin does feels better from when I started.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be purchasing another one, for sure.</li>
            <li>I just have to say to all those who say clarosonic is better than this... don&#x27;t believe them.</li>
            <li>that is the MAGIC ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>With that being said, I love this Olay kit.</li>
            <li>I love love love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>The microdermabrasion part I love as well.</li>
            <li>and I love that too.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my face feel.... nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love the exfoliation on my skin without having to spend $100+ on the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>I have used oil of olay for many years, which is the reason i chose their product</li>
            <li>and I can say I&#x27;m satisfied with this</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>I &#x27;really&#x27; enjoyed using this product</li>
            <li>This is so much better than just a face cloth.</li>
            <li>and we both agree her skin looks much better as it has taken away the dullness.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have really enjoyed using it</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love the 3 speeds and 2 heads.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>have had before that works even better.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is beating most stores by $15.00 to $16.00.</li>
            <li>I chose to review this item because there are not a lot of affordable at home Microdermabrasion machines that you can buy without having a degree in dermatology to understand how to safely use it.</li>
            <li>It was so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I did not experience any irritation or redness though I am not prone to that with most cleansers.</li>
            <li>I ended up using the scrub with my fingers which did leave my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for facial exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>just as described i love it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Do I need any more salon spa facials?  </li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with the cleansing results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this product -my  </li>
            <li>Instructions for how to use the products could have been better..</li>
            <li>but after using this I noticed more makeup on the brush.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting something built by Tim The Toolman Taylor, ripping along at 60mph, however I get a better scrub from my washcloth.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles don&#x27;t need any help to get deeper and more noticeable</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it also contains a sample size of the exfoliating cream and MDA gel.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re wanting something cheap but works!</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt better</li>
            <li>My skin is so much more brighter &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li>I am sure this works well, I just need to take the time to do it like it says.</li>
            <li>You get MUCH better results with the polisher if you just use your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love what this product is doing for my face.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>and I would like for there to be more exfoliation beads.</li>
            <li>, it is also possible to do dermabrasion, GREAT!</li>
            <li>I wish there were more than 3 speeds.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t stop touching my skin afterwards in shock from the smoothness.</li>
            <li>She said it works excellent and helps make her look younger.</li>
            <li>The instructions say (in many languages) how to put the batteries in, and which product to use with which attachment.  </li>
            <li>If you decide to use this, make sure you have all your hair secured as if you were scrubbing in to surgery.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to think up what else I might be able to use the machine for but have concluded I might as well just throw it away.</li>
            <li>:) The wand even shows you which way the batteries go in.</li>
            <li>after 2 microdermabraision uses, visibly improved texture and more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this kit.</li>
            <li>Everything you need to start working towards healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the micro-dermabrasion brush head yet, but the regular scrubber works wonderful.</li>
            <li>It works great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but I will buy more of the exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great price.</li>
            <li>I recommend finding an alternative microderm gel or cream and using it in conjunction with the Olay pad for better results.</li>
            <li>hope my face get smoother with this Olay~:)</li>
            <li>and i love it&lt;</li>
            <li>, i tried lots of DIY treatments for my scars and this product worked SO well better than anything else</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews and decided on this product, and I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the product makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>This product is not what I thought it would be:  I can get a better cleaning experience using my hands.</li>
            <li>Love that it came with both the brush and sponge heads.</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li>Product is just ok.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way my skin glows now with both of the included products.</li>
            <li>Cleans OK.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this reasonably priced item.</li>
            <li>You can use it with the products enclosed or with your favorite products.</li>
            <li>but it did make my skin softer and cleaned most of my pores.</li>
            <li>In most cases I find using the crystals once every 2 weeks for olive or darker skins do not trigger hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more radiant.</li>
            <li>Cleans my face, but does not seem to be doing do much better than washing with my hands.</li>
            <li>OMG i love this thing</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love, love this machine.</li>
            <li>This Olay Pro-X worked much better for me.  </li>
            <li>Also as the brush spins instead of vibrating, it cleans my skin faster and seems to leaving my skin glowing because its more vigorous and sends the blood up to my skin better.  </li>
            <li>, I have better results with my chemical exfoliator which I rub on my face.</li>
            <li>I never got more of the cleaning products that came with it.</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to buy more soon.</li>
            <li>We love this mattress</li>
            <li>This facial microdermabrasion brush set works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this device.  </li>
            <li>skin love it :)</li>
            <li>This is okay...</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love to use this one,</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this, bought me and my sister one</li>
            <li>we both love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to quit using it just because of the device even if it where as I&#x27;m sure my skin is just adjusting to the more vigorous scrubbing &#x27;ceremony&#x27;.</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>This works just OK.  </li>
            <li>Makes the makeup blend in with your face even more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the 3 speeds, and being ablle to use microdermabrasion head at home.</li>
            <li>Speed 3 is the Microdermabrasion Speed that is meant to be used with the Microdermabrasion Foam Head; it supposedly exfoliates 700% better than their scrub</li>
            <li>Creams and masks work so much better after using this product.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of microdermabrasion</li>
            <li>I have been using this for almost 3 weeks and my skin looks and feels smooth and softer!  </li>
            <li>Use this system 2 times a week for a better complexion.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be sure</li>
            <li>More even skin tone after about two weeks&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser causes me to breakout, I don&#x27;t know if I would have received better results if I could use</li>
            <li>Because the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser causes me to breakout, I don&#x27;t know if I would have received better results if I could use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in the trying stages but love the way it makes my skin feel and has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>My skin already feels smoother, and I notice that my moisturizer goes on so much better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.....</li>
            <li>Love the 3 speed setting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of just the friction from the sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better quality and cheaper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am impressed with the Microdermabrasion Plus System, I will continue to use it daily</li>
            <li>So, this system is supposed to increase the effectiveness of your face wash up to 700 times more than hands alone.  </li>
            <li>Skin looks radient and I have been using this product in the shower which is even more convient.</li>
            <li>I also love the face creams that it comes with</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>My wife love it.</li>
            <li>Well the pad wears out before the product is gone so you buy more to get the ONE head they supply</li>
            <li>and you end up with many unopened bottles.  </li>
            <li>I bought this three months ago and love it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.....</li>
            <li>Such a great product!!</li>
            <li>And now at a week, my skin looks so very much better.</li>
            <li>It is okay something I would not purchase again</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>For any OCM users reading this, I think I&#x27;m going to replace my brush head more often than what it calls for</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product and what my skin looks like now.</li>
            <li>I was more focused on my cheeks and forehead.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I was a smoker for many years (I am 68 yrs of age &amp; no longer smoke)</li>
            <li>…THAT is how lovely their skin is.</li>
            <li>certainly much better than nothing</li>
            <li>Cleans okay, but not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>But the attachments for it, don&#x27;t give any better effects than a cheaper version in the drugstore, or even a &#x27;buff pad&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I am also allergic to most products causing a breakout.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>Love this product and have sent my friends to get it.</li>
            <li>Am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads and crystals are more affordable for the Olay ProX</li>
            <li>But when it works, it does miracles to my skin :-).</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much more cleaner after using this.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;ll work better once replaced</li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>It is battery powered and safe to use I the shower.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the scrubber.</li>
            <li>After one week of use my skin is looking and feeling so much better and softer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Much better deal here</li>
            <li>I vowed to take better care of my skin but didnt want to spend $200 on a clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I use good face lotion right after I use this</li>
            <li>My skin looks beautiful, and it feels very soft.</li>
            <li>Used it a couple of times for the microdermabrasion and the exfoliating system and it made my skin look very smooth and clean!</li>
            <li>Works great for me, keeps my skin looking fresh and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I love using it because it makes my face feel so very clean.</li>
            <li>My daughter was very excited to find this gift under the Christmas tree this year.</li>
            <li>I also use this device when applying acne creme, very useful!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any significant results to be honest.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean nice</li>
            <li>I have since purchased more product I loved it so much!</li>
            <li>feels good, seems to very gently exfoliate  </li>
            <li>Quick ship, love the product and still using it!</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use...cleans very well.</li>
            <li>but as I was using it I couldn&#x27;t help but think good thing this thing is super light or else</li>
            <li>because the warming product is very cool and it will work better with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because the warming product is very cool and it will work better with this tool.    </li>
            <li>While normally I&#x27;d say be happy with what you have</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However in first week my skin didnt show any good output..</li>
            <li>Cleans my face pretty good.</li>
            <li>It feels really good when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li>machine does just ok for the cleaning and polishing purpose, but nothing supper special!</li>
            <li>I thought it was great that new batteries also came included</li>
            <li>works great, the smooth finishing pad did not hold up very well.</li>
            <li>Works just as easy as washing your face with a wash cloth before bed, but with stunning results.</li>
            <li>Just switch off the device, remove the attachment, and you can get your hair detatched from the attachment quite easily,  You might even  be able to get it untangled.</li>
            <li>If you need replacement brush or polishing heads, you should be able to find them easily.  </li>
            <li>Love this item, it was so easy to use and came with the betteries (def a plus).</li>
            <li>The kit comes with a nice brush that really scrubs the skin without being abrasive and the polisher has a nice effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very, very soft and looks great.</li>
            <li>I mean it does a good job, maybe not an excellent one but</li>
            <li>Just use a moisturizer after and clean the bristles!</li>
            <li>I purchased this set due to the great reviews and thought, way cheaper, maybe it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is an incredible product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System Kit.</li>
            <li>This is a great price and  better than the red package version I bought for way more money at the store.  </li>
            <li>Excellent skin cleansing and dermabrasion capabilities, but not much product included and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt my skin so consistently smooth for more than just a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve learned to correct that by lifting it off my skin just a tad so that it can move more freely.</li>
            <li>using it,I felt this one made it better smooth</li>
            <li>Works well and the brush is soft though it truly does a great job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>more like when you apply makeup and your skin color is even and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a great product so far.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I bought my mother one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about as good as any $5 exfoliating cleanser, didn&#x27;t really do much of anything.</li>
            <li>Thank you for good product with reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My daughter borrowed it and loved it so much I have to buy another for her...</li>
            <li>good and reasonable price</li>
            <li>it has been over a month and MY lines are NOW most definitely much fainter!!!</li>
            <li>Makes my face very smooth and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good considering such a great price.</li>
            <li>I use other face washes with it but find olays were probably best exfoliants.</li>
            <li>so I might be ticked off if I&#x27;d paid full price!</li>
            <li>Was used after the skin is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Is a very good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>All that plus its so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think this product would be great to have had when I was a teenager promoting better care of my skin at a younger age.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t give that easily, but for the price and what you get and how well it works, I think it deserves it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t give that easily, but for the price and what you get and how well it works, I think it deserves it.</li>

            <li>The product itself is easy to use though the box does not come with instructions on recommended time, amount or setting</li>
            <li>The buttons are easy toggles with a size difference you can feel so you don&#x27;t have to look in case</li>
            <li>It is compact and can easily be transported on trips.  </li>
            <li>more.)to find them easily.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy brush change.</li>

            <li>Easy to use....</li>
            <li>This is a desirable and easy to use product.</li>
            <li>easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Easy to pack for a weekend away from home too.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to get rid</li>
            <li>I also like how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>and it fits easily in my travel stuff without a problem</li>
            <li>Have really enjoyed using this because it makes my skin feel so clean and invigorated.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to switch out.</li>
            <li>Makes washing your face so easy</li>
            <li>Although not as strong or as thorough as a pro, I get no redness from using this.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer pointed out the activator from the peel is not included here so it will not be as strong</li>
            <li>Not that strong, but then again, you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than the more popular brands and does the same (or even better!)</li>
            <li>the cleanser and thermal polish gel are very gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my complexion or wrinkles but my face feels clean!</li>
            <li>It was ok, I didn&#x27;t notice anything special.</li>
            <li>Amazing how much cleaner it gets your skin!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased as it is very sturdy and works well with its 3 speeds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a Clarisonic, and this is the first of its kind that I&#x27;ve bought, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked it at first.</li>
            <li>I had the original version which didn&#x27;t have the microdermabrasion function, and it was the best money I ever spent.</li>
            <li>works ok not a lot of power but for the price not bad.</li>
            <li>The rep also said that I shouldn&#x27;t press down with the brush -- at all -- as it&#x27;s best to let the cleansing and exfoliating product do the job, rather than the brush.  </li>
            <li>I Love how clean my face feels after using Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li>Special offer when buy, wash very clean</li>
            <li>If you use once a day and keep it max at speed 2, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>and I like it fine.</li>
            <li>While it worked -it was just fine</li>
            <li>item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li>The thermal polisher works just fine on areas where the skin can&#x27;t be pulled-just be cautious around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>\\&quot;after 1 microdermabraision use, see noticeable improvement in the appearance of fine lines, radiance, brightness, and pores.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>Mine has worked just fine for my needs.</li>
            <li>I think my skin looks brighter, but I never saw any reduction in fine lines or anything.  </li>
            <li>(The grit of the crystal is so fine</li>
            <li>Love the brush - the brush pads wear out so quickly though.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very happy with my new clear skin.</li>
            <li>you want an easy to use microdermabrasion kit that you can use at home and not have to spend a lot of money, this kit may not be as good as a professional treatment</li>

            <li>My face look amazing , very clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>Debated about buying a clairsonic but went with the olay pro-x after reading all the reviews and seeing the huge price difference.  </li>
            <li>Noticed a huge difference in my skin in just two uses.</li>
            <li>It pulls around the eye area (a huge no no) and along the temples and forehead where that skin needs to not be rippled or furrowed- ever.</li>
            <li>Noticed a huge difference after just one use of the microdermabraision pad and cleanser.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality</li>
            <li>My skin just feels awesome no longer bumpy from dead skin and blackheads</li>
            <li>and I must say that my face feels extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>If it lasts for a year, I&#x27;ll be happy enough.  </li>
            <li>It is relaxing to have the brush sort of lightly massage your face</li>

            <li>Important Note:</li>
            <li>have been happy with its use, although I must say that I don&#x27;t feel the same cleansing \\&quot;pressure\\&quot; on my skin that I do with the Mia, in the use of either extension for the Pro-X.  </li>
            <li>So whether you can walk on your own feet or in a wheelchair I would recommend this for any lady who wants to keep her skin looking youthful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleaning spin brush for almost a year</li>
            <li>it now looks fresh and more even without a stitch of makeup</li>
            <li>Started developing some odd-looking bumps on my face, purchased this item to help smooth things out a bit after discussing microdermabrasion with my doctor.  </li>

            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]</li>
            <li>works fabulously.</li>
            <li>I came into work with almost no foundation on, just a light miners veil.</li>
            <li>This has been surprisingly effective and gentle.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I can say that there is a visible difference in my skin tone and my face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>I was puzzled as to how a smooth foam pad could do anything, until I opened the tube of cream.  </li>
            <li>And it doesnt have detailed description on how to maintain the brush etc</li>
            <li>It contains different speeds and is really great at scrubbing of the dirt from face.</li>
            <li>My make-up goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>The two included brush heads give you great microdermabrasion and cleansing, and the 3 speeds lets you customize your facial.</li>
            <li>It really does a nice job on cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>The cleanser and exfoliants are gentle but effective as well.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks I&#x27;m really happy as I&#x27;m finally breaking the breakout cycle that starts around my period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Olay Pro-X definitely does a great job at cleansing, and microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>If you are looking at the package, the microdermabraision head is the smooth one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package claims:&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>(Of course, you could also use one of those free makeup bags you get from cosmetics companies, BUT I would think Olay would want to take this opportunity to advertise their product.  </li>

            <li>Face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>She wants her own now.</li>
            <li>Light and comfortable handling.</li>
            <li>The included device, which circulates the exfoliation sponge and liquid, isn&#x27;t worth any more than $10.  </li>
            <li>Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>I truly enjoy the exfoliation of this product and the cleansers that come with it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as durable as I thought it would be, although it does get a light weight job done on cleaning the face etc.</li>
            <li>I may do it once a week but the regular brush seems to be working great for me as of now.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is CHEAP.</li>
            <li>Product is cheap, not made well</li>
            <li>If you really want effective cleaning for your skin - save your money and buy a Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>The regular head is great and u can see visible effects after 1 use.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 months ago and use the Advanced cleanser twice a week.</li>
            <li>The cleansing/spinning sponge brush works nicely, but the real gem is the exfoliating/spinning brush.</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li>it felt great, it was like having a facial massage.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li>There are a couple of weeks&#x27; worth in there since you don&#x27;t use it more than twice a week and not two days in a</li>
            <li>Great service - only niggle was parcel took about 4 weeks longer to arrive than the automated response said it would</li>
            <li>It is a great value and the cleanser and polishing lotions - you only need a teeny bit</li>
            <li>This Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System did not work like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>I was not going to pay $100+ for a facial cleaning brush and $50+ for replacement heads, this one works great for a fraction of the price and has inexpensive replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Works fabulously.</li>
            <li>It works great and has three (3) speed settings and comes with an exfoliate pad and a facial brush attachments.</li>
            <li>The brush handle seems a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the microdermabrasion setting/brush, but the cleansing brush was nice.</li>
            <li>price wasnt that great only saved on shipping.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Leaves face so smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall, great purchase.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth</li>
            <li>but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I use the old Olay brush and it did a good job cleaning</li>
            <li>I needed something that I could more frequently and cost effective.  </li>
            <li>It is like the difference between the old school interplak tooth brushes and the superior sonic care.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I found it easier to use this system just before a shower as the polish is gritty and to make sure my face is rinsed good.  </li>
            <li>Good product, once I&#x27;d used it noticed the difference On my skin as far how it felt and looked</li>
            <li>but this one is so much stronger and the extra speed is great!!  </li>
            <li>So far, so good</li>
            <li>My girlfriend use it and said her face is so good, feels soft.</li>
            <li>very handy tool for beautifying and the little extras are nice.</li>
            <li>This is a very effective microdermabrasion tool, but because the head spins rather than pulsates or vibrates unlike the clarisonic, it&#x27;s important to make sure the brush-head is really wet and soapy so that it doesn&#x27;t pull or tug at the skin.</li>
            <li>I love this and the price was right.</li>
            <li>does all, that it was meant too, must the chemicals, that are supplied need to be advertised, as very powerful, as they caused a redness on my face</li>
            <li>Both brushes are very useful.</li>
            <li>love the feel of a fresh clean face</li>
            <li>It feels so fresh, clean, and healthy.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>skin felt smooth and clean .</li>
            <li>It really clean my face and my face feels smooth.</li>
            <li>skin feels clean from inside and also smooth.</li>
            <li>but the system makes your face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>, My skin was so clean and had a light sheen.</li>
            <li>After I use this product my face feel smooth and clean,</li>
            <li>But do like the way it makes my face feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Using it during my morning showers makes it super easy to rinse off and I follow up with moisturizer and then make up.</li>
            <li>super easy to use and change out heads as needed&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Its nice to be pampered but if your primarily looking for change in the texture of your skin, this system is very effective and a small fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the original one before</li>
            <li>originally gave this 4 stars but am now dropping it to one.</li>
            <li>but we just buy the brush replacement so we each have our own and use our normal face wash</li>
            <li>I am excited to see where my skin is in a month.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this in the mail.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>The one thing this product could use is better instructions for when you use this the first time.  </li>
            <li>After first use, my skin felt better and softer.  </li>
            <li>Today is 5th day of using the system, i am very happy with a small result.</li>
            <li>i am so excited to try the microdermabrasion  brush tommorrow..</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!  </li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>I notice a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>When she first started using it, I asked her if it cleanses better.</li>
            <li>I had the original and replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li>I will probably repurchase the original kit without the microdermabrasion attachment.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had any significant improvements to my skin.</li>
            <li>Being satisfied with the Advanced Cleanser and cleansing brush, I just bought a large tube of cleanser and 2 replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>It works well my skins been super smooth.</li>
            <li>I switched to the brush and used the cleanser, I also used another product to help clean which was also an exfoliator</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel so clean</li>
            <li>and it feels so clean after I use this.  </li>
            <li>After using it, i felt that my face was really clean</li>
            <li>Does get my face clean.</li>
            <li>I can personally say that so far this has been the best investment ever.</li>
            <li>I can personally say that so far this has been the best investment ever.</li>
            <li>This product is really good, it cleans your face amazingly however it can be slightly harsh on sensative skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cleansing brush is nice for a deep clean, but my favorite thing about the kit is the foam head and scrub.</li>
            <li>It turns warm on your skin (to open your pores and clean better).</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and I find make-up applies more smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 plus and keep trying another way to clean my face.</li>
            <li>I was tentative about using an appliance on my sensitive skin but after enjoying the microdermabrasion treatment and wanting that but not being able to afford the $100/treatment pricel...</li>
            <li>This keeps your face clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>what it is, but my machine works when I try to clean it out and put in the batteries.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean it out, but its still there.</li>
            <li>It does what its suppossed to do essentially, clean.</li>
            <li>Having tested one out, I can say that his will not come close to replacing a clarisonic but will still keep you clean and hopefully reduce acne.</li>
            <li>But it got better and I am satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and refreshed after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps face clean.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my face at the highest setting</li>
            <li>BUT this does make it easier to get a thorough clean.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have had a pamphlet that spelled things out more clearly, especially since I plan on throwing the box</li>
            <li>My pores look awesome, then my clear skin literally freaks out days later.  </li>
            <li>Use it with some bensol peroxide cleaner when I shower and my face is completely clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My daughter swears by this and loves to clean her face with it.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much power it has and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li>I originally wanted a clarisonic because I&#x27;d heard such good things about it.</li>
            <li>other brush system works really good, makes my face feel cleaner and pores look better.</li>
            <li>It got good reviews from other users so they must have a better result than I did.  </li>
            <li>It makes a full clean up in face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and does a far better job cleaning my pores and leaving my skin smooth than washing with hands.</li>
            <li>I bought it special offer price</li>
            <li>They work well but be sure to use the right cream with the right head.</li>
            <li>Nothing special that sets it apart from others.</li>
            <li>so i could start using it right away!</li>
            <li>This really gets your face clean, and I think the moisturizer can sink in better then.  </li>
            <li>This one is so weak I can rub my face better with my own hands and a washcloth!!</li>
            <li>in all Olay did a great job and this device, if used carefully is an inexpensive way to dramatically improve your skin.</li>
            <li>The cleansing brush is great but the tube of Thermal Crystals provided was almost empty.</li>
            <li>Those reviews that claim to have people commenting on the condition of their skin are full of it, if you ask me.  </li>
            <li>It works good but batteries run low often.</li>
            <li>what held true all those years ago also holds true today.  </li>
            <li>Probably more gentle to use the cushioned disk.</li>
            <li>This is not painful.</li>
            <li>I know there are others that cost way much more, but this one is a reasonable price and does its work.</li>
            <li>And I really wish it had better directions in how to use it with the creams it comes with.</li>
            <li>The cleansing head does feel very spa like, and it does make you feel like you are doing something healthy for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Its soft and effective.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling super clean and renewed.</li>
            <li>but after a month I could see good results, especially in summer</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so smooth and fresh, even when used with another cleaner.</li>
            <li>It actually does what it claims.. loved the results.</li>
            <li>It is a good product overall</li>
            <li>The motor does not have enough power to do a good job I feel.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is again ok, it doesn&#x27;t foam much</li>
            <li>Good low price substitute to give cleaning brushes a try.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the full results.</li>
            <li>because it has ionic technology and sonic waves is going to get much deeper into the skin, kill bacteria better and stimulate the skin.</li>
            <li>It would have been cool to have some color coding on the attachment to make it easier to remember which tool matches which product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my Son and he absolutely loves it :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;this greats off so much of my makeup way more than using a makeup wipe or some cleaner with your hands.</li>
            <li>I had 2 co-workers approach me about my skin looking so good and what did I do different.</li>
            <li>Since I have started using it, my skin feels really smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>MY SKIN WAS NICE AND SOFT</li>
            <li>If you have superficial acne scars this device might help soften those especially if you have fair skin.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll just go back to a good old-fashioned washcloth.  </li>
            <li>so I still give it full stars.</li>
            <li>The combo of using this, good moisturizer, and a BB cream has eliminated foundation from my daily routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works just as well as the high priced ones!  :)</li>
            <li>but it was just too much out of our price range for something I wasn&#x27;t sure about.</li>
            <li>The skin gets better really.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting a good facial cleansing system.</li>
            <li>What they say is true.</li>
            <li>They say to replace the brushes after your bottles run out, so they should last a good while.</li>
            <li>They say to replace the brushes after your bottles run out, so they should last a good while.</li>
            <li>made me look good only to see at this age the results of all that Sun damage….</li>
            <li>Only use twice a week because that is all you need to look good.</li>
            <li>However, Pro-X does have enough power to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do any better than the Neutrogena wave and products.</li>
            <li>I love how this feels but can&#x27;t say it does much.</li>
            <li>however that was not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>It is not bad but it is not a Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>It is not very powerful so doesn&#x27;t give a great microdermabrasion effect.</li>
            <li>skin felt fresh and smooth after the use and its very easy to use as they do give clear directions.</li>
            <li>: I think this is worth it because I got my original kit from my Mom as a Christmas gift</li>
            <li>: I think this is worth it because I got my original kit from my Mom as a Christmas gift</li>
            <li>It works well by making my skin feel good after using it, I just wish it had a little more power to it</li>
            <li>This is my first powered experience and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Makes her face feel really fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The soap and creame that come with the applicator were fine, but i used a gentle face soap with mine and it workwed just as well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;i think if you dont have a lot of skin problems like serious acne this is perfect to use instead of the clairisonic.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>The three speeds available make the regular cleansing head even more effective, as opposed to the two speeds with the older version.</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely smoother and skin much less flaky, but the most impressive result I&#x27;ve seen is a substantial reduction in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great for that microdermabrasion process, but for me, its too much - an electric brush with two heads and 2 different lotions...</li>
            <li>but I can see quick results.</li>
            <li>So here I was back to searching for the best cleansing facial brush.</li>
            <li>After just one use my freckles have lightened an extraordinary amount - it was practically life changing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After purchasing this set for $30, it arrived quickly and I opened it up and read all of the instructions.</li>
            <li>After that, I just decided to buy a $5 manual facial brush from Sephora and that was working out great, but my face still had flaky skin despite me gently brushing my face for over 10 minutes at a time</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just lucky...</li>
            <li>Quick delv.</li>
            <li>you are looking for something that really scrubs, you might need something more powerful.</li>
            <li>This should be a 3.5 star rating mainly because I wish this came with more cleansing product.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and have been looking for something that will save me some time.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve used many facial scrubs (Estee Lauder, Crabtree and Evelyn, Clarins, etc) but the Olay ones work better than any I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Ok i got this instead of buying the more flimsy non name brand facial brushes out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to reduce my pores and tighten up my jawline with high end peptides like Genifique and Lancome Regenerist multi lift tinted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I found this kit super easy to use and since the tubes of product are not that large</li>
            <li>The first time I used this system i noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several months now and am still very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I purchased the set instead of the regular Olay Pro-X system.</li>
            <li>I actually feel it to be more effective than the real microdermabrasion treatments I&#x27;ve received at a spa.</li>
            <li>Very gentle thorough cleaning!</li>
            <li>the very first time I used this  </li>
            <li>This was a great edition to kick my daily facial routine into a more productive gear with visible results..</li>
            <li>First time I used it my face felt so smooth.</li>
            <li>The cleanser and polisher creams are good and the tubes have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>At first I assumed this was because I had such an awesome deep clean</li>
            <li>It is a nice set but not enough power to clean a skin.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I&#x27;m getting such a better clean!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite health and beauty item.</li>
            <li>Neither is true - it is just right.</li>
            <li>This product works wonderfully make my face feel so soft and it diminishes dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>So far so nice machine, i noticed a diffrence from the first week.</li>
            <li>Pat dry and apply a good night cream or Argan Oil</li>
            <li>Pat dry and apply a good night cream or Argan Oil</li>
            <li>I feel that when used at night, after first removing most of my makeup with a wipe, using the Pro-X really gets the remaining traces of dirt, grime, and makeup out of my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this system, makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li>first I wasn&#x27;t excited about the product, but I have been converted and I do like it.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t excited about the product, but I have been converted and I do like it.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this product would live up to it&#x27;s own description</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this, I figured it either wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough to notice or it would rip my skin off.</li>
            <li>super soft and healthy glow</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprise to see just in 3 days how much this product not only cleared up my completion</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth, soft and scars</li>
            <li>It does clean well the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>The machine is very comfortable to hold, not too heavy and the surface texture has a nice grip.</li>
            <li>This is a great little machine.</li>
            <li>This is a great little face cleaning tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though on the low settings I am sure it is fine to use on cleansing days.</li>
            <li>While it isn&#x27;t a professional grade M.D. unit it certainly does a nice job for $25.</li>
            <li>Great powerful little machine</li>
            <li>It is now mostly smooth and much lighter.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my skin smooth and brighter.</li>
            <li>This is such a great tool for making your face ultra smooth and your pores smaller.</li>
            <li>Really helps shrink the pores and makes the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old Neutrogena face scrubber does much better.</li>
            <li>The two different heads are nice.</li>
            <li>The lowest setting gives you nice facial massage.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor, fits in your hand..</li>
            <li>Maybe I have really sensitive skin, but for some reason the longer I used this, the more I broke out.</li>
            <li>Too rough on my skin with the abrasive cream that is included, but the sponge pads feel good.</li>
            <li>So worth the money.  </li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>I did find it fun</li>
            <li>This was worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set of exfoliates but the face brush wasn&#x27;t powerful enough for me.</li>
            <li>I got this hoping for powerful exfoliation</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and healthy in years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to report that my initial worries were unfounded.</li>
            <li>these really worth it</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost as the pads</li>
            <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I have been using my own facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>But I prefer my own facial soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth giving this a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a week - used it almost every day - just once as a start with the microdermabrasion attachment but with my own natural brand exfoliator (allergies to most big brands)</li>
            <li>and she liked it enough that she ended up taking it home with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue increasing the use all the way up to the recommended frequency and levels and</li>
            <li>it remotely worth spending 5X the amount for the Clairsonic?  </li>
            <li>gave it two stars because the products included are actually quite nice.  </li>
            <li>After one use of this thing with the microdermabrasion pad and crystal polisher, my skin is glowing and fresh.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The only reasons I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars are because it would be nice to have a timer</li>
            <li>Not as powerful and I would expect.  </li>
            <li>and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and was a bit apprehensive about using the microdermabrasion part, but I did so yesterday and really liked how soft and smooth my skin felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Works great and my skin likes it, but not everyday and definitely not twice a day.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the daily cleanser as I use my own.  </li>
            <li>I have to pay a premium to buy the creams overseas - but still worth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>after a week  I notice that my face look even more clear</li>
            <li>I can actually smile without my face cracking.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and free of dirt afterwards!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>free clean soft renewed !</li>
            <li>Results have been very positive; would recommend for anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li>If you want a better clean and a little more softness, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I suggest spending a little more for a much better clean.</li>
            <li>My Clarisonic system was returned to Sephora due to a problem with staying charged and the fact that while I liked using it, at around a cost of $200 it wasn&#x27;t that much, if any, better than using a manual face brush.  </li>
            <li>It is ideal to use the thermal peel, before cleansing and then the thermal peel directly on hyper pigmentation spots every other day if you have oiler skin.</li>
            <li>I had more dirt not less in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after I&#x27;ve done a quick once over wash of face with my hands b/c I wash around my eye area first to get make-up off.</li>
            <li>It breaks out a bit at first because it brings everything to the surface, but clears up quickly.</li>
            <li>It was very smart decision to purchase this kit regarding the price although I rarely use the Microdermabrasion Foam Head and Thermal Crystal Polisher.</li>
            <li>Good quality considering the price when compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>The motorized brush is just the right pressure and speed to not cause damage, but to allow you to get the cleaning/abrasive effect you need.</li>
            <li>The right amount of speeds.</li>
            <li>This should always be stated right off the start.</li>
            <li>Used the scrub and saw a difference right away in flakiness and dullness.</li>
            <li>The price is right, too.  </li>
            <li>It is priced right and includes a cleanser and polisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I try using the product right after i received it</li>
            <li>The bristles are just the right mix of firmness and softness to be just right for your face.</li>
            <li>I think purchasing the Microderm Plus initially is a better investment - paying more in the beginning will save you from becoming quickly disenchanted with the limited 2 speed system and wasting money later when you upgrade to the 3 speed microderm system like I did.</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose for me and really does what it should do - clean your face</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose for me and really does what it should do - clean your face</li>
            <li>and I really wanted something to help clean and shrink the pores of my nose.</li>
            <li>I used the microdermabrasion pad for the first time last night and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>The frequency of use is so low for me because my skin is very sensitive and I am not even able to use setting more than one.</li>
            <li>I have very large pores.  </li>
            <li>I did have one small scar from a pimple that has been greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li>I first tried Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion System (which consists of the sponge attachment and microdermabrasion crystals [tube with the blue cap]), I was honestly blown away by the difference it made after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>Does its job, skin feels clean and tight immediately after, love it!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t typically write reviews unless I am really impressed or really disappointed in something, in this case I am impressed.</li>
            <li>There are only two ways to shrink pores, one is to use peptides and be patient while following a healthy berry, fruits and veggies based diet with lots of water or you can conceal them with silicone based products like Loreal Collagen filler (whichdoes keep forehead wrinkles down wonderfully) or Esttee lauder Pore minimizer.</li>
            <li>Olay&#x27;s option is far more reasonable with regard to both time and cost.  </li>
            <li>Delivered super fast</li>
            <li>It looks smooth and fresh and it feels baby soft.</li>
            <li>I think using it really helps my moisturizer absorb quickly as well.</li>
            <li>The brush has different speed settings which is good for sensitive areas like underneath the eyes.</li>
            <li>And a good rule of thumb is two minutes or less.  </li>
            <li>The Neutrogena one works very well, but I don&#x27;t enjoy having to replace the pads so much.</li>
            <li>I experienced small breakouts for the first time use.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and really like the feel of my skin after I use this with my Olay products.  </li>
            <li>Soft move and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the results of just a few days use of this Product that got online and bought two more and gave one to my daughter and daughter in-law who are in their 30&#x27;s a Kit.</li>
            <li>the small bottles of product are very nice too.  </li>
            <li>my skin jusy feels wonderfully smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Using it twice a week my dry skin has really improved and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Bought this and it shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I proceeded very, very gently.  </li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>There are 3 speeds on this the Olay, and if I need to I just press very gently on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus system is very reasonably priced for all of the benefits the user will receive.</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus system is very reasonably priced for all of the benefits the user will receive.</li>
            <li>I like this very much.  </li>
            <li>it does bog down easily when touching the skin.</li>
            <li>Week one: fine, soft skin Midway into week two:</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little more powerful but other than that it is great for the price</li>
            <li>I have long nails and the buttons are very easy to push.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had this for 2 months now and the brush head still looks new and still running on the original batteries.</li>
            <li>Honestly, let&#x27;s be very real, this device is nothing at all close to microdermabrasion and Olay has stretched their credibility too much to have labeled it with the word microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus system for nearly a month and during this time I have noticed a fresher, smoother looking skin and my pores have minimized substantially plus a huge reduction in acne</li>
            <li>first impression-</li>
            <li>I get better results using my shiseido face brush, didn&#x27;t see any difference with the olay prox and my hair kept getting snagged even when pulled back</li>
            <li>Also when I opened my batter compartment there was some creamy (clear/whitish) stuff that i cleaned out first.</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>can with onions and garlic hot breathe in a hole covered in burnt pubic hair from a 500 pound man that has not seen his downstairs in a while let alone washed it.</li>
            <li>I started on the higher setting and then played around with it.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I put it in my &amp;#34;weird beauty gadgets&amp;#34; box - not a fail but not something I&#x27;ll use on a routine basis</li>
            <li>box - not a fail but</li>
            <li>I purchased the kit at Target but still wanted to write a review on Amazon since that&#x27;s where many people come to read reviews about various products.</li>
            <li>At first, I was worried if it was water proof</li>
            <li>I love this thing definitely would recommend thing product to my friends.</li>
            <li>Product just as promised - better price than local retailer.</li>
            <li>(that stuff is fabulous for making your skin soft).</li>
            <li>(that stuff is fabulous for making your skin soft).</li>
            <li>The system works pretty well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels like it has had layers of dead skin removed and it&#x27;s bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no shill ;-)).</li>
            <li>I first used the microdermabrasion portion of this product.</li>
            <li>so rarely do we ladies get real results-</li>
            <li>so rarely do we ladies get real results-</li>
            <li>I could see a visible difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>The first time i used this product, I felt it did wonders to my skin.</li>
            <li>Will buy again because more than likely it works to well</li>
            <li>I used couple of times and its pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Smooth, soft, after 4 th day even softer&lt;br /&gt;naturel shine.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I finally pulled the plug and bought this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was pretty eager to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>decided to try the microdermabrasion first.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am using it for the first time and I am still waiting to see visible results, but I like it.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>FYI - I have light ivory, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference from the first use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else since this is the first cleansing brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I can notice my skin really improved!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m really satisfied for its effect at the same time with its value.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother at her request, she loves this, it is not the first one she has used.</li>
            <li>She likes it except for the red top tube which is I think the microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>The latter solution is mostly temporary.</li>
            <li>First of all, the product comes with inadequate instructions.  </li>
            <li>As battery powered facial cleansing systems go, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I would always reccommend to be sure and read the label to check for possible allergic reactions to any ingredients listed.</li>
            <li>I believe I saw immediate results the morning after my first microdermabrasion treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would probably only cost them about 50 cents more.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $10 more but has an extra faster speed.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw this thing I was unimpressed.</li>
            <li>I compared against higher end companies machines I have purchased.</li>
            <li>This system is pretty foolproof - 2 cleaning heads and 2 cleaning products.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used it</li>
            <li>BUT IT WAS, THE FIRST NIGHT</li>
            <li>especially since I didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>do use the different speeds, I  use the lower speed for cheeks and top speed for my T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Using this with regular bar soap and tea tree oil has done more for me that accutane or any over the counter acne medicine.</li>
            <li>I first started using this system, I used the included Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser once a day for around a minute each time (counting to 15 in the chin, each cheek and forehead areas) but soon found that it caused my acne prone skin to breakout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it can be used while bathing since the brush will send out tiny drops of water and cleanser around your hair,</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li>I use this almost daily and really love it.  </li>
            <li>Used the microdermabrasion/polishing head the first day  -</li>
            <li>and I feel that regular use of the Pro-X system is beginning to help fade the most surface ones slightly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, after using a more powerful cleaner, this is a great disappointment.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I notice my face was brighter and softer, others have notice it as well, saying my face is brighter.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with two different face cleansers to try out with the product</li>
            <li>Thank you Olay for making this wonderful product at an affordable price for those of us that can&#x27;t afford a $200 Clarisonic brush.d difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Not expensive; does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I thought it would give more of an actual microdermabrasion effect.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to keep your hair back.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty noticeable pores around my nose/cheek area</li>
            <li>I saw a difference on my face the first day after using it.</li>
            <li>My sister first got one and said I need to get one.</li>
            <li>My overall skin tone is improving and my pores look slightly more refined.</li>
            <li>To give you a little background, I&#x27;m 38 years old with very sensitive, fair skin that reacts to most anti- aging skin care products</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and clean after i have used it.</li>
            <li>/more even toned and feel like I am at least holding steady with the good fight of aging!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the over 50 crowd (but 50&#x27;s the new 30 right?!)</li>
            <li>My skin tuned out smooth, but not tight.</li>
            <li>The skin stay more soft to the touch and the other products that I use in my face have a better</li>
            <li>Olay Pro-X Advanced System  - two speeds  - single brush - cleaner    Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced   - 3 speeds - foam pad and the brush - cleanser and polisher included</li>
            <li>Very compact and right size fro me.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation speeds are gently, yet efficient and I love how soft and smooth my face and neck felt after only 1 treatment.</li>
            <li>I can see how the sponge is not going to last too long, but the actual device is pretty great!</li>
            <li>the face is a little scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;Washing want to make a more smooth cornering.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the more expensive ones are like, but this one is pretty good for the money.</li>
            <li>As I previously owned a Clarisonic Plus face and body system, I&#x27;m familiar with what a mechanical cleansing brush should be able to do.  </li>
            <li>they seem too sharp to me, I found a different- better quality sugar scrub that is effective but still gentle.</li>
            <li>they seem too sharp to me, I found a different- better quality sugar scrub that is effective but still gentle.</li>
            <li>I thought it was great that they take one customer&#x27;s experience so seriously.  </li>
            <li>I used this from two weeks ago, and when this brush is used, my skin seems to be more clean and less greasy.</li>
            <li>I honestly think I&#x27;ve broken out more since using it but any product that gets you to clean your face better more often can&#x27;t be all bad  :)  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels soft &amp; clean after each use.</li>
            <li>However, the stuff does make my face feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Your face really feels and looks better when used REGULARLY</li>
            <li>It &#x27;a good product, similar to the Clarisonic, not equal.</li>
            <li>I recommend going gently and briefly and getting a better quality of crystals than what&#x27;s included with the unit-</li>
            <li>I recommend going gently and briefly and getting a better quality of crystals than what&#x27;s included with the unit-</li>
            <li>Kind of disappointing when all the reviews mentioned how good of a product this was.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this so much, I do not want to go back to manually washing my face ever again.</li>
            <li>If you do not, either the motor will not turn  if you are holding it firmly to your skin, or if you press more lightly it grabs the skin intermittently and skips around.  </li>
            <li>I prefer to use my fingers as I could target the areas that need polishing more &amp; I could control how much crystals are needed for specific areas of my face.</li>
            <li>My pores are much cleaner and I am seeing better results from my facial night moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This Olay brush is much better than the Pretika, and seems like it will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my daughter told me that this kit is a good budget-friendly substitute for the more expensive Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are cheap too which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>Batteries have lasted for nearly a month and are still going strong while always being used on the high setting</li>
            <li>My dark spots from acne are decreasing more quickly</li>
            <li>but I think it is pretty good  except not very good instruction</li>
            <li>It does clean my face a little better than if I just used my cleanser.</li>
            <li>The idea is really great, the pads are firm, but soft and shaped well, and the product is much like what I use without the gadget.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, yet gentle enough for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so I pretty much knew what I was in for.</li>
            <li>Upon first use, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much for me, it is a piece of foam after all.</li>
            <li>The system does not come with detailed instructions, just a bare bones outline on how to use the microdermabrasion</li>
            <li>Customer service pretty much said &amp;</li>
            <li>I have only had this for a short time, but so far I am happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used creams and cleansers in the past that I paid lots of money for and never got this good of a result with my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am amazed how gentle it is on my face and how soft and clean it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li>If your older &amp; looking for that magic wand that&#x27;s going to turn back the hands of time or erase the damage you&#x27;ve done to your skin</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing kit, high quality low price.</li>
            <li>are universal for handle and easily purchased for replacements.</li>
            <li>, infact it made it more dry.</li>
            <li>So nice to have the option of less makeup without being self conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;There are several brands of Microdermabrasion cleansing kits out there, Olay is easy to find.  </li>
            <li>but even on my super sensitive skin, I like to use the highest speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a super busy schedule.</li>
            <li>But honestly, the first few days it seemed like it was..</li>
            <li>But honestly, the first few days it seemed like it was..</li>
            <li>I use setting #3 which is strong enough to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li>It has three settings for speed/power, but I always use the highest and it still doesn&#x27;t feel strong enough...</li>
            <li>At 3 weeks I have no new zits and my cystic acne on my chin is gone :)</li>
            <li>Plus over the original Pro-X because the Microderm Plus simply has more options, allowing you to choose between 3 speeds if you want a gentle cleanse, a moderate cleanse, or a deeper exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend for anyone and in fact am buying one for my sister for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and this feels just like the micro at the spa.  </li>
            <li>For the price and ease, I&#x27;d certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I still had residual crystals on certain parts of my face.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it has a certain glow to it that it did not have before.</li>
            <li>I have problematic skin; acne, wrinkles, dullness, large pores, etc.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is as effective as a professional microdermabrasion session but for home use, this is easy to use and costs a lot less than paying for a professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the ladies or men who want to try something new in your skin care routine this is a must try !!</li>
            <li>The good thing about the bristles is that you can use less of your cleanser because the spinning action builds up bubbles.</li>
            <li>personally like it, it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>It is so large that you can&#x27;t really use it on or around the nose</li>
            <li>The little brush is nice.</li>
            <li>While some reviewers complain that it rotates too slowly or isn&#x27;t otherwise powerful enough I&#x27;ve found that if it were faster or more powerful it would be way too easy to over</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the whole kit!</li>
            <li>I figured it had to be a heck of a lot more powerful than this little guy but</li>
            <li>I bought the original 2 speed version only a short while ago and was loving it, then I came across the Pro-X Microderm Plus featuring 3 speeds and suddenly wished I had found and purchased this one first.</li>
            <li>The cleansers smell great and you only need to use a little for your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>The Olay Pro-X Plus Advanced Cleansing System DOES accomplish the same, very thorough cleansing of all of your pores, with the ease of the dermabrasion brush doing all of the scrubbing &#x27;work&#x27; for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Plus Advanced Cleansing System, unlike the Microdermabrasion System, is gentle enough to be used everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely noticed amazing improvements by the second week.</li>
            <li>It does an ok job of keeping your feeling fresh and exfoliated without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Great until a few days later</li>
            <li>I bought this because I notice my skin has been changing from being soft, young, and problem free....</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I am 30 and have had acne my whole life..</li>
            <li>I have blackheads on my nose that I have struggled with my whole life, and I can even tell those are diminishing.</li>
            <li>Sponge head absolutely does what the description has stated.</li>
            <li>If you really want a power brush, I suggest saving your money, doing your research and buying a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Very pleased because I&#x27;ve had scrubbers in the past</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really have seen an improvement in my complexion and would reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>The rest of the time I use a gentle face wash on the brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>No directions came with the purchase and the amount of product was very discouraging.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t mind it..</li>
            <li>I realized I really got jipped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>made a big difference on my skin, pimples are gone and my skin so smooth</li>
            <li>Does not seem like it can really do much for skin.,</li>
            <li>Really cleaned my face and made it so much brighter.</li>
            <li>She really likes hers.</li>
            <li>very good,if shipping can be faster</li>
            <li>I really like my kit</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure it doesn&#x27;t tug as much.</li>
            <li>but after I use it (and use it only twice a week) my face is smooth, and I notice my moisturizer, face serum, and makeup go on smoother and applies easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and haven&#x27;t seen much difference</li>
            <li>Started to notice my skin was much softer after a week of using it.</li>
            <li>It has really help her skin.</li>
            <li>But, if I put on too much moisturizer, my pores get clogged.  </li>
            <li>So having the tool is a real bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to make it fit properly?</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>and I really notice the difference.</li>
            <li>and I really do like it.  </li>
            <li>I can really see the improvement in how my face</li>
            <li>kit also comes with a \\&quot;Plus Advanced Cleansing System,\\&quot; which consists of the brush attachment and cleanser [tube with the red cap].</li>
            <li>The cleanser works very well to remove dirt and grime from my face without overdrying.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed by what one use did to my pores.</li>
            <li>Personally, I am a devoted user of my Mia, and have been overall happy enough with it to not go looking for additional \\&quot;face brushes\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand the reviewers who are saying this device does something.  </li>
            <li>A washcloth or scrubby sponge for your face does as much</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I called and asked for a partial credit as I saw this product for a very similar price at a retailer but it included two huge included (free) tubes of the cleaners~!</li>
            <li>I really did see and feel the difference of my face after using this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped to 3 stars- since the price is low, even with light use</li>
            <li>my unit did not last (it often sat on the shelf for months at a time with no use, so when I say my use was light-</li>
            <li>I gave it a 3 star because I really wanted the scrubby brush to be a bit firmer.  </li>
            <li>I get really flaky skin on my nose in the winter</li>
            <li>Not so much.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I have been using Olay Pro-Microdermabrasion very night.  </li>
            <li>you feel much</li>
            <li>you feel much</li>
            <li>Says its gentle but thorough in cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Really see no improvement</li>
            <li>IT REALLY</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The machine work fast  with 3 speed  </li>
            <li>I really like all these products and will buy this kit as soon as mine is gone</li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much, in fact based on all description</li>
            <li>I like something that really works.</li>
            <li>I have read some reviewers stating that this didn&#x27;t work for them, and I really believe that they aren&#x27;t using it correctly, or maybe its just me.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it very often and would probably have returned it if I could.  </li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>She really enjoys the feeling her face has after using it.</li>
            <li>Cleans really well and removes all makeup.</li>
            <li>Just started using it, I really don&#x27;t know if it works yet</li>
            <li>While I know I won&#x27;t recapture my youth, and genuinely don&#x27;t want to, this cleaning system is terrific.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, works very well.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Ok but not very powerfu</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>For starters, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans my skin as much as it pulls, stretches and twists my skin while the brush or sponge is spinning around.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this - and I think I would have except the lack of power to the unit on batteries.  </li>
            <li>Cleansing Brush Head makes washing your face much easier and efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The polisher attachment doesn&#x27;t seem to provide much stimulation, even when used with the polishing cream.</li>
            <li>many on here I&#x27;m not ready to invest in a Clarisonic but will eventually.</li>
            <li>Just massage around gently with your finger tips.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended, but be careful. :)</li>
            <li>I really like the concept of having EVERYTHING you need in this kit when you bring it home.  </li>
            <li>So I ended up returning the Mia after 3 months or so because I didn&#x27;t see that much difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;ll be too fast and irritating&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like the system.  </li>
            <li>supr value!buy 2,1 for free.&lt;br /&gt;express is very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>, i really slather it on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like so much....</li>
            <li>The rotating brush turns very very slowly on fast.</li>
            <li>Will probably try their products eventually, and if I really like them I will update.</li>
            <li>It is an absolute steal at the price.</li>
            <li>Not seeing any real improvement.</li>
            <li>helps my skin so much.</li>
            <li>As an aside, applying vitamin C or alpha hydroxy serums is a real treat after microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>Overall, since using this my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my skin, used as directed for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>As for the microdermabrasion, it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>This has helped me so much with my acne.</li>
            <li>Really well priced and it works very well.</li>
            <li>So Thanks Oly Pro-X.</li>
            <li>I can really feel and see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It rinses off well just standing at the sink, because let&#x27;s be honest...who wants to do this in the shower?</li>
            <li>I really like that product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this a couple months now and my pores look smaller and not as clogged and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>gently massage on face for 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle brush</li>
            <li>Instead, the price point is something that I can afford to keep doing as the cost of the refills are reasonable.</li>
            <li>*  two Duracell batteries (which I really like, since you don&#x27;t have to worry about re-charging it)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am convinced that a brush any rougher would be too much.</li>
            <li>she is very statisfied this gift</li>
            <li>Works really well with my pores and I could already see the results in just after 3 uses.</li>
            <li>i will really avoid that area from now on.</li>
            <li>I really look forward to the morning and evening cleansing sessions.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t have to use as much as I do if I apply it on the head of the brush.</li>
            <li>I really like the thermal crystal wash</li>
            <li>feel that this product has really enhanced the look, feel and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>for a gentle morning exfoliation - pre toner, moisturizer, and makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it feels to put on your face.  </li>
            <li>It may be the regimen as a whole</li>
            <li>Really like this product.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the pad which is much nicer than the brushes for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had just bought a Clairsonic, but I felt t it vibrated way too much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it as much as I did my Neutrogena .</li>
            <li>Thanks olay, looking forward to improved versions.</li>
            <li>My girls have a very even skin tone and both look so refreshed and neither wear liquid makeup or powder now</li>
            <li>I really hope this review helps someone else make their choice in trying this product.</li>
            <li>It does work for me very well.</li>
            <li>and you can adjust how much pressure you apply to your affected area.</li>
            <li>recommend really.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and is much clearer.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>it really helps exfoliate and my sun damage/dark spots seem to be disappearing faster.</li>
            <li>I had to throw away the whole device plus my rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>: The product arrived as promised, the whole process was fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>Can not believe how much cleaner my face looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>Has really helped with my breakouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for face cleaning, but not much else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my skin, and it feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I like it so much,</li>
            <li>I really really like it</li>
            <li>I have to say that I really like the way my skin feels after I have used the microdermabrasion cream/grit.</li>
            <li>my face really need this product.</li>
            <li>really like using this tickly thing on my face.</li>
            <li>I wasnt expecting too much of this, but actually i really like this product.</li>
            <li>Recommended highly!</li>
            <li>It visibly removed so much of my makeup and left my skin feeling super clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing this kit because I liked that it was a simple white color for one</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a facial cleansing system, this is a nice one to get, especially since it comes with themicrodermabrasion buffer, too!microdermabrasion buffer, too!</li>
            <li>This microdermabrasion system works just as well as the more expensive brand that I also own.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it does make your skin feel very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>my skin looks much better after only one use, and by &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; I mean that the fine lines around my mouth and on my chest are significantly diminished.</li>
            <li>and I can happily say my face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in the past 6 months!</li>
            <li>This is a really good product for deep cleaning my face and leaves you with a very clean feel, but personally, I find the bristles a bit harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>and wow!!!</li>
            <li>The cleansing wash is okay, a pretty typical exfoliating cleanser</li>
            <li>I mean very light); original review follows....</li>
            <li>Love the results &amp; love the fact that it does as good if not better than than the expensive Clairsonic.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because, in my older age (50+) my skin is not tight and firm as it used to be, but stretching my skin like that can&#x27;t be good for the wrinkles that are already there.  </li>
            <li>- the cleansing head makes you feel like you are really getting your skin clean, but it&#x27;s really no different than a wash cloth</li>
            <li>Then that leaves the flat sponge type head to put the polisher on, sort of like a light sandpaper.  </li>
            <li>Well, last week at the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale I got the original Mia Clarisonic for $79.</li>
            <li>Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth with this product!</li>
            <li>actually was considering the original Olay Pro-X brush (the one with 2 speeds), but ended up getting this one.  </li>
            <li>Back this up by eating foods rich in them as a way of life</li>
            <li>Back this up by eating foods rich in them as a way of life</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the Clairisonic, but its better than any other kit I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find it any better than baking soda or any other cleanser.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation brushes are a joke and may best work with somebody with minor exfoliation needs and very delicate skin.  </li>
            <li>After reading numerous positive reviews and hearing this is just as good as more expensive brands, I had to try it.</li>
            <li>but the microdermabrasion takes it to a whole new level!</li>
            <li>This does not have enough power to work and clean like you would expect.</li>
            <li>I needed something to help me deep clean my face.</li>
            <li>my skin was all white and glowing and clean, my husband when he returned from work</li>
            <li>and i see changes on my face and feel it do the job, deep clean the pores and skin.</li>
            <li>The red stuff didn&#x27;t really clean my face</li>
            <li>I prefer to use a different cleanser to get a deeper clean, however.</li>
            <li>Now, this isn&#x27;t a separate system from the normal Pro-X; the Microdermabrasion aspect comes in the form of an additional \\&quot;brush\\&quot; for the the Pro-X--more like a cotton round, really--as well as their own cleansing crystal</li>
            <li>first I thought the extra head - which looks like a foam disc, was just an excuse to charge more because it doesn&#x27;t really look like it&#x27;s going to do much</li>
            <li>Nice little brush for the price!</li>
            <li>My skin feel much better, less oily especially at my T-zone, and my skin is very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Obviously everybody has different skin types and will react differently to products, but I feel good about recommending this system to people with normal skin or skin that is similar to my own that I&#x27;ve described above.</li>
            <li>I really feel that with long term use my fine lines will be less noticeable and feel that this will help to reduce more lines.</li>
            <li>Does not clean very well because it really doesn&#x27;t do any more than manual cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the second kit I have purchased because my sister tried the first one I had ordered right before her Christmas visit</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it very long, but so far I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This is just as good and less than a third of the price.  </li>
            <li>My face was a bit red when I finished, but some soothing lotion helped calm it back down, and I was left with a nice healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Within the first week we already noticed the acne clear up.</li>
            <li>I think my face needed to adjust because it&#x27;s been pretty clear ever since.</li>
            <li>It gave her more dark spots.</li>
            <li>the size is nice and small</li>
            <li>I use the more intense 3rd setting at night either with the micoderm pad and thermal cleanser or the brush, after removing makeup with a wipe, prior to night</li>
            <li>This was a purchase for my wife to replace a competitor&#x27;s faulty unit that was replaced 3 times and is currently being RMA&#x27;d for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the plus side - It is good as tool to deep cleanse your face with the wash pad - and I use it as a simple deep cleanser -</li>
            <li>use my own cleansers, I prefer to wet my face with cleanser first, and place the brush on dry</li>
            <li>brush is a little soft but its still effective</li>
            <li>my new must have!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy especially when it&#x27;s the same price like the original Pro-X in stores except it</li>
            <li>I wanted to try some advanced cleansing system from a very long time and when i saw the deal for Olay Pro-X</li>
            <li>I think this product helps my moisturizer work more efficiently, and I use less.</li>
            <li>easy to use and not much</li>
            <li>paying only 5$ more to get both systems of &amp;#34;microdermabrasion&amp;#34; and facial scrub brush.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace an older one.</li>
            <li>In this case, it is the &#x27;Olay Professional Promise,&#x27; your guaranteed satisfaction with their Pro-X Advanced System or your money back.  </li>
            <li>It left my face soft and smooth with a washcloth, however.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a mild facial cleanser along with the microderm crystal-cleansers that are included.</li>
            <li>the freckles made me look and now that I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>This is a decent cheaper alternative to Clarisonic (which will cost about $125).</li>
            <li>My skin definitely glows more now that I&#x27;ve properly exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>(I used to think physical spinning was the poor-man&#x27;s version of the sonic motion, but I personally like the spinning motion better).  </li>
            <li>I bought this and only was able to use it once or twice and simply just doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>For the most part she only uses the regular brush head and doesn&#x27;t use the microdermabrasion too often.</li>
            <li>I am also considering using a mild cleanser like Simple, instead of the Olay cleansers to be gentler on my skin.</li>
            <li>After just one use I was amazed at how vibrant my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>The older brush had two settings where this one has three.</li>
            <li>I have tender skin, but weekly microdermabrasion at the high speed, pad and microdermabrasion crystals have left my skin really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>do it and really irritate my face- too much power and in seconds you&#x27;ve irritated your skin- at least for me with a fair (blonde) complexion.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The high speed is not that abrasive either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the settings as instructed--only using the high setting 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>hopes were extremely high.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would buy again, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great price for a microdermabrasion tool - removes my makeup well at night everyday.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t run fast enough or strong enough to accomplish anything.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is just more sensitive due to pregnancy??</li>
            <li>I would recommend the use of a good night cream after using the pro-X because the skin could feel a bit raw initially.</li>
            <li>May invest in the more expensive one in the future based on how much I love this product!</li>
            <li>As a woman who wears makeup on a daily basis, this is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I will pay a little more to get some durability-</li>
            <li>the Clairsonic perform a little better than this?  </li>
            <li>my face is already soft from the cleanser!!</li>
            <li>I do wish there was a little more cleanser and polisher.</li>
            <li>Blemishes/ache are gone, face is soft and clean and overall</li>
            <li>Blemishes/ache are gone, face is soft and clean and overall</li>
            <li>YOU FEEL SUCH SOFT CLEAN SKIN AFTERWARDS .</li>
            <li>The brush is also way too soft for a deep clean.</li>
            <li>My serum is absorbing much more completely and I am going to waste less of it and get better results.</li>
            <li>Though the Pro-X 2 speed worked fine and improved the texture of my skin, I didn&#x27;t feel like 2 speeds was really doing enough for a really deep cleanse.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, the fragrance is lovely, it isn&#x27;t harsh on my fairly sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to use.  </li>
            <li>feel it long specially if you want to use it every day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times and you notice how clean your skin is right after use.</li>
            <li>It almost felt like I was rubbing concrete on my face,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always exfoliated with a cheap white sponge and went straight back to it after using this thing once.  </li>
            <li>My Dr couldnt believe it when I told her how old I really am.</li>
            <li>Expected this product to have a stronger brush action...feels so light on the face.</li>
            <li>Plus the cleansing pad is so soft it really doesn&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li>after using the system for 3 weeks now, her skin is much smoother and clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s really gentle</li>
            <li>I normally don’t write reviews on products, but I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing just how improved my skin will be after a few more weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>I looked into a few Clarisonic brushes but yli couldn&#x27;t imagine the results being better than what they were.</li>
            <li>humid (so I wouldn&#x27;t normally need much moisturizing, but even with the natural conditioning, my skin feels softer and smoother with this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I use my own cleanser instead of the one that came with it (it left my face feeling oily) but the microdermabrasion (step 2, blue &amp; white tube) works wonders!</li>
            <li>On the first try, I didn&#x27;t really notice anything too different.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth giving this a try.bought a tube of the \\&quot;thermal crystal polisher\\&quot; that seems to be the same thing that is included in the kit</li>
            <li>For instance the sponge needs to be remoistened frequently to maintain proper lubrication, and the appropriate pressure to apply is not necessarily intuitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this item once and think it&#x27;s worth the price since you receive two tubes of cleaners and two brushes for the different type of cleaning.</li>
            <li>Now I use it at night with my normal cleanser and follow up with moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>After a few days of using this, I told my husband I thought my skin looked better</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not quite sure how long it is going to last.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend you buy this product, it’s worth it.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t get acne, but I do get blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li>As I entered my late twenties, my skin got a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>I figure that the brush itself does the exfoliating, and I don&#x27;t want to waste my money buying more of that cleanser.  </li>
            <li>so far.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a professional for skin but feeling much better than regular brush style cleaner.</li>
            <li>The highest setting is still pretty slow but more gentile then the Clairisonic.</li>
            <li>The included cleansers, however, are nice, if not amazing.  </li>
            <li>I really like this little unit; it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>The brush head is smaller than I thought it would be, and the brissles are super soft.</li>
            <li>but I definitely needed something that would be more aggressive in treatment of dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Let me preface my review by explaining my skincare situation, I have very fair skin and any and all sun exposure gives me dark sun spots (we&#x27;re talking chocolate chips here) and my skin over the years has developed a thick layer of sun spots over the bridge of my nose and across the high part of my cheeks just under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Good investement, especially in comparison to more expensive products!</li>
            <li>This is not a high end model, but is suffice to allow you to get a thorough clean as part of your cleansing routine.  </li>
            <li>They have a nice smell, and leave me with a clean feeling (although as with any crystal microdermabrasion cleanser, be extra careful to fully rinse off any residual crystals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different speeds as well, which was new for me (the Mia only has one).  </li>
            <li>I think it works but it needs time and the right facial wash .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day because my skin is super sensitive and has to be phased into using a new face wash.</li>
            <li>But then it refused to turn on right after I installed new batteries only moments before.</li>
            <li>Maybe there are other factors, but I find my skin type to be more normal now, no dry skin, and breakouts are practically gone.</li>
            <li>I received this product a little over a week ago and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Clarisonic Mia for about three years, but wanted to try out this new Olay system since I was intrigued by the idea of the microdermabrasion head.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this contraption.</li>
            <li>I tried new batteries and everything and never got it to turn on again.</li>
            <li>Anyway, with the new acne, came new acne scars.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product for busy women who don&#x27;t usually have time to get frequent facials, plus it&#x27;s much cheaper :-)</li>
            <li>yesterday I felt confident enough to go out with my hair up and minimal make up.</li>
            <li>I have a soft $25 Shiseido brush and Sephora&#x27;s $7 brush that&#x27;s a bit firm, and they do a much better job than this Olay system.  </li>
            <li>Most exfoliating products tend to feel too abrasive to me but this offers a few options for speed.  </li>
            <li>but they both love it and said it has really helped their skin to be smoother, less breakouts and overall softer and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>happen to come across Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System kit and because I personally use Olay moisturizing facial creams/products, I personally felt comfortable researching about this facial brush...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit comes with two \\&quot;heads\\&quot;--a smooth one for microdermabrasion, and a brush for regular cleaning--plus two sample-sized (tiny) tubes of cleanser and</li>
            <li>I really like it, but the microderm attachment doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough for me.</li>
            <li>Definitely nowhere near as powerful as I imagined</li>
            <li>I get better results with a rough facial cloth.</li>
            <li>The two (2) attachments are quite small and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and almost never try new products.</li>
            <li>If you leave even a tiny whisp of hair loose, it can wind clear up to your scalp before you are able to turn the thing off.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li>, my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised with results</li>
            <li>I can use it once in few months but not as a regular cleansing system as i can relate it more to a pedicure where rigourous cleaning removes all the dead cells from your feet, and i dont want that kind of cleaning on my face on a regular basis apart from facials made with gentle hand strokes.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve had success with the Olay Advanced Cleaning brush, I initially felt a little hesitation to use the microdermabrasion head and accompanying thermal crystal cleanser.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see the kind of difference I was expecting there is only very slight brightening of the skin.</li>
            <li>I have a few fine lines on my forehead in particular.</li>
            <li>The only down side is if you want to go pick up a new microderm wash you really gotta look because most places don&#x27;t carry it (or at least we haven&#x27;t found many in San Diego)</li>
            <li>this is my first rotating facial scrubber.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to wait for results and if it lightens up my age spots, I&#x27;ll report back in a six (or sooner) months.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised that after 4 weeks of use my skin is noticeably brighter, smoother, and clearer!</li>
            <li>in the past and have been quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Naturally I jumped at the opportunity to try this Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion kit and it does not disappoint!</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I only cleansed my skin, I didn&#x27;t exfoliate.</li>
            <li>wondered why the first use showed wonders and realized it was so because I hadnt had a facial in over 4 months.</li>
            <li>Once I was in bed, I noticed my cheeks felt SO SOFT!</li>
            <li>This is the second one I have bought, I am sure I had the other one for 10 years, I use this one twice a day, I use another brand of cleanser.</li>
            <li>used it for the first time last night...and believe it or not I saw results!  </li>
            <li>This system is ok, size of cleaning brushes and sponges is quite small.</li>
            <li>There were red patches on my face after using the thermal scrub for the first time.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and has cleared up!</li>
            <li>and I have seen so many improvements in my skin for example no more pimple break out</li>
            <li>I had a red half-circle mark on my forehead which is the first area I washed.</li>
            <li>The included tubes of scrubs are really small and won&#x27;t last you long, but the machine is great.  </li>
            <li>but I actually do, I use it every night and my face is starting to feel and look more even, not instant results</li>
            <li>one differs from the original Oil of Olay, in that it has 3 speeds, so it can simply be used as a facial cleaner....</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>First off, the brush head was a bit brown after using it so you can actually see all the gunk it is taking out of your pores.</li>
            <li>but you can use it for a little while until you can afford paying strong one</li>
            <li>last if you clean them properly.</li>
            <li>Advanced daily cleansing gentle enough for daily use on days when microdermabrasion treatment not used.</li>
            <li>Your fingers will do just as good a job as long as you do a thorough cleansing (double cleanse) &amp; your procedure is long enough.</li>
            <li>It was well liked that we had to go back and purchase a second one for our other daughter.</li>
            <li>so naturally it was like a clean up and the whole brushing removed the dead cells off of my face</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the brush catching my pulled back hair, but the foam pad easily snagged and pulled small wisps each time I used it.  </li>
            <li>As far as the little machine is concerned, it&#x27;s not as strong as I thought it might be</li>
            <li>Even pressing a bit more than what we users think is moderate and the spin slows down.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough for everyday and makes my face feel so clean!</li>
            <li>The first speed doesn&#x27;t do much for me, I like the second with the brush and cleanser for daily use.</li>
            <li>That actually worked better, and less abrasive to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest either buying more of the red stuff or some other facial wash right away because the sample does not last long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was wondering whether the brush would be strong enough with only 2 double A batteries</li>
            <li>I use Cetaphil as a cleanser and pure Argan Oil as my only type of lotion/moisturizer (I get mine off of Amazon...</li>
            <li>so no need to scrub too hard :-)</li>
            <li>I feel like I get a better microdermabrasion scrub from washing my face hard with a rag and an exfoliating</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush system after carefully reviewing this brush set against other face cleaning  system,  I must admit I love this system I uses it every other day to clean my face</li>
            <li>It’s been a week and my face is completely clear.</li>
            <li>Facial brushes are soft and reasonably priced on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so clear</li>
            <li>I can see a clear difference in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had treated myself to a couple of salon facials but they were expensive and the effects were great but only temporary.  </li>
            <li>Rinse your face with clear water.</li>
            <li>So far so go</li>
            <li>so it make it soft from the spong</li>
            <li>People saying it&#x27;s prone to skin probably use this too frequent at speed 2 or 3.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to spend money on the pricey alternatives - this, so far, has done the job.  </li>
            <li>Been using this as soon as i got it.and,  so far so good,looking forward to see results on my skin soon.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel really soft after I use it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m the type of person who like clear and concise direction</li>
            <li>My skin does feel really soft after I use it</li>
            <li>But so far it&#x27;s been working.</li>
            <li>The Olay brushes seen way too soft and I just don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting anything I wouldn&#x27;t without it.</li>
            <li>well, I can&#x27;t see much use for level 1, but I guess that&#x27;s a personal thing.</li>
            <li>Thermal heat gel with the soft brush removed dirt and cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>The crystals are warming and when used with the sponge brush its made my skin smoother and soft to touch.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I felt that the brush stretched my skin when rotating.</li>
            <li>After using this once your skin feels so much softer and after a week definitely can feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin didn&#x27;t have any reactions or breakouts.</li>
            <li>the difference between my neck and face made it look like I must have had a facelift- 80 year old neck and 50 year old face.</li>
            <li>I just keep it in the shower and use it gently and briefly</li>
            <li>I used Oil of Olay complete all day moisture cream for sensitive skin after.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the effectiveness because even though I have never used a Clairsonic</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>SHE LOVES THE WAY IT TAKES OFF THE OLD SKIN AND MAKES HER FACE FEEL REFRESHED</li>
            <li>but you also don&#x27;t want to tear up your skin either (for those who have sensitive</li>
            <li>but you also don&#x27;t want to tear up your skin either (for those who have sensitive</li>
            <li>i developed pimples after using it.</li>
            <li>I use it at least twice a week but with my own cleanser because the Renewal cleanser left a film on my face that raised some bumps and my face itched like maybe I&#x27;m sensitive to something in</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s almost 2 years old now</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s almost 2 years old now</li>

            <li>She has used it a couple of times so far</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much smoother and definitely evening it out a bit.</li>
            <li>I have always been self conscious about youthful</li>
            <li>I will use the cleanser head with my Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Gel Cleanser instead.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Soft.&lt;br /&gt;Haeyagetda frequently.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old, and I consider my skin tone as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a complete piece of GARBAGE.  </li>
            <li>Used this one time so far, and I like it alot.</li>
            <li>and my skin really did not seem different.</li>
            <li>Oh well, moving on but so far this works like a charm u just have to invest your time doing it.</li>
            <li>With daily use of this product my skin is much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>This is so much easier than using only my fingers to wash my face.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li>i never realized how much makeup was left on my face until i started using this.</li>
            <li>the one time I used it directly.</li>
            <li>This one has a three speed rotary action.  </li>
            <li>(I have very flaky skin, especially in the winter, when I use Retin-A).  </li>
            <li>and so far nothing has happened.  </li>
            <li>So far, the Pro-X hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I know some people mentioned that that can happen, but so far I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far, I have been using this a month</li>
            <li>I do not use the products inside, I use professional products instead.</li>
            <li>Her sensitive skin is always an issue but this device does not bother her.  </li>
            <li>I really like this facial cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>Makes cleansing easier for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult onset acne and have combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using the brush twice a week and dermabrasion once in ten days followed by an intense hydration mask.</li>
            <li>After I used the microdermabrasion head and product my skin was sensitive for a day.  </li>
            <li>Used and pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Actually even without microdermabrasion applying anti-oxidants to your face after a thorough cleanse is very beneficial.</li>
            <li>Actually even without microdermabrasion applying anti-oxidants to your face after a thorough cleanse is very beneficial.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use a soft sponge and some dove soap.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have been using a sonic brush (another brand) for a year</li>
            <li>Not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li>My husband has even commented on how soft my face</li>
            <li>brush feels delicately soft in use with the red-capped wash.</li>
            <li>far I have done the microdermabrasion treatment 2x per week</li>
            <li>Speed 2 is the Daily Deep Cleansing Speed that that is meant to be used with the regular brush head; it supposedly cleans 600% better than regular cleansing&lt;br</li>
            <li>I broke out directly in my T zone.  </li>
            <li>Really makes a difference in the bumps that build up on aging skin, especially at the end of summer.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>MY 15 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER ASKED FOR THIS FOR CHRISTMAS.  </li>
            <li>Soft skin after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon is by far the cheapest supplier that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has anything to do with it, but I began using the Oil Cleansing Method around the same time I started to break out, but even the reviews of OCM users didn&#x27;t mention your skin breaking out THAT much</li>
            <li>I thought it would be rougher on my face, so I was surprised at how soft it felt.</li>
            <li>She has avoided these because she has sensitive skin, but after feeling how soft that brush is</li>
            <li>But if you like a spinning soft brush on the face or a spinning soft sponge, than by all means, go ahead and try it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that you could find the same thing for much cheaper at any drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I use on the highest setting unless I&#x27;m around sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does not leave a greasy feel but soft natural skin.</li>
            <li>I plan on using every week and get a professional microdermabrasion quarterly.</li>
            <li>My skin drinks in my moisturizer now, and has become so soft.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it would make that much of a difference over regular washing!</li>
            <li>It has three speed settings, although the only I really use is the fastest one.</li>
            <li>It has a bristle and soft buffing pad.</li>
            <li>I think it is making my 51 year old skin look refreshed.  </li>
            <li>This product gets the job done, but is not as powerful as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot offer many reviews of olay products as the anti-aging line is too thick for me</li>
            <li>but I do use other facial products and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>mirror etc., leaving a mess to clean up after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first week of course I had a few new breakouts which is normal for me when I start any new regimine on my skin, but now my skin has cleared up and isn&#x27;t irritated at all from this</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that is either really oily or really dry (especially around the upper lip and nose when I use Retin-A and Tazorac cream for my acne/wrinkles).  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, I did feel that my face was clean, and it also felt a bit tight afterwards.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean without being tight.</li>
            <li>, it picks up a lot of leftover makeup and makes your skin feel clean and tight.</li>
            <li>since used up the entire tube of thermal exfoliating cream and my face is so smooth and my pores are hard to see and once I apply a bit of foundation they pretty much disappear entirely.</li>
            <li>Normal facial cleansers I use leave my face smooth but feeling tight</li>
            <li>As a 30-something still dealing with mild breakouts and dark spots, I was worried this would irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Tubes aren&#x27;t even half full.</li>
            <li>I have heard great reviews on this cleaning system and I was a little skeptical at first, but I don&#x27;t regret purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 with pretty good skin; some hormonal acne on my chin from time to time and a few lines when I smile, nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li>I would much rather have higher speed rpm&#x27;s than these slow speeds which completely stop the unit from rotating if too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>I notice less blemishes on my skin and my face is super soft</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the package and the item itself, its just a little bit of trouble i ve got when i was trying to put in the batteries.</li>
            <li>Be careful on first use that you don&#x27;t over do it or you will be sensitive.</li>
            <li>I usually wipe my makeup off with the makeup removers, but this definitely helped even more.</li>
            <li>Two or three times a week using this cleaning system is more than enough, followed by regular daily facial washing&#x27;s and once a week facial mask.</li>
            <li>At first I was only getting this as a back up and travel exfoliating machine.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how much better another brand could be, because I have seen a total transformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not have acne, but my main problem is blackheads and white heads around my chin.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not picky about color), most importantly this facial brush only takes 2-AA batteries as opposed to the other facial brushes that require 4-AA batteries (which I think is just ridiculous considering that batteries alone are not cheap themselves) anything that takes more than 2-AA batteries should be a charger based device, I think.</li>
            <li>My dark spots have faded a little and now my skin looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I could see with extended use this improving skin appearance, not a bad little cleaner over all for the price..</li>
            <li>After washing my face, I use the Olay Active Hydrating Cream Original Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was back in high school.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know why this product has such high reviews.</li>
            <li>the only downside I&#x27;d say is that the foam head is hard to get completely clean, but I know they sell replacements, and honestly for something that is taking off dead skin, it should be replaced regularly anyways.</li>
            <li>The new Olay system has a third faster speed that combines with a soft spongy pad to give you a microdermabrasion treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have major blackhead problem &amp; with this product I can control my skin!</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t find myself really using this feature too much, as I found the faster speeds to feel even less thorough than the slower ones.  </li>
            <li>I have adult acne and was using an acne product daily on my nose to reduce the pore size and on the occasional break outs--I have stopped using the acne product about 4 weeks ago as the micordermabrasion product is really working.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you don&#x27;t have money for the more expensive one or if you are like me and have never tried an expensive face cleansing machine.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any miracles with lines or wrinkles yet but haven&#x27;t used it that long and really don&#x27;t expect any miracles.</li>
            <li>Worth the money but not worth a hundred and some dollars</li>
            <li>I first wet my skin and then applied the crystals which made for an easier application of the crystals on my face.</li>
            <li>When used in combination with the foam pad, I feel a lot of drag on my skin, and it feels like it gets hot.</li>
            <li>for all the reviews that compare this to the more expensive clarisonic, it makes me glad that i didn&#x27;t waste any money on that.</li>
            <li>First product Ive used, so not much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>Getting a few white heads means I can just brush them away and my dab of clearsil advanced which works in one night not a huge application applied for a week over skin not truly clean.</li>
            <li>Expected something with a little more power &amp; effect.</li>
            <li>I should of spent a little more to get a clarsonic.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had this too long and have yet to use the samples because I bought another facial product to use, overall I really enjoy this facial scrubber.</li>
            <li>Prior to getting this kit, I had an earlier version of the same basic product, which came with a two-speed version of the microdermabrasion tool, with the brush head and a full size tube of the exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li>It works well but not as big and as powerful as I expected.</li>
            <li>After seeing more expensive options I decided to try Olay since it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I find using the brush for my daily 2nd cleansing routine very helpful.</li>
            <li>Like getting a facial at a salon only so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much gunk was left on my face - very gross.</li>
            <li>Found it for half the price on Amazon so, if you want a fresh start for your skin this year, give this system a try.</li>
            <li>Speed 1 is the Daily Gentle Cleansing Speed that is meant to be used with the regular brush head</li>
            <li>I suspect the results are due in large part to the electric powered abrasive action (as opposed to applying the microdermabrasion crystals by hand).</li>
            <li>works fine, but hard to manage</li>
            <li>However, other companies cleansers are priced even higher.</li>
            <li>But even with this frequency, I have noticed major difference.</li>
            <li>It does indeed clean deep down, much deeper expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35, asian, have sensitive skin that borders on either being really oily or really dry.  </li>
            <li>hope that by doing this lighter, more frequent treatment I can get similar if not better results to what I expected from the professional microdermabrasion at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>a home glycolic peel gone awry plus some mild acne scarring and very slight sagging around my lower mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Professional microdermabrasian has a reputation for leaving skin raw, so I expected something MORE when I used this...</li>
            <li>The power is average and the cleaning is a little better than just putting cleanser on your face.  </li>
            <li>As for eyes, Clarisonic makes an applicator with sonic technology called Black Opal that is for use around the delicate eye are and is very pricey, Michael Todd organics eye sonic is half the price and actually as good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin from only using it in the past week.</li>
            <li>but if this helps at least one person - that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t sustain a corneal injury it could easily have caused a serious injury.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would clear my acne and not irritated my skin, i only used the device it did what it was supposed too do.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the bristles on the brush are too soft and there are no alternative brush heads available.</li>
            <li>but it has been clear for years with the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>my skin is much softer than with hand wshing alone bit just not what i expected.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy this not really expecting a whole lot.</li>
            <li>The Olay brush has a different method of action than the Clarisonic line.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product, and it wasn&#x27;t expensive (at least, not in my opinion, I&#x27;ve eaten out at restaurants that cost more than this), so I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a second system for my 22 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>soft bristle face brush, from Big Lots of all places.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the olay pro x for a week, but so far I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>An even bigger difference is my neck area around the crease: my neck was looking like what one would expect on an 80 year old-</li>
            <li>As a face cleaner, it gets deep into pores and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>wand has 3 speeds: one for gentle cleansing (with facial cleansing brush), one for deep cleansing (with facial cleansing brush), and one for microdermabrasion (with microdermabraision foam head).  </li>
            <li>The vibration on the Clarisonic didn&#x27;t do anything for me, but my skin is only slightly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this device faithfully for two weeks (using the brush daily and the foam head twice a week), and all I can say is wow.</li>
            <li>I compared the cleanliness of my face after washing with a wash cloth, after just washing using my bare hands with cleanser and water, and the Olay Pro-X.</li>
            <li>I have old red acne spots and scarring, and this has improved those issues.</li>
            <li>Even with my 10x magnification mirror the pores around my nose are barely visible, and I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of products before with no results in that area.</li>
            <li>I normally use it at 2nd to 3rd speed depending where I use it on my face</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse than the Clarisonic</li>
            <li>also like a company that, these days, makes a product they are confident in and stand behind.  </li>
            <li>Many have commented about it pulling the thin skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>I previously used the Olay kit that only has one head attachment and a small tube of the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser (red and white tube) and didn&#x27;t like the cleanser but loved the exfoliating tool that came with it.</li>
            <li>It actually hit me in the open eye twice before I quit trying new strategies.  </li>
            <li>I received this a few days ago and used it right out of the box.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely acne prone and I only noticed that it broke me out for the first couple of days.</li>
            <li>Also, the tubes of product are super small</li>
            <li>Besides being lighter and smaller, if I loose it I wouldn&#x27;t care as much.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have that much room in the bathroom to keep all this plus my other toiletries.</li>
            <li>I have been using for close to a month, I really cannot tell a difference from any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>I have found that I can use it to get into the areas of my face that are hard to get to and clean (between the nose and checks).</li>
            <li>Last, but not least, for daily use, you can interchange the gentle cleansing brushes included with the previous &#x27;Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle Protocol System.</li>
            <li>I find that even on the highest setting the scrub brush is VERY gentle on the face which at first annoyed me</li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old african american woman also.</li>
            <li>but would be useful for those delicate or sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the bristle is quite effective but the microdermabrasion part of this product is almost useless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially I was a bit concerned about the grittiness of the microdermabrasion product, I use just a little bit and like the exfoliating cleanser, I apply the microdermabrasion product first with my finger tips and then use the wand with the foam pad.  </li>
            <li>But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
            <li>I was excited about purchasing this product as my skin had begun to show the signs of aging (I am 40 yrs) like dull skin, dark spots, fine lines and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>Obviously you&#x27;re not going to get the same results as going to the dermatologist for a microdermabrasion, that&#x27;s why it cost you a few hundred dollars to have something like that done at a spa/clinic in the first place!</li>
            <li>My skin is very thin and this product does not hurt at all but actually feel nice.</li>
            <li>In general if you have a cleansing brush and a facial foam you do not need any device to cleanse &amp; exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I noticed a lot of reviewers compared this product (and other brands like it) to the more &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; priced Clarisonic, which will cost at least $100.</li>
            <li>One cleans the gums stimulating them (or tearing them if you were not careful) while the sonicare actually healed them and helps you retain youthful gum tissue.</li>
            <li>there wasn&#x27;t enough motion (and apparently you&#x27;re not supposed to scrub your face with the brush either).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional microdermabrasion done a few times and loved it, but it is really expensive and time consuming to go to the doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this a few months now and it seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li>cleansing brush is (small) or as like to call it fun size.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to try this as people were saying it made them break out for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>The foam pad with the microdermabrasion gel gets really hot after spinning a few seconds on my face and does not work well</li>
            <li>Have had the first version for a few years</li>
            <li>Only cons is the fasted setting might be too slow for people who have been using spin brushes for awhile or need a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>and I spent time writing back and forth to the shippers, who weren&#x27;t particularly helpful.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t pull straight down, on the compartment area, but rock it side to side.  </li>
            <li>I think it really gets down into the pores.</li>
            <li>So as I am using it, if I am not very careful, the battery compartment just pops open.  </li>
            <li>The motor is too weak to make a serious impact on the real skin issues that plague most of the young adults today.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the issue was because the batteries were the right size.</li>
            <li>Since I like some of the Olay moisturizers as well as other high end products, I thought I&#x27;d give this brush a try.  </li>
            <li>My skin type is dry combination but clear.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the only product that has really cleared my dark spots.</li>
            <li>first you would waste $500 plus dollars on such nonsense...</li>
            <li>The machine is pretty weak, it&#x27;s a decent product</li>
            <li>The substance is very thick and gummy, with fine, gritty particles.</li>
            <li>There are other very expensive ones but this one is great for the price.</li>
            <li>Turns out it actually was a little too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to my baking soda mixed with a little liquid cleanser and gentle circular motion.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, this brush has such little power that it wouldn&#x27;t even make a good toy.  </li>
            <li>although very little it&#x27;s my first use</li>
            <li>Olay has always provided great alternatives for expensive skin care for hard working girls.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extra soft, but they really do remove the dull layers skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry (I&#x27;m in my 50s and live in a dry climate).</li>
            <li>Too bad, I was hoping this would be just as good.</li>

            <li> but it works great!</li>
            <li> Also, that there are 3 speeds instead of 2, and when the included Olay&#x27;s exfoliating &#x27;Renewal Cleanser&#x27; and &#x27;Thermal Crystal Skin Polisher&#x27; run out, you can use your preference of cleansers and moisturizers (as well as Olay&#x27;s excellent brands, of course.)  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked it and it&#x27;s helped me a lot!  </li>

            <li> I have never used a microdermabrasion product, but I have heard from so many people that it is just wonderful.</li>

            <li> Honestly that is how good your skin looks and how good you feel about yourself!</li>
            <li> vert good for cleansing</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> A good product.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price range.</li>
            <li> really good quality product and the results are great!&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> i loved it and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> and it feels good to me during and</li>
            <li> and it feels good to me during and after.    </li>
            <li> and maybe thats all it was good for...</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself because I was looking for a good cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> so this is a good thing.</li>
            <li> and it is good.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product</li>
            <li> but it is a really good product</li>
            <li> the unit is fairly lightweight and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> and it is good</li>
            <li> and while i loved that, I realized that sometimes it would still make my skin feel patchy.</li>
            <li> Also it shows good results if you use good cream after cleanising with it.</li>
            <li> : If you have pimples dont use it on that part of your face.&lt;br /&gt;I did not found Thermal Crystal Polisher that good, cz</li>
            <li> This one seems just as good as the others</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t explain it at all..but loved the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for weeks now just to give it a fair shot</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I should have, however, listened to the reviews that this is not even as good as a washcloth, which is also cheaper.</li>
            <li> and surprisingly, the sonic vibration is what I ended up not liking about it.  </li>
            <li> My daughter tried it and loved it as well.</li>
            <li> Good for traveling too.</li>
            <li> great price for all you get, the brush is nice but the dermabrasion sponge is tricky to use.</li>
            <li> The 3 speeds are fantastic and the sponge head attachment works perfect on the highest setting just as the instructions suggest.</li>
            <li> Good product, recommend.</li>
            <li> Also did a good job of cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an I-Skin device which I loved.  </li>
            <li> Good price and faster deliver</li>
            <li> good quality&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> Really good product, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> After using it, when I apply my night creams it goes on smooth and seeps into my skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> ALL THAT GOOD</li>
            <li> What works for me for night cleansing: I use my fingers using a good quality face creamy cleanser, compatible to my skin type, to remove make up or environmental dirt.</li>
            <li> and I get just as good of results.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Good for skin.</li>
            <li> It did a good job.</li>
            <li> Good for ladies.</li>
            <li> Anyway, i found this cleansing system kit is good purchase</li>
            <li> The works really good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit from Target after reading good reviews from Amazon.</li>
            <li> good price and shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great system for the price, and it seems like it&#x27;ll hold up nicely.  </li>
            <li> I try one time is feel good</li>
            <li> Also feels good.</li>
            <li> good price, thank you</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin skin feeling good and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good stuff.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.</li>
            <li> Maybe my unit was a dud and everyone else had a good one.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the clarisonic cleansing system, did my homework and found this, got good reviews and ordered it, even got $3 off coupon.</li>
            <li> This is so good I&#x27;m going to buy one for my mom for her Birthday.</li>
            <li> My wife said it did a really good job.  </li>
            <li> This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I think it was a good buy and would recommend it to others and have already to my son and his daughter.</li>
            <li> This is good product.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good gift.</li>
            <li> good product</li>

            <li> it does a wonderful job and your face feels so smooth when you&#x27;re done</li>
            <li> Good price for the kit.</li>
            <li> Good, My sister likes it.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> I think it is as good as the $100 ones found in department stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with how clean my face is after using the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Lemme say its the best clean I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> The fact that it was a Cyber Monday Special deal was great!</li>
            <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I used easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no fountain of youth to be sure, but it&#x27;s sure impressed the heck out of me.</li>
            <li> It is light, fits in your hand very nicely and does a great job.</li>
            <li> The mocroderm pad is very good too my face feels so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> im very sure this is not water resistant in any way.</li>
            <li> For the price it was great, love using the brush.</li>
            <li> The price was also very appealing.</li>
            <li> or so I will be very pleased with the results.</li>

            <li> Love it, does a great job.</li>
            <li> face feels GREAT after using it :)</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, and it&#x27;s a great value for those looking for something comparable to the Clarisonic, but at a better price range.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the cleansers aren&#x27;t that great, but when used with something better, this thing is a beast.</li>
            <li> The three speed variation is great, works as well as clarisonic and has cleared up so many skin imperfections for me.</li>
            <li> The brush is great :)</li>
            <li> But I am most happy with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Works good and effective.</li>
            <li> This brush is still a great part of a regimen because it does keep the rest of your face very clean.</li>

            <li> So I was thrilled to get to try out the Olay Pro-X Cleaning System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used both brushes, and I liked that the spinning head rotated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it, it does the job, massages face skin and cleans it really good.</li>
            <li> Quite nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> Your hands get kind of sore.</li>
            <li> As is all too often the case with this type of thing, just save up to get the nice version instead of wasting money on something that&#x27;s just so-so</li>
            <li> stars because I did like one of the scrubs that came with this kit (the one that gets warm when you apply it.)</li>
            <li> the Pro-X does a nice job.</li>
            <li> For me, it isn&#x27;t needed to be honest.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on my own needs.</li>
            <li> For me, it isn&#x27;t needed to be honest.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on my own needs.</li>
            <li> I use it with my Olay regenerist cleanser and it cleans so nicely.</li>
            <li> liked the brush and the cleanser, though it wasn&#x27;t super-scrubby, like an \\&quot;exfoliator\\&quot; is, in my experience.</li>
            <li> , ultimately: it&#x27;s a nice tool.</li>
            <li> But the pad/polisher combo doesn&#x27;t seem as nice.</li>
            <li> used the exfoliating tool with my own cleanser during my morning shower and then before bed I decided to try the thermal cream with the microdermabrasion head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another nice thing about this kit is that you can purchase the two brush head attachments separately</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another nice thing about this kit is that you can purchase the two brush head attachments separately</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> I even tried using the scrub with just my fingers like I use my microdermabrasion crystals, which was nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the product is Good.. :)</li>
            <li> Kind of self explanatory tho.</li>
            <li> and I have really liked using this product.</li>
            <li> but I do look forward to it though to be honest once I&#x27;m finished with the supplied cleanser</li>
            <li> I am loving this product i have used it twice and see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> The cleanser and crystals are nice, but I just use Cetaphil on my skin and then apply the spin brush or sponge.  </li>
            <li> The price of the whole set on Amazon is the best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Skin feels nice after use.</li>
            <li> Have not used their cleaning products yet, use my own.</li>
            <li> but I liked the fact that it has 3 rotation speed levels .</li>
            <li> foam head is nice, but I won&#x27;t replace it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping not, because as nice as this device is I don&#x27;t want to have to buy strictly Olay product in order to use it.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates nicely and my skin feels smoother than before.</li>
            <li> The brush feels nice on my face and is not abrasive.</li>
            <li> I also liked how it removed the skin flakes that I get from my nightly use of Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She points out that she uses her own cleanser, not the cleanser provided by</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would be awesome, cost efficient and amazing for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice product.. as described.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used with own cleanser</li>
            <li> I have been using this system over one month and honestly it works, I had some marks on my chin</li>
            <li> She really liked it.</li>
            <li> It is nice to feel my skin dewy again.</li>
            <li> And the &amp;#34;warming thermal scrub&amp;#34; stuff for the microderm does seem to warm for me.</li>
            <li> It feels nice to have your face rubbed, but that is the extent of what it does.</li>
            <li> but I have tried the manual Face brush and even though you do need to do the work on your own you can control the pressure and motion, which in the case of this face brush I feel like</li>
            <li> I used my friends Clarisonic and really liked it.  </li>
            <li> I even put in my own batteries.  </li>
            <li> But otherwise good deal and value for the price :)</li>
            <li> this is really nice</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE LOVE it!!  </li>
            <li> this product is great, especially compared to the systems out there that cost a lot more!!!</li>
            <li> My face is clean without irritation and the cost is great with the added coupon that Amazon kindly throws</li>
            <li> choice is not wrong very good</li>
            <li> very good and reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I kind of knew that I would love this product, but I have still been impressed by how much it has brightened my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased, and do recommend this for a more affordable option to clarisonic</li>
            <li> The Thermal Polish cream was nice with a very fine grit.</li>
            <li> I love this kit it really works as my skin is smoother and brighter, and the price was great!</li>
            <li> i think its perfect for anyone who wants something more than their hands but dont want to spend the 200 bucks.</li>
            <li> There are super pricey ones out there, but this one is absolutely great for the price.</li>
            <li> brush itself also has three speeds, and you change the speeds by pushing on buttons, which are very easy to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any real significant changes...</li>
            <li> I am glad to have a great product at a low cost.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to supply a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about how amazing the clairsonic brush is and after this one is done I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll make the investment.</li>
            <li> No, it will not give you the look of a professional microdermabrasion, but in between it works perfect.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the Olay scrubber would help smooth my skin as part of a routine, and some of the reviews indicate that it is a good product.</li>
            <li> The CS rep to whom I spoke said that this probably isn&#x27;t the best product for someone with sensitive skin, as I have.  </li>
            <li> I do love the warm tingle of the microdermabrasion scrub though.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Clarisonic, I own one</li>
            <li> Since my husband is one of the world&#x27;s most honest men, if he didn&#x27;t agree with this, he would have said something noncommittal to skirt the issue.  </li>
            <li> I honestly had better expectations for this.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is good and the skin looks polished and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and batteries included!</li>
            <li> Very drying so good moisturizer is a must!</li>
            <li> In this case, with the very good results I can clearly see, I won&#x27;t be taking them up on it, but it&#x27;s nice to know</li>
            <li> I love the product, My skin felt great and looked fresh.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it cleaned my skin and was very happy with the the overall performance.  </li>
            <li> Did an ok job wasn&#x27;t spectacular needs more heads</li>
            <li> Great delivery time and I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> the product is great does exactly what it says on the box</li>
            <li> and I am pretty happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try microdermabreasion, and this is a great first try.</li>
            <li> great price, works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my wife and she feel happy with it ;)</li>
            <li> That one was cool, but rubbing the crystals with your hands is fairly abrasive.</li>
            <li> I almost never leave the house without full makeup because I&#x27;m so fair</li>
            <li> I almost never leave the house without full makeup because I&#x27;m so fair</li>
            <li> and it is very comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that your face is very smooth afterwords.  </li>
            <li> My face feels very smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> etc. is easy, but it would be nice to know what recommended duration you should use</li>
            <li> Enjoy the price most of all.!</li>
            <li> Very good, face skin&#x27;s alive.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s there.ith the very good results I can clearly see, I won&#x27;t be taking them up on it, but</li>
            <li> so glad i got this 15$ cheaper than in stores</li>
            <li> vitagoods, way better brand</li>
            <li> Great Deal, thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> The color of my skin is more even over-all.</li>
            <li> The samples that come with it are okay</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fabulous!</li>
            <li> After just 3 days, I noticed that most of my acne was gone.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy that I bought this.</li>
            <li> Was the best decision because my skin felt smoother after just one use and it is looks brighter after only 1 week.  </li>
            <li> My wife said it was just an OK product.</li>
            <li> As for having more radiant skin</li>
            <li> does a better job than hand scrubs or gloves..</li>
            <li> Now I just need to use it more often...</li>
            <li> I love using this product once a week.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have as many breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this unit.</li>
            <li> As many have said before there are no instructions included with the product.</li>
            <li> My fingers worked better.</li>
            <li> I only used it once/twice a week, always used good quality, fresh batteries and took excellent care of it.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic cost a lot more but well</li>
            <li> /&gt;you have a better chance doing it manually (and by that</li>
            <li> The device doesn&#x27;t do anything more than I can with my hands.</li>
            <li> I love the thermal crystal polish</li>
            <li> But despite this I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> most people answered &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> and I do love the Olay line of face products.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use sandpaper, but it should exfoliate better.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been a magic wand, but my face has improved a bit since I started to use this.</li>
            <li> but it is better and easier than washing your face with your hands.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase the Clairisonic, but wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend &amp;#</li>
            <li> I love this my face feels so much more cleaner</li>
            <li> I love Olay and this product did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> Best facial thing I have bought EVER!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon provided me this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Amazon provided me this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Maybe used along with a Clarisonic brush the effect I want would be better.</li>
            <li> I love this machine.</li>
            <li> love this brush and its speeds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with how well this product works.</li>
            <li> I sincerely hope it works as well for you as it did for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System Kit my HIGHEST recommendation!ndation!</li>
            <li> I felt it could use more power.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I haven&#x27;t found a microdermabrasion treatment yet that I have been satisfied with and, when given the chance to try Olay&#x27;s version, I went for it.  </li>
            <li> I am sure you will see results.</li>
            <li> Went in with fairly moderate expectations and have been impressed.</li>
            <li> After one use of the Clarisonic, my skin was smoother and my makeup went on much better.</li>
            <li> and I feel pleased with the difference</li>
            <li> One is I thought it would be more powerfull rotation.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all I need is to tug more wrinkles around my eyes...</li>
            <li> I still have the two cleansers it came with after many face washes as you just need a dab.</li>
            <li> Perhaps someone else has had better results.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and we both love it.</li>
            <li> Just an ok item.</li>
            <li> Will be investing in a better model.</li>
            <li> I really love the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working like magic...</li>
            <li> I love it....</li>
            <li> absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Overall, Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> It was an okay deal although it said that I would get 3.00 off but it didn&#x27;t,</li>
            <li> my face is more radiant than ever , would recommend.</li>
            <li> This was the best price for similar products.</li>
            <li> Over all satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and will more than likely buy again once this one gives out.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I still like mine better.</li>
            <li> the Pro X Cleansing System, in addition to the cleansing tool and exfoliating cream, you get another head attachment for microdermabrasion and a thermal cream for even more thorough exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my pores look so much better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my pores look so much better</li>
            <li> I like this product just wish it had more power.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> and it was dropped one too many times and had stopped working after 2 years</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about four months now and my skin does feels better from when I started.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be purchasing another one, for sure.</li>
            <li> I just have to say to all those who say clarosonic is better than this... don&#x27;t believe them.</li>
            <li> that is the MAGIC ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> With that being said, I love this Olay kit.</li>
            <li> I love love love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> The microdermabrasion part I love as well.</li>
            <li> and I love that too.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my face feel.... nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love the exfoliation on my skin without having to spend $100+ on the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I have used oil of olay for many years, which is the reason i chose their product</li>
            <li> and I can say I&#x27;m satisfied with this</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;really&#x27; enjoyed using this product</li>
            <li> This is so much better than just a face cloth.</li>
            <li> and we both agree her skin looks much better as it has taken away the dullness.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have really enjoyed using it</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love the 3 speeds and 2 heads.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> have had before that works even better.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is beating most stores by $15.00 to $16.00.</li>
            <li> I chose to review this item because there are not a lot of affordable at home Microdermabrasion machines that you can buy without having a degree in dermatology to understand how to safely use it.</li>
            <li> It was so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any irritation or redness though I am not prone to that with most cleansers.</li>
            <li> I ended up using the scrub with my fingers which did leave my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for facial exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> just as described i love it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Do I need any more salon spa facials?  </li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with the cleansing results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this product -my  </li>
            <li> Instructions for how to use the products could have been better..</li>
            <li> but after using this I noticed more makeup on the brush.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting something built by Tim The Toolman Taylor, ripping along at 60mph, however I get a better scrub from my washcloth.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles don&#x27;t need any help to get deeper and more noticeable</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it also contains a sample size of the exfoliating cream and MDA gel.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re wanting something cheap but works!</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better</li>
            <li> My skin is so much more brighter &amp; smoother.</li>
            <li> I am sure this works well, I just need to take the time to do it like it says.</li>
            <li> You get MUCH better results with the polisher if you just use your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love what this product is doing for my face.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> and I would like for there to be more exfoliation beads.</li>
            <li> , it is also possible to do dermabrasion, GREAT!</li>
            <li> I wish there were more than 3 speeds.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t stop touching my skin afterwards in shock from the smoothness.</li>
            <li> She said it works excellent and helps make her look younger.</li>
            <li> The instructions say (in many languages) how to put the batteries in, and which product to use with which attachment.  </li>
            <li> If you decide to use this, make sure you have all your hair secured as if you were scrubbing in to surgery.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to think up what else I might be able to use the machine for but have concluded I might as well just throw it away.</li>
            <li> :) The wand even shows you which way the batteries go in.</li>
            <li> after 2 microdermabraision uses, visibly improved texture and more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kit.</li>
            <li> Everything you need to start working towards healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the micro-dermabrasion brush head yet, but the regular scrubber works wonderful.</li>
            <li> It works great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but I will buy more of the exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great price.</li>
            <li> I recommend finding an alternative microderm gel or cream and using it in conjunction with the Olay pad for better results.</li>
            <li> hope my face get smoother with this Olay~:)</li>
            <li> and i love it&lt;</li>
            <li> , i tried lots of DIY treatments for my scars and this product worked SO well better than anything else</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and decided on this product, and I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the product makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> This product is not what I thought it would be:  I can get a better cleaning experience using my hands.</li>
            <li> Love that it came with both the brush and sponge heads.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> Product is just ok.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way my skin glows now with both of the included products.</li>
            <li> Cleans OK.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this reasonably priced item.</li>
            <li> You can use it with the products enclosed or with your favorite products.</li>
            <li> but it did make my skin softer and cleaned most of my pores.</li>
            <li> In most cases I find using the crystals once every 2 weeks for olive or darker skins do not trigger hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> It is definitely more radiant.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face, but does not seem to be doing do much better than washing with my hands.</li>
            <li> OMG i love this thing</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I love, love this machine.</li>
            <li> This Olay Pro-X worked much better for me.  </li>
            <li> Also as the brush spins instead of vibrating, it cleans my skin faster and seems to leaving my skin glowing because its more vigorous and sends the blood up to my skin better.  </li>
            <li> , I have better results with my chemical exfoliator which I rub on my face.</li>
            <li> I never got more of the cleaning products that came with it.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to buy more soon.</li>
            <li> We love this mattress</li>
            <li> This facial microdermabrasion brush set works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this device.  </li>
            <li> skin love it :)</li>
            <li> This is okay...</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love to use this one,</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this, bought me and my sister one</li>
            <li> we both love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to quit using it just because of the device even if it where as I&#x27;m sure my skin is just adjusting to the more vigorous scrubbing &#x27;ceremony&#x27;.</li>
            <li> and she couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This works just OK.  </li>
            <li> Makes the makeup blend in with your face even more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the 3 speeds, and being ablle to use microdermabrasion head at home.</li>
            <li> Speed 3 is the Microdermabrasion Speed that is meant to be used with the Microdermabrasion Foam Head; it supposedly exfoliates 700% better than their scrub</li>
            <li> Creams and masks work so much better after using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of microdermabrasion</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 3 weeks and my skin looks and feels smooth and softer!  </li>
            <li> Use this system 2 times a week for a better complexion.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to be sure</li>
            <li> More even skin tone after about two weeks&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser causes me to breakout, I don&#x27;t know if I would have received better results if I could use</li>
            <li> Because the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser causes me to breakout, I don&#x27;t know if I would have received better results if I could use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the trying stages but love the way it makes my skin feel and has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> My skin already feels smoother, and I notice that my moisturizer goes on so much better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.....</li>
            <li> Love the 3 speed setting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of just the friction from the sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better quality and cheaper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am impressed with the Microdermabrasion Plus System, I will continue to use it daily</li>
            <li> So, this system is supposed to increase the effectiveness of your face wash up to 700 times more than hands alone.  </li>
            <li> Skin looks radient and I have been using this product in the shower which is even more convient.</li>
            <li> I also love the face creams that it comes with</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> My wife love it.</li>
            <li> Well the pad wears out before the product is gone so you buy more to get the ONE head they supply</li>
            <li> and you end up with many unopened bottles.  </li>
            <li> I bought this three months ago and love it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.....</li>
            <li> Such a great product!!</li>
            <li> And now at a week, my skin looks so very much better.</li>
            <li> It is okay something I would not purchase again</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> For any OCM users reading this, I think I&#x27;m going to replace my brush head more often than what it calls for</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product and what my skin looks like now.</li>
            <li> I was more focused on my cheeks and forehead.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I was a smoker for many years (I am 68 yrs of age &amp; no longer smoke)</li>
            <li> …THAT is how lovely their skin is.</li>
            <li> certainly much better than nothing</li>
            <li> Cleans okay, but not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> But the attachments for it, don&#x27;t give any better effects than a cheaper version in the drugstore, or even a &#x27;buff pad&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I am also allergic to most products causing a breakout.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> Love this product and have sent my friends to get it.</li>
            <li> Am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads and crystals are more affordable for the Olay ProX</li>
            <li> But when it works, it does miracles to my skin :-).</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much more cleaner after using this.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;ll work better once replaced</li>
            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> It is battery powered and safe to use I the shower.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the scrubber.</li>
            <li> After one week of use my skin is looking and feeling so much better and softer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Much better deal here</li>
            <li> I vowed to take better care of my skin but didnt want to spend $200 on a clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I use good face lotion right after I use this</li>
            <li> My skin looks beautiful, and it feels very soft.</li>
            <li> Used it a couple of times for the microdermabrasion and the exfoliating system and it made my skin look very smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> Works great for me, keeps my skin looking fresh and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I love using it because it makes my face feel so very clean.</li>
            <li> My daughter was very excited to find this gift under the Christmas tree this year.</li>
            <li> I also use this device when applying acne creme, very useful!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any significant results to be honest.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean nice</li>
            <li> I have since purchased more product I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> feels good, seems to very gently exfoliate  </li>
            <li> Quick ship, love the product and still using it!</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use...cleans very well.</li>
            <li> but as I was using it I couldn&#x27;t help but think good thing this thing is super light or else</li>
            <li> because the warming product is very cool and it will work better with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because the warming product is very cool and it will work better with this tool.    </li>
            <li> While normally I&#x27;d say be happy with what you have</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However in first week my skin didnt show any good output..</li>
            <li> Cleans my face pretty good.</li>
            <li> It feels really good when you first put it on.  </li>
            <li> machine does just ok for the cleaning and polishing purpose, but nothing supper special!</li>
            <li> I thought it was great that new batteries also came included</li>
            <li> works great, the smooth finishing pad did not hold up very well.</li>
            <li> Works just as easy as washing your face with a wash cloth before bed, but with stunning results.</li>
            <li> Just switch off the device, remove the attachment, and you can get your hair detatched from the attachment quite easily,  You might even  be able to get it untangled.</li>
            <li> If you need replacement brush or polishing heads, you should be able to find them easily.  </li>
            <li> Love this item, it was so easy to use and came with the betteries (def a plus).</li>
            <li> The kit comes with a nice brush that really scrubs the skin without being abrasive and the polisher has a nice effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and use.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very, very soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> I mean it does a good job, maybe not an excellent one but</li>
            <li> Just use a moisturizer after and clean the bristles!</li>
            <li> I purchased this set due to the great reviews and thought, way cheaper, maybe it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is an incredible product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System Kit.</li>
            <li> This is a great price and  better than the red package version I bought for way more money at the store.  </li>
            <li> Excellent skin cleansing and dermabrasion capabilities, but not much product included and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt my skin so consistently smooth for more than just a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve learned to correct that by lifting it off my skin just a tad so that it can move more freely.</li>
            <li> using it,I felt this one made it better smooth</li>
            <li> Works well and the brush is soft though it truly does a great job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> more like when you apply makeup and your skin color is even and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product so far.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much that I bought my mother one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as good as any $5 exfoliating cleanser, didn&#x27;t really do much of anything.</li>
            <li> Thank you for good product with reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My daughter borrowed it and loved it so much I have to buy another for her...</li>
            <li> good and reasonable price</li>
            <li> it has been over a month and MY lines are NOW most definitely much fainter!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my face very smooth and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty good considering such a great price.</li>
            <li> I use other face washes with it but find olays were probably best exfoliants.</li>
            <li> so I might be ticked off if I&#x27;d paid full price!</li>
            <li> Was used after the skin is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Is a very good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> All that plus its so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think this product would be great to have had when I was a teenager promoting better care of my skin at a younger age.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t give that easily, but for the price and what you get and how well it works, I think it deserves it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t give that easily, but for the price and what you get and how well it works, I think it deserves it.</li>
            <li> The two heads come off and on easy</li>
            <li> use this in the shower and it&#x27;s easy to hold on to.  </li>

            <li> The product itself is easy to use though the box does not come with instructions on recommended time, amount or setting</li>
            <li> The buttons are easy toggles with a size difference you can feel so you don&#x27;t have to look in case</li>
            <li> It is compact and can easily be transported on trips.  </li>
            <li> more.)to find them easily.  </li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy brush change.</li>
            <li> I chose Olay because it is easy to access for brush head replacement.</li>
            <li> Easy to use....</li>
            <li> This is a desirable and easy to use product.</li>
            <li> easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Easy to pack for a weekend away from home too.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to get rid</li>
            <li> I also like how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> and it fits easily in my travel stuff without a problem</li>
            <li> Have really enjoyed using this because it makes my skin feel so clean and invigorated.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to switch out.</li>
            <li> Makes washing your face so easy</li>
            <li> Although not as strong or as thorough as a pro, I get no redness from using this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer pointed out the activator from the peel is not included here so it will not be as strong</li>
            <li> Not that strong, but then again, you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than the more popular brands and does the same (or even better!)</li>
            <li> the cleanser and thermal polish gel are very gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my complexion or wrinkles but my face feels clean!</li>
            <li> It was ok, I didn&#x27;t notice anything special.</li>
            <li> Amazing how much cleaner it gets your skin!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased as it is very sturdy and works well with its 3 speeds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Clarisonic, and this is the first of its kind that I&#x27;ve bought, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked it at first.</li>
            <li> I had the original version which didn&#x27;t have the microdermabrasion function, and it was the best money I ever spent.</li>
            <li> works ok not a lot of power but for the price not bad.</li>
            <li> The rep also said that I shouldn&#x27;t press down with the brush -- at all -- as it&#x27;s best to let the cleansing and exfoliating product do the job, rather than the brush.  </li>
            <li> I Love how clean my face feels after using Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System.</li>
            <li> Special offer when buy, wash very clean</li>
            <li> If you use once a day and keep it max at speed 2, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> and I like it fine.</li>
            <li> While it worked -it was just fine</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> The thermal polisher works just fine on areas where the skin can&#x27;t be pulled-just be cautious around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> \\&quot;after 1 microdermabraision use, see noticeable improvement in the appearance of fine lines, radiance, brightness, and pores.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Mine has worked just fine for my needs.</li>
            <li> I think my skin looks brighter, but I never saw any reduction in fine lines or anything.  </li>
            <li> (The grit of the crystal is so fine</li>
            <li> Love the brush - the brush pads wear out so quickly though.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very happy with my new clear skin.</li>
            <li> you want an easy to use microdermabrasion kit that you can use at home and not have to spend a lot of money, this kit may not be as good as a professional treatment</li>
            <li> My skin does feel and look better than when I first started!</li>
            <li> My face look amazing , very clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> Debated about buying a clairsonic but went with the olay pro-x after reading all the reviews and seeing the huge price difference.  </li>
            <li> Noticed a huge difference in my skin in just two uses.</li>
            <li> It pulls around the eye area (a huge no no) and along the temples and forehead where that skin needs to not be rippled or furrowed- ever.</li>
            <li> Noticed a huge difference after just one use of the microdermabraision pad and cleanser.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality</li>
            <li> My skin just feels awesome no longer bumpy from dead skin and blackheads</li>
            <li> and I must say that my face feels extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> If it lasts for a year, I&#x27;ll be happy enough.  </li>
            <li> It is relaxing to have the brush sort of lightly massage your face</li>
            <li> It is relaxing to have the brush sort of lightly massage your face</li>
            <li> really cant tell you if it works or not because to be honest with you-</li>

            <li> I works great with a facial scrub,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my face so smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enter the \\&quot;Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System Kit,\\&quot; which contains two \\&quot;systems\\&quot; -- (1) \\&quot;Pro-X Microdermabrasion</li>
            <li> System\\&quot; and (2) \\&quot;Plus Advanced Cleansing System.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I know I sound like an ad, but I assure you</li>
            <li> Important Note:</li>
            <li> have been happy with its use, although I must say that I don&#x27;t feel the same cleansing \\&quot;pressure\\&quot; on my skin that I do with the Mia, in the use of either extension for the Pro-X.  </li>
            <li> So whether you can walk on your own feet or in a wheelchair I would recommend this for any lady who wants to keep her skin looking youthful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleaning spin brush for almost a year</li>
            <li> it now looks fresh and more even without a stitch of makeup</li>
            <li> Started developing some odd-looking bumps on my face, purchased this item to help smooth things out a bit after discussing microdermabrasion with my doctor.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason which I understand now - you want to keep your skin smooth</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason which I understand now - you want to keep your skin smooth</li>
            <li> Cheap product.</li>
            <li> my face feels so smooth</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth and</li>
            <li> ... it kind of feels like heat just from friction, because it&#x27;s dragging so much.</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]]</li>
            <li> works fabulously.</li>
            <li> I came into work with almost no foundation on, just a light miners veil.</li>
            <li> This has been surprisingly effective and gentle.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I can say that there is a visible difference in my skin tone and my face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> I was puzzled as to how a smooth foam pad could do anything, until I opened the tube of cream.  </li>
            <li> And it doesnt have detailed description on how to maintain the brush etc</li>
            <li> It contains different speeds and is really great at scrubbing of the dirt from face.</li>
            <li> My make-up goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> The two included brush heads give you great microdermabrasion and cleansing, and the 3 speeds lets you customize your facial.</li>
            <li> It really does a nice job on cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> The cleanser and exfoliants are gentle but effective as well.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks I&#x27;m really happy as I&#x27;m finally breaking the breakout cycle that starts around my period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Olay Pro-X definitely does a great job at cleansing, and microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at the package, the microdermabraision head is the smooth one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package claims:&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> (Of course, you could also use one of those free makeup bags you get from cosmetics companies, BUT I would think Olay would want to take this opportunity to advertise their product.  </li>
            <li> (Of course, you could also use one of those free makeup bags you get from cosmetics companies, BUT I would think Olay would want to take this opportunity to advertise their product.  </li>
            <li> Face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> She wants her own now.</li>
            <li> Light and comfortable handling.</li>
            <li> The included device, which circulates the exfoliation sponge and liquid, isn&#x27;t worth any more than $10.  </li>
            <li> Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> I truly enjoy the exfoliation of this product and the cleansers that come with it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as durable as I thought it would be, although it does get a light weight job done on cleaning the face etc.</li>
            <li> I may do it once a week but the regular brush seems to be working great for me as of now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is CHEAP.</li>
            <li> Product is cheap, not made well</li>
            <li> If you really want effective cleaning for your skin - save your money and buy a Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> The regular head is great and u can see visible effects after 1 use.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 months ago and use the Advanced cleanser twice a week.</li>
            <li> The cleansing/spinning sponge brush works nicely, but the real gem is the exfoliating/spinning brush.</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels so smooth.  </li>
            <li> it felt great, it was like having a facial massage.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so smooth.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of weeks&#x27; worth in there since you don&#x27;t use it more than twice a week and not two days in a</li>
            <li> Great service - only niggle was parcel took about 4 weeks longer to arrive than the automated response said it would</li>
            <li> It is a great value and the cleanser and polishing lotions - you only need a teeny bit</li>
            <li> This Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System did not work like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I was not going to pay $100+ for a facial cleaning brush and $50+ for replacement heads, this one works great for a fraction of the price and has inexpensive replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Works fabulously.</li>
            <li> It works great and has three (3) speed settings and comes with an exfoliate pad and a facial brush attachments.</li>
            <li> The brush handle seems a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the microdermabrasion setting/brush, but the cleansing brush was nice.</li>
            <li> price wasnt that great only saved on shipping.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Leaves face so smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall, great purchase.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth</li>
            <li> but so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I use the old Olay brush and it did a good job cleaning</li>
            <li> I needed something that I could more frequently and cost effective.  </li>
            <li> It is like the difference between the old school interplak tooth brushes and the superior sonic care.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I found it easier to use this system just before a shower as the polish is gritty and to make sure my face is rinsed good.  </li>
            <li> Good product, once I&#x27;d used it noticed the difference On my skin as far how it felt and looked</li>
            <li> but this one is so much stronger and the extra speed is great!!  </li>
            <li> So far, so good</li>
            <li> My girlfriend use it and said her face is so good, feels soft.</li>
            <li> very handy tool for beautifying and the little extras are nice.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective microdermabrasion tool, but because the head spins rather than pulsates or vibrates unlike the clarisonic, it&#x27;s important to make sure the brush-head is really wet and soapy so that it doesn&#x27;t pull or tug at the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this and the price was right.</li>
            <li> does all, that it was meant too, must the chemicals, that are supplied need to be advertised, as very powerful, as they caused a redness on my face</li>
            <li> Both brushes are very useful.</li>
            <li> love the feel of a fresh clean face</li>
            <li> It feels so fresh, clean, and healthy.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> skin felt smooth and clean .</li>
            <li> It really clean my face and my face feels smooth.</li>
            <li> skin feels clean from inside and also smooth.</li>
            <li> but the system makes your face smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> , My skin was so clean and had a light sheen.</li>
            <li> After I use this product my face feel smooth and clean,</li>
            <li> But do like the way it makes my face feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Using it during my morning showers makes it super easy to rinse off and I follow up with moisturizer and then make up.</li>
            <li> super easy to use and change out heads as needed&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Its nice to be pampered but if your primarily looking for change in the texture of your skin, this system is very effective and a small fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the original one before</li>
            <li> originally gave this 4 stars but am now dropping it to one.</li>
            <li> but we just buy the brush replacement so we each have our own and use our normal face wash</li>
            <li> I am excited to see where my skin is in a month.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this in the mail.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> The one thing this product could use is better instructions for when you use this the first time.  </li>
            <li> After first use, my skin felt better and softer.  </li>
            <li> Today is 5th day of using the system, i am very happy with a small result.</li>
            <li> i am so excited to try the microdermabrasion  brush tommorrow..</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!  </li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I notice a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> When she first started using it, I asked her if it cleanses better.</li>
            <li> I had the original and replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li> I will probably repurchase the original kit without the microdermabrasion attachment.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had any significant improvements to my skin.</li>
            <li> Being satisfied with the Advanced Cleanser and cleansing brush, I just bought a large tube of cleanser and 2 replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> It works well my skins been super smooth.</li>
            <li> I switched to the brush and used the cleanser, I also used another product to help clean which was also an exfoliator</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel so clean</li>
            <li> and it feels so clean after I use this.  </li>
            <li> After using it, i felt that my face was really clean</li>
            <li> Does get my face clean.</li>
            <li> I can personally say that so far this has been the best investment ever.</li>
            <li> I can personally say that so far this has been the best investment ever.</li>
            <li> This product is really good, it cleans your face amazingly however it can be slightly harsh on sensative skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cleansing brush is nice for a deep clean, but my favorite thing about the kit is the foam head and scrub.</li>
            <li> It turns warm on your skin (to open your pores and clean better).</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and I find make-up applies more smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 plus and keep trying another way to clean my face.</li>
            <li> I was tentative about using an appliance on my sensitive skin but after enjoying the microdermabrasion treatment and wanting that but not being able to afford the $100/treatment pricel...</li>
            <li> This keeps your face clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> what it is, but my machine works when I try to clean it out and put in the batteries.</li>
            <li> I tried to clean it out, but its still there.</li>
            <li> It does what its suppossed to do essentially, clean.</li>
            <li> Having tested one out, I can say that his will not come close to replacing a clarisonic but will still keep you clean and hopefully reduce acne.</li>
            <li> But it got better and I am satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and refreshed after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps face clean.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my face at the highest setting</li>
            <li> BUT this does make it easier to get a thorough clean.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have had a pamphlet that spelled things out more clearly, especially since I plan on throwing the box</li>
            <li> My pores look awesome, then my clear skin literally freaks out days later.  </li>
            <li> Use it with some bensol peroxide cleaner when I shower and my face is completely clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My daughter swears by this and loves to clean her face with it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much power it has and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> I originally wanted a clarisonic because I&#x27;d heard such good things about it.</li>
            <li> other brush system works really good, makes my face feel cleaner and pores look better.</li>
            <li> It got good reviews from other users so they must have a better result than I did.  </li>
            <li> It makes a full clean up in face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and does a far better job cleaning my pores and leaving my skin smooth than washing with hands.</li>
            <li> I bought it special offer price</li>
            <li> They work well but be sure to use the right cream with the right head.</li>
            <li> Nothing special that sets it apart from others.</li>
            <li> so i could start using it right away!</li>
            <li> This really gets your face clean, and I think the moisturizer can sink in better then.  </li>
            <li> This one is so weak I can rub my face better with my own hands and a washcloth!!</li>
            <li> in all Olay did a great job and this device, if used carefully is an inexpensive way to dramatically improve your skin.</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush is great but the tube of Thermal Crystals provided was almost empty.</li>
            <li> Those reviews that claim to have people commenting on the condition of their skin are full of it, if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> It works good but batteries run low often.</li>
            <li> what held true all those years ago also holds true today.  </li>
            <li> Probably more gentle to use the cushioned disk.</li>
            <li> This is not painful.</li>
            <li> I know there are others that cost way much more, but this one is a reasonable price and does its work.</li>
            <li> And I really wish it had better directions in how to use it with the creams it comes with.</li>
            <li> The cleansing head does feel very spa like, and it does make you feel like you are doing something healthy for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Its soft and effective.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling super clean and renewed.</li>
            <li> but after a month I could see good results, especially in summer</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so smooth and fresh, even when used with another cleaner.</li>
            <li> It actually does what it claims.. loved the results.</li>
            <li> It is a good product overall</li>
            <li> The motor does not have enough power to do a good job I feel.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is again ok, it doesn&#x27;t foam much</li>
            <li> Good low price substitute to give cleaning brushes a try.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the full results.</li>
            <li> because it has ionic technology and sonic waves is going to get much deeper into the skin, kill bacteria better and stimulate the skin.</li>
            <li> It would have been cool to have some color coding on the attachment to make it easier to remember which tool matches which product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my Son and he absolutely loves it :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;this greats off so much of my makeup way more than using a makeup wipe or some cleaner with your hands.</li>
            <li> I had 2 co-workers approach me about my skin looking so good and what did I do different.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using it, my skin feels really smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li> MY SKIN WAS NICE AND SOFT</li>
            <li> If you have superficial acne scars this device might help soften those especially if you have fair skin.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll just go back to a good old-fashioned washcloth.  </li>
            <li> so I still give it full stars.</li>
            <li> The combo of using this, good moisturizer, and a BB cream has eliminated foundation from my daily routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the high priced ones!  :)</li>
            <li> but it was just too much out of our price range for something I wasn&#x27;t sure about.</li>
            <li> The skin gets better really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a good facial cleansing system.</li>
            <li> What they say is true.</li>
            <li> They say to replace the brushes after your bottles run out, so they should last a good while.</li>
            <li> They say to replace the brushes after your bottles run out, so they should last a good while.</li>
            <li> made me look good only to see at this age the results of all that Sun damage….</li>
            <li> Only use twice a week because that is all you need to look good.</li>
            <li> However, Pro-X does have enough power to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do any better than the Neutrogena wave and products.</li>
            <li> I love how this feels but can&#x27;t say it does much.</li>
            <li> however that was not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> It is not bad but it is not a Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> It is not very powerful so doesn&#x27;t give a great microdermabrasion effect.</li>
            <li> skin felt fresh and smooth after the use and its very easy to use as they do give clear directions.</li>
            <li> : I think this is worth it because I got my original kit from my Mom as a Christmas gift</li>
            <li> : I think this is worth it because I got my original kit from my Mom as a Christmas gift</li>
            <li> It works well by making my skin feel good after using it, I just wish it had a little more power to it</li>
            <li> This is my first powered experience and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Makes her face feel really fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The soap and creame that come with the applicator were fine, but i used a gentle face soap with mine and it workwed just as well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i think if you dont have a lot of skin problems like serious acne this is perfect to use instead of the clairisonic.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> The three speeds available make the regular cleansing head even more effective, as opposed to the two speeds with the older version.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely smoother and skin much less flaky, but the most impressive result I&#x27;ve seen is a substantial reduction in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great for that microdermabrasion process, but for me, its too much - an electric brush with two heads and 2 different lotions...</li>
            <li> but I can see quick results.</li>
            <li> So here I was back to searching for the best cleansing facial brush.</li>
            <li> After just one use my freckles have lightened an extraordinary amount - it was practically life changing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After purchasing this set for $30, it arrived quickly and I opened it up and read all of the instructions.</li>
            <li> After that, I just decided to buy a $5 manual facial brush from Sephora and that was working out great, but my face still had flaky skin despite me gently brushing my face for over 10 minutes at a time</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just lucky...</li>
            <li> Quick delv.</li>
            <li> you are looking for something that really scrubs, you might need something more powerful.</li>
            <li> This should be a 3.5 star rating mainly because I wish this came with more cleansing product.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have been looking for something that will save me some time.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve used many facial scrubs (Estee Lauder, Crabtree and Evelyn, Clarins, etc) but the Olay ones work better than any I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Ok i got this instead of buying the more flimsy non name brand facial brushes out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to reduce my pores and tighten up my jawline with high end peptides like Genifique and Lancome Regenerist multi lift tinted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I found this kit super easy to use and since the tubes of product are not that large</li>
            <li> The first time I used this system i noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months now and am still very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I purchased the set instead of the regular Olay Pro-X system.</li>
            <li> I actually feel it to be more effective than the real microdermabrasion treatments I&#x27;ve received at a spa.</li>
            <li> Very gentle thorough cleaning!</li>
            <li> the very first time I used this  </li>
            <li> This was a great edition to kick my daily facial routine into a more productive gear with visible results..</li>
            <li> First time I used it my face felt so smooth.</li>
            <li> The cleanser and polisher creams are good and the tubes have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> At first I assumed this was because I had such an awesome deep clean</li>
            <li> It is a nice set but not enough power to clean a skin.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I&#x27;m getting such a better clean!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite health and beauty item.</li>
            <li> Neither is true - it is just right.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully make my face feel so soft and it diminishes dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> So far so nice machine, i noticed a diffrence from the first week.</li>
            <li> Pat dry and apply a good night cream or Argan Oil</li>
            <li> Pat dry and apply a good night cream or Argan Oil</li>
            <li> I feel that when used at night, after first removing most of my makeup with a wipe, using the Pro-X really gets the remaining traces of dirt, grime, and makeup out of my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this system, makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> first I wasn&#x27;t excited about the product, but I have been converted and I do like it.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t excited about the product, but I have been converted and I do like it.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this product would live up to it&#x27;s own description</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this, I figured it either wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough to notice or it would rip my skin off.</li>
            <li> super soft and healthy glow</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprise to see just in 3 days how much this product not only cleared up my completion</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth, soft and scars</li>
            <li> It does clean well the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li> The machine is very comfortable to hold, not too heavy and the surface texture has a nice grip.</li>
            <li> This is a great little machine.</li>
            <li> This is a great little face cleaning tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though on the low settings I am sure it is fine to use on cleansing days.</li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t a professional grade M.D. unit it certainly does a nice job for $25.</li>
            <li> Great powerful little machine</li>
            <li> It is now mostly smooth and much lighter.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my skin smooth and brighter.</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool for making your face ultra smooth and your pores smaller.</li>
            <li> Really helps shrink the pores and makes the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old Neutrogena face scrubber does much better.</li>
            <li> The two different heads are nice.</li>
            <li> The lowest setting gives you nice facial massage.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor, fits in your hand..</li>
            <li> Maybe I have really sensitive skin, but for some reason the longer I used this, the more I broke out.</li>
            <li> Too rough on my skin with the abrasive cream that is included, but the sponge pads feel good.</li>
            <li> So worth the money.  </li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> I did find it fun</li>
            <li> This was worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of exfoliates but the face brush wasn&#x27;t powerful enough for me.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping for powerful exfoliation</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and healthy in years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to report that my initial worries were unfounded.</li>
            <li> these really worth it</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost as the pads</li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I have been using my own facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> But I prefer my own facial soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a week - used it almost every day - just once as a start with the microdermabrasion attachment but with my own natural brand exfoliator (allergies to most big brands)</li>
            <li> and she liked it enough that she ended up taking it home with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue increasing the use all the way up to the recommended frequency and levels and</li>
            <li> it remotely worth spending 5X the amount for the Clairsonic?  </li>
            <li> gave it two stars because the products included are actually quite nice.  </li>
            <li> After one use of this thing with the microdermabrasion pad and crystal polisher, my skin is glowing and fresh.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The only reasons I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars are because it would be nice to have a timer</li>
            <li> Not as powerful and I would expect.  </li>
            <li> and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and was a bit apprehensive about using the microdermabrasion part, but I did so yesterday and really liked how soft and smooth my skin felt afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Works great and my skin likes it, but not everyday and definitely not twice a day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the daily cleanser as I use my own.  </li>
            <li> I have to pay a premium to buy the creams overseas - but still worth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> after a week  I notice that my face look even more clear</li>
            <li> I can actually smile without my face cracking.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and free of dirt afterwards!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> free clean soft renewed !</li>
            <li> Results have been very positive; would recommend for anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> If you want a better clean and a little more softness, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I suggest spending a little more for a much better clean.</li>
            <li> My Clarisonic system was returned to Sephora due to a problem with staying charged and the fact that while I liked using it, at around a cost of $200 it wasn&#x27;t that much, if any, better than using a manual face brush.  </li>
            <li> It is ideal to use the thermal peel, before cleansing and then the thermal peel directly on hyper pigmentation spots every other day if you have oiler skin.</li>
            <li> I had more dirt not less in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after I&#x27;ve done a quick once over wash of face with my hands b/c I wash around my eye area first to get make-up off.</li>
            <li> It breaks out a bit at first because it brings everything to the surface, but clears up quickly.</li>
            <li> It was very smart decision to purchase this kit regarding the price although I rarely use the Microdermabrasion Foam Head and Thermal Crystal Polisher.</li>
            <li> Good quality considering the price when compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> The motorized brush is just the right pressure and speed to not cause damage, but to allow you to get the cleaning/abrasive effect you need.</li>
            <li> The right amount of speeds.</li>
            <li> This should always be stated right off the start.</li>
            <li> Used the scrub and saw a difference right away in flakiness and dullness.</li>
            <li> The price is right, too.  </li>
            <li> It is priced right and includes a cleanser and polisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I try using the product right after i received it</li>
            <li> The bristles are just the right mix of firmness and softness to be just right for your face.</li>
            <li> I think purchasing the Microderm Plus initially is a better investment - paying more in the beginning will save you from becoming quickly disenchanted with the limited 2 speed system and wasting money later when you upgrade to the 3 speed microderm system like I did.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose for me and really does what it should do - clean your face</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose for me and really does what it should do - clean your face</li>
            <li> and I really wanted something to help clean and shrink the pores of my nose.</li>
            <li> I used the microdermabrasion pad for the first time last night and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> The frequency of use is so low for me because my skin is very sensitive and I am not even able to use setting more than one.</li>
            <li> I have very large pores.  </li>
            <li> I did have one small scar from a pimple that has been greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li> I first tried Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion System (which consists of the sponge attachment and microdermabrasion crystals [tube with the blue cap]), I was honestly blown away by the difference it made after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> Does its job, skin feels clean and tight immediately after, love it!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t typically write reviews unless I am really impressed or really disappointed in something, in this case I am impressed.</li>
            <li> There are only two ways to shrink pores, one is to use peptides and be patient while following a healthy berry, fruits and veggies based diet with lots of water or you can conceal them with silicone based products like Loreal Collagen filler (whichdoes keep forehead wrinkles down wonderfully) or Esttee lauder Pore minimizer.</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s option is far more reasonable with regard to both time and cost.  </li>
            <li> Delivered super fast</li>
            <li> It looks smooth and fresh and it feels baby soft.</li>
            <li> I think using it really helps my moisturizer absorb quickly as well.</li>
            <li> The brush has different speed settings which is good for sensitive areas like underneath the eyes.</li>
            <li> And a good rule of thumb is two minutes or less.  </li>
            <li> The Neutrogena one works very well, but I don&#x27;t enjoy having to replace the pads so much.</li>
            <li> I experienced small breakouts for the first time use.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and really like the feel of my skin after I use this with my Olay products.  </li>
            <li> Soft move and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the results of just a few days use of this Product that got online and bought two more and gave one to my daughter and daughter in-law who are in their 30&#x27;s a Kit.</li>
            <li> the small bottles of product are very nice too.  </li>
            <li> my skin jusy feels wonderfully smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Using it twice a week my dry skin has really improved and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Bought this and it shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> I proceeded very, very gently.  </li>
            <li> The price is also very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> There are 3 speeds on this the Olay, and if I need to I just press very gently on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus system is very reasonably priced for all of the benefits the user will receive.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus system is very reasonably priced for all of the benefits the user will receive.</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  </li>
            <li> it does bog down easily when touching the skin.</li>
            <li> Week one: fine, soft skin Midway into week two:</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more powerful but other than that it is great for the price</li>
            <li> I have long nails and the buttons are very easy to push.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this for 2 months now and the brush head still looks new and still running on the original batteries.</li>
            <li> Honestly, let&#x27;s be very real, this device is nothing at all close to microdermabrasion and Olay has stretched their credibility too much to have labeled it with the word microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus system for nearly a month and during this time I have noticed a fresher, smoother looking skin and my pores have minimized substantially plus a huge reduction in acne</li>
            <li> first impression-</li>
            <li> I get better results using my shiseido face brush, didn&#x27;t see any difference with the olay prox and my hair kept getting snagged even when pulled back</li>
            <li> Also when I opened my batter compartment there was some creamy (clear/whitish) stuff that i cleaned out first.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> can with onions and garlic hot breathe in a hole covered in burnt pubic hair from a 500 pound man that has not seen his downstairs in a while let alone washed it.</li>
            <li> I started on the higher setting and then played around with it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I put it in my &amp;#34;weird beauty gadgets&amp;#34; box - not a fail but not something I&#x27;ll use on a routine basis</li>
            <li> box - not a fail but</li>
            <li> I purchased the kit at Target but still wanted to write a review on Amazon since that&#x27;s where many people come to read reviews about various products.</li>
            <li> At first, I was worried if it was water proof</li>
            <li> I love this thing definitely would recommend thing product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Product just as promised - better price than local retailer.</li>
            <li> (that stuff is fabulous for making your skin soft).</li>
            <li> (that stuff is fabulous for making your skin soft).</li>
            <li> The system works pretty well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels like it has had layers of dead skin removed and it&#x27;s bright and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no shill ;-)).</li>
            <li> I first used the microdermabrasion portion of this product.</li>
            <li> so rarely do we ladies get real results-</li>
            <li> so rarely do we ladies get real results-</li>
            <li> I could see a visible difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this product, I felt it did wonders to my skin.</li>
            <li> Will buy again because more than likely it works to well</li>
            <li> I used couple of times and its pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Smooth, soft, after 4 th day even softer&lt;br /&gt;naturel shine.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I finally pulled the plug and bought this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was pretty eager to try it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> decided to try the microdermabrasion first.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am using it for the first time and I am still waiting to see visible results, but I like it.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> FYI - I have light ivory, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference from the first use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else since this is the first cleansing brush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I can notice my skin really improved!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really satisfied for its effect at the same time with its value.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother at her request, she loves this, it is not the first one she has used.</li>
            <li> She likes it except for the red top tube which is I think the microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> The latter solution is mostly temporary.</li>
            <li> First of all, the product comes with inadequate instructions.  </li>
            <li> As battery powered facial cleansing systems go, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I would always reccommend to be sure and read the label to check for possible allergic reactions to any ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> I believe I saw immediate results the morning after my first microdermabrasion treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would probably only cost them about 50 cents more.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $10 more but has an extra faster speed.  </li>
            <li> When I first saw this thing I was unimpressed.</li>
            <li> I compared against higher end companies machines I have purchased.</li>
            <li> This system is pretty foolproof - 2 cleaning heads and 2 cleaning products.  </li>
            <li> The first day I used it</li>
            <li> BUT IT WAS, THE FIRST NIGHT</li>
            <li> especially since I didn&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> do use the different speeds, I  use the lower speed for cheeks and top speed for my T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Using this with regular bar soap and tea tree oil has done more for me that accutane or any over the counter acne medicine.</li>
            <li> I first started using this system, I used the included Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser once a day for around a minute each time (counting to 15 in the chin, each cheek and forehead areas) but soon found that it caused my acne prone skin to breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad it can be used while bathing since the brush will send out tiny drops of water and cleanser around your hair,</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> I use this almost daily and really love it.  </li>
            <li> Used the microdermabrasion/polishing head the first day  -</li>
            <li> and I feel that regular use of the Pro-X system is beginning to help fade the most surface ones slightly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, after using a more powerful cleaner, this is a great disappointment.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I notice my face was brighter and softer, others have notice it as well, saying my face is brighter.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with two different face cleansers to try out with the product</li>
            <li> Thank you Olay for making this wonderful product at an affordable price for those of us that can&#x27;t afford a $200 Clarisonic brush.d difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Not expensive; does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I thought it would give more of an actual microdermabrasion effect.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to keep your hair back.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty noticeable pores around my nose/cheek area</li>
            <li> I saw a difference on my face the first day after using it.</li>
            <li> My sister first got one and said I need to get one.</li>
            <li> My overall skin tone is improving and my pores look slightly more refined.</li>
            <li> To give you a little background, I&#x27;m 38 years old with very sensitive, fair skin that reacts to most anti- aging skin care products</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and clean after i have used it.</li>
            <li> /more even toned and feel like I am at least holding steady with the good fight of aging!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the over 50 crowd (but 50&#x27;s the new 30 right?!)</li>
            <li> My skin tuned out smooth, but not tight.</li>
            <li> The skin stay more soft to the touch and the other products that I use in my face have a better</li>
            <li> Olay Pro-X Advanced System  - two speeds  - single brush - cleaner    Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced   - 3 speeds - foam pad and the brush - cleanser and polisher included</li>
            <li> Very compact and right size fro me.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation speeds are gently, yet efficient and I love how soft and smooth my face and neck felt after only 1 treatment.</li>
            <li> I can see how the sponge is not going to last too long, but the actual device is pretty great!</li>
            <li> the face is a little scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;Washing want to make a more smooth cornering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the more expensive ones are like, but this one is pretty good for the money.</li>
            <li> As I previously owned a Clarisonic Plus face and body system, I&#x27;m familiar with what a mechanical cleansing brush should be able to do.  </li>
            <li> they seem too sharp to me, I found a different- better quality sugar scrub that is effective but still gentle.</li>
            <li> they seem too sharp to me, I found a different- better quality sugar scrub that is effective but still gentle.</li>
            <li> I thought it was great that they take one customer&#x27;s experience so seriously.  </li>
            <li> I used this from two weeks ago, and when this brush is used, my skin seems to be more clean and less greasy.</li>
            <li> I honestly think I&#x27;ve broken out more since using it but any product that gets you to clean your face better more often can&#x27;t be all bad  :)  </li>
            <li> and my skin feels soft &amp; clean after each use.</li>
            <li> However, the stuff does make my face feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Your face really feels and looks better when used REGULARLY</li>
            <li> It &#x27;a good product, similar to the Clarisonic, not equal.</li>
            <li> I recommend going gently and briefly and getting a better quality of crystals than what&#x27;s included with the unit-</li>
            <li> I recommend going gently and briefly and getting a better quality of crystals than what&#x27;s included with the unit-</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointing when all the reviews mentioned how good of a product this was.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this so much, I do not want to go back to manually washing my face ever again.</li>
            <li> If you do not, either the motor will not turn  if you are holding it firmly to your skin, or if you press more lightly it grabs the skin intermittently and skips around.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use my fingers as I could target the areas that need polishing more &amp; I could control how much crystals are needed for specific areas of my face.</li>
            <li> My pores are much cleaner and I am seeing better results from my facial night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This Olay brush is much better than the Pretika, and seems like it will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my daughter told me that this kit is a good budget-friendly substitute for the more expensive Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are cheap too which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> Batteries have lasted for nearly a month and are still going strong while always being used on the high setting</li>
            <li> My dark spots from acne are decreasing more quickly</li>
            <li> but I think it is pretty good  except not very good instruction</li>
            <li> It does clean my face a little better than if I just used my cleanser.</li>
            <li> The idea is really great, the pads are firm, but soft and shaped well, and the product is much like what I use without the gadget.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, yet gentle enough for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so I pretty much knew what I was in for.</li>
            <li> Upon first use, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much for me, it is a piece of foam after all.</li>
            <li> The system does not come with detailed instructions, just a bare bones outline on how to use the microdermabrasion</li>
            <li> Customer service pretty much said &amp;</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a short time, but so far I am happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used creams and cleansers in the past that I paid lots of money for and never got this good of a result with my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am amazed how gentle it is on my face and how soft and clean it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> If your older &amp; looking for that magic wand that&#x27;s going to turn back the hands of time or erase the damage you&#x27;ve done to your skin</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing kit, high quality low price.</li>
            <li> are universal for handle and easily purchased for replacements.</li>
            <li> , infact it made it more dry.</li>
            <li> So nice to have the option of less makeup without being self conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;There are several brands of Microdermabrasion cleansing kits out there, Olay is easy to find.  </li>
            <li> but even on my super sensitive skin, I like to use the highest speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a super busy schedule.</li>
            <li> But honestly, the first few days it seemed like it was..</li>
            <li> But honestly, the first few days it seemed like it was..</li>
            <li> I use setting #3 which is strong enough to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> It has three settings for speed/power, but I always use the highest and it still doesn&#x27;t feel strong enough...</li>
            <li> At 3 weeks I have no new zits and my cystic acne on my chin is gone :)</li>
            <li> Plus over the original Pro-X because the Microderm Plus simply has more options, allowing you to choose between 3 speeds if you want a gentle cleanse, a moderate cleanse, or a deeper exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend for anyone and in fact am buying one for my sister for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and this feels just like the micro at the spa.  </li>
            <li> For the price and ease, I&#x27;d certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I still had residual crystals on certain parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it has a certain glow to it that it did not have before.</li>
            <li> I have problematic skin; acne, wrinkles, dullness, large pores, etc.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is as effective as a professional microdermabrasion session but for home use, this is easy to use and costs a lot less than paying for a professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the ladies or men who want to try something new in your skin care routine this is a must try !!</li>
            <li> The good thing about the bristles is that you can use less of your cleanser because the spinning action builds up bubbles.</li>
            <li> personally like it, it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> It is so large that you can&#x27;t really use it on or around the nose</li>
            <li> The little brush is nice.</li>
            <li> While some reviewers complain that it rotates too slowly or isn&#x27;t otherwise powerful enough I&#x27;ve found that if it were faster or more powerful it would be way too easy to over</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the whole kit!</li>
            <li> I figured it had to be a heck of a lot more powerful than this little guy but</li>
            <li> I bought the original 2 speed version only a short while ago and was loving it, then I came across the Pro-X Microderm Plus featuring 3 speeds and suddenly wished I had found and purchased this one first.</li>
            <li> The cleansers smell great and you only need to use a little for your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> The Olay Pro-X Plus Advanced Cleansing System DOES accomplish the same, very thorough cleansing of all of your pores, with the ease of the dermabrasion brush doing all of the scrubbing &#x27;work&#x27; for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Plus Advanced Cleansing System, unlike the Microdermabrasion System, is gentle enough to be used everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed amazing improvements by the second week.</li>
            <li> It does an ok job of keeping your feeling fresh and exfoliated without harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great until a few days later</li>
            <li> I bought this because I notice my skin has been changing from being soft, young, and problem free....</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I am 30 and have had acne my whole life..</li>
            <li> I have blackheads on my nose that I have struggled with my whole life, and I can even tell those are diminishing.</li>
            <li> Sponge head absolutely does what the description has stated.</li>
            <li> If you really want a power brush, I suggest saving your money, doing your research and buying a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Very pleased because I&#x27;ve had scrubbers in the past</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> I really have seen an improvement in my complexion and would reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The rest of the time I use a gentle face wash on the brush.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> No directions came with the purchase and the amount of product was very discouraging.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t mind it..</li>
            <li> I realized I really got jipped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> made a big difference on my skin, pimples are gone and my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> Does not seem like it can really do much for skin.,</li>
            <li> Really cleaned my face and made it so much brighter.</li>
            <li> She really likes hers.</li>
            <li> very good,if shipping can be faster</li>
            <li> I really like my kit</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure it doesn&#x27;t tug as much.</li>
            <li> but after I use it (and use it only twice a week) my face is smooth, and I notice my moisturizer, face serum, and makeup go on smoother and applies easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and haven&#x27;t seen much difference</li>
            <li> Started to notice my skin was much softer after a week of using it.</li>
            <li> It has really help her skin.</li>
            <li> But, if I put on too much moisturizer, my pores get clogged.  </li>
            <li> So having the tool is a real bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to make it fit properly?</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> and I really notice the difference.</li>
            <li> and I really do like it.  </li>
            <li> I can really see the improvement in how my face</li>
            <li> kit also comes with a \\&quot;Plus Advanced Cleansing System,\\&quot; which consists of the brush attachment and cleanser [tube with the red cap].</li>
            <li> The cleanser works very well to remove dirt and grime from my face without overdrying.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed by what one use did to my pores.</li>
            <li> Personally, I am a devoted user of my Mia, and have been overall happy enough with it to not go looking for additional \\&quot;face brushes\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the reviewers who are saying this device does something.  </li>
            <li> A washcloth or scrubby sponge for your face does as much</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I called and asked for a partial credit as I saw this product for a very similar price at a retailer but it included two huge included (free) tubes of the cleaners~!</li>
            <li> I really did see and feel the difference of my face after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped to 3 stars- since the price is low, even with light use</li>
            <li> my unit did not last (it often sat on the shelf for months at a time with no use, so when I say my use was light-</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 star because I really wanted the scrubby brush to be a bit firmer.  </li>
            <li> I get really flaky skin on my nose in the winter</li>
            <li> Not so much.  </li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Pro-Microdermabrasion very night.  </li>
            <li> you feel much</li>
            <li> you feel much</li>
            <li> Says its gentle but thorough in cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Really see no improvement</li>
            <li> IT REALLY</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The machine work fast  with 3 speed  </li>
            <li> I really like all these products and will buy this kit as soon as mine is gone</li>
            <li> Reasonable price</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much, in fact based on all description</li>
            <li> I like something that really works.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviewers stating that this didn&#x27;t work for them, and I really believe that they aren&#x27;t using it correctly, or maybe its just me.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it very often and would probably have returned it if I could.  </li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> She really enjoys the feeling her face has after using it.</li>
            <li> Cleans really well and removes all makeup.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, I really don&#x27;t know if it works yet</li>
            <li> While I know I won&#x27;t recapture my youth, and genuinely don&#x27;t want to, this cleaning system is terrific.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, works very well.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Ok but not very powerfu</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> For starters, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans my skin as much as it pulls, stretches and twists my skin while the brush or sponge is spinning around.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this - and I think I would have except the lack of power to the unit on batteries.  </li>
            <li> Cleansing Brush Head makes washing your face much easier and efficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The polisher attachment doesn&#x27;t seem to provide much stimulation, even when used with the polishing cream.</li>
            <li> many on here I&#x27;m not ready to invest in a Clarisonic but will eventually.</li>
            <li> Just massage around gently with your finger tips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended, but be careful. :)</li>
            <li> I really like the concept of having EVERYTHING you need in this kit when you bring it home.  </li>
            <li> So I ended up returning the Mia after 3 months or so because I didn&#x27;t see that much difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;ll be too fast and irritating&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like the system.  </li>
            <li> supr value!buy 2,1 for free.&lt;br /&gt;express is very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> , i really slather it on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like so much....</li>
            <li> The rotating brush turns very very slowly on fast.</li>
            <li> Will probably try their products eventually, and if I really like them I will update.</li>
            <li> It is an absolute steal at the price.</li>
            <li> Not seeing any real improvement.</li>
            <li> helps my skin so much.</li>
            <li> As an aside, applying vitamin C or alpha hydroxy serums is a real treat after microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> Overall, since using this my skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my skin, used as directed for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> As for the microdermabrasion, it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> This has helped me so much with my acne.</li>
            <li> Really well priced and it works very well.</li>
            <li> So Thanks Oly Pro-X.</li>
            <li> I can really feel and see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It rinses off well just standing at the sink, because let&#x27;s be honest...who wants to do this in the shower?</li>
            <li> I really like that product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a couple months now and my pores look smaller and not as clogged and my skin is smooth.</li>
            <li> gently massage on face for 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle brush</li>
            <li> Instead, the price point is something that I can afford to keep doing as the cost of the refills are reasonable.</li>
            <li> *  two Duracell batteries (which I really like, since you don&#x27;t have to worry about re-charging it)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am convinced that a brush any rougher would be too much.</li>
            <li> she is very statisfied this gift</li>
            <li> Works really well with my pores and I could already see the results in just after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> i will really avoid that area from now on.</li>
            <li> I really look forward to the morning and evening cleansing sessions.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t have to use as much as I do if I apply it on the head of the brush.</li>
            <li> I really like the thermal crystal wash</li>
            <li> feel that this product has really enhanced the look, feel and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> for a gentle morning exfoliation - pre toner, moisturizer, and makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it feels to put on your face.  </li>
            <li> It may be the regimen as a whole</li>
            <li> Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the pad which is much nicer than the brushes for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had just bought a Clairsonic, but I felt t it vibrated way too much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it as much as I did my Neutrogena .</li>
            <li> Thanks olay, looking forward to improved versions.</li>
            <li> My girls have a very even skin tone and both look so refreshed and neither wear liquid makeup or powder now</li>
            <li> I really hope this review helps someone else make their choice in trying this product.</li>
            <li> It does work for me very well.</li>
            <li> and you can adjust how much pressure you apply to your affected area.</li>
            <li> recommend really.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and is much clearer.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> it really helps exfoliate and my sun damage/dark spots seem to be disappearing faster.</li>
            <li> I had to throw away the whole device plus my rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> : The product arrived as promised, the whole process was fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> Can not believe how much cleaner my face looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> Has really helped with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for face cleaning, but not much else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my skin, and it feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I like it so much,</li>
            <li> I really really like it</li>
            <li> I have to say that I really like the way my skin feels after I have used the microdermabrasion cream/grit.</li>
            <li> my face really need this product.</li>
            <li> really like using this tickly thing on my face.</li>
            <li> I wasnt expecting too much of this, but actually i really like this product.</li>
            <li> Recommended highly!</li>
            <li> It visibly removed so much of my makeup and left my skin feeling super clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing this kit because I liked that it was a simple white color for one</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a facial cleansing system, this is a nice one to get, especially since it comes with themicrodermabrasion buffer, too!microdermabrasion buffer, too!</li>
            <li> This microdermabrasion system works just as well as the more expensive brand that I also own.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it does make your skin feel very smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> my skin looks much better after only one use, and by &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; I mean that the fine lines around my mouth and on my chest are significantly diminished.</li>
            <li> and I can happily say my face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in the past 6 months!</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for deep cleaning my face and leaves you with a very clean feel, but personally, I find the bristles a bit harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> and wow!!!</li>
            <li> The cleansing wash is okay, a pretty typical exfoliating cleanser</li>
            <li> I mean very light); original review follows....</li>
            <li> Love the results &amp; love the fact that it does as good if not better than than the expensive Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because, in my older age (50+) my skin is not tight and firm as it used to be, but stretching my skin like that can&#x27;t be good for the wrinkles that are already there.  </li>
            <li> - the cleansing head makes you feel like you are really getting your skin clean, but it&#x27;s really no different than a wash cloth</li>
            <li> Then that leaves the flat sponge type head to put the polisher on, sort of like a light sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> Well, last week at the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale I got the original Mia Clarisonic for $79.</li>
            <li> Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth with this product!</li>
            <li> actually was considering the original Olay Pro-X brush (the one with 2 speeds), but ended up getting this one.  </li>
            <li> Back this up by eating foods rich in them as a way of life</li>
            <li> Back this up by eating foods rich in them as a way of life</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the Clairisonic, but its better than any other kit I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find it any better than baking soda or any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation brushes are a joke and may best work with somebody with minor exfoliation needs and very delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> After reading numerous positive reviews and hearing this is just as good as more expensive brands, I had to try it.</li>
            <li> but the microdermabrasion takes it to a whole new level!</li>
            <li> This does not have enough power to work and clean like you would expect.</li>
            <li> I needed something to help me deep clean my face.</li>
            <li> my skin was all white and glowing and clean, my husband when he returned from work</li>
            <li> and i see changes on my face and feel it do the job, deep clean the pores and skin.</li>
            <li> The red stuff didn&#x27;t really clean my face</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a different cleanser to get a deeper clean, however.</li>
            <li> Now, this isn&#x27;t a separate system from the normal Pro-X; the Microdermabrasion aspect comes in the form of an additional \\&quot;brush\\&quot; for the the Pro-X--more like a cotton round, really--as well as their own cleansing crystal</li>
            <li> first I thought the extra head - which looks like a foam disc, was just an excuse to charge more because it doesn&#x27;t really look like it&#x27;s going to do much</li>
            <li> Nice little brush for the price!</li>
            <li> My skin feel much better, less oily especially at my T-zone, and my skin is very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Obviously everybody has different skin types and will react differently to products, but I feel good about recommending this system to people with normal skin or skin that is similar to my own that I&#x27;ve described above.</li>
            <li> I really feel that with long term use my fine lines will be less noticeable and feel that this will help to reduce more lines.</li>
            <li> Does not clean very well because it really doesn&#x27;t do any more than manual cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the second kit I have purchased because my sister tried the first one I had ordered right before her Christmas visit</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it very long, but so far I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> This is just as good and less than a third of the price.  </li>
            <li> My face was a bit red when I finished, but some soothing lotion helped calm it back down, and I was left with a nice healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> Within the first week we already noticed the acne clear up.</li>
            <li> I think my face needed to adjust because it&#x27;s been pretty clear ever since.</li>
            <li> It gave her more dark spots.</li>
            <li> the size is nice and small</li>
            <li> I use the more intense 3rd setting at night either with the micoderm pad and thermal cleanser or the brush, after removing makeup with a wipe, prior to night</li>
            <li> This was a purchase for my wife to replace a competitor&#x27;s faulty unit that was replaced 3 times and is currently being RMA&#x27;d for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the plus side - It is good as tool to deep cleanse your face with the wash pad - and I use it as a simple deep cleanser -</li>
            <li> use my own cleansers, I prefer to wet my face with cleanser first, and place the brush on dry</li>
            <li> brush is a little soft but its still effective</li>
            <li> my new must have!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy especially when it&#x27;s the same price like the original Pro-X in stores except it</li>
            <li> I wanted to try some advanced cleansing system from a very long time and when i saw the deal for Olay Pro-X</li>
            <li> I think this product helps my moisturizer work more efficiently, and I use less.</li>
            <li> easy to use and not much</li>
            <li> paying only 5$ more to get both systems of &amp;#34;microdermabrasion&amp;#34; and facial scrub brush.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace an older one.</li>
            <li> In this case, it is the &#x27;Olay Professional Promise,&#x27; your guaranteed satisfaction with their Pro-X Advanced System or your money back.  </li>
            <li> It left my face soft and smooth with a washcloth, however.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a mild facial cleanser along with the microderm crystal-cleansers that are included.</li>
            <li> the freckles made me look and now that I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> This is a decent cheaper alternative to Clarisonic (which will cost about $125).</li>
            <li> My skin definitely glows more now that I&#x27;ve properly exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> (I used to think physical spinning was the poor-man&#x27;s version of the sonic motion, but I personally like the spinning motion better).  </li>
            <li> I bought this and only was able to use it once or twice and simply just doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> For the most part she only uses the regular brush head and doesn&#x27;t use the microdermabrasion too often.</li>
            <li> I am also considering using a mild cleanser like Simple, instead of the Olay cleansers to be gentler on my skin.</li>
            <li> After just one use I was amazed at how vibrant my skin looked.  </li>
            <li> The older brush had two settings where this one has three.</li>
            <li> I have tender skin, but weekly microdermabrasion at the high speed, pad and microdermabrasion crystals have left my skin really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> do it and really irritate my face- too much power and in seconds you&#x27;ve irritated your skin- at least for me with a fair (blonde) complexion.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The high speed is not that abrasive either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the settings as instructed--only using the high setting 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> hopes were extremely high.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would buy again, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great price for a microdermabrasion tool - removes my makeup well at night everyday.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run fast enough or strong enough to accomplish anything.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is just more sensitive due to pregnancy??</li>
            <li> I would recommend the use of a good night cream after using the pro-X because the skin could feel a bit raw initially.</li>
            <li> May invest in the more expensive one in the future based on how much I love this product!</li>
            <li> As a woman who wears makeup on a daily basis, this is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I will pay a little more to get some durability-</li>
            <li> the Clairsonic perform a little better than this?  </li>
            <li> my face is already soft from the cleanser!!</li>
            <li> I do wish there was a little more cleanser and polisher.</li>
            <li> Blemishes/ache are gone, face is soft and clean and overall</li>
            <li> Blemishes/ache are gone, face is soft and clean and overall</li>
            <li> YOU FEEL SUCH SOFT CLEAN SKIN AFTERWARDS .</li>
            <li> The brush is also way too soft for a deep clean.</li>
            <li> My serum is absorbing much more completely and I am going to waste less of it and get better results.</li>
            <li> Though the Pro-X 2 speed worked fine and improved the texture of my skin, I didn&#x27;t feel like 2 speeds was really doing enough for a really deep cleanse.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, the fragrance is lovely, it isn&#x27;t harsh on my fairly sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to use.  </li>
            <li> feel it long specially if you want to use it every day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and you notice how clean your skin is right after use.</li>
            <li> It almost felt like I was rubbing concrete on my face,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always exfoliated with a cheap white sponge and went straight back to it after using this thing once.  </li>
            <li> My Dr couldnt believe it when I told her how old I really am.</li>
            <li> Expected this product to have a stronger brush action...feels so light on the face.</li>
            <li> Plus the cleansing pad is so soft it really doesn&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li> after using the system for 3 weeks now, her skin is much smoother and clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s really gentle</li>
            <li> I normally don’t write reviews on products, but I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing just how improved my skin will be after a few more weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> I looked into a few Clarisonic brushes but yli couldn&#x27;t imagine the results being better than what they were.</li>
            <li> humid (so I wouldn&#x27;t normally need much moisturizing, but even with the natural conditioning, my skin feels softer and smoother with this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I use my own cleanser instead of the one that came with it (it left my face feeling oily) but the microdermabrasion (step 2, blue &amp; white tube) works wonders!</li>
            <li> On the first try, I didn&#x27;t really notice anything too different.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth giving this a try.bought a tube of the \\&quot;thermal crystal polisher\\&quot; that seems to be the same thing that is included in the kit</li>
            <li> For instance the sponge needs to be remoistened frequently to maintain proper lubrication, and the appropriate pressure to apply is not necessarily intuitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this item once and think it&#x27;s worth the price since you receive two tubes of cleaners and two brushes for the different type of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Now I use it at night with my normal cleanser and follow up with moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> After a few days of using this, I told my husband I thought my skin looked better</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not quite sure how long it is going to last.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend you buy this product, it’s worth it.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t get acne, but I do get blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> As I entered my late twenties, my skin got a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> I figure that the brush itself does the exfoliating, and I don&#x27;t want to waste my money buying more of that cleanser.  </li>
            <li> so far.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a professional for skin but feeling much better than regular brush style cleaner.</li>
            <li> The highest setting is still pretty slow but more gentile then the Clairisonic.</li>
            <li> The included cleansers, however, are nice, if not amazing.  </li>
            <li> I really like this little unit; it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> The brush head is smaller than I thought it would be, and the brissles are super soft.</li>
            <li> but I definitely needed something that would be more aggressive in treatment of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Let me preface my review by explaining my skincare situation, I have very fair skin and any and all sun exposure gives me dark sun spots (we&#x27;re talking chocolate chips here) and my skin over the years has developed a thick layer of sun spots over the bridge of my nose and across the high part of my cheeks just under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Good investement, especially in comparison to more expensive products!</li>
            <li> This is not a high end model, but is suffice to allow you to get a thorough clean as part of your cleansing routine.  </li>
            <li> They have a nice smell, and leave me with a clean feeling (although as with any crystal microdermabrasion cleanser, be extra careful to fully rinse off any residual crystals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different speeds as well, which was new for me (the Mia only has one).  </li>
            <li> I think it works but it needs time and the right facial wash .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day because my skin is super sensitive and has to be phased into using a new face wash.</li>
            <li> But then it refused to turn on right after I installed new batteries only moments before.</li>
            <li> Maybe there are other factors, but I find my skin type to be more normal now, no dry skin, and breakouts are practically gone.</li>
            <li> I received this product a little over a week ago and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Clarisonic Mia for about three years, but wanted to try out this new Olay system since I was intrigued by the idea of the microdermabrasion head.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this contraption.</li>
            <li> I tried new batteries and everything and never got it to turn on again.</li>
            <li> Anyway, with the new acne, came new acne scars.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product for busy women who don&#x27;t usually have time to get frequent facials, plus it&#x27;s much cheaper :-)</li>
            <li> yesterday I felt confident enough to go out with my hair up and minimal make up.</li>
            <li> I have a soft $25 Shiseido brush and Sephora&#x27;s $7 brush that&#x27;s a bit firm, and they do a much better job than this Olay system.  </li>
            <li> Most exfoliating products tend to feel too abrasive to me but this offers a few options for speed.  </li>
            <li> but they both love it and said it has really helped their skin to be smoother, less breakouts and overall softer and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> happen to come across Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System kit and because I personally use Olay moisturizing facial creams/products, I personally felt comfortable researching about this facial brush...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit comes with two \\&quot;heads\\&quot;--a smooth one for microdermabrasion, and a brush for regular cleaning--plus two sample-sized (tiny) tubes of cleanser and</li>
            <li> I really like it, but the microderm attachment doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely nowhere near as powerful as I imagined</li>
            <li> I get better results with a rough facial cloth.</li>
            <li> The two (2) attachments are quite small and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and almost never try new products.</li>
            <li> If you leave even a tiny whisp of hair loose, it can wind clear up to your scalp before you are able to turn the thing off.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li> , my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with results</li>
            <li> I can use it once in few months but not as a regular cleansing system as i can relate it more to a pedicure where rigourous cleaning removes all the dead cells from your feet, and i dont want that kind of cleaning on my face on a regular basis apart from facials made with gentle hand strokes.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve had success with the Olay Advanced Cleaning brush, I initially felt a little hesitation to use the microdermabrasion head and accompanying thermal crystal cleanser.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the kind of difference I was expecting there is only very slight brightening of the skin.</li>
            <li> I have a few fine lines on my forehead in particular.</li>
            <li> The only down side is if you want to go pick up a new microderm wash you really gotta look because most places don&#x27;t carry it (or at least we haven&#x27;t found many in San Diego)</li>
            <li> this is my first rotating facial scrubber.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to wait for results and if it lightens up my age spots, I&#x27;ll report back in a six (or sooner) months.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised that after 4 weeks of use my skin is noticeably brighter, smoother, and clearer!</li>
            <li> in the past and have been quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Naturally I jumped at the opportunity to try this Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion kit and it does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, I only cleansed my skin, I didn&#x27;t exfoliate.</li>
            <li> wondered why the first use showed wonders and realized it was so because I hadnt had a facial in over 4 months.</li>
            <li> Once I was in bed, I noticed my cheeks felt SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have bought, I am sure I had the other one for 10 years, I use this one twice a day, I use another brand of cleanser.</li>
            <li> used it for the first time last night...and believe it or not I saw results!  </li>
            <li> This system is ok, size of cleaning brushes and sponges is quite small.</li>
            <li> There were red patches on my face after using the thermal scrub for the first time.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and has cleared up!</li>
            <li> and I have seen so many improvements in my skin for example no more pimple break out</li>
            <li> I had a red half-circle mark on my forehead which is the first area I washed.</li>
            <li> The included tubes of scrubs are really small and won&#x27;t last you long, but the machine is great.  </li>
            <li> but I actually do, I use it every night and my face is starting to feel and look more even, not instant results</li>
            <li> one differs from the original Oil of Olay, in that it has 3 speeds, so it can simply be used as a facial cleaner....</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> First off, the brush head was a bit brown after using it so you can actually see all the gunk it is taking out of your pores.</li>
            <li> but you can use it for a little while until you can afford paying strong one</li>
            <li> last if you clean them properly.</li>
            <li> Advanced daily cleansing gentle enough for daily use on days when microdermabrasion treatment not used.</li>
            <li> Your fingers will do just as good a job as long as you do a thorough cleansing (double cleanse) &amp; your procedure is long enough.</li>
            <li> It was well liked that we had to go back and purchase a second one for our other daughter.</li>
            <li> so naturally it was like a clean up and the whole brushing removed the dead cells off of my face</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the brush catching my pulled back hair, but the foam pad easily snagged and pulled small wisps each time I used it.  </li>
            <li> As far as the little machine is concerned, it&#x27;s not as strong as I thought it might be</li>
            <li> Even pressing a bit more than what we users think is moderate and the spin slows down.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough for everyday and makes my face feel so clean!</li>
            <li> The first speed doesn&#x27;t do much for me, I like the second with the brush and cleanser for daily use.</li>
            <li> That actually worked better, and less abrasive to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suggest either buying more of the red stuff or some other facial wash right away because the sample does not last long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wondering whether the brush would be strong enough with only 2 double A batteries</li>
            <li> I use Cetaphil as a cleanser and pure Argan Oil as my only type of lotion/moisturizer (I get mine off of Amazon...</li>
            <li> so no need to scrub too hard :-)</li>
            <li> I feel like I get a better microdermabrasion scrub from washing my face hard with a rag and an exfoliating</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush system after carefully reviewing this brush set against other face cleaning  system,  I must admit I love this system I uses it every other day to clean my face</li>
            <li> It’s been a week and my face is completely clear.</li>
            <li> Facial brushes are soft and reasonably priced on Subscribe and Save.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so clear</li>
            <li> I can see a clear difference in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had treated myself to a couple of salon facials but they were expensive and the effects were great but only temporary.  </li>
            <li> Rinse your face with clear water.</li>
            <li> So far so go</li>
            <li> so it make it soft from the spong</li>
            <li> People saying it&#x27;s prone to skin probably use this too frequent at speed 2 or 3.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend money on the pricey alternatives - this, so far, has done the job.  </li>
            <li> Been using this as soon as i got it.and,  so far so good,looking forward to see results on my skin soon.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel really soft after I use it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m the type of person who like clear and concise direction</li>
            <li> My skin does feel really soft after I use it</li>
            <li> But so far it&#x27;s been working.</li>
            <li> The Olay brushes seen way too soft and I just don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting anything I wouldn&#x27;t without it.</li>
            <li> well, I can&#x27;t see much use for level 1, but I guess that&#x27;s a personal thing.</li>
            <li> Thermal heat gel with the soft brush removed dirt and cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> The crystals are warming and when used with the sponge brush its made my skin smoother and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I felt that the brush stretched my skin when rotating.</li>
            <li> After using this once your skin feels so much softer and after a week definitely can feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin didn&#x27;t have any reactions or breakouts.</li>
            <li> the difference between my neck and face made it look like I must have had a facelift- 80 year old neck and 50 year old face.</li>
            <li> I just keep it in the shower and use it gently and briefly</li>
            <li> I used Oil of Olay complete all day moisture cream for sensitive skin after.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the effectiveness because even though I have never used a Clairsonic</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> SHE LOVES THE WAY IT TAKES OFF THE OLD SKIN AND MAKES HER FACE FEEL REFRESHED</li>
            <li> but you also don&#x27;t want to tear up your skin either (for those who have sensitive</li>
            <li> but you also don&#x27;t want to tear up your skin either (for those who have sensitive</li>
            <li> i developed pimples after using it.</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a week but with my own cleanser because the Renewal cleanser left a film on my face that raised some bumps and my face itched like maybe I&#x27;m sensitive to something in</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s almost 2 years old now</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s almost 2 years old now</li>
            <li> I have a couple of scars from old blemishes that need to go away anyway.</li>
            <li> She has used it a couple of times so far</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much smoother and definitely evening it out a bit.</li>
            <li> I have always been self conscious about youthful</li>
            <li> I will use the cleanser head with my Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Gel Cleanser instead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Soft.&lt;br /&gt;Haeyagetda frequently.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old, and I consider my skin tone as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a complete piece of GARBAGE.  </li>
            <li> Used this one time so far, and I like it alot.</li>
            <li> and my skin really did not seem different.</li>
            <li> Oh well, moving on but so far this works like a charm u just have to invest your time doing it.</li>
            <li> With daily use of this product my skin is much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than using only my fingers to wash my face.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are soft.  </li>
            <li> i never realized how much makeup was left on my face until i started using this.</li>
            <li> the one time I used it directly.</li>
            <li> This one has a three speed rotary action.  </li>
            <li> (I have very flaky skin, especially in the winter, when I use Retin-A).  </li>
            <li> and so far nothing has happened.  </li>
            <li> So far, the Pro-X hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I know some people mentioned that that can happen, but so far I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far, I have been using this a month</li>
            <li> I do not use the products inside, I use professional products instead.</li>
            <li> Her sensitive skin is always an issue but this device does not bother her.  </li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> Makes cleansing easier for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult onset acne and have combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush twice a week and dermabrasion once in ten days followed by an intense hydration mask.</li>
            <li> After I used the microdermabrasion head and product my skin was sensitive for a day.  </li>
            <li> Used and pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Actually even without microdermabrasion applying anti-oxidants to your face after a thorough cleanse is very beneficial.</li>
            <li> Actually even without microdermabrasion applying anti-oxidants to your face after a thorough cleanse is very beneficial.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use a soft sponge and some dove soap.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have been using a sonic brush (another brand) for a year</li>
            <li> Not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has even commented on how soft my face</li>
            <li> brush feels delicately soft in use with the red-capped wash.</li>
            <li> far I have done the microdermabrasion treatment 2x per week</li>
            <li> Speed 2 is the Daily Deep Cleansing Speed that that is meant to be used with the regular brush head; it supposedly cleans 600% better than regular cleansing&lt;br</li>
            <li> I broke out directly in my T zone.  </li>
            <li> Really makes a difference in the bumps that build up on aging skin, especially at the end of summer.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> MY 15 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER ASKED FOR THIS FOR CHRISTMAS.  </li>
            <li> Soft skin after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon is by far the cheapest supplier that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has anything to do with it, but I began using the Oil Cleansing Method around the same time I started to break out, but even the reviews of OCM users didn&#x27;t mention your skin breaking out THAT much</li>
            <li> I thought it would be rougher on my face, so I was surprised at how soft it felt.</li>
            <li> She has avoided these because she has sensitive skin, but after feeling how soft that brush is</li>
            <li> But if you like a spinning soft brush on the face or a spinning soft sponge, than by all means, go ahead and try it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that you could find the same thing for much cheaper at any drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I use on the highest setting unless I&#x27;m around sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy feel but soft natural skin.</li>
            <li> I plan on using every week and get a professional microdermabrasion quarterly.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks in my moisturizer now, and has become so soft.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it would make that much of a difference over regular washing!</li>
            <li> It has three speed settings, although the only I really use is the fastest one.</li>
            <li> It has a bristle and soft buffing pad.</li>
            <li> I think it is making my 51 year old skin look refreshed.  </li>
            <li> This product gets the job done, but is not as powerful as I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I cannot offer many reviews of olay products as the anti-aging line is too thick for me</li>
            <li> but I do use other facial products and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> mirror etc., leaving a mess to clean up after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first week of course I had a few new breakouts which is normal for me when I start any new regimine on my skin, but now my skin has cleared up and isn&#x27;t irritated at all from this</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that is either really oily or really dry (especially around the upper lip and nose when I use Retin-A and Tazorac cream for my acne/wrinkles).  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, I did feel that my face was clean, and it also felt a bit tight afterwards.</li>
            <li> My face felt clean without being tight.</li>
            <li> , it picks up a lot of leftover makeup and makes your skin feel clean and tight.</li>
            <li> since used up the entire tube of thermal exfoliating cream and my face is so smooth and my pores are hard to see and once I apply a bit of foundation they pretty much disappear entirely.</li>
            <li> Normal facial cleansers I use leave my face smooth but feeling tight</li>
            <li> As a 30-something still dealing with mild breakouts and dark spots, I was worried this would irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Tubes aren&#x27;t even half full.</li>
            <li> I have heard great reviews on this cleaning system and I was a little skeptical at first, but I don&#x27;t regret purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 with pretty good skin; some hormonal acne on my chin from time to time and a few lines when I smile, nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li> I would much rather have higher speed rpm&#x27;s than these slow speeds which completely stop the unit from rotating if too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> I notice less blemishes on my skin and my face is super soft</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the package and the item itself, its just a little bit of trouble i ve got when i was trying to put in the batteries.</li>
            <li> Be careful on first use that you don&#x27;t over do it or you will be sensitive.</li>
            <li> I usually wipe my makeup off with the makeup removers, but this definitely helped even more.</li>
            <li> Two or three times a week using this cleaning system is more than enough, followed by regular daily facial washing&#x27;s and once a week facial mask.</li>
            <li> At first I was only getting this as a back up and travel exfoliating machine.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how much better another brand could be, because I have seen a total transformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have acne, but my main problem is blackheads and white heads around my chin.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not picky about color), most importantly this facial brush only takes 2-AA batteries as opposed to the other facial brushes that require 4-AA batteries (which I think is just ridiculous considering that batteries alone are not cheap themselves) anything that takes more than 2-AA batteries should be a charger based device, I think.</li>
            <li> My dark spots have faded a little and now my skin looks fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I could see with extended use this improving skin appearance, not a bad little cleaner over all for the price..</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I use the Olay Active Hydrating Cream Original Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was back in high school.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know why this product has such high reviews.</li>
            <li> the only downside I&#x27;d say is that the foam head is hard to get completely clean, but I know they sell replacements, and honestly for something that is taking off dead skin, it should be replaced regularly anyways.</li>
            <li> The new Olay system has a third faster speed that combines with a soft spongy pad to give you a microdermabrasion treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have major blackhead problem &amp; with this product I can control my skin!</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t find myself really using this feature too much, as I found the faster speeds to feel even less thorough than the slower ones.  </li>
            <li> I have adult acne and was using an acne product daily on my nose to reduce the pore size and on the occasional break outs--I have stopped using the acne product about 4 weeks ago as the micordermabrasion product is really working.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you don&#x27;t have money for the more expensive one or if you are like me and have never tried an expensive face cleansing machine.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any miracles with lines or wrinkles yet but haven&#x27;t used it that long and really don&#x27;t expect any miracles.</li>
            <li> Worth the money but not worth a hundred and some dollars</li>
            <li> I first wet my skin and then applied the crystals which made for an easier application of the crystals on my face.</li>
            <li> When used in combination with the foam pad, I feel a lot of drag on my skin, and it feels like it gets hot.</li>
            <li> for all the reviews that compare this to the more expensive clarisonic, it makes me glad that i didn&#x27;t waste any money on that.</li>
            <li> First product Ive used, so not much to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> Getting a few white heads means I can just brush them away and my dab of clearsil advanced which works in one night not a huge application applied for a week over skin not truly clean.</li>
            <li> Expected something with a little more power &amp; effect.</li>
            <li> I should of spent a little more to get a clarsonic.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this too long and have yet to use the samples because I bought another facial product to use, overall I really enjoy this facial scrubber.</li>
            <li> Prior to getting this kit, I had an earlier version of the same basic product, which came with a two-speed version of the microdermabrasion tool, with the brush head and a full size tube of the exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> It works well but not as big and as powerful as I expected.</li>
            <li> After seeing more expensive options I decided to try Olay since it was much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I find using the brush for my daily 2nd cleansing routine very helpful.</li>
            <li> Like getting a facial at a salon only so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much gunk was left on my face - very gross.</li>
            <li> Found it for half the price on Amazon so, if you want a fresh start for your skin this year, give this system a try.</li>
            <li> Speed 1 is the Daily Gentle Cleansing Speed that is meant to be used with the regular brush head</li>
            <li> I suspect the results are due in large part to the electric powered abrasive action (as opposed to applying the microdermabrasion crystals by hand).</li>
            <li> works fine, but hard to manage</li>
            <li> However, other companies cleansers are priced even higher.</li>
            <li> But even with this frequency, I have noticed major difference.</li>
            <li> It does indeed clean deep down, much deeper expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35, asian, have sensitive skin that borders on either being really oily or really dry.  </li>
            <li> hope that by doing this lighter, more frequent treatment I can get similar if not better results to what I expected from the professional microdermabrasion at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> a home glycolic peel gone awry plus some mild acne scarring and very slight sagging around my lower mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Professional microdermabrasian has a reputation for leaving skin raw, so I expected something MORE when I used this...</li>
            <li> The power is average and the cleaning is a little better than just putting cleanser on your face.  </li>
            <li> As for eyes, Clarisonic makes an applicator with sonic technology called Black Opal that is for use around the delicate eye are and is very pricey, Michael Todd organics eye sonic is half the price and actually as good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin from only using it in the past week.</li>
            <li> but if this helps at least one person - that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t sustain a corneal injury it could easily have caused a serious injury.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would clear my acne and not irritated my skin, i only used the device it did what it was supposed too do.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bristles on the brush are too soft and there are no alternative brush heads available.</li>
            <li> but it has been clear for years with the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> my skin is much softer than with hand wshing alone bit just not what i expected.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy this not really expecting a whole lot.</li>
            <li> The Olay brush has a different method of action than the Clarisonic line.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product, and it wasn&#x27;t expensive (at least, not in my opinion, I&#x27;ve eaten out at restaurants that cost more than this), so I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a second system for my 22 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> soft bristle face brush, from Big Lots of all places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the olay pro x for a week, but so far I can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> An even bigger difference is my neck area around the crease: my neck was looking like what one would expect on an 80 year old-</li>
            <li> As a face cleaner, it gets deep into pores and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> wand has 3 speeds: one for gentle cleansing (with facial cleansing brush), one for deep cleansing (with facial cleansing brush), and one for microdermabrasion (with microdermabraision foam head).  </li>
            <li> The vibration on the Clarisonic didn&#x27;t do anything for me, but my skin is only slightly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this device faithfully for two weeks (using the brush daily and the foam head twice a week), and all I can say is wow.</li>
            <li> I compared the cleanliness of my face after washing with a wash cloth, after just washing using my bare hands with cleanser and water, and the Olay Pro-X.</li>
            <li> I have old red acne spots and scarring, and this has improved those issues.</li>
            <li> Even with my 10x magnification mirror the pores around my nose are barely visible, and I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of products before with no results in that area.</li>
            <li> I normally use it at 2nd to 3rd speed depending where I use it on my face</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse than the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> also like a company that, these days, makes a product they are confident in and stand behind.  </li>
            <li> Many have commented about it pulling the thin skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Olay kit that only has one head attachment and a small tube of the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser (red and white tube) and didn&#x27;t like the cleanser but loved the exfoliating tool that came with it.</li>
            <li> It actually hit me in the open eye twice before I quit trying new strategies.  </li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and used it right out of the box.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely acne prone and I only noticed that it broke me out for the first couple of days.</li>
            <li> Also, the tubes of product are super small</li>
            <li> Besides being lighter and smaller, if I loose it I wouldn&#x27;t care as much.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have that much room in the bathroom to keep all this plus my other toiletries.</li>
            <li> I have been using for close to a month, I really cannot tell a difference from any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> I have found that I can use it to get into the areas of my face that are hard to get to and clean (between the nose and checks).</li>
            <li> Last, but not least, for daily use, you can interchange the gentle cleansing brushes included with the previous &#x27;Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle Protocol System.</li>
            <li> I find that even on the highest setting the scrub brush is VERY gentle on the face which at first annoyed me</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old african american woman also.</li>
            <li> but would be useful for those delicate or sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the bristle is quite effective but the microdermabrasion part of this product is almost useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially I was a bit concerned about the grittiness of the microdermabrasion product, I use just a little bit and like the exfoliating cleanser, I apply the microdermabrasion product first with my finger tips and then use the wand with the foam pad.  </li>
            <li> But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
            <li> I was excited about purchasing this product as my skin had begun to show the signs of aging (I am 40 yrs) like dull skin, dark spots, fine lines and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Obviously you&#x27;re not going to get the same results as going to the dermatologist for a microdermabrasion, that&#x27;s why it cost you a few hundred dollars to have something like that done at a spa/clinic in the first place!</li>
            <li> My skin is very thin and this product does not hurt at all but actually feel nice.</li>
            <li> In general if you have a cleansing brush and a facial foam you do not need any device to cleanse &amp; exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of reviewers compared this product (and other brands like it) to the more &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; priced Clarisonic, which will cost at least $100.</li>
            <li> One cleans the gums stimulating them (or tearing them if you were not careful) while the sonicare actually healed them and helps you retain youthful gum tissue.</li>
            <li> there wasn&#x27;t enough motion (and apparently you&#x27;re not supposed to scrub your face with the brush either).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional microdermabrasion done a few times and loved it, but it is really expensive and time consuming to go to the doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few months now and it seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li> cleansing brush is (small) or as like to call it fun size.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to try this as people were saying it made them break out for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> The foam pad with the microdermabrasion gel gets really hot after spinning a few seconds on my face and does not work well</li>
            <li> Have had the first version for a few years</li>
            <li> Only cons is the fasted setting might be too slow for people who have been using spin brushes for awhile or need a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> and I spent time writing back and forth to the shippers, who weren&#x27;t particularly helpful.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t pull straight down, on the compartment area, but rock it side to side.  </li>
            <li> I think it really gets down into the pores.</li>
            <li> So as I am using it, if I am not very careful, the battery compartment just pops open.  </li>
            <li> The motor is too weak to make a serious impact on the real skin issues that plague most of the young adults today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the issue was because the batteries were the right size.</li>
            <li> Since I like some of the Olay moisturizers as well as other high end products, I thought I&#x27;d give this brush a try.  </li>
            <li> My skin type is dry combination but clear.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has really cleared my dark spots.</li>
            <li> first you would waste $500 plus dollars on such nonsense...</li>
            <li> The machine is pretty weak, it&#x27;s a decent product</li>
            <li> The substance is very thick and gummy, with fine, gritty particles.</li>
            <li> There are other very expensive ones but this one is great for the price.</li>
            <li> Turns out it actually was a little too much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my baking soda mixed with a little liquid cleanser and gentle circular motion.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, this brush has such little power that it wouldn&#x27;t even make a good toy.  </li>
            <li> although very little it&#x27;s my first use</li>
            <li> Olay has always provided great alternatives for expensive skin care for hard working girls.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extra soft, but they really do remove the dull layers skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry (I&#x27;m in my 50s and live in a dry climate).</li>
            <li> Too bad, I was hoping this would be just as good.</li>
            <li> Normally I wear my hair down to cover up my face but</li>
            <li> My face feels clean without feeling tight, like using a harsh soap.</li>
            <li> I am young enough that I felt as if I did not needed to start a nightly facial routine other than removing make up and washing face before bed</li>
            <li> But the other one, especially if you&#x27;re approaching 40 like me, you won&#x27;t let it near your face.  </li>
            <li> However the tubes of facial cleanser are pitifully small (size of travel toothpaste) and the motor is too weak to be effective.</li>
            <li> I had to laugh when both of them called me a few days later (without having talked to each other) and said …</li>
            <li> The included tubes of cleanser and microdermabrasion lotion are small, but you really use just a little to do your whole face so they will last a while.</li>
            <li> box doesn&#x27;t really have any directions as to what to do other than to get your face wet, put the cleanser on one of the brushes and start spinning it on your face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly for the little brush</li>
            <li> &amp; I learned that I was apparently not the only one to purchase a defective Olay Pro-X from Amazon</li>
            <li> to dry patches, large pores, and little wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I would suggest not applying too much pressure and let the scrubbing pad/brush do the work because both scrubs have exfoliate in them and it could rub your skin raw.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if all microdermabrasion kits are like this or if it&#x27;s just assumed that the person who buys one will have had it done in a salon at some point and will already know what to do, but I&#x27;m the type of person who like clear and concise direction</li>
            <li> After the second use several days later, I used the thermal product again and rinsed thoroughly after I was done and patted my face dry.</li>
            <li> I left the tool in my shower, and can confirm that it does well getting soaked in water every day, the batteries last a long time, and the tool is durable and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see much dramatic improvement in skin after daily use of the normal brush for a week.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used both heads at least a dozen times and they still look new</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used both heads at least a dozen times and they still look new</li>
            <li> Tiny tubs of cleansers that come with it won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The one I used then left my skin somewhat dry, but noticeably cleaner than it had been in days and cleared the way for any further treatment (Persadox, benzoyl peroxide cream), I would use.</li>
            <li> I would not use it directly on the upper nasasl pores as well if you have even slightly enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> It really feels like it is sloughing off the dead and dry skin, leaving a smoother result.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product has really changed the way my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I just used too much cleanser, but it was a disaster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure the microderm function has done much.</li>
            <li> OMG, its unbelievable how fast u start noticing changes on your face after u start using this.</li>
            <li> how long for each time, what results I&#x27;m actually supposed to see and how soon, etc.  </li>
            <li> And the amount of product in the tubes is a flat out joke.</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any difference yet.</li>
            <li> I only wished I didn&#x27;t have to wait so long to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wonder how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I just have to see how long the creams and the brushes will last.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect it to last long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and had it pulled back, but managed to get some of the crystals in my hairline.  </li>
            <li> As long as this facial brush lasts, then I do not see why anyone would spend $100 on these things.</li>
            <li> This product has good power - although I was disappointed with the size of the product.</li>
            <li> (I think it&#x27;s because the Olay Pro-X exfoliates my skin and also lets the medication I use reach deeper down where it needs to go...not because the Pro-X directly lightens my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The oil has cut down dramatically and my face feels as soft as baby skin.</li>
            <li> I am 52, with MS and other major health issues.</li>
            <li> I am 67 and although I use a regimen including day and night moisturizers, I wanted a product that would sluff off the dead cells on my face and bring out the new skin below.  </li>
            <li> The motor in the brush didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I have combo/oily skin with some dry areas now that it is winter and am in my mid 30&#x27;s-</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it, but if you like it and want it to last, keep it as dry as you can.</li>
            <li> It definitely gets rid of the dry skin &amp; makes it smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Handy to carry when travelling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Less frequent acne breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However once I get out and put moisturizer on it dries and I have dry patches that are flaky and gross looking.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that combats my dry skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> I only used the brush a few times, on the medium setting, but clearly my skin couldn&#x27;t handle it.</li>
            <li> I had a few scars from teenage acne and they are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> wet face with water and wet the soft bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, my skin looks healthier and a few old blemish scars have been lightened.</li>
            <li> my hand would get tired quick.</li>
            <li> I only had to cut a very little bit out because of the knotted twisting.&lt;br /&gt;Second, and this is more serious, you have to keep the sponge attachment sopping wet.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t considered that this might be related to my ultra sensitive skin, as the reaction from this (acne) was different than the reaction I usually get from skin products (ultra itchy rash, which this didn&#x27;t cause at all).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not entirely thrilled with the polisher and the foam pad, though I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m just not using it right, or I expected something else.</li>
            <li> I seriously noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> I used the Red Cap cleaner every night and the Blue Cap Polisher every other night and a lot of Moisturizer after treatment.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my face did feel smoother, but the next morning it wasn&#x27;t, plus my face was very, very dry.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft enough so that I can use it every without making my skin feel raw or tender.  </li>
            <li> My 10 year old son has started to get a little acne</li>
            <li> Due to a change in medication my facial skin has changed and requires different daily maintenance, as it has become rough and bumpy.</li>
            <li> When you use the microdermabrasion pad, it really tugs and sucks at your skin, so don&#x27;t be alarmed by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Pro-X gently removes those ugly dry patches and leaves my skin glowing and feeling clean without irritation.</li>
            <li> Felt it was at least part way reasonable.</li>
            <li> Do I look younger, not really, but my skin does look healthier.</li>
            <li> This one turns off after it being on for 3 seconds, which is strange.</li>
            <li> It seems that it&#x27;s closed properly without the batteries, but when I put the batteries in, the compartment does not close all the way?</li>
            <li> I had even forgotten about it for a long time and when a friend discussed about wanting to buy herself one, she reminded me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t why i took so long in getting it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using microdermabrasion crystals from another company for a long time, as well as glycolic acid and lactic acid.</li>
            <li> But for someone who&#x27;s been exfoliating for a long time, this kit worked wonderfully.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts all day every day (as long as I follow my routine).</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It was wet with fluid which I believed its glue.</li>
            <li> The peptides DO work in the long haul but require a two month wait</li>
            <li> Yeah, I&#x27;m going to be using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Clarisonic for a long time.</li>
            <li> this brush lasts a long time, assume this review to be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical to buy this after reading many mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> I have reallylong hair (down to the middle of my back) and I am cursed with lots of &amp;#34;baby hairs&amp;#34; around my hairline.  </li>
            <li> this really really helps, i notice im breaking out less, and i had a few purple acne scars and it faded them to almost gone</li>
            <li> I have seen my moderate breakouts minimize and my face is less oily the next day.</li>
            <li> I wonder if a more expensive product would have faster speeds!</li>
            <li> Have to use the microdermabrasion only once every other week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare this to other than using my hands or a facial puff.</li>
            <li> , I used to break out occasionally and used a blue, pleasant-smelling facial scrub with small &#x27;particles&#x27; in it (&#x27;Brasivol&#x27;), that provided what was to become &#x27;dermabrasion&#x27; treatments that cost hundreds in a spa or salon today.  </li>
            <li> along with my other products (Sibu Sea  Buckthorn and some other essential oils that have also made a big difference)</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these facial brushes for a while now but couldn&#x27;t justify the price tag of he other models.  </li>
            <li> The hand held cleansing machine was pretty weak.</li>
            <li> You can use other facial cleansers with this.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s versatile enough to use with other cleansers after I&#x27;ve finished using the cleanser/exfoliant that came with it.  </li>
            <li> (my fault not the manufacturers: accidentally dropping it on a hard tile shower floor multiple times, I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t stop working sooner).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this system to anyone wanting help with dry, dull skin, minimizing pores and reduce acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this system to anyone wanting help with dry, dull skin, minimizing pores and reduce acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is dry and peels, but gets oily as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> The difficult area of the nose is clean as well just by using the sponge head with microbead exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I use to have dry skin flaking.</li>
            <li> and you can wash and dry those.</li>
            <li> I have oilier skin during the warmer months and dry, flaky skin during the winter.</li>
            <li> Tried this to get rid of the dry patches that have accumulated.</li>
            <li> My t-zone is oily but sometimes my cheeks can feel really dry.</li>
            <li> it dry, and set it somewhere to thoroughly dry overnight (medicine cabinet or wherever).  </li>
            <li> it dry, and set it somewhere to thoroughly dry overnight (medicine cabinet or wherever).  </li>
            <li> The 2x week microdermabrasion tends to dry my face out in spots, so I found using it 1xweek for me is better.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I thought there was no way it was going to solve my dry skin issue.</li>
            <li> This has worked well for so many people, but I&#x27;m sad to say it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> i am not impressed with this, if you rub your face with a washcloth it provides nearly just as much exfoliating.</li>
            <li> This redness only lasts for a few minutes after I apply my daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> I only use this in phases when I don&#x27;t have any active pimples.</li>
            <li> If you have active acne, wait till your acne is under control before using this or any similar device.</li>
            <li> My entire skin is peeling, black and extremely rough (especially my cheeks, sides of my face, and around my mouth)</li>
            <li> I should have spent extra on the clarisonic; this is ABSOLUTELY not comparable.</li>
            <li> My complaint about this kit is with the Thermal Polisher which is the main reason I bought this kit.</li>
            <li> I patted my face dry and put my face moisturizer on and when it dried I only had a tiny bit of flaky dry skin by my nose</li>
            <li> Also I will admit that the older reviewers who stated their ages ( being in late 50&#x27;s and up) also had a lot to do with my decision to purchace this item.  </li>
            <li> I like this brush however the speed seems a little slow and the cleansing head feels a little cheap.  </li>
            <li> Microdermabrasion treatments should be limited to 2 non-consecutive days/week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Limited instructions.</li>
            <li> The least it can do is smooth out your skin a little because the microdermabrasion brush gets rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic brush heads move VERY little in sort of a pulsating action.  </li>
            <li> Maybe not suitable for very sensitive skin, might cause itchiness.</li>
            <li> that was fabulous, but didn&#x27;t last long and was very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how old dead skin on the face can make us look!  </li>
            <li> One use almost completely did away with the small stubborn blackheads in those areas.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised after using the microdermabrasion product for the past 8 weeks (2x a week)</li>
            <li> After only one month of average use, the motor died.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are smaller and lighter after using this product for three weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin is actually worse than when I first started.</li>
            <li> I recently suffered from a heavy breakout which left my skin rough and scarred.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and I am always combating dry scaly patches.</li>
            <li> It definitely reaches down and extracts the grime and dirt from my pores.</li>
            <li> Cleans deep down to get all the yuck out.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, the only down side is having to buy the cream I&#x27;ve had to repurchase as a replacement for my mom.  </li>
            <li> I still have a few dark spots from previous pimples, but I can finally can see myself having perfectly clear skin</li>
            <li> Maybe 2 weeks if you&#x27;re only using a small drop with your daily cleansing?!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female 36.</li>
            <li> Because I have the brush from the other Pro x kit and this 3 speed brush, I use the 3 speed just for micro derm abrasion and the other brush for daily wash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it less than a week</li>
            <li> I think &amp;#34;dermabrasion&amp;#34; is misleading since one can achieve the same effect with a typical washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I had a Clarisonic Mia that lasted less than a year, so I can&#x27;t expect something with this low price to perform as well</li>
            <li> Even if you soak the sponge, it dries out enough without warning to jump unpredictably.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the first and only time I used it, it burnt my skin.</li>
            <li> Costs less than local stores in my area.</li>
            <li> I suffer with acne rosacea which often causes very dry patches of skin.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the scrubbing product, but the brush is really weak.  </li>
            <li> You may use other crystals as long as they are rounded and not ground seeds of some sort.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this black or especially this rough.</li>
            <li> The second day I exfoliated and my skin was tight but it took a lot of the dullness away.</li>
            <li> In the two weeks I&#x27;ve used my unit, the pad had broken down considerably from the tiny beads in the blue cap wash.</li>
            <li> out the product with such little quantity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exfoliating was the key and while there are plenty of ways to exfoliate I&#x27;m now sold on this little tool-</li>
            <li> I only wish the motor was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> It requires a little learning to use it properly.</li>
            <li> Neither the buff sponge or bristle head did anything to my face but pressing harder would only kill the motor; the buff sponge head felt like a weak breeze from a fan and the bristle head was like an overly soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish the samples were a little bigger though</li>
            <li> Lightened my dark spots, gives me that glow that older skin loses.</li>
            <li> It also makes your face a bit dry after but so does a lot of the other exfoliators</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry due to a chronic illness.  </li>
            <li> and some dry skin due to weather changes.</li>
            <li> I primarily only use it on my cheek bones and jaw area and on the 3rd speed because the slowest one like I said before pulls my skin too hard.</li>
            <li> I had to keep putting more water on my face as it was pulling my skin really bad.</li>
            <li> However, I must admit that the more name brand brushes like the Clarisonic Mia/ Mia 2 was just way too expensive and honestly not something that I saw myself spending $100</li>
            <li> I started out using the microdermabrasion once a week for 2 weeks and then moved to twice a week when my sensitive face didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> only thing I would like to see added would be a small, cloth, zippered fabric bag/case, about 6 inches long, with \\&quot;Olay\\&quot; on it</li>
            <li> only thing I would like to see added would be a small, cloth, zippered fabric bag/case, about 6 inches long, with \\&quot;Olay\\&quot; on it</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up (which it had been doing previously to starting using this) but not quite fast enough for me- with this kit, my skin is clear and I&#x27;d almost go as far as saying that it looks like it did before the horrible outbreak.</li>
            <li> Not really as I have expected.</li>
            <li> It has absolutely no power.</li>
            <li> have rough skin from the dryness</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product a few weeks</li>
            <li> and after I use the wash and scrubber (microdermabrasion) product and tool, my skin is no longer rough.</li>
            <li> was closed</li>
            <li> Cleans well, spin is slower than I expected though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say Pro-X lives up to its promise of removing contaminants and dead skin that rob your face of its luster to reveal smoother and younger looking skin</li>
            <li> My face is brighter, skin is firm and MUCH younger looking.</li>
            <li> but then I thought I have always been to rough on my face</li>
            <li> My skin felt smoother after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> and it seemed like my pores were harder to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A definite waste of money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> I have seen product reviews of this and got really curious</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pushing it harder into my skin</li>
            <li> if not much</li>
            <li> It does not say whether to keep the brush and sponge wet, how often to use the products, or any warnings about the problems which I will now describe.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> A total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The rest of my face was slightly pink.</li>
            <li> Wet the foam brush and polish your skin for 1 minute.</li>
            <li> My skin was red for a few minutes after using the Olay System.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Visual evidence of pore minimization after just a few days&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re only supposed to wash for a few minutes...</li>
            <li> I am prone to occasional breakouts and since using the Pro-X as an addition to my nightly face wash regimen, I have noticed a decrease in active breakouts, dry skin, and uneven texture.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> and spent time going over every inch of my face.  </li>
            <li> I also admit to having left my house a few times with a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; face just Mascara and lip stick</li>
            <li> uneven skin tone and the red /brown blotches.</li>
            <li> if I wanted to spend the money for it so after reading some reviews, I decided to try Pro-X for a minimal investment.  </li>
            <li> Works well, not too rough</li>
            <li> Even after I have washed my face in the shower, I have gone back over it with the everyday scrubber and wash</li>
            <li> Waste of money not enough product.</li>
            <li> However, the attachments (brushes) don&#x27;t stay firm &amp; get soft within a few times of use.</li>
            <li> I should have Spent the extra few dollars and got the sonic handheld.</li>
            <li> another reviewer mentioned, the frustrating thing is that the kit doesn&#x27;t come with a complete set of instructions; except for a brief brochure that tells you how to put the batteries in, everything is printed on the exterior of the box, and it&#x27;s actually a bit confusing to read since the information is scattered in various places.  </li>
            <li> My face constantly felt tight and rough , the reason for this was due to soap residue .</li>
            <li> Any new product or change in regimen will usually cause that or worse as a natural reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This machine is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> is not strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> is not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other cleaning systems of various price ranges.  </li>
            <li> At first when I powered the brush on, I was a little shocked by the highest speed setting of the brush (which isn&#x27;t fast at all)</li>
            <li> At first when I powered the brush on, I was a little shocked by the highest speed setting of the brush (which isn&#x27;t fast at all)</li>
            <li> Has very little power, when it works, Mine Would turn on (not necessarily work) for a few minutes then promptly shut off and turn back on with minutes or fidgeting with it</li>
            <li> Needless to say, after a few weeks of use, I felt I was breaking out more than I ever have in the past years.</li>
            <li> The Cleaner does its job,But not sure of the microderbasion brush,seems to be on the lighter side with low to no effects been seen over last few months of usage.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t want to use the three speeds then the other one will save a few bucks but is the same thing - my friend has the other one.</li>
            <li> At the price, I expected to receive full size products not a small sample size, in addition the batteries were dead :(</li>
            <li> This product comes as a complete package and consists of a hand wand approximately 5 inches long, two snap in/out heads, 2 AA Duracell batteries, a tube of exfoliating cleanser, amd a tube of self-warming thermal crystal polisher.  </li>
            <li> but a little can go a long way.</li>
            <li> Four stars only because they give you very little product.</li>
            <li> my skin has been noticeably smoother only after a few weeks of usage.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried Clarisonic, but Olay Pro-X seems to do the job for 5x less the price.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for money and will be recommending this to friends.</li>
            <li> have the eye area of someone over well half my age (zero crows feet, bags etc only slight shadows), almost no wrinkles but slightly large pores and some HP spots from wearing the wrong sunglasses this summer (</li>
            <li> lets just hope this one lasts longer than the other brand i bought.  </li>
            <li> While I notice a difference, I don&#x27;t know that other people can.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need turbo speeds and extreme force like some customers talked about.</li>
            <li> You can use it with your other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I use the microdermabrasion twice a week and the other exfoliating product 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> until I tried some other ones.</li>
            <li> I have the other Pro x kit</li>
            <li> the other wash is all over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done the crystals three of the nights and the cleanser alone on the other days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with it or other cream cleansers at this point.</li>
            <li> Being Wheelchair bound in a home that is not exactly wheelchair assessable</li>
            <li> a woman stopped me at the post office the other day to ask what I use on my face</li>
            <li> Maybe it just takes longer than what some other posters said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if you end up not liking one or the other of the creams/cleansers included in the kit, you don&#x27;t have to buy the kit again once the heads wear out.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve actually left the house a few times with no foundation or powder on my face!</li>

            <li> , I&#x27;ve actually left the house a few times with no foundation or powder on my face!</li>
            <li> My face is smoother from using this than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used, and that&#x27;s a lot of products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bottles that come with it are small, and I will only be repurchasing the thermal polisher.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to all the other</li>
            <li> After the first use of the brush, the brush became discoloured and I think the replacement brushes are too expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on this type of product for quite some time, as I keep seeing mentions in women&#x27;s magazines and other places.  </li>
            <li> , at first I thought there&#x27;s something wrong with the product because it won&#x27;t start at all, I was thinking some machine issues or something</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not pleased with is the foam head attachment for microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> (I used other brands.)  </li>
            <li> (I used other brands.)  </li>
            <li> like the other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The other is a thermal crystal (they heat up on contact with the skin)</li>
            <li> and, Friday I use Micro Head and all other days mornings.and nights....</li>
            <li> , i only had about 3 or 4 small scars.</li>
            <li> I only use the crystals once a week and use a Regenerist cleanser no more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> If you rotate the brush in a small circle in the opposite direction in these areas, it counteracts the pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Check other brands.</li>
            <li> and it cleared up my skin due to it cleaning deeper than just your hands.</li>
            <li> I have also used the spinning brush with other cleansing products to eliminate acne.</li>
            <li> According to the packaging, the brush heads are interchangeable with the other Pro-X brush heads in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used small amounts and only once or twice a week to keep from drying out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> WAS TOLD THE OTHER DAY THAT SHE LOVED&lt;br /&gt;USING</li>
            <li> I may try some other cleansing products just to see the difference, but the battery operated brush and polisher?</li>
            <li> They both take pride in their skin and do not have wrinkles other than the lil &amp;#34;kiss&amp;#34; marks at outer eye corner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected!</li>
            <li> Dry patches are gone, little funky bumps now gone -</li>
            <li> At first, I thought something was wrong with the batteries, I cringe to think of how many batteries I wasted thinking they were bad.</li>
            <li> tried this set twice and returned it as it was making me mad that something like this was available for so much money and was absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> ALSO A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was only twenty bucks because this was a real disappointment  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The crystal \\&quot;salve\\&quot; from both products require rinsing and rubbing off with wet hands or a washrag, but I tend to use less with this system so it&#x27;s easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the contents of the tube is much less than expected.</li>
            <li> When I looked inside I could see the internal compartment was not nicely glued and its wet.</li>
            <li> So, no more washcloths, no more bare hands, it&#x27;s Olay Pro-X all the way!!!</li>
            <li> I use the other pad twice a week for a slight abrasion.  </li>
            <li> Unless you only need/want a very minor and subtle exfoliating treatment, this is not the product for somebody with moderate to serious exfoliating needs.  </li>
            <li> wife doesn&#x27;t have bad acne by any means, but she recently went off of birth control and was starting to have minor breakouts, especially on her chin.</li>
            <li> too pricey, not worth it.</li>
            <li> that I say It is DEFINATELY not worth your money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not nearly as powerful as I had imagined.</li>
            <li> In two weeks, my dark spots do seem a teeny bit lighter.</li>
            <li> Having brown skin with sun damage I have had dark spots for years</li>
            <li> Only 2 negative things.</li>
            <li> It works just so-so for me, probably not totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li> so I think they&#x27;ll last at least a couple of months and</li>
            <li> so I think they&#x27;ll last at least a couple of months and</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical this could really be that helpful.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price, not even for the spinning brush that&#x27;ll break in a week.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, and it seems really expensive</li>
            <li> It is an average over the counter microdermabrasion kit.  </li>
            <li> Definitely have to work it into my routine for at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Not worth even $5.00..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the expensive face brushes so I can&#x27;t really compare with those</li>
            <li> Not really worth it.</li>
            <li> There were so many things I hate about this cleansing system.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend starting with a slow speed and increasing the intensity as your skin adjusts.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback to this one as well as all of the others is that the motor spins too slowly for me.  </li>
            <li> I also feel like my face isn&#x27;t so tight after cleaning it like with other products.</li>
            <li> The skin around the scar was raised and it that has gone down dramatically.  </li>
            <li> From my forehead all down my nose and chin.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using it and will try it out with other cleansing products!</li>
            <li> They only send 2 very small sample bottles of their exfoliating liquid product which is supposed to work in conjunction with the device &amp; sponges.  </li>
            <li> A few strands of my hair got caught and pulled out the other day.</li>
            <li> no breakouts nothing odd happened to my skin.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles on my forehead are less defined.</li>
            <li> You get everything for a start in this kit, batteries, a small cleanser, a small microdermabrasion scrub, 2 brushed and 1 head unit.</li>
            <li> But this product is worth a try and can replace at least some of the expensive anti-aging creams.</li>
            <li> Less pimples and cleaner pores.</li>
            <li> and I can see that my pores has been slightly reduced.</li>
            <li> got it less than 20 bucks.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve had this a week and a half and those acne scars?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using less foundation because I don&#x27;t have to worry about covering up my scars and incoming acne.</li>
            <li> I had the previous version</li>
            <li> Also the little tubes of the cleanser and abrasive they give you is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush head for regular cleansing is definitely not as soft and plush as the brush heads are on my Clarisonic Mia, but it didn&#x27;t feel too abrasive on my sensitive skin, which can flare up really badly if I use something too harsh on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong and it will disappear completely !!.,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every blackhead scrub known to man with little or no success in clearing my pores from the little black spots you can see close up.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid at first that my face would burn</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using this with another face wash I have, and I got a foamy mess that spun all over my bathroom mirror and me.</li>
            <li> I immediately threw away the flat sponge which is only designed to give you a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; and is completely useless to me.  </li>
            <li> After a few months now, I notice that my skin is smoother and I have less black heads.</li>
            <li> It has changed the dull look to my somewhat dry winter complexion-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Olay don&#x27;t sell this range in South Africa where I live so</li>
            <li> Those really bad, embarrassing acne scars have faded tremendously.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use my skin is noticeably brighter, smoother, and has less blemishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less messy</li>
            <li> After using the little tubes of cleanser, etc.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared to use the microbead cleanser for the sponge head</li>
            <li> 20 ml is too little</li>
            <li> With a little puzzle solving, I came to the conclusion that the brush head, the one with the bristles, is meant to be used for cleaning your face.  </li>
            <li> it was so little that I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using both the cleansing and microdermabrasion heads for a little over three weeks now - here is what I find:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is there are no instructions included in the box!</li>
            <li> instead, as it&#x27;s a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> (Some other companies are getting lazy with that</li>
            <li> I have to give the head a little spin and it will get going.</li>
            <li> The bristles could be a little firmer</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this product a little over a week ago because I was wanting the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d get a little a be</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little sisters birthday gift.</li>
            <li> I usually exfoliate my face in the shower every other day with St.</li>
            <li> No power, stops with little pressure..</li>
            <li> those little lines are diminished after one use.</li>
            <li> Since it has the little crystals that the foam sponge pushes around your skin, it&#x27;s necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use the included abrasive soapy things, but i do use a little coconut oil as a lubricant.</li>
            <li> I do wish the brush was a little softer.</li>
            <li> I try not to push it against my skin very hard, but sometimes I catch myself doing it around the nose area and the extra pressure doesn&#x27;t stop the spin brush from spinning.  </li>
            <li> but I put little to no pressure on my face, as the bristles are a little harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> I am not very satisfied or dissatisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> I had a little trouble trying to use the polishing pad because it doesn&#x27;t move gracefully over the skin</li>
            <li> Once you place it against your face one has to be careful not to press too hard or it will stop spinning.  </li>
            <li> just recently it has gotten worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brush system.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this, save yourself the trouble of returning it and don&#x27;t bother.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with a few replacement heads .</li>
            <li> i put it on my face and it made it smell like a 3 month dead tuna trapped in a fart</li>
            <li> A bit harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after just a few months.</li>
            <li> Look at all of the one star reviews with people saying theirs also stopped working after just a few months (weeks or days for some).</li>
            <li> This product is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but Ive dunked mine in the sink a few times.  </li>
            <li> I even saved a few bucks by using Amazon.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also, I found myself missing the Mia&#x27;s timed cycle of 60 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I used the Olay a few times and didn&#x27;t notice any difference, but I had never used a Clarisonic</li>
            <li> As per the directions (found on the side of the box, not inside), I use the renewal cleansing brush with the exfoliating cleanser everyday and I use the microdermabrasion head with the thermal crystal cleanser twice a week with three days in between uses.</li>
            <li> You could literally see the dead skin particles floating in the water once you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this product, I feel my skin has brightened and is clearing up.</li>
            <li> My mom told me not to waste my money on this product, but after 2 days, I caught her using it too</li>
            <li> so i gave it a gap of few weeks</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON CLAROSONIC</li>
            <li> the dead skin is removed, and the face was used&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste a dime of your money on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a scrub that was that harsh before.</li>
            <li> Got this product in advance, everything as promised is in there except it comes with dead batteries</li>
            <li> WITH JUST A REGUAR CLEANSER ALSO PLEASE HAS DIFFRENT SPEEDS FOR THE MOR HARSH SCRUBS.</li>
            <li> Spend the money for the heavy duty one.</li>
            <li> but it did take a few weeks (tops) to start clearing.</li>
            <li> Also, a few times I have gone to turn the unit on and it won&#x27;t start.</li>
            <li> I still have blackheads, didn&#x27;t gain radiance, and it&#x27;s really messy to use.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks I have fewer whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I just turn it on rub it against a bar of soap to get a lather and add a few drops of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference after a few day with using just a wash cloth when I didn&#x27;t have this brush with me.</li>
            <li> It says not to use everyday, but I do anyways.</li>
            <li> i feel that my skin got cleared all dead cell</li>
            <li> As soon as you put the batteries in and start using it feels like it&#x27;s going dead already.</li>
            <li> I guess they having a thick, rough face skin?</li>
            <li> I had to step up my facial cleansing game, so I bought this.</li>
            <li> The product hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this, off and on, for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though I wasted money buying the 2 speed Pro-X because I won&#x27;t ever use it again.</li>
            <li> but if you use it everyday you need to change the batteries every two weeks.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a few days and I am already seeing the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m psyched to keep using this and see the end result in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now...</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and use the microdermabrasion twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I could see the difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I feel like I look wan and pale</li>
            <li> I feel like I look wan and pale</li>
            <li> -&lt;br /&gt;the little brush head is kinda annoying to clean</li>
            <li> The construction is a little worse than the first sadly.</li>
            <li> It is not strong like clarisonic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very odd sensation and one that I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> works well , but very less quantity of serum and clenser send</li>
            <li> This is a little small wish I would have went with a differant brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not worth spending your hard earned money on.</li>
            <li> with the dead skin removed there was bound to be some small negatives during the adjustment.</li>
            <li> Something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had quite a few breakouts in the past couple weeks, but I do not know whether it is from the device or stress.</li>
            <li> The unit has power in the rotation, but when the unit touches my face it slows down and loses it&#x27;s power.</li>
            <li> Like raw skin or something.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete disappointment and waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> my acne has decreased by 70% at least using this thing with my regular washes.</li>
            <li> I thought, &amp;#34;This little thing is going to do a number on my dull skin?</li>
            <li> Very little power.</li>
            <li> The cleanser and micro are in small packages, almost sample size.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple skin care products including Proactiv (which didn’t work) and expensive creams from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else had that problem.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it falls short.</li>
            <li> Battery power is not appropriate for this type of tool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how often you should be doing this,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if all microdermabrasion kits are like this or if it&#x27;s just assumed that the person who buys one will have had it done in a salon at some point and will already know what to do,</li>
            <li> I was dissappointed that Olay made this product seem like a microdermabraion product, but it was no better than putting scrub on my fingers and rubbing it in my face.</li>
            <li> but I usually use coconut oil for that anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> On the plus side it does come with the batteries (although I now realize this is pointless, because you WILL use your arms anyway)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> The sample cleansing cream was way too small.  </li>
            <li> not sure what that price range will be;  </li>
            <li> I go through bouts of my face breaking out with itchy patches and small bumps.</li>
            <li> so I think no more details needed.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these in the past</li>
            <li> Small lines have disappeared and I use it twice weekly.</li>
            <li> And the hand held itself is too small.</li>
            <li> Both the cleanser and the polisher come in small tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have somewhat sensitive skin and was afraid this might make me look like I had a sunburn/windburned face but</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with the cleaning tool with 1 brush and 1 sponge and 2 small tubes of cleansing and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used the brush with my ordinary cleanser.</li>
            <li> im 30 and have some expression lines and acne scars it has not magically disappeared</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I lived without this spin brush.  </li>
            <li> I totally promoted this items to whom that still in doubts to buy the expensive or cheaper item.</li>
            <li> I just received  this today, and I usually don&#x27;t review  products this soon or ever..</li>
            <li> not sure why everyone raved about this product.  </li>
            <li> Just a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I was worries when i read few negative reviews but at the end i purchased this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the scrubs that come with it, just my usual face wash and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin smoother after using it, but i&#x27;m not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Put a small amount ( about the size of pencil eraser ) of Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser on your face.  </li>
            <li> Put a small amount of the Thermal Crystal Polisher on.  </li>
            <li> small and fits in my small bathroom cabinet with no problem</li>
            <li> when you use it - not sure that there is anyway</li>
            <li> The cleansing system machine did not open so it was useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to Clarasonic brushes, and this Olay brush head was sooooo small compared to Clarasonic,</li>
            <li> It came with a small sample size of cleanser and exfoliating polish.</li>
            <li> The bottles are small and just for starter</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like how hard it pulls my skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> things I like about this product (besides the batteries being included, as in the Pro-X System), is that it does what it claims to do (advised no more than 2X per week for thorough microdermasion treatment, at least a day apart), which DOES leave my skin noticeably cleaner.  </li>
            <li> why couple reviewers are not satisfied with this cleansing system and complaint about the rolling speed...</li>
            <li> I see the small lines in my face slowly diminishing.</li>
            <li> there are three speeds for this application, and the slowest speed was a little too slow for me!  </li>
            <li> Put my moisturizer on and NO MORE DRY SKIN FLAKES!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> How hard can it be?</li>
            <li> It helps your skin look radiant instead of dull.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I pressed too hard.</li>
            <li> Also, the polishing stuff tore up my face and is hard to use.</li>
            <li> I held it firmly and moved it very slowly over my skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect this to be dermatologist grade, and anymore expecting some sort of at-home spa equipment is a sucker.</li>
            <li> I thought it has at least one year warranty.thank you.</li>
            <li> I have a combination skin and not too delicate.</li>
            <li> My complaint is the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> A common question is what&#x27;s the difference between the two:</li>
            <li> My mom and sister have both been using the Olay Pro-X for about a year, and have had nothing negative to say about it.  </li>
            <li> but if this helps at least one person - that&#x27;s important.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using this brush since day one.</li>
            <li> at least three times  a week, as I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Late delivery was a lot of waiting.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Of course, this product is not to be used on the delicate skin around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One or Two Negative remarks out of over 200</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow and steady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict on my skin?</li>
            <li> are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s a bit slow, even on the fastest speed.  </li>
            <li> The speed of the unit, even on its highest setting, seems slow.</li>
            <li> I mean buy a brush and scrub your face)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its an affordable price than the other expensive brands as i reviewed before i ordered this system.</li>
            <li> no more breakouts!</li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t bad so no regrets but would not purchase again for the lack of results.</li>
            <li> had tried a similar product and it was rougher on the skin and very expensive</li>
            <li> It took quite a bit of effort, to detangle the very small amount of hair that was affected.</li>
            <li> I have a condition called Millia (little annoying white bumps that look like zits, but they&#x27;re not) - this has help to diminish those, as well.  </li>
            <li> First, it pulls your skin very badly, and you don&#x27;t want it hear your eyes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this just didn&#x27;t work out for me because without the oomph, there is little point to use this as opposed to my fingers.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this</li>
            <li> Did what it said it would, but constantly tangled in my wife&#x27;s hair and was painful.</li>
            <li> it has taken a few years off my appearance and I&#x27;m getting random</li>
            <li> Was shocked when I tried to open up the battery compartment to insert the battery.</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a facelift, but it does make for a soft face and will work those nasty dead cells off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a facelift, but it does make for a soft face and will work those nasty dead cells off your face.    </li>
            <li> For a moment, I wonder its it an imitation product, very disappointed that olay overlooked on workmanship standard.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a weak fixture.</li>
            <li> The rotating mechanism on the wand was weak and vibates.  </li>
            <li> Felt really weak, rather use my hand.</li>
            <li> I already use the Olay Pro facial scrub brush, so I was disappointed to see that I could have just purchased the microderm pads.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably only mine product, but it doesn&#x27;t work properly - turns on and off randomly, I hate it :-(.</li>
            <li> A brush for use with the cleanser and a tough sponge for microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money !!!</li>
            <li> The pad for the dermabrasion gel was a little awkward to use.</li>
            <li> however it feels a bit rough on my skin, and after a couple weeks of using it i got really bad flaking skin on the sides of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this.</li>
            <li> feel like it breaks me out and makes my skin look worse.</li>
            <li> It could be too irritating.</li>
            <li> and I have broken out on my cheeks from the microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li> Not attractive.</li>
            <li> in fact it was way worse than what I remember my skin looked like during those troubling years.</li>
            <li> No explosions, battery failures, broken posts.</li>
            <li> the only thing i hate is that I didn&#x27;t buy it before.&lt;br /&gt;Seller</li>
            <li> I started to break out really bad , due to residue build up my pores were clogged .</li>
            <li> I also have some acne scars from those terrible high school years</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect dramatic differences in your skin.  </li>
            <li> But all that hardly matters when it&#x27;s not doing its job!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week and the amount of time it takes, and the lack of results it produces is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My skin just looks and feels healthier since I began using this product, it has gotten rid of the nasty dry patches on my cheeks, it keeps the pores on my nose from building up clogs, and it has decreased the amount of oil I produce in my T-zone.</li>
            <li> The pad has slow power, and does a bad job of buffing or cleansing.</li>
            <li> nothing is wrong with it.  </li>
            <li> The sponge are poor quality!</li>
            <li> This is what I came up with, I could be completely wrong</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using expensive glycolic washes, etc.</li>
            <li> Ill stick with using my hands.</li>
            <li> The problem was that it is expensive, so I got this instead.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be expensive too because it doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> In today&#x27;s world, expensive moisturizers are used instead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference between this Olay brand and the expensive calarasonic.  </li>
            <li> but I was absolutely wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I am no longer embarrassed or obsessed about hiding my neck-</li>
            <li> I am no longer embarrassed or obsessed about hiding my neck-</li>
            <li> Sorry Olay not today</li>
            <li> but unfortunately i broke out again</li>
            <li> but it has unfortunately been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> I used an Ultra Sonic for years and thought that the replacements were getting expensive.  </li>
            <li> That is SO expensive.</li>
            <li> Unable to find microdermabrasion foam head.</li>
            <li> I have this one, and that really expensive one &amp;#34;ClariXXX&amp;#34; something.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t squeeze out excess water when you are done with washing your face, I can only imagine how nasty it would get with mold.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the expensive ones, but seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> ; I use that often, but I am sad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I have had this kit for 2 months and the brush randomly stopped working.</li>
            <li> I kept wanting to order this but kept putting it off because I thought it was too expensive.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few months after turning 30 my chin area started to get horrible cystic acne!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know one&#x27;s face could get so dirty by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was completely wrong!</li>
            <li> ; But I was wrong!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> The power is very feeble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is a really bad product</li>
            <li> I have really bad eczema as well as dry,sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And painful.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate as nothing was clearing up my face, I didn&#x27;t even want to go to work!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I purchased one for a friend s gift.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m stupid because it took me a while to figure out the directions are on the side of the box, not inside - ugh.</li>
            <li> it is so annoying, I literally want to throw it against the wall and break it in two!!!&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> Microdermabrasion Foam Head is crap.</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s a bit of an idiot warning....</li>
            <li> had also received a cheapo version of thesr scrubbers and was shocked to find that this name brand,  Oil of Olay scrubber didn&#x27;t have anymore power than the dollar store model!</li>
            <li> This is the worst microdermabrasion tool I&#x27;ve ever used :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed of OIL of OLAY!  </li>
            <li> but I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item.  </li>
            <li> Awful Product --</li>
            <li> just Awful</li>
            <li> Terrible experience.  </li>
            <li> quality of the machine- is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Horrible acne that took a week to go away after I stopped using this \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; cleansing</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any nasty reaction for using all three.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not really as I have expected. Cheap quality</li>
            <li> Great product at great price.</li>
            <li> does all, that it was meant too, must the chemicals, that are supplied need to be advertised, as very powerful, as they caused a redness on my face</li>
            <li> I wonder if a more expensive product would have faster speeds! The cleanser and micro are in small packages, almost sample size. I tried a regular exfoliant also, st Ives apricot and it worked well too. I notice less blemishes on my skin and my face is super soft</li>
            <li> im so glad i got this 15$ cheaper than in stores...i would not have bought it if it wasnt at such a discount.  first impression-it is much smaller than i anticipated...it works.  my skin is much softer than with hand wshing alone bit just not what i expected.  the small bottles of product are very nice too.  no breakouts nothing odd happened to my skin.  nothing is wrong with it.  thats about as nice as i can be.  lets just hope this one lasts longer than the other brand i bought.  im very sure this is not water resistant in any way.</li>
            <li> too pricey, not worth it. the brush does not last! vitagoods, way better brand</li>
            <li> Great Deal, thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this. It has absolutely no power. I have been using it a couple of weeks and see no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> works really well and makes my face look and feel great afterwards!!</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars if it had a recharging station (this one runs on batteries). I was concerned this wouldn&#x27;t be abrasive enough. I have combination skin that is dry and peels, but gets oily as the day goes on. After using this system about twice a week for 3+ weeks I&#x27;ve decided I love it! The bristle brush exfoliates well enough that I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed the foam head/microdermabrasion system. Maybe there are other factors, but I find my skin type to be more normal now, no dry skin, and breakouts are practically gone. The color of my skin is more even over-all. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and I really like it.  I&#x27;ve never used one of these before so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse than the Clarisonic but I feel like it does a great job at exfoliating.  Don&#x27;t expect dramatic differences in your skin.  Those reviews that claim to have people commenting on the condition of their skin are full of it, if you ask me.  While I notice a difference, I don&#x27;t know that other people can.  I did have one small scar from a pimple that has been greatly diminished.  The skin around the scar was raised and it that has gone down dramatically.  It is now mostly smooth and much lighter.  I use this brush with my regular cleansers; Nutrogena Acne Wash (daily),  Pola Whittening Cream Cleanser (daily) &amp; St. Ives Apricot Scrub (1 - 2 times per week).  The samples that come with it are okay but nothing I would run out and buy.  Use rechargeable batteries and they&#x27;ll last about a month before having the replace.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase considering the great price compared to the Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> So far so go I just need to remain dedicated using brush daily</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. It changes my skin immediately after the fist use.&lt;br /&gt;I have rough skin from the dryness so it make it soft from the spong head.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is the the size of  brush and the sponge is small، so it take 10 minutes to findh the proccess.&lt;br /&gt;You feel it long specially if you want to use it every day</li>
            <li> This is pretty good considering such a great price. It is best priced getting Plus kit through Amazon- paying only 5$ more to get both systems of &amp;#34;microdermabrasion&amp;#34; and facial scrub brush. I like that heads for each are universal for handle and easily purchased for replacements. I use scrubber once daily (in evening) after I&#x27;ve done a quick once over wash of face with my hands b/c I wash around my eye area first to get make-up off. Then about every 2 days I use the M.D. scrub/sponge in evening. While it isn&#x27;t a professional grade M.D. unit it certainly does a nice job for $25. I also think it is nice that you can use any type of wash/scrub you want with brushes and adjust pressure during use. I have combo/oily skin with some dry areas now that it is winter and am in my mid 30&#x27;s- this is doing a great job at allowing my skin to become smoother/more even toned and feel like I am at least holding steady with the good fight of aging! I don&#x27;t think this would erase deep lines and wrinkles but it will definitely improve quality of skin tone and firmness. I would certainly recommend for anyone and in fact am buying one for my sister for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! I don&#x27;t see how a really expensive one could be any better. I love using it because it makes my face feel so very clean. After using the little tubes of cleanser, etc. that came with it I just used my regular cleanser, etc. with it. All that plus its so easy to use. Great gift, too.</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend the money on the more expensive versions of this. The product is great for the money. My skin feels very soft and clean after i have used it. I have been using it for several months now and am still very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel fabulous!</li>
            <li> For the price it was great, love using the brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing price and product~ good~ nice cleansing system</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit about a week ago. I am 30 and have had acne my whole life.. just recently it has gotten worse. I decided to buy this not really expecting a whole lot. I was completely wrong! I seriously noticed a difference after the first use. After just 3 days, I noticed that most of my acne was gone. I have blackheads on my nose that I have struggled with my whole life, and I can even tell those are diminishing. It’s been a week and my face is completely clear. Normally I wear my hair down to cover up my face but yesterday I felt confident enough to go out with my hair up and minimal make up. I normally don’t write reviews on products, but I this is something you definitely want to invest in if you’re having troubles with acne. I have tried multiple skin care products including Proactiv (which didn’t work) and expensive creams from the dermatologist. This is the only thing I would recommend. Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this brush system. My 15 year old Neutrogena face scrubber does much better. This one is so weak I can rub my face better with my own hands and a washcloth!!</li>
            <li> Quick ship, love the product and still using it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> VERY good product.  Highly recommend.  Your face really feels and looks better when used REGULARLY</li>
            <li> This does not have enough power to work and clean like you would expect.</li>
            <li> I get better results using my shiseido face brush, didn&#x27;t see any difference with the olay prox and my hair kept getting snagged even when pulled back</li>
            <li> This was a gift. She like it.</li>
            <li> Bought this and it shipped very fast. I like how it has 3 different speeds to exfoliating. I&#x27;ve used the original one before but my sister has it now so I decided to try this microdermabrasion one. The two different heads are nice. I was a little scared to use the microbead cleanser for the sponge head but it&#x27;ll defeat the purpose of me purchasing this kit if I didn&#x27;t use the products it came with. Used the sponge head with mircobead exfoliater and my skin jusy feels wonderfully smooth and soft! Sponge head absolutely does what the description has stated. Overall very happy that I bought this. My skin just feels awesome no longer bumpy from dead skin and blackheads/yellowheads that were making the area aroud my nose bumpy. The difficult area of the nose is clean as well just by using the sponge head with microbead exfoliator. Definitely worth the buy especially when it&#x27;s the same price like the original Pro-X in stores except it this kit comes with two heads instead of one, the olay cleanser, a microbead exfoliator, and the product itself has 3 different types of speed rather than 2.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need turbo speeds and extreme force like some customers talked about. The motorized brush is just the right pressure and speed to not cause damage, but to allow you to get the cleaning/abrasive effect you need. My skin does feel and look better than when I first started! Four stars only because they give you very little product. I have to find replacement tubes now... I feel that this kit worked for me!</li>
            <li> The sponge are poor quality!</li>
            <li> Somebody said I looked whiter...</li>
            <li> Debated about buying a clairsonic but went with the olay pro-x after reading all the reviews and seeing the huge price difference.  Was the best decision because my skin felt smoother after just one use and it is looks brighter after only 1 week.  I have already had people ask me what i&#x27;m doing differently because they&#x27;ve noticed my skin is so even-toned.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase: great price, great quality, works amazingly. People saying it&#x27;s prone to skin probably use this too frequent at speed 2 or 3. If you use once a day and keep it max at speed 2, it&#x27;s fine. Maybe not suitable for very sensitive skin, might cause itchiness.Hope the samples given can be a bit bigger. 20 ml is too little</li>
            <li> Awful Product -- just Awful</li>
            <li> My skin has changed dramatically since I used it. You have acne? Then use this amazing product with a tea tree oil cleanser! You can never go wrong and it will disappear completely !!.,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to spend money on the pricey alternatives - this, so far, has done the job.  May invest in the more expensive one in the future based on how much I love this product!</li>
            <li> vert good for cleansing</li>
            <li> As I previously owned a Clarisonic Plus face and body system, I&#x27;m familiar with what a mechanical cleansing brush should be able to do.  My Clarisonic system was returned to Sephora due to a problem with staying charged and the fact that while I liked using it, at around a cost of $200 it wasn&#x27;t that much, if any, better than using a manual face brush.  Since I like some of the Olay moisturizers as well as other high end products, I thought I&#x27;d give this brush a try.  Sadly, this brush has such little power that it wouldn&#x27;t even make a good toy.  I struggled using it through two cleansings and gave up the third time and went back to my manual brushes.  I have a soft $25 Shiseido brush and Sephora&#x27;s $7 brush that&#x27;s a bit firm, and they do a much better job than this Olay system.  The Olay brush has a different method of action than the Clarisonic line.  The Clarisonic brush heads move VERY little in sort of a pulsating action.  The Olay brush head rotates around and around and tugs at your skin.  It&#x27;s a very odd sensation and one that I didn&#x27;t like.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the brush catching my pulled back hair, but the foam pad easily snagged and pulled small wisps each time I used it.  If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this, save yourself the trouble of returning it and don&#x27;t bother.  If you really want a power brush, I suggest saving your money, doing your research and buying a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I really like it. I have large pores and this feels just like the micro at the spa.  Use the Olay micro crystals for best results.</li>
            <li> I like the 3 speed settings. The lowest setting gives you nice facial massage. Tiny tubs of cleansers that come with it won&#x27;t last very long. Maybe 2 weeks if you&#x27;re only using a small drop with your daily cleansing?! Also when I opened my batter compartment there was some creamy (clear/whitish) stuff that i cleaned out first. Not sure if anyone else had that problem. Haven&#x27;t tried the 3rd speed setting for the microderm sponge yet.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> mother happy to receive</li>
            <li> Was used after the skin is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Is a very good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this product would live up to it&#x27;s own description but unfortunately it falls short. I have had much better results from a good exfoliating face wash then I have with this. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week and the amount of time it takes, and the lack of results it produces is very disappointing. I would recommend anyone looking for the results this product claims to provide to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My wife said it was just an OK product. She doesn&#x27;t recommend buying one unless it is on sale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try one of these facial systems for a while so I decided to go ahead &amp; get this. I honestly think I&#x27;ve broken out more since using it but any product that gets you to clean your face better more often can&#x27;t be all bad  :)  As for having more radiant skin I&#x27;m thinking you either have it to begin with or you don&#x27;t.  I think this product would be great to have had when I was a teenager promoting better care of my skin at a younger age.  If your older &amp; looking for that magic wand that&#x27;s going to turn back the hands of time or erase the damage you&#x27;ve done to your skin already then this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried a similar product and it was rougher on the skin and very expensive</li>
            <li> does a better job than hand scrubs or gloves..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product a few weeks so I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve seen all of the benefits yet, but so far, so good.  It is easy to use, the fragrance is lovely, it isn&#x27;t harsh on my fairly sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to use.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing just how improved my skin will be after a few more weeks of use.  I&#x27;ve had professional microdermabrasion done a few times and loved it, but it is really expensive and time consuming to go to the doctor&#x27;s office.  Olay&#x27;s option is far more reasonable with regard to both time and cost.  I recommend the microdermabrasion plus kit.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with a few replacement heads . Great product</li>
            <li> I think this product is great for that microdermabrasion process, but for me, its too much - an electric brush with two heads and 2 different lotions...i don&#x27;t have that much room in the bathroom to keep all this plus my other toiletries. I think it does what it says (I&#x27;ve used it only a handful of times), but I found that a clay facial once or twice a week does what I need sufficiently.</li>
            <li> The machine is pretty weak, it&#x27;s a decent product but it&#x27;s way over priced</li>
            <li> Very compact and right size fro me.Been using this as soon as i got it.and,  so far so good,looking forward to see results on my skin soon.</li>
            <li> Pulls my skin. Very little power.</li>
            <li> As a man, every time I use this I think to myself, &amp;#34;Why am I using this instead of a wash cloth?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> works great, the smooth finishing pad did not hold up very well. The brush scrubber works great.</li>
            <li> I love this and the price was right. I was not going to pay a hundred some bucks for the same thing in another brand. My skin feels good and looks better. Used the two Olay products that came with it. Since they ran out, I use my own products. Get one, you will not regret it. Worth the money but not worth a hundred and some dollars some where else.</li>
            <li> Great service, quality is very good</li>
            <li> I love this kit it really works as my skin is smoother and brighter, and the price was great!</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the results &amp; love the fact that it does as good if not better than than the expensive Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> this is a nice tool and product.  I have what I call sandpaper forhead and after I use the wash and scrubber (microdermabrasion) product and tool, my skin is no longer rough. Now I just need to use it more often...</li>
            <li> A good product.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have some before and after photos I will post soon. I have noticed a difference in my skin which looks clearer, and my scars seem to be fading. The wrinkles on my forehead are less defined. All in all a very good investement!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now. Using both the cleanser and crystals that came with the package. I really like the way it makes my skin feel. Perhaps it is an illusion, but I believe it makes it look younger as well (I&#x27;m 50+). For the price and ease, I&#x27;d certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Product review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item looked bigger on photo.  It is smaller than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well but is too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RVilchez</li>
            <li> So far so nice machine, i noticed a diffrence from the first week.</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten it sooner. It does exactly what it says. Powerful motor, fits in your hand..awesome</li>
            <li> I love using this product once a week. My face feels smooth and clean. I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My acne definitely reduced shortly after using this product. I don&#x27;t have as many breakouts. I don&#x27;t use the olay products but I do use other facial products and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Haven&#x27;t had this too long and have yet to use the samples because I bought another facial product to use, overall I really enjoy this facial scrubber. The right amount of speeds. I normally use it at 2nd to 3rd speed depending where I use it on my face but it doesn&#x27;t skip a beat. Comes with batteries which is great! Not off brand batteries either. Easy to operate. Very pleased because I&#x27;ve had scrubbers in the past but they were vibrating ones this is my first rotating facial scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price range. It works well my skins been super smooth. I looked into a few Clarisonic brushes but yli couldn&#x27;t imagine the results being better than what they were. The only issue was that the head doesn&#x27;t clasp onto the motor properly it&#x27;s a weak fixture.</li>
            <li> Very helpful. It cleared my skin after a couple of weeks. Imagine! I use to have dry skin flaking. There&#x27;s a wedding coming so I wanted to prepare my skin. It did work! Now, it is flawless. My make-up artist and my sister who is the bride as well commented how beautiful my skin was! will continue to use this! Excellent and affordable!</li>
            <li> Used it a couple of times for the microdermabrasion and the exfoliating system and it made my skin look very smooth and clean!</li>
            <li> i put it on my face and it made it smell like a 3 month dead tuna trapped in a fart can with onions and garlic hot breathe in a hole covered in burnt pubic hair from a 500 pound man that has not seen his downstairs in a while let alone washed it. acne did not go away.</li>
            <li> A bit harsh for my skin. Have to use the microdermabrasion only once every other week.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price. I am glad I bought this unit.</li>
            <li> I received this a few days ago and used it right out of the box. As many have said before there are no instructions included with the product. I first wet my skin and then applied the crystals which made for an easier application of the crystals on my face. It almost felt like I was rubbing concrete on my face, however that was not a bad thing. I started on the higher setting and then played around with it. I rinsed my face by splashing then I attempted to do so with a wash clothe. I still had residual crystals on certain parts of my face. I switched to the brush and used the cleanser, I also used another product to help clean which was also an exfoliator and I must say that my face feels extremely smooth. I noticed that it has a certain glow to it that it did not have before. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. The pad for the dermabrasion gel was a little awkward to use. My fingers worked better. The little brush is nice. You can use it with your other cleansers.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference! Smaller pores and brighter skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run fast enough or strong enough to accomplish anything.  Battery power is not appropriate for this type of tool</li>
            <li> Havnt noticed a difference , oh except me breaking out in hives after using... Awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with acne scarring and overall deep cleaning for my face. Turns out it actually was a little too much for my skin. Maybe I have really sensitive skin, but for some reason the longer I used this, the more I broke out. I broke out in places I haven&#x27;t had a breakout in years. My skin is actually worse than when I first started. Only when I stopped did I start to notice an improvement in my skin. I only used the brush a few times, on the medium setting, but clearly my skin couldn&#x27;t handle it. This has worked well for so many people, but I&#x27;m sad to say it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> i bought this prompted by curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;but it is helpful skin clearing in my face - than my thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! It&#x27;s like having a mini facial without spending a ton at a salon! I really have seen an improvement in my complexion and would reccomend this to anyone. Just be prepared to replace the brushes that come with it as needed.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before so have nothing to compare with at present.  I am 67, and have some sun damage from decades ago. Too rough on my skin with the abrasive cream that is included, but the sponge pads feel good. I like that I can use rechargeable batteries in it.  I got it during a Lightning Deal for around $20 and I&#x27;ve always wondered if it would improve the texture of my skin.  I like the size and it is very comfortable in my hand.  Facial brushes are soft and reasonably priced on Subscribe and Save. If it lasts for a year, I&#x27;ll be happy enough.  I&#x27;m willing to wait for results and if it lightens up my age spots, I&#x27;ll report back in a six (or sooner) months.</li>
            <li> * updated review *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally gave this 4 stars but am now dropping it to one. It stopped working after just a few months. I only used it once/twice a week, always used good quality, fresh batteries and took excellent care of it. At first, I thought something was wrong with the batteries, I cringe to think of how many batteries I wasted thinking they were bad. But then it refused to turn on right after I installed new batteries only moments before. Strikes One and Two&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also received a cheapo version of thesr scrubbers and was shocked to find that this name brand,  Oil of Olay scrubber didn&#x27;t have anymore power than the dollar store model! Strike three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not worth spending your hard earned money on. Save up and buy one of the fancy Clairsonic&#x27;s instead of wasting money on this. Look at all of the one star reviews with people saying theirs also stopped working after just a few months (weeks or days for some). Shame on you Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve wanted one of these microdermabrasion kits for a couple of years but never could convince myself to drop the $30-$40 for them.  So I was thrilled to get to try out the Olay Pro-X Cleaning System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box doesn&#x27;t really have any directions as to what to do other than to get your face wet, put the cleanser on one of the brushes and start spinning it on your face.  With a little puzzle solving, I came to the conclusion that the brush head, the one with the bristles, is meant to be used for cleaning your face.  I guess the speed you choose is up to you.  Then that leaves the flat sponge type head to put the polisher on, sort of like a light sandpaper.  Again, you spin it on your desired speed all over your face.  This is what I came up with, I could be completely wrong but as I said, there weren&#x27;t any instructions in my package.  I&#x27;m not sure how often you should be doing this, how long for each time, what results I&#x27;m actually supposed to see and how soon, etc.  All of that lack of information has sort of made me feel like I&#x27;m just washing my face with a spinning tooth brush and some type of soap.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin but maybe I&#x27;m not using it enough?  My skin does feel really soft after I use it and I don&#x27;t have any lingering breakouts, redness or rashes.  It is relaxing to have the brush sort of lightly massage your face and I suppose after you run out of the included cleansing creams you could just use anything you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if all microdermabrasion kits are like this or if it&#x27;s just assumed that the person who buys one will have had it done in a salon at some point and will already know what to do, but I&#x27;m the type of person who like clear and concise direction so I know what the end goal is and I didn&#x27;t get that with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I put it in my &amp;#34;weird beauty gadgets&amp;#34; box - not a fail but not something I&#x27;ll use on a routine basis either.me feel like I&#x27;m just washing my face with a spinning tooth brush and some type of soap.

            <li> My daughter was very excited to find this gift under the Christmas tree this year. It keeps her motivated to take care of her skin without my constant harping.</li>
            <li> Feeling very good, clean</li>
            <li> Terrible experience.  Used twice but stopped working after the second time.  Replaced battery but it does not work.</li>
            <li> So worth the money.  My skin has never been so clear and I feel like I&#x27;m getting such a better clean!</li>
            <li> As a 30-something still dealing with mild breakouts and dark spots, I was worried this would irritate my skin. I was very pleasantly surprised that after 4 weeks of use my skin is noticeably brighter, smoother, and clearer! After the first week of course I had a few new breakouts which is normal for me when I start any new regimine on my skin, but now my skin has cleared up and isn&#x27;t irritated at all from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this brush twice a day. I use the microdermabrasion twice a week and the other exfoliating product 1-2 times a week. The rest of the time I use a gentle face wash on the brush. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of reviewers compared this product (and other brands like it) to the more &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; priced Clarisonic, which will cost at least $100. I&#x27;ve never used a Clarisonic, and this is the first of its kind that I&#x27;ve bought, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like it, it works fine for me. Afterwards, I did feel that my face was clean, and it also felt a bit tight afterwards. I&#x27;ve already dropped it in the sink, with the batteries flying out and all, but it didn&#x27;t break, so it seems durable to me too. Runs on AA batteries, which came with it, so that&#x27;s a plus. Came with 2 coupons also, each were $3 off of Olay products. I used both brushes, and I liked that the spinning head rotated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with the product, and it wasn&#x27;t expensive (at least, not in my opinion, I&#x27;ve eaten out at restaurants that cost more than this), so I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t expect this to be dermatologist grade, and anymore expecting some sort of at-home spa equipment is a sucker. Obviously you&#x27;re not going to get the same results as going to the dermatologist for a microdermabrasion, that&#x27;s why it cost you a few hundred dollars to have something like that done at a spa/clinic in the first place!</li>
            <li> Love this system, makes my skin feel so soft!</li>
            <li> No directions came with the purchase and the amount of product was very discouraging.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this Nov 5th 2014,and after almost 3 months stop working, and return policy window was closed 1/31/2015,all I need have it replaced. I thought it has at least one year warranty.thank you.</li>
            <li> I sent this back. I was dissappointed that Olay made this product seem like a microdermabraion product, but it was no better than putting scrub on my fingers and rubbing it in my face. Clarisonic cost a lot more but well worth it. This product is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Where do I begin with this? lets start with the price sha&#x27;ll we?&lt;br /&gt;its $40... which (as you can tell) I really didn&#x27;t mind it.. since I bought it.. but when it arrived in the mail- I realized I really got jipped.&lt;br /&gt;the quantity of the bottles are SMALLER than a travel size tube. how am I supposed to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; out the product with such little quantity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;quality?&lt;br /&gt;I really cant tell you if it works or not because to be honest with you- it was so little that I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;and I am NOT buying more! -__-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the quality of the machine- is HORRIBLE. yes it has 3 pulses, but none are stronger than my electronic toothbrush. in FACT- the damn thing keeps turning off on me when I put it on my face. YOU CANNOT BUT ANY PREASURE OR IT TURNS OFF... it is so annoying, I literally want to throw it against the wall and break it in two!!!&lt;br /&gt;for that I say It is DEFINATELY not worth your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you have a better chance doing it manually (and by that I mean buy a brush and scrub your face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is a really bad product and I wish I could get my money back!!!</li>
            <li> Cleans well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> There are gritty creams that work just as well as this device.  The device doesn&#x27;t do anything more than I can with my hands.</li>
            <li> made a big difference on my skin, pimples are gone and my skin so smooth</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I wish I would have known about it sooner. I&#x27;ve been using expensive glycolic washes, etc. to help with my post-acne scar discoloration and to prevent/reduce acne - this things works Best! I am very happy with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I purchased the kit at Target but still wanted to write a review on Amazon since that&#x27;s where many people come to read reviews about various products.</li>
            <li> good!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great value.  I go through skin care products faster than underwear and everyone knows they should exfoliate.  Most exfoliating products tend to feel too abrasive to me but this offers a few options for speed.  I love the thermal crystal polish but I&#x27;ve never seen it in stores around here.  At first, I was worried if it was water proof but Ive dunked mine in the sink a few times.  This is a permanent member of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Love it, it does the job, massages face skin and cleans it really good.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this, I figured it either wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough to notice or it would rip my skin off. Neither is true - it is just right. The brush has 3 speeds, 2 for daily cleaning and 1 for deep microdermabrasion. The first speed doesn&#x27;t do much for me, I like the second with the brush and cleanser for daily use. I have tender skin, but weekly microdermabrasion at the high speed, pad and microdermabrasion crystals have left my skin really smooth and soft. Do I look younger, not really, but my skin does look healthier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything else to compare this to other than using my hands or a facial puff. This is my first powered experience and it was fine. I have yet to use the microdermabrasion head, and will try it soon. My face feels clean without feeling tight, like using a harsh soap. Skin feels smooth and all the makeup comes off, except eye makeup - but I usually use coconut oil for that anyway. I doubt that this brush is all that different from it&#x27;s $200 counterpart. If I use one, I will let you know.</li>
            <li> It &#x27;a good product, similar to the Clarisonic, not equal. Cleans the skin well, the brush is not aggressive and that for dermabrasion either, so if you expect immediate results you will have them not, perhaps with constant use. But despite this I am satisfied. I have a combination skin and not too delicate.</li>
            <li> Virtually no directions and/or instructions on this product so I was at a loss when I discovered that the cleanser brush head &amp;#34; wobbled &amp;#34; or pivoted when it  clicked on the unit. I asked the people here @ Amazon whether the head was supposed to &amp;#34; wobble &amp;#34; or pivot and most people answered &amp;#34; no &amp;#34; and 1 person advised that her cleanser brush head also &amp;#34; wobbled &amp;#34; or pivoted but  she added that she didn&#x27;t know whether or not it was supposed to &amp;#34; wobble &amp;#34; or pivot like this either ?&lt;br /&gt;So......I phoned the Oil of Olay Corporation itself and was informed that the cleanser brush head was  not supposed to &amp;#34; wobble &amp;#34; or pivot like it did/&lt;br /&gt;Therefore I am sending this defective unit back to Amazon  for a refund &amp; I learned that I was apparently not the only one to purchase a defective Olay Pro-X from Amazon</li>
            <li> My face feels a bit smoother and cleaner than just soap and a wash cloth. I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting. I wasn&#x27;t impressed nor dissapointed.  If you want a better clean and a little more softness, I would recommend it. But if you are expecting a miracle, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> really good quality product and the results are great!&lt;br /&gt;my wife use it and loves it</li>
            <li> Cleans well, spin is slower than I expected though.  Does the job well.</li>
            <li> Expected something with a little more power &amp; effect. Does not seem like it can really do much for skin.,</li>
            <li> Really cleaned my face and made it so much brighter. My pores look reduced and my skin feels great. I bought a second system for my 22 year old daughter. She really likes hers.</li>
            <li> very good,if shipping can be faster</li>
            <li> Very good, face skin&#x27;s alive.</li>
            <li> The Cleaner does its job,But not sure of the microderbasion brush,seems to be on the lighter side with low to no effects been seen over last few months of usage.</li>
            <li> I really like my kit and I&#x27;m buying for the next one! It made my skin glow thank you Olay</li>
            <li> Works great! Delivered super fast</li>
            <li> I bought this item ($30) and used it for a week before I left it on the bathroom counter where the kids got ahold of it and lost the brush head forever. And of course, the replacement heads were &amp;#34;currently unavailable&amp;#34; from Amazon. For the week that I used it, I seemed to like it okay... until I tried some other ones. I grabbed a wooden handle face brush from the drug store for a couple bucks then found a plastic handled (to keep in the shower) soft bristle face brush, from Big Lots of all places. I paid $1.25 for it and I absolutely love it!! Save your money on this one. I wish I had. On the plus side it does come with the batteries (although I now realize this is pointless, because you WILL use your arms anyway) and I do love the Olay line of face products.</li>
            <li> It was ok, I didn&#x27;t notice anything special. I do like the spin brush that came with it. I&#x27;m a black female 36.</li>
            <li> Got it for my mom for christmas and she loves the way her skin feels! super soft and healthy glow</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I thought it would be.  It does clean my face a little better than if I just used my cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product worked great i loved it and would buy it again. Told  my sister and mother in law and they  bought one.</li>
            <li> Only used twice but I think it is pretty good  except not very good instruction</li>
            <li> I love it. I can see the difference in cleanliness. I&#x27;m very happy that I bought it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using this a few months now and it seems pretty durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the olay pro x for a week, but so far I can see a difference in my skin. My skin is smoother and my pores appear smaller. I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day because my skin is super sensitive and has to be phased into using a new face wash. But so far it&#x27;s been working. I have not used the microdermabrasion treatment, but when I do I will come back and give a review. The brush head is smaller than I thought it would be, and the brissles are super soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would clear my acne and not irritated my skin, i only used the device it did what it was supposed too do. ived used it for about a week b4 i stop. I did find it fun but it was just not for me. Ill stick with using my hands. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have the other Pro x kit so I&#x27;m used to using the scrub.  What I like about this product is that your face is very smooth afterwords.  Because I have the brush from the other Pro x kit and this 3 speed brush, I use the 3 speed just for micro derm abrasion and the other brush for daily wash.  You do feel a warming sensation but it&#x27;s not bothersome.  I was afraid at first that my face would burn but it&#x27;s a soothing warming feeling, almost like you&#x27;re at a spa.  Now the fat brush with the microderm scrub does tug at your face but if you don&#x27;t put a lot of pressure it doesn&#x27;t tug as much. But that&#x27;s fine. I like this product.  I only gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t use it as often but after I use it (and use it only twice a week) my face is smooth, and I notice my moisturizer, face serum, and makeup go on smoother and applies easier.</li>
            <li> It works ok. I bought it to replace an older one. The Olay brushes seen way too soft and I just don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting anything I wouldn&#x27;t without it. I don&#x27;t want to use sandpaper, but it should exfoliate better. I&#x27;ll try a different brands next time.</li>
            <li> Quite nice. It hasn&#x27;t been a magic wand, but my face has improved a bit since I started to use this.</li>
            <li> It seems to work very good.  I haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use it very long, but so far I am pleased with the results.  The price was also very appealing.</li>
            <li> Did what it said it would, but constantly tangled in my wife&#x27;s hair and was painful. Returned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two days.It deep cleans the face and remove dirt from the pores. I can feel the softness on my skin.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted a clarisonic because I&#x27;d heard such good things about it. The problem was that it is expensive, so I got this instead. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year now and haven&#x27;t seen much difference but it is better and easier than washing your face with your hands. I don&#x27;t use the Olay brand cleaners, but it works just as well without them.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully make my face feel so soft and it diminishes dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product. Started to notice my skin was much softer after a week of using it. I love this thing definitely would recommend thing product to my friends.</li>
            <li> It works good but batteries run low often.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to help with some blemishes. She uses it everday. It has really help her skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my order. I even saved a few bucks by using Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice little brush for the price! Face feels great!</li>
            <li> My skin is dry (I&#x27;m in my 50s and live in a dry climate). But, if I put on too much moisturizer, my pores get clogged.  I wanted to purchase the Clairisonic, but wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend &amp;#60;$120.  This is the perfect solution.  I&#x27;ve been using now for about two weeks, and have noticed a big difference in my skin (and it&#x27;s not just delusion, I promise). Dry patches are gone, little funky bumps now gone - I have a condition called Millia (little annoying white bumps that look like zits, but they&#x27;re not) - this has help to diminish those, as well.  I use then microdermabrasion three times per week (not on consecutive days).  The daily scrub the remaining days.  I think this product helps my moisturizer work more efficiently, and I use less. This was worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had the regular brush and it was great. This one turns off after it being on for 3 seconds, which is strange. I&#x27;m returning it and getting the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Olay brush and saving $10.</li>
            <li> I love this my face feels so much more cleaner</li>
            <li> Product just as promised - better price than local retailer. I&#x27;ve had it for over a month with no problems.</li>
            <li> Excellent and makes my face feel and look great..</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my skin from only using it in the past week. I had looked at the more expensive brands but opted for this instead. Glad I did! Does a great job in cleaning my face!</li>
            <li> I love Olay and this product did not disappoint.  I was wondering whether the brush would be strong enough with only 2 double A batteries but it works great!</li>
            <li> The brush stopped working after about 5 uses. I replaced the batteries, still not working. Terrible waste of money. And the amount of product in the tubes is a flat out joke.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small and flimsy.  I bought it to replace my Clarisonic that was fabulous, but didn&#x27;t last long and was very expensive.  This turned out to be expensive too because it doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> Best facial thing I have bought EVER! The only down side is if you want to go pick up a new microderm wash you really gotta look because most places don&#x27;t carry it (or at least we haven&#x27;t found many in San Diego) the other wash is all over but we just buy the brush replacement so we each have our own and use our normal face wash and I haven&#x27;t had but maybe one break out a month when it used to be weekly. LOOOOOOVE this product!!&lt;br /&gt;The difference between this and the red box is this one has a third and faster &amp;#34;microdermabrasion&amp;#34; speed, so if you don&#x27;t want to use the three speeds then the other one will save a few bucks but is the same thing - my friend has the other one.</li>
            <li> I love the product, My skin felt great and looked fresh. I have told my daughter and daughter in law about the product. They are going to try it also.</li>
            <li> Guys care about their skin, too... I remember as a teen, I used to break out occasionally and used a blue, pleasant-smelling facial scrub with small &#x27;particles&#x27; in it (&#x27;Brasivol&#x27;), that provided what was to become &#x27;dermabrasion&#x27; treatments that cost hundreds in a spa or salon today.  Back then, &#x27;Brasivol&#x27; was under five bucks!  They still sell a similar one (Pernox scrub, also around five bucks back in the &#x27;70s, but now closer to $75.00!) But they both worked.  The one I used then left my skin somewhat dry, but noticeably cleaner than it had been in days and cleared the way for any further treatment (Persadox, benzoyl peroxide cream), I would use. In today&#x27;s world, expensive moisturizers are used instead. (Or with medicated acne treatment, if needed.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what held true all those years ago also holds true today.  The Olay Pro-X Plus Advanced Cleansing System DOES accomplish the same, very thorough cleansing of all of your pores, with the ease of the dermabrasion brush doing all of the scrubbing &#x27;work&#x27; for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I like about this product (besides the batteries being included, as in the Pro-X System), is that it does what it claims to do (advised no more than 2X per week for thorough microdermasion treatment, at least a day apart), which DOES leave my skin noticeably cleaner.  Also, that there are 3 speeds instead of 2, and when the included Olay&#x27;s exfoliating &#x27;Renewal Cleanser&#x27; and &#x27;Thermal Crystal Skin Polisher&#x27; run out, you can use your preference of cleansers and moisturizers (as well as Olay&#x27;s excellent brands, of course.)  Last, but not least, for daily use, you can interchange the gentle cleansing brushes included with the previous &#x27;Pro-X Intensive Wrinkle Protocol System.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like a company that, these days, makes a product they are confident in and stand behind.  In this case, it is the &#x27;Olay Professional Promise,&#x27; your guaranteed satisfaction with their Pro-X Advanced System or your money back.  In this case, with the very good results I can clearly see, I won&#x27;t be taking them up on it, but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s there.ith the very good results I can clearly see, I won&#x27;t be taking them up on it, but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks. I&#x27;ve done the crystals three of the nights and the cleanser alone on the other days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing cream is designed to work with the scrubber and I like it fine. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference with it or other cream cleansers at this point. Prior to this, I used a variety of cleansers and I wash my face with my hands (versus using a washcloth) unless my makeup needs some extra help to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN TYPE: Oily ...  MY CLIMATE: humid (so I wouldn&#x27;t normally need much moisturizing, but even with the natural conditioning, my skin feels softer and smoother with this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used nearly identical crystals with [[ASIN:B000F63TW0 Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion &amp; Peel System 1 Kit]] where you rub the crystals with your hand around a wet face and then apply a thermal product. That one was cool, but rubbing the crystals with your hands is fairly abrasive. Your hands get kind of sore. So having the tool is a real bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crystal \\&quot;salve\\&quot; from both products require rinsing and rubbing off with wet hands or a washrag, but I tend to use less with this system so it&#x27;s easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor..well, I can&#x27;t see much use for level 1, but I guess that&#x27;s a personal thing. I tend to use the highest level on everything and it&#x27;s not nearly as powerful as I had imagined. I would like to see a proportionately level 5 at least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the tool can be an improvement to using your hands:&lt;br /&gt;1. The abrasive crystals in the salve are abrasive to your hands&lt;br /&gt;2. It keeps everything cleaner&lt;br /&gt;3. Probably more gentle to use the cushioned disk. It seems to limit the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professional microdermabrasian has a reputation for leaving skin raw, so I expected something MORE when I used this... Like raw skin or something. But that might be actually damaging to the skin. And painful. This is not painful. It&#x27;s slow and steady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict on my skin? It&#x27;s definitely smoother. In two weeks, my dark spots do seem a teeny bit lighter. Olay does not promise that it will change that soon. It seems my occasional acne has not been appearing. But honestly, the first few days it seemed like it was.. so it may have been drawing out the bacteria at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product and rinsing your face. Pat dry and apply a good night cream or Argan Oil (that stuff is fabulous for making your skin soft). When you need to refill the crystals, I recommend getting the set mentioned above [[ASIN:B000F63TW0 Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion &amp; Peel System 1 Kit]] because the warming product is very cool and it will work better with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I wasn&#x27;t excited about the product, but I have been converted and I do like it. I like how it does go into the crannies of my face if I move it around enough and it feels good to me during and after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon provided me this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I know 5 stars is a lot and I don&#x27;t give that easily, but for the price and what you get and how well it works, I think it deserves it. It&#x27;s not a facelift, but it does make for a soft face and will work those nasty dead cells off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]y does not promise that it will change that soon.

            <li> Great product! Thermal heat gel with the soft brush removed dirt and cleared my skin. It was rejuvenating.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these for a while and mine stopped working after Years!  I Love this set!</li>
            <li> This is a nice set of exfoliates but the face brush wasn&#x27;t powerful enough for me. Maybe used along with a Clarisonic brush the effect I want would be better. I&#x27;d probably buy the scrubs alone next time and invest in Clarisonic</li>
            <li> The sample cleansing cream was way too small.  The rotating mechanism on the wand was weak and vibates.  It would dtop vibrating with any pressure.</li>
            <li> The system works pretty well. However, I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any difference yet. My complaint is the battery compartment. It seems that it&#x27;s closed properly without the batteries, but when I put the batteries in, the compartment does not close all the way? I have tried everything to make it fit properly? So as I am using it, if I am not very careful, the battery compartment just pops open.  I did not read all the reviews but wondered if anyone else has this problem? Maybe it&#x27;s just the one that I have? Other than that it does make your skin feel very smooth afterwards. But I have only been using it for about a week.</li>
            <li> Very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I used easily.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is an incredible product. The two heads come off and on easy and it is very simple to operate. After a few weeks of use my skin is noticeably brighter, smoother, and has less blemishes. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is just to buy&lt;br /&gt;My choice is not wrong very good</li>
            <li> I think it works but it needs time and the right facial wash .</li>
            <li> This machine is not strong enough. We had to return it and get Neutrogena instead.</li>
            <li> My wife absolutely loves it. I got it for her birthday  and she uses it daily. Happy wife happy life!!</li>
            <li> I love this machine. It makes your face feel so clean and I really notice the difference. I know there are others that cost way much more, but this one is a reasonable price and does its work.</li>
            <li> love this brush and its speeds.</li>
            <li> I was excited about purchasing this product as my skin had begun to show the signs of aging (I am 40 yrs) like dull skin, dark spots, fine lines and uneven skin tone. You get everything for a start in this kit, batteries, a small cleanser, a small microdermabrasion scrub, 2 brushed and 1 head unit. The crystals are warming and when used with the sponge brush its made my skin smoother and soft to touch. When I first used it I felt that the brush stretched my skin when rotating. But wetting my face properly and in between the scrubs made it a smoother glide. My dark spots have faded a little and now my skin looks fresh and clean. I would recommend the use of a good night cream after using the pro-X because the skin could feel a bit raw initially. But this product is worth a try and can replace at least some of the expensive anti-aging creams.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly for the little brush and I really do like it.  I works great with a facial scrub, just enough power to feel it but not enough to cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance.  She said to rate it 5 stars.  A common question is what&#x27;s the difference between the two: Olay Pro-X Advanced System  - two speeds  - single brush - cleaner    Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced   - 3 speeds - foam pad and the brush - cleanser and polisher included</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say this has improved the look and feel of my skin.  It&#x27;s made my face so smooth and it feels so clean after I use this.  I can really see the improvement in how my face looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the shower and it&#x27;s easy to hold on to.  I have long nails and the buttons are very easy to push.  It comes with a microdermabrasion foam head and a cleansing brush head.  I like the way the microdermabrasion head makes my face feel.  My skin feels like it has had layers of dead skin removed and it&#x27;s bright and shiny.  I didn&#x27;t realize how old dead skin on the face can make us look!  I&#x27;m really pleased with how well this product works.</li>
            <li> I have used [[ASIN:B000F63TW0 Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion &amp; Peel System Kit]] in the past and have been quite pleased with it. The results were gradual -- so gradual in fact you would be hard-pressed to notice the improvements from one treatment to the next. But the Regenerist Kit definitely works. I only wished I didn&#x27;t have to wait so long to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the \\&quot;Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System Kit,\\&quot; which contains two \\&quot;systems\\&quot; -- (1) \\&quot;Pro-X Microdermabrasion System\\&quot; and (2) \\&quot;Plus Advanced Cleansing System.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion System (which consists of the sponge attachment and microdermabrasion crystals [tube with the blue cap]), I was honestly blown away by the difference it made after the first treatment. I&#x27;d have to say Pro-X lives up to its promise of removing contaminants and dead skin that rob your face of its luster to reveal smoother and younger looking skin (I know I sound like an ad, but I assure you I&#x27;m no shill ;-)). It&#x27;s no fountain of youth to be sure, but it&#x27;s sure impressed the heck out of me. I suspect the results are due in large part to the electric powered abrasive action (as opposed to applying the microdermabrasion crystals by hand). Important Note: the Microdermabrasion System is to be used ONLY TWO (non-consecutive) days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit also comes with a \\&quot;Plus Advanced Cleansing System,\\&quot; which consists of the brush attachment and cleanser [tube with the red cap]. The cleanser works very well to remove dirt and grime from my face without overdrying. The Plus Advanced Cleansing System, unlike the Microdermabrasion System, is gentle enough to be used everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have to say I&#x27;m extremely pleased with the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System Kit. I sincerely hope it works as well for you as it did for me. I&#x27;m giving the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System Kit my HIGHEST recommendation!ndation!</li>
            <li> Very impressed.  I don&#x27;t see a difference between this Olay brand and the expensive calarasonic.  I&#x27;ve tried both.  Have used it daily for 2 months now and still haven&#x27;t replaced the batteries.  My skin feels amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the BEST product out there but this product definitely works and cleans the skin thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;For the money it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I use this every night. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping for powerful exfoliation but I was very disappointed.  I&#x27;ve always exfoliated with a cheap white sponge and went straight back to it after using this thing once.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill. But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed by what one use did to my pores. I&#x27;ve used every blackhead scrub known to man with little or no success in clearing my pores from the little black spots you can see close up.  My problematic areas are my nose and my chin. One use almost completely did away with the small stubborn blackheads in those areas.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was bc I felt it could use more power.  I&#x27;ve heard about how amazing the clairsonic brush is and after this one is done I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll make the investment.</li>
            <li> My mom and sister have both been using the Olay Pro-X for about a year, and have had nothing negative to say about it.  Personally, I am a devoted user of my Mia, and have been overall happy enough with it to not go looking for additional \\&quot;face brushes\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I haven&#x27;t found a microdermabrasion treatment yet that I have been satisfied with and, when given the chance to try Olay&#x27;s version, I went for it.  Now, this isn&#x27;t a separate system from the normal Pro-X; the Microdermabrasion aspect comes in the form of an additional \\&quot;brush\\&quot; for the the Pro-X--more like a cotton round, really--as well as their own cleansing crystal formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been happy with its use, although I must say that I don&#x27;t feel the same cleansing \\&quot;pressure\\&quot; on my skin that I do with the Mia, in the use of either extension for the Pro-X.  The included cleansers, however, are nice, if not amazing.  They have a nice smell, and leave me with a clean feeling (although as with any crystal microdermabrasion cleanser, be extra careful to fully rinse off any residual crystals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are different speeds as well, which was new for me (the Mia only has one).  However, I didn&#x27;t find myself really using this feature too much, as I found the faster speeds to feel even less thorough than the slower ones.  Also, I found myself missing the Mia&#x27;s timed cycle of 60 seconds.  This might seem a rather insignificant concern, but it was just something that makes me lean towards using the Mia over the Pro-X from what I&#x27;m used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is definitely a great system, but I don&#x27;t think I would recommend it over the Mia.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand the reviewers who are saying this device does something.  A washcloth or scrubby sponge for your face does as much and you can wash and dry those. The Thermal Polish cream was nice with a very fine grit. It left my face soft and smooth with a washcloth, however. Honestly, let&#x27;s be very real, this device is nothing at all close to microdermabrasion and Olay has stretched their credibility too much to have labeled it with the word microdermabrasion. I do understand that either amazon or Olay &amp;#34;gave&amp;#34; this product to customers in exchange for their review.  This should always be stated right off the start.</li>
            <li> I needed something to help me deep clean my face. Being Wheelchair bound in a home that is not exactly wheelchair assessable The Olay Pro-X System has been a big help in keeping my youthful look. So whether you can walk on your own feet or in a wheelchair I would recommend this for any lady who wants to keep her skin looking youthful.</li>
            <li> Having been using this product for several weeks.  I use the \\&quot;microdermabrasion\\&quot; part twice a week.  I can definetely see a difference in the look of my face.</li>
            <li> I have used it for couple of months now and I feel the difference on my face. Less pimples and cleaner pores.</li>
            <li> After using this once your skin feels so much softer and after a week definitely can feel and see a difference. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I actually did not use this, it was a gift for one of my children (I bought two) but they both love it and said it has really helped their skin to be smoother, less breakouts and overall softer and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> I am young enough that I felt as if I did not needed to start a nightly facial routine other than removing make up and washing face before bed but I was absolutely wrong. Although I didn&#x27;t have wrinkles or skin discoloration I definitely noticed amazing improvements by the second week. My face is brighter, skin is firm and MUCH younger looking. I had a few scars from teenage acne and they are nearly gone. I use the exfoliating pad twice a week and the cleansing brush nightly. After the 1st use you will feel your pores breathing unlike ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to admit that I only used the cleaning and exfoliating lotions that came with the system for about a week. I switch to the ROC MAX resurfacing facial cleanser in combination with the ROC nightly moisturizer but regardless of what cleansing products you use I am sure you will see results.</li>
            <li> Went in with fairly moderate expectations and have been impressed. It&#x27;s easy to use and does a far better job cleaning my pores and leaving my skin smooth than washing with hands. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product a couple of weeks but I can already tell my face is breighter and smoother...I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I first used the microdermabrasion portion of this product. After using it, i felt that my face was really clean and maybe thats all it was good for... but then I went to sleep and woke up and noticed a change in my skin. Having brown skin with sun damage I have had dark spots for years but I did notice a change.. although very little it&#x27;s my first use and I believe it can only go up from here.</li>
            <li> THE spongy head for abrasion seems to do nothing. I called and asked for a partial credit as I saw this product for a very similar price at a retailer but it included two huge included (free) tubes of the cleaners~! This came with tiny things.</li>
            <li> I really like this little unit; it&#x27;s easy to use and I can feel the difference in the surface of my skin after buffing.  The heads are easy to iinterchange and are well made.</li>
            <li> I used this once , so my review is based upon one use .  So far so good  skin felt smooth and clean .</li>
            <li> Rather use a hand scrubber</li>
            <li> I thought I could save $100 by getting this Olay version instead of a Mia Clarisonic. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The brush heads on the Olay just spin in circles--there is no movement within the brush itself. I used the Olay a few times and didn&#x27;t notice any difference, but I had never used a Clarisonic so I couldn&#x27;t compare. Well, last week at the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale I got the original Mia Clarisonic for $79. Let me just tell y&#x27;all: it&#x27;s night and day. After one use of the Clarisonic, my skin was smoother and my makeup went on much better. As is all too often the case with this type of thing, just save up to get the nice version instead of wasting money on something that&#x27;s just so-so and you don&#x27;t wind up using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because I did like one of the scrubs that came with this kit (the one that gets warm when you apply it.)</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. I rave about of all the time! My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and healthy in years. As a woman who wears makeup on a daily basis, this is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the kind of difference I was expecting there is only very slight brightening of the skin. the contents of the tube is much less than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleaning spin brush for almost a year and I feel pleased with the difference that&#x27;s it&#x27;s made in the appearance of my skin. Naturally I jumped at the opportunity to try this Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion kit and it does not disappoint! To give you a little background, I&#x27;m 38 years old with very sensitive, fair skin that reacts to most anti- aging skin care products and I&#x27;m prone to monthly hormonal breakouts. I have oilier skin during the warmer months and dry, flaky skin during the winter. Although I&#x27;ve had success with the Olay Advanced Cleaning brush, I initially felt a little hesitation to use the microdermabrasion head and accompanying thermal crystal cleanser. I&#x27;m thrilled to report that my initial worries were unfounded. My sensitive skin didn&#x27;t have any reactions or breakouts. As per the directions (found on the side of the box, not inside), I use the renewal cleansing brush with the exfoliating cleanser everyday and I use the microdermabrasion head with the thermal crystal cleanser twice a week with three days in between uses. After almost a month, my skin looks incredible! It looks smooth and fresh and it feels baby soft. I REALLY love this system! It&#x27;s effective, yet gentle enough for my sensitive skin and it&#x27;s affordable. Obviously everybody has different skin types and will react differently to products, but I feel good about recommending this system to people with normal skin or skin that is similar to my own that I&#x27;ve described above.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel brand new.</li>
            <li> I really did see and feel the difference of my face after using this. You will not be disappointed. Only 2 negative things. One is I thought it would be more powerfull rotation. And I really wish it had better directions in how to use it with the creams it comes with.</li>
            <li> Works great!!!! Notice a difference in my skin after three uses.  The cleanser and exfolliater are great products as well.  Recommend the three speed as this is over a two speed.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price~</li>
            <li> UPDATE: While it worked -it was just fine and I would have recommended this Olay face polishing unit;  now it simply wont turn on- I won&#x27;t repurchase. I will pay a little more to get some durability- not sure what that price range will be;  I&#x27;ve dropped to 3 stars- since the price is low, even with light use it comes out to pennys a day - but  I want my tools to last- my unit did not last (it often sat on the shelf for months at a time with no use, so when I say my use was light- I mean very light); original review follows....This has been a great addition to my skin care routine. While some reviewers complain that it rotates too slowly or isn&#x27;t otherwise powerful enough I&#x27;ve found that if it were faster or more powerful it would be way too easy to over do it and really irritate my face- too much power and in seconds you&#x27;ve irritated your skin- at least for me with a fair (blonde) complexion. It has changed the dull look to my somewhat dry winter complexion- it now looks fresh and more even without a stitch of makeup on- along with my other products (Sibu Sea  Buckthorn and some other essential oils that have also made a big difference) it has taken a few years off my appearance and I&#x27;m getting random compliments- a woman stopped me at the post office the other day to ask what I use on my face (I wasn&#x27;t wearing any makeup at all). An even bigger difference is my neck area around the crease: my neck was looking like what one would expect on an 80 year old- I had no idea that the problem was that I needed to exfoliate there. I stopped wearing any necklines that drew the eye to that area because I was so embarrassed- the difference between my neck and face made it look like I must have had a facelift- 80 year old neck and 50 year old face. Exfoliating was the key and while there are plenty of ways to exfoliate I&#x27;m now sold on this little tool- it&#x27;s so easy and convenient- I just keep it in the shower and use it gently and briefly about 3 times per week- just 2-3 passes per area. I am no longer embarrassed or obsessed about hiding my neck- I don&#x27;t even think about it anymore. It took about 3 weeks of regular use to get the result I now have- I recommend going gently and briefly and getting a better quality of crystals than what&#x27;s included with the unit- they seem too sharp to me, I found a different- better quality sugar scrub that is effective but still gentle. I am sold- so rarely do we ladies get real results- for me this worked- it was what I needed.per area.

            <li> I have really bad eczema as well as dry,sensitive skin. I go through bouts of my face breaking out with itchy patches and small bumps. Tried this to get rid of the dry patches that have accumulated. Used the scrub and saw a difference right away in flakiness and dullness. I used Oil of Olay complete all day moisture cream for sensitive skin after. I was surprised at the effectiveness because even though I have never used a Clairsonic I figured it had to be a heck of a lot more powerful than this little guy but the Pro-X does a nice job. I believe over the next month or so I will be very pleased with the results. I am a 40 year old african american woman also.</li>
            <li> You have to change the batteries every three times you use it. That&#x27;s going to add up.</li>
            <li> (this review is just for the brush portion of the product) I gave it a 3 star because I really wanted the scrubby brush to be a bit firmer.  I get really flaky skin on my nose in the winter and I was hoping the brush would take that off.  Not so much.  Does get my face clean.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the reviews before I purchased this one with the microdermabrasion piece. I have been using both the cleansing and microdermabrasion heads for a little over three weeks now - here is what I find:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - I noticed others mentioned that it did not come with instructions, and I thought, what&#x27;s the big deal?  How hard can it be? Well, assembly, etc. is easy, but it would be nice to know what recommended duration you should use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 - the cleansing head makes you feel like you are really getting your skin clean, but it&#x27;s really no different than a wash cloth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 - the microdermabrasion head... don&#x27;t buy this kit for it. First, it pulls your skin very badly, and you don&#x27;t want it hear your eyes. Even on the lowest setting all it did was tug my skin around, I didn&#x27;t feel it was doing anything useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 - I have used this every night for over 3 weeks and have noticed no changes in my skin. Now, I bought it so I will continue to use it for a while. Maybe it just takes longer than what some other posters said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice - buy the cheaper one with just the cleansing piece. Skip the microdermabrasion head that comes with this one. The cleansing head does feel very spa like, and it does make you feel like you are doing something healthy for your skin.  But the other one, especially if you&#x27;re approaching 40 like me, you won&#x27;t let it near your face.  That&#x27;s all I need is to tug more wrinkles around my eyes... haha.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. You could literally see the dead skin particles floating in the water once you&#x27;re done. It really works. It also makes your face a bit dry after but so does a lot of the other exfoliators</li>
            <li> I was looking at the more expensive cleansing system sold in the department stores but didn&#x27;t want to part with $200.00 for a face scrubber. I searched on Amazon and found this system. It works really well. There are several speeds and two brushes. Easy to use. I still have the two cleansers it came with after many face washes as you just need a dab. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> works fine, but hard to manage</li>
            <li> After reading numerous positive reviews and hearing this is just as good as more expensive brands, I had to try it. Needless to say, after a few weeks of use, I felt I was breaking out more than I ever have in the past years. My skin is extremely sensitive. The combination of the brushes and the cleansers did a number on my skin. I went back to cetaphil and felt like it revived/renewed my skin.</li>
            <li> Brush is somewhat flimsy</li>
            <li> I have been using Olay Pro-Microdermabrasion very night.  I feel like I am getting the days grit off my face and replenishing my skin with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective microdermabrasion tool, but because the head spins rather than pulsates or vibrates unlike the clarisonic, it&#x27;s important to make sure the brush-head is really wet and soapy so that it doesn&#x27;t pull or tug at the skin. I would recommend using a mild facial cleanser along with the microderm crystal-cleansers that are included.</li>
            <li> I like the pro-x but I wish it had come with instructions on how to use.  Maybe tips on how often and how to move it around on your face. The kit I received didn&#x27;t have that information.</li>
            <li> Felt really weak, rather use my hand. Sorry Olay not today</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself because I was looking for a good cleaning brush. I loved it so much that I bought my mother one. She loves it too.</li>
            <li> Started developing some odd-looking bumps on my face, purchased this item to help smooth things out a bit after discussing microdermabrasion with my doctor.  I get that they want to sell the equipment, but after I used it I realized that I can probably just purchase the fluids separately and use my fingertips to apply it.  Maybe not, just my thoughts.  It works just so-so for me, probably not totally worth the money.  Perhaps someone else has had better results.</li>
            <li> GOT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER SHE LOVES THE WAY IT TAKES OFF THE OLD SKIN AND MAKES HER FACE FEEL REFRESHED</li>
            <li> Using both the cleaning and dermabrasion  on a regular basis. Love the way it makes my skin feel. Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I could see a visible difference after the first use. Very drying so good moisturizer is a must! Good product</li>
            <li> Love it. I have problematic skin; acne, wrinkles, dullness, large pores, etc. Normal facial cleansers I use leave my face smooth but feeling tight, so then I need to use a moisturizer to balance it out. When my Olay Pro X System arrived, I was eager to try it. The first day I used it, I only cleansed my skin, I didn&#x27;t exfoliate. My skin tuned out smooth, but not tight. The second day I exfoliated and my skin was tight but it took a lot of the dullness away. After a few days of using this product, I feel my skin has brightened and is clearing up. I was even getting compliments on my complexion! My mom told me not to waste my money on this product, but after 2 days, I caught her using it too and we both love it. I&#x27;ve only had it less than a week but I can see quick results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an exfoliating/cleansing brush for a while...I had even forgotten about it for a long time and when a friend discussed about wanting to buy herself one, she reminded me. So here I was back to searching for the best cleansing facial brush. However, I must admit that the more name brand brushes like the Clarisonic Mia/ Mia 2 was just way too expensive and honestly not something that I saw myself spending $100+ dollars on - it just wasn&#x27;t in my budget. I then came across some of the cheaper brands where the prices seemed great but I was hesitant and questioning &amp;#34;are these really worth it and will they serve my purpose/needs?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to come across Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System kit and because I personally use Olay moisturizing facial creams/products, I personally felt comfortable researching about this facial brush...I ended up purchasing this kit because I liked that it was a simple white color for one (I&#x27;m not picky about color), most importantly this facial brush only takes 2-AA batteries as opposed to the other facial brushes that require 4-AA batteries (which I think is just ridiculous considering that batteries alone are not cheap themselves) anything that takes more than 2-AA batteries should be a charger based device, I think. Lastly, personally for me, I don&#x27;t need 5,6,7,8 different multi-facial brushes. I simply needed a kit that comes with two simple brushes (1) Microdermabrasion Foam Head and (1) Cleansing Brush Head. That&#x27;s it! The kit also comes with Thermal Crystal Polisher (0.68 fl. oz.), Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser (0.68 fl. oz.), &amp; 2 AA Duracell Batteries, however for me - the crystal polisher, nor the exfoliating renewal cleanser would not be needed nor used (I only wanted the brush set).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy the replacement brushes for this kit (which ARE NOT aftermarket brushes). They are the actual Olay Pro-X Replacement Brush Heads that are specifically for this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using this brush since day one. I can personally say that so far this has been the best investment ever. I&#x27;m happy with this product. It serves its purpose for me and really does what it should do - clean your face well. At first when I powered the brush on, I was a little shocked by the highest speed setting of the brush (which isn&#x27;t fast at all) BUT don&#x27;t let that fool you. There&#x27;s a reason which I understand now - you want to keep your skin smooth but you also don&#x27;t want to tear up your skin either (for those who have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally have not and do not use (nor recommend) this for use in the shower/bath. For me, it isn&#x27;t needed to be honest. You can definitely cleanse your face after your bath/shower before bed time and it&#x27;s like a mini facial massage. Afterwards you ALWAYS apply moisturizer after every wash. I personally cleanse my face with the brush, then use a pore strip afterwards and then apply moisturizer and it does wonders for my face/skin. Blemishes/ache are gone, face is soft and clean and overall you feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a facial cleansing brush without having to pay for a name or color of a quality product. I chose this product based on my own needs. I understand it may not work for everyone else but if this helps at least one person - that&#x27;s important.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using this brush since day one.

            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any real significant changes... Kind of disappointing when all the reviews mentioned how good of a product this was.</li>
            <li> bought it for my daughter.  She loves it.  Says its gentle but thorough in cleaning.  Makes her face feel really fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Cheap product. Motor doesn&#x27;t cope.</li>
            <li> Returned item, was not working upon receipt.</li>
            <li> Just an ok item. Really see no improvement and I feel like it is just another gimmick item I fell for,</li>
            <li> THIS MACHINE IS A WONDERFUL TOOL  FOR ANY SKIN BUT ESPECIALLY OFR MATURING SKIN IT REALLY EXFOLIATES AND CLEANSES WELL . YOU FEEL SUCH SOFT CLEAN SKIN AFTERWARDS . ALSO A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY !!&lt;br /&gt;CAME WITH BATTERIES  AND CREAM CLEANSERS  . GREAT BUY</li>
            <li> Results have been very positive; would recommend for anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> LOW PRICE. EASY USE. WATER PROFF</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Will be investing in a better model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second one I am buying- gift for my boss so I think no more details needed. Won&#x27;t regret having this product. Excellent results!</li>
            <li> I have had one of these in the past so I pretty much knew what I was in for. I really love the way my skin feels after using it. I&#x27;m in the over 50 crowd (but 50&#x27;s the new 30 right?!) and my skin will take all the help it can get. I think using it really helps my moisturizer absorb quickly as well. I wish I knew what set the ones that are priced well over $100 apart but I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Seams to be solidly built and weatherproof for use in shower.</li>
            <li> Great powerful little machine</li>
            <li> 3 weeks in and it&#x27;s working like magic...my face feels so smooth, I use my own cleanser instead of the one that came with it (it left my face feeling oily) but the microdermabrasion (step 2, blue &amp; white tube) works wonders! I can&#x27;t wait to continue using it!</li>
            <li> My wife says it works good!</li>
            <li> I love it....absolutely love it. Don&#x27;t why i took so long in getting it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it a month now and i see the difference, my skin looks....&lt;br /&gt;AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Its soft and effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I thought I got this for a deal, but I found for the same price at Target. Haven&#x27;t seen any significant results to be honest.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this product, I felt it did wonders to my skin. my skin was all white and glowing and clean, my husband when he returned from work asked me what the difference was, as i was glowing. I was really happy. I was just using it once a week and using it the following week and so on hs brought no difference in the way my skin feels, infact it made it more dry. i developed pimples after using it. it was literally breaking my skin. so i gave it a gap of few weeks and I used it again but unfortunately i broke out again and so now i have stopped using this product. I am prone to occassional breakouts, but this product is increasing its chances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered why the first use showed wonders and realized it was so because I hadnt had a facial in over 4 months. so naturally it was like a clean up and the whole brushing removed the dead cells off of my face and it glowed.  May be I can use it once in few months but not as a regular cleansing system as i can relate it more to a pedicure where rigourous cleaning removes all the dead cells from your feet, and i dont want that kind of cleaning on my face on a regular basis apart from facials made with gentle hand strokes. I would definitely not recommend it for regular usage.</li>
            <li> This is the best OTC microderm kit I have found. Well worth the cost as the pads last if you clean them properly. No, it will not give you the look of a professional microdermabrasion, but in between it works perfect. Small lines have disappeared and I use it twice weekly. As a face cleaner, it gets deep into pores and makes my skin soft. My only complaint is there are no instructions included in the box! I had to search online on how and when to use it. If you want facial maintenance this may be what you want. FYI-when I have a pro microdermabrasion, my face is red and spotty for two weeks. Although not as strong or as thorough as a pro, I get no redness from using this.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Leaves my face feeling super clean and renewed. I only wish the motor was a little stronger. Overall, Excellent purchase. The samples are great too.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone through three cleansing brushes in the last two years. I started with an over priced one (100 dollars) then it broke, and bought a 12 dollar Ulta one. I am happy to say this Olay brush out preformed them both! I use it with my Olay regenerist cleanser and it cleans so nicely. I could never spend big money on a more expensive brush, this cleans just as well. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest leaving it in the shower. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it, but if you like it and want it to last, keep it as dry as you can.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product about two months ago I have not had a breakout. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cleansing and microderm abrasion tubes included are tiny.</li>
            <li> Received my kit yesterday and these are my initial observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box was well packaged. Batteries are included for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing brush is (small) or as like to call it fun size. I was hoping it was bigger but as I was using it I couldn&#x27;t help but think good thing this thing is super light or else my hand would get tired quick. I find that even on the highest setting the scrub brush is VERY gentle on the face which at first annoyed me but then I thought I have always been to rough on my face so this is a good thing. All in all I would consider this system a definite buy. My face is clean without irritation and the cost is great with the added coupon that Amazon kindly throws in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that I have been using my own facial cleanser. The cleanser that is included is what I would consider a sample size and it is good. But I prefer my own facial soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Con is that it runs on battery and it isn&#x27;t rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product</li>
            <li> This product has good power - although I was disappointed with the size of the product. I was actually looking for the susan lucci product line but it has unfortunately been discontinued.It was an okay deal although it said that I would get 3.00 off but it didn&#x27;t,</li>
            <li> my face is more radiant than ever , would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great for me, keeps my skin looking fresh and feeling clean. This was the best price for similar products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product for the price. It really clean my face and my face feels smooth. Over all satisfied.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face. Not bad. I like the warming sensation scrub.</li>
            <li> The sponge for microdermabrasion doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Mind as well use your fingers in circular motion. And the hand held itself is too small.</li>
            <li> This product is really good, it cleans your face amazingly however it can be slightly harsh on sensative skin but it is a really good product</li>
            <li> Love it. Cleans my skin so good!</li>
            <li> Perfect clean!  My face look amazing , very clean and very soft. The machine work fast  with 3 speed  I recommend this product 100% 😍</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly,as describe.</li>
            <li> Definitely got my money&#x27;s worth with this product! Used it as soon as it was delivered and immediately noticed improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture. Wonderful product and will more than likely buy again once this one gives out.</li>
            <li> This is a great price and  better than the red package version I bought for way more money at the store.  After a week of use my face was flawless and felt incredible.  Will buy again because more than likely it works to well and it will disappear from the market lol</li>
            <li> Excellent skin cleansing and dermabrasion capabilities, but not much product included and the unit is fairly lightweight and flimsy.  I wonder how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I like this brush however the speed seems a little slow and the cleansing head feels a little cheap.  I do like using the microdermabrasion head with the product that came with it.  If I had to buy again I would probably save my money and buy a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Target and I absolutely love it! (even though it was way more expensive to buy in store..) My skin felt smoother after only a few uses. I still don&#x27;t understand how to work the thermal polisher yet... But I&#x27;ll get it eventually.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The brush cleans my skin so well my sister has a clarisonic, I tried it and I still like mine better. The mocroderm pad is very good too my face feels so smooth afterwards. I really like all these products and will buy this kit as soon as mine is gone</li>
            <li> Prior to getting this kit, I had an earlier version of the same basic product, which came with a two-speed version of the microdermabrasion tool, with the brush head and a full size tube of the exfoliating cleanser. I left the tool in my shower, and can confirm that it does well getting soaked in water every day, the batteries last a long time, and the tool is durable and reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the brush and the cleanser, though it wasn&#x27;t super-scrubby, like an \\&quot;exfoliator\\&quot; is, in my experience. Still, it cleaned well. My skin felt smooth and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New in this kit, is a *three* speed tool, with a foam pad and the \\&quot;Thermal Crystal Polisher.\\&quot; Both the cleanser and the polisher come in small tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not entirely thrilled with the polisher and the foam pad, though I can&#x27;t tell if I&#x27;m just not using it right, or I expected something else. The substance is very thick and gummy, with fine, gritty particles. When used in combination with the foam pad, I feel a lot of drag on my skin, and it feels like it gets hot. I assume this is the \\&quot;thermal\\&quot; part, but... it kind of feels like heat just from friction, because it&#x27;s dragging so much. And my skin doesn&#x27;t seem noticeably smoother than when I just used the exfoliating cleanser and the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, ultimately: it&#x27;s a nice tool. It works well. I like the exfoliating cleanser and the brush. But the pad/polisher combo doesn&#x27;t seem as nice. You might consider [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]] instead, as it&#x27;s a little cheaper. But you won&#x27;t go wrong with this. :)</li>
            <li> I previously used the Olay kit that only has one head attachment and a small tube of the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser (red and white tube) and didn&#x27;t like the cleanser but loved the exfoliating tool that came with it. I use it at least twice a week but with my own cleanser because the Renewal cleanser left a film on my face that raised some bumps and my face itched like maybe I&#x27;m sensitive to something in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Pro X Cleansing System, in addition to the cleansing tool and exfoliating cream, you get another head attachment for microdermabrasion and a thermal cream for even more thorough exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the extra head - which looks like a foam disc, was just an excuse to charge more because it doesn&#x27;t really look like it&#x27;s going to do much but I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the exfoliating tool with my own cleanser during my morning shower and then before bed I decided to try the thermal cream with the microdermabrasion head. On the first try, I didn&#x27;t really notice anything too different. My face felt clean without being tight. After the second use several days later, I used the thermal product again and rinsed thoroughly after I was done and patted my face dry. Once I was in bed, I noticed my cheeks felt SO SOFT! I even had my husband feel and there was definitely a difference so I got up and was looking at my face in the mirror and it seemed like my pores were harder to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve since used up the entire tube of thermal exfoliating cream and my face is so smooth and my pores are hard to see and once I apply a bit of foundation they pretty much disappear entirely. I&#x27;ve used creams and cleansers in the past that I paid lots of money for and never got this good of a result with my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat sensitive skin and was afraid this might make me look like I had a sunburn/windburned face but any redness I had disappeared by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I didn&#x27;t care for the Renewal cream, I already bought a tube of the \\&quot;thermal crystal polisher\\&quot; that seems to be the same thing that is included in the kit and I&#x27;m going to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing about this kit is that you can purchase the two brush head attachments separately so if you end up not liking one or the other of the creams/cleansers included in the kit, you don&#x27;t have to buy the kit again once the heads wear out. So far, I&#x27;ve used both heads at least a dozen times and they still look new so I think they&#x27;ll last at least a couple of months and perhaps more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my pores look so much better and I have a bit of color from the sun, I&#x27;ve actually left the house a few times with no foundation or powder on my face! I almost never leave the house without full makeup because I&#x27;m so fair I feel like I look wan and pale and I felt like my pores were glaringly obvious. So nice to have the option of less makeup without being self conscious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the price: I think this is worth it because I got my original kit from my Mom as a Christmas gift so it&#x27;s almost 2 years old now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I&#x27;ve had to replace the batteries obviously and the brush head once but the machine itself still works great. Definitely worth giving this a try.bought a tube of the \\&quot;thermal crystal polisher\\&quot; that seems to be the same thing that is included in the kit and I&#x27;m going to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing about this kit is that you can purchase the two brush head attachments separately so if you end up not liking one or the other of the creams/cleansers included in the kit, you don&#x27;t have to buy the kit again once the heads wear out.

            <li> This is awesome product... works great and I really enjoy it. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I am not very satisfied or dissatisfied with this product.  I don&#x27;t see a big difference after two weeks use.  I use it with my daily cleanser too.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and it&#x27;s effective. It really makes my skin smooth and brighter.</li>
            <li> I like this product just wish it had more power. Besides, that I would recommend it. My face feels softer.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. Can see a total difference in my skin. I might upgrade to a clarisonic one day but this is working for me for now.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much, in fact based on all description I was somewhat skeptical this could really be that helpful.  I was wrong.  I purchased the kit as a replacement for the [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz, 1-Count]] as I use the wand and brush head in the shower each morning and it was dropped one too many times and had stopped working after 2 years (my fault not the manufacturers: accidentally dropping it on a hard tile shower floor multiple times, I&#x27;m surprised it didn&#x27;t stop working sooner).  I figured I&#x27;d try the microdermabrasion product too, as it wasn&#x27;t much more expensive than just buying a replacement wand.  I was pleasantly surprised after using the microdermabrasion product for the past 8 weeks (2x a week) I noticed the pours on my face are noticeably smaller and I haven&#x27;t had a break out since I started using it.  I have adult acne and was using an acne product daily on my nose to reduce the pore size and on the occasional break outs--I have stopped using the acne product about 4 weeks ago as the micordermabrasion product is really working. I still use the [[ASIN:B002UUT38I Olay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser 6 Fl Oz]] morning and night (I have two wands for convenience) and I wash off the cleaner using a wash cloth at night and let the shower do the work in the morning.  Twice a week I follow up the exfoliating cleanser with the microdermabrasion cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I was a bit concerned about the grittiness of the microdermabrasion product, I use just a little bit and like the exfoliating cleanser, I apply the microdermabrasion product first with my finger tips and then use the wand with the foam pad.  I recommend keeping your eyes shut whenever using the wand and pad to avoid any chance any of the particles being swept by the rotation of the pad into your eyes.  I started out using the microdermabrasion once a week for 2 weeks and then moved to twice a week when my sensitive face didn&#x27;t have a negative reaction to it.  Using it during my morning showers makes it super easy to rinse off and I follow up with moisturizer and then make up.</li>
            <li> I love this set. It helps your skin look radiant instead of dull. The brush has different speed settings which is good for sensitive areas like underneath the eyes. I wish it spun in two different directions, but I know I&#x27;m asking a lot. The cleansers smell great and you only need to use a little for your whole face and neck. I like to use it after removing my makeup, it picks up a lot of leftover makeup and makes your skin feel clean and tight. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about four months now and my skin does feels better from when I started. I can see a clear difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample size lasted about a month from using the exfoliating scrub twice a week and the thermal polisher lasted about 3 months from using it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest buying the refills from Amazon a week or so before you run out of the samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would suggest this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these last year and it worked for almost a year.  I liked the way it cleaned my skin and was very happy with the the overall performance.  Consequently, I purchased another one on March 31 of this year and last week it stopped working again.  I&#x27;ve tried replacing the batteries to no avail.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing another one, for sure.</li>
            <li> I just have to say to all those who say clarosonic is better than this... don&#x27;t believe them. first you would waste $500 plus dollars on such nonsense... then you wont regret it because is strips and irritates your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I BOUGHT THIS OLAY PRODUCT  I USE IT  and it is good but WHAT HELPS YOUR SKIN IS NOT only the brush BUT THE MICRODERMABRASION CLEANSING GEL... that is the MAGIC ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;I  used  it once a week either scrub my face with a cloth, the brush or my finger tips but this microdermabrasion gel is AMAZING... DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON CLAROSONIC IT PEEL YOUR SKING OFF.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try some advanced cleansing system from a very long time and when i saw the deal for Olay Pro-X i just purchased it to try it.I used couple of times and its pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt fresh and smooth after the use and its very easy to use as they do give clear directions.</li>
            <li> I have been using microdermabrasion crystals from another company for a long time, as well as glycolic acid and lactic acid. I love a good exfoliation, and I do not have sensitive skin, so I like something that really works. With that being said, I love this Olay kit. I have read some reviewers stating that this didn&#x27;t work for them, and I really believe that they aren&#x27;t using it correctly, or maybe its just me. But for someone who&#x27;s been exfoliating for a long time, this kit worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing brush is nice for a deep clean, but my favorite thing about the kit is the foam head and scrub. Upon first use, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing much for me, it is a piece of foam after all. I even tried using the scrub with just my fingers like I use my microdermabrasion crystals, which was nice.  But I tried it again the next day, and it blew me away. I believe it is how you hold the foam head against your skin that makes the difference. I held it firmly and moved it very slowly over my skin. Like I said earlier, maybe it&#x27;s just me, but this just works for me. I love love love it. My face is smoother from using this than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used, and that&#x27;s a lot of products.&lt;br /&gt;I hope it works as well for others as it has for me. The bottles that come with it are small, and I will only be repurchasing the thermal polisher. I just use a different facial wash with the brush head. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this so much, I do not want to go back to manually washing my face ever again. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned any cleansing systems before. I wanted to try the Clarisonic because of it&#x27;s amazing reviews but it&#x27;s too expensive. I did some research and chose this system and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I was initially going to get just the cleansing system until I stumbled onto the microdermabrasion system. So I said, why not? I have a couple of scars from old blemishes that need to go away anyway. The first time I used this system i noticed a huge difference. Before I would just use apricot scrub from st. ives and while i loved that, I realized that sometimes it would still make my skin feel patchy. I have combination/oily skin. My t-zone is oily but sometimes my cheeks can feel really dry. This took care of that. I use this in conjunction with a Mario Badescu cucumber cleansing lotion that I got a sample of, their toner, and their moisturizer as well. All of this together makes a recipe for perfection. I&#x27;ve never felt my skin so consistently smooth for more than just a couple of hours. It lasts all day every day (as long as I follow my routine). The microdermabrasion part I love as well. I feel it&#x27;s making a difference already. I use the lotion that it comes with and I love that too. I use it 2-3x a week. It turns warm on your skin (to open your pores and clean better). Overall I&#x27;m very pleased. Who wouldn&#x27;t be? I save hundreds of dollars haha.</li>
            <li> I used an Ultra Sonic for years and thought that the replacements were getting expensive.  This product&#x27;s scrubbing pad is much smaller.  It still gets the job done so I will still recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my face feel.... nice and smooth.  I like this system and have noticed a great improvement in my skin; I would recommend this anyone.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t blown away with this purchase.  Won&#x27;t be a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> the product is great does exactly what it says on the box</li>
            <li> Love it, does a great job. I look 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> works fabulously. I love the exfoliation on my skin without having to spend $100+ on the Clarisonic.  Wish it came with bigger tubes of cleanser &amp; exfoliation beads.</li>
            <li> I think &amp;#34;dermabrasion&amp;#34; is misleading since one can achieve the same effect with a typical washcloth.  A definite waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and use.  The system has 5 speeds for all types of facial skin.  Enjoy the price most of all.!</li>
            <li> I have used oil of olay for many years, which is the reason i chose their product so i know this is a great item</li>
            <li> I hv been using this prduct since 1 month and I can say I&#x27;m satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However in first week my skin didnt show any good output.. but after a month I could see good results, especially in summer (in Mumbai humidity is high).&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels clean from inside and also smooth. Also it shows good results if you use good cream after cleanising with it. (that matters a lot.)&lt;br /&gt;Note : If you have pimples dont use it on that part of your face.&lt;br /&gt;I did not found Thermal Crystal Polisher that good, cz I got breakouts after using it.. So be carefull before using this Foam Head + Crystal Polisher.&lt;br /&gt;Mostly avoid using Crystal Polisher if you have pimples..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product is Good.. :)</li>
            <li> Its ok. I don&#x27;t really use it very often and would probably have returned it if I could.  feel like it breaks me out and makes my skin look worse. Its definitely not for every day use</li>
            <li> This is such a great tool for making your face ultra smooth and your pores smaller. I Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> love this product! I use it several times a week to help thoroughly remove my makeup and have noticed my skin cleared up a lot. will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I expected.  I &#x27;really&#x27; enjoyed using this product, my face felt soooo great. Smooth, soft, after 4 th day even softer&lt;br /&gt;naturel shine.  I&#x27;m looking forward to all the other benifits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Millie</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement almost immediately. Easy to use and batteries included! The only drawback is there aren&#x27;t any directions but just go online for how to use it. Kind of self explanatory tho. I use the cleanser every day except when I use the polisher twice a week.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have bought, I am sure I had the other one for 10 years, I use this one twice a day, I use another brand of cleanser. This is so much better than just a face cloth. I do the microdermabrasion at least three times  a week, as I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> The wife kept saying she needed to &#x27;go get a facial&#x27; however she never seemed to find the time.  I got her this for Christmas.  She has used it a couple of times so far and we both agree her skin looks much better as it has taken away the dullness.</li>
            <li> She really enjoys the feeling her face has after using it. It feels softer to the touch already. She says her pores are getting smaller as well.</li>
            <li> My mother in law got me one of these systems from Costco last year for Mother&#x27;s day.  My daughter and I have really enjoyed using it and it&#x27;s a really great system.  My 10 year old son has started to get a little acne so I thought I&#x27;d order him one of these.  Since he started using it, his acne has disappeared.</li>
            <li> This is magical! I love the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> Love it! Cleans really well and removes all makeup. Very pleased! I use the microdermabrasion twice a week and the regular cleansing brush every night before bed. My skin is a lot smoother and brighter.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and I have really liked using this product. My skin is much smoother and I find make-up applies more smoothly. My recommendation however would be to not overuse it and follow as directed. It could be too irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months now. If I miss a day using it, I can tell. My skin feels so much smoother and definitely evening it out a bit. Good buy!</li>
            <li> In a salon, microdermabrasion costs around $60- $100 per session and sessions should be repeated around once a month depending on the desired results. That is SO expensive. Its nice to be pampered but if your primarily looking for change in the texture of your skin, this system is very effective and a small fraction of the cost. Even if it winds up breaking after each use (which it hasn&#x27;t appeared to do) it is still a bargain. It requires a little learning to use it properly. For instance the sponge needs to be remoistened frequently to maintain proper lubrication, and the appropriate pressure to apply is not necessarily intuitive. But, here&#x27;s the bottom line- my skin looks much better after only one use, and by &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; I mean that the fine lines around my mouth and on my chest are significantly diminished. I am excited to see where my skin is in a month. My serum is absorbing much more completely and I am going to waste less of it and get better results. I&#x27;m extremely happy.</li>
            <li> Love it.  The price is right, too.  I have been wanting one of these facial brushes for a while now but couldn&#x27;t justify the price tag of he other models.  This one seems just as good as the others and I love the 3 speeds and 2 heads.  The exfoliating crystals are awesome.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, I really don&#x27;t know if it works yet</li>
            <li> Once you place it against your face one has to be careful not to press too hard or it will stop spinning.  Even pressing a bit more than what we users think is moderate and the spin slows down.  It&#x27;s OK but I bought something with 4 batteries have had before that works even better.  Too bad, I was hoping this would be just as good.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is beating most stores by $15.00 to $16.00. I&#x27;ve used this item once and think it&#x27;s worth the price since you receive two tubes of cleaners and two brushes for the different type of cleaning.</li>
            <li> I chose to review this item because there are not a lot of affordable at home Microdermabrasion machines that you can buy without having a degree in dermatology to understand how to safely use it. Let me preface my review by explaining my skincare situation, I have very fair skin and any and all sun exposure gives me dark sun spots (we&#x27;re talking chocolate chips here) and my skin over the years has developed a thick layer of sun spots over the bridge of my nose and across the high part of my cheeks just under my eyes. While normally I&#x27;d say be happy with what you have I have always been self conscious about youthful the freckles made me look and now that I&#x27;m getting older I find they age me aggressively as they look like age spots. After just one use my freckles have lightened an extraordinary amount - it was practically life changing. I came into work with almost no foundation on, just a light miners veil. It was so refreshing. The product itself is easy to use though the box does not come with instructions on recommended time, amount or setting I achieved optimal results using about the size of a nickel smoothed over a damp face, wetting the sponge, and letting it scrub in each place for about 45 seconds completing my face in about 5-7 minutes. I did not experience any irritation or redness though I am not prone to that with most cleansers. I haven&#x27;t used the regular cleanser yet but I do look forward to it though to be honest once I&#x27;m finished with the supplied cleanser I will use the cleanser head with my Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Gel Cleanser instead. In any case, great value and great results.</li>
            <li> I like the results. Works just as easy as washing your face with a wash cloth before bed, but with stunning results. The cleaning lotions are over priced in my opinion.... However, other companies cleansers are priced even higher. I like this Olay line.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product but I&#x27;ll keep it and continue to use it.  I had a Clarisonic Mia that lasted less than a year, so I can&#x27;t expect something with this low price to perform as well and I won&#x27;t be paying the big bucks for Clarisonic again!</li>
            <li> I really like the scrubbing product, but the brush is really weak.  I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was actually doing anything at all.  I ended up using the scrub with my fingers which did leave my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 plus and keep trying another way to clean my face. While I know I won&#x27;t recapture my youth, and genuinely don&#x27;t want to, this cleaning system is terrific. It makes my skin feel so smooth and fresh, even when used with another cleaner. Glad I decided to try this option as it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for facial exfoliation.  Makes the skin feel clean and fresh.  This is a product I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a Christmas stocking stuffer and she was tickled.  Olay is a reliable brand and the product lives up to the brand&#x27;s reputation.  The fact that it was a Cyber Monday Special deal was great!</li>
            <li> I was tentative about using an appliance on my sensitive skin but after enjoying the microdermabrasion treatment and wanting that but not being able to afford the $100/treatment pricel... This has been surprisingly effective and gentle. I started on the lowest settings on purpose to avoid a &amp;#34;failure caused by user&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve had it a week - used it almost every day - just once as a start with the microdermabrasion attachment but with my own natural brand exfoliator (allergies to most big brands) and my pores are already visibly smaller, my skin is smoother and without the dreaded oily overreaction or irritation. Of course I had a couple pores here and there break out but with the dead skin removed there was bound to be some small negatives during the adjustment. No big deal. Any new product or change in regimen will usually cause that or worse as a natural reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this review can&#x27;t give any input as to the cleanser and exfoliator from Olay included with the kit but only the implement itself. The machine is very comfortable to hold, not too heavy and the surface texture has a nice grip. The buttons are easy toggles with a size difference you can feel so you don&#x27;t have to look in case you want to avoid accidentally getting anything in your eyes when changing speeds or turning it on or off. Also the battery compartment was a bit tricky to open but once I read the instructions and followed the twist-one-side-down sort of move it was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second kit I have purchased because my sister tried the first one I had ordered right before her Christmas visit and she liked it enough that she ended up taking it home with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue increasing the use all the way up to the recommended frequency and levels and hope that by doing this lighter, more frequent treatment I can get similar if not better results to what I expected from the professional microdermabrasion at a fraction of the cost. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This is a decent cheaper alternative to Clarisonic (which will cost about $125). It gets the job done. I&#x27;ve seen some improvements in my skin. The least it can do is smooth out your skin a little because the microdermabrasion brush gets rid of dead skin. And my skin does feel cleaner than before.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, works very well.  You can see the difference in your skin after just a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> just as described i love it</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth. Love it.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry due to a chronic illness.  I use the old Olay brush and it did a good job cleaning but I definitely needed something that would be more aggressive in treatment of dry skin.  I had treated myself to a couple of salon facials but they were expensive and the effects were great but only temporary.  I needed something that I could more frequently and cost effective.  I think I have found it.  The new Olay system has a third faster speed that combines with a soft spongy pad to give you a microdermabrasion treatment.  Using it twice a week my dry skin has really improved and I am very pleased with the results.  Do I need any more salon spa facials?  No, but don&#x27;t tell my husband.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. I am totally satisfied with the cleansing results.&lt;br /&gt;I can truly recommend this product. Good investement, especially in comparison to more expensive products!</li>
            <li> I am 67 and although I use a regimen including day and night moisturizers, I wanted a product that would sluff off the dead cells on my face and bring out the new skin below.  This served just that purpose.  My skin has a polished look now.</li>
            <li> Love this product -my  skin feels amazing afterwards. Be careful on first use that you don&#x27;t over do it or you will be sensitive.</li>
            <li> Late delivery was a lot of waiting.&lt;br /&gt;Once the dead skin is removed, and the face was used&lt;br /&gt;Soft.&lt;br /&gt;Haeyagetda frequently.</li>
            <li> this product is great, especially compared to the systems out there that cost a lot more!!! the cleanser and thermal polish gel are very gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> Yes, the Clairsonic is a great product.  But so is this one!&lt;br /&gt;Does the Clairsonic perform a little better than this?  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Is it remotely worth spending 5X the amount for the Clairsonic?  Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful gift for a pre-teen.  I got one for myself and then showed her the benefit of this.</li>
            <li> I had thought about buy one of these for awhile...and I&#x27;m glad I finally pulled the plug and bought this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time last night...and believe it or not I saw results!  And this morning when I was applying my moisturizer and make-up I could still see a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is brighter, and smoother.  I am 51 years old, and I consider my skin tone as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the product I used the exfoliation setting, and only used for about 3-5 minutes.  I did not experence any discomfort, and the system and cleaner was not abrasive at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It actually does what it claims.. loved the results. Instructions for how to use the products could have been better..it doesn&#x27;t explain it at all..but loved the product</li>
            <li> This works great. My face feels very smooth after using it. I feel like I look better!</li>
            <li> Ok but not very powerfu</li>
            <li> I thought the product size was bigger! After the first use of the brush, the brush became discoloured and I think the replacement brushes are too expensive</li>
            <li> This is a complete piece of GARBAGE.  Don&#x27;t waste a dime of your money on it.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 3.5 stars.. It is a good product overall and my skin feels soft &amp; clean after each use. However, the attachments (brushes) don&#x27;t stay firm &amp; get soft within a few times of use.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for the face. Great quality and price. Makes my skin look and feel great. Stopped using acne wash, too, only need soap now. Only cons is the fasted setting might be too slow for people who have been using spin brushes for awhile or need a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> I did not like the brush so I just used the cleanser and polisher. The results were great after one use.</li>
            <li> Excellent results!!!!!</li>
            <li> Used twice was great! Third time when I placed against my face it just stopped!!! I&#x27;m bugged &amp; bummed. It definitely gets rid of the dry skin &amp; makes it smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Handy to carry when travelling. But all that hardly matters when it&#x27;s not doing its job!!😕😕</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use any pressure at all when you use the brush.  And a good rule of thumb is two minutes or less.  My skin was irritated until I figured this out.  Now I use it at night with my normal cleanser and follow up with moisturizer.  I can say that there is a visible difference in my skin tone and my face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> Used this one time so far, and I like it alot. I usually wipe my makeup off with the makeup removers, but this definitely helped even more. I thought I was getting all my makeup off but after using this I noticed more makeup on the brush. This keeps your face clean and refreshed. I will keep using this.</li>
            <li> This system is ok, size of cleaning brushes and sponges is quite small. It is not very powerful so doesn&#x27;t give a great microdermabrasion effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on this type of product for quite some time, as I keep seeing mentions in women&#x27;s magazines and other places.  I was pretty eager to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with two \\&quot;heads\\&quot;--a smooth one for microdermabrasion, and a brush for regular cleaning--plus two sample-sized (tiny) tubes of cleanser and scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the microdermabrasion first.  I was puzzled as to how a smooth foam pad could do anything, until I opened the tube of cream.  Yowza.  Sandpaper in a bottle.  I&#x27;ve never used a scrub that was that harsh before. I proceeded very, very gently.  Afterwards, my face did feel smoother, but the next morning it wasn&#x27;t, plus my face was very, very dry.  I have oily skin and the dryness persisted for days.  I might use the scrub on my feet, but never on my face again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush for cleaning your skin--what can I say?  No different than using a washcloth.  I&#x27;ve used it for weeks now just to give it a fair shot and my skin is exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with this.  It does absolutely nothing and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> there are three speeds for this application, and the slowest speed was a little too slow for me!  but would be useful for those delicate or sensitive areas.  The high speed is not that abrasive either.  This is not a high end model, but is suffice to allow you to get a thorough clean as part of your cleansing routine.  The soap and creame that come with the applicator were fine, but i used a gentle face soap with mine and it workwed just as well! Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> There were red patches on my face after using the thermal scrub for the first time. Perhaps I pressed too hard. Don&#x27;t really see much dramatic improvement in skin after daily use of the normal brush for a week. Other than that it&#x27;s a great price for a microdermabrasion tool - removes my makeup well at night everyday.</li>
            <li> I am using it for the first time and I am still waiting to see visible results, but I like it.</li>
            <li> Due to a change in medication my facial skin has changed and requires different daily maintenance, as it has become rough and bumpy. I was hoping that the Olay scrubber would help smooth my skin as part of a routine, and some of the reviews indicate that it is a good product. I should have, however, listened to the reviews that this is not even as good as a washcloth, which is also cheaper. On the upside, this product *does* come with quality batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After purchasing this set for $30, it arrived quickly and I opened it up and read all of the instructions. However the tubes of facial cleanser are pitifully small (size of travel toothpaste) and the motor is too weak to be effective. I wasn&#x27;t expecting something built by Tim The Toolman Taylor, ripping along at 60mph, however I get a better scrub from my washcloth. Neither the buff sponge or bristle head did anything to my face but pressing harder would only kill the motor; the buff sponge head felt like a weak breeze from a fan and the bristle head was like an overly soft toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this set twice and returned it as it was making me mad that something like this was available for so much money and was absolutely useless. I&#x27;d give it zero stars if possible, but guess I&#x27;ll give it one star for the batteries.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product i have used it twice and see a difference in my skin love the feel of a fresh clean face</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would do</li>
            <li> I used it for a while and my skin really did not seem different. After a month of twice a day it is just sitting in a drawer. Also, the polishing stuff tore up my face and is hard to use.</li>
            <li> i am not impressed with this, if you rub your face with a washcloth it provides nearly just as much exfoliating. for all the reviews that compare this to the more expensive clarisonic, it makes me glad that i didn&#x27;t waste any money on that.</li>
            <li> Was shocked when I tried to open up the battery compartment to insert the battery. It was wet with fluid which I believed its glue. When I looked inside I could see the internal compartment was not nicely glued and its wet. So I have to wipe it. For a moment, I wonder its it an imitation product, very disappointed that olay overlooked on workmanship standard. And it doesnt have detailed description on how to maintain the brush etc</li>
            <li> UPDATE 9/17/2013: I called Olay, as requested by Olay Comm Mgr.  I do have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with Olay&#x27;s Customer Service.  The CS rep to whom I spoke said that this probably isn&#x27;t the best product for someone with sensitive skin, as I have.  I hadn&#x27;t considered that this might be related to my ultra sensitive skin, as the reaction from this (acne) was different than the reaction I usually get from skin products (ultra itchy rash, which this didn&#x27;t cause at all).  The rep also said that I shouldn&#x27;t press down with the brush -- at all -- as it&#x27;s best to let the cleansing and exfoliating product do the job, rather than the brush.  I was also impressed that the rep will be sharing my experience within the Olay company.  I thought it was great that they take one customer&#x27;s experience so seriously.  For Olay&#x27;s great Customer Service, I&#x27;d give five star, and one star because of the experience I had, for a combined rating of three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: There were so many things I hate about this cleansing system.  For starters, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it cleans my skin as much as it pulls, stretches and twists my skin while the brush or sponge is spinning around.  Maybe it&#x27;s because, in my older age (50+) my skin is not tight and firm as it used to be, but stretching my skin like that can&#x27;t be good for the wrinkles that are already there.  My wrinkles don&#x27;t need any help to get deeper and more noticeable than they already are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, after a couple days, I noticed that I started getting acne.  Horrible acne that took a week to go away after I stopped using this \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this for the above reasons.</li>
            <li> Great buy!! bought it for my mum and she absolutely loves it! Love the fact that it also contains a sample size of the exfoliating cream and MDA gel. Off course you cant compare it to the clarisonic range of products but hey! then again, the Olay system is 1/4th the price. It contains different speeds and is really great at scrubbing of the dirt from face. Wish they would add a body attachment as well and it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> The motor in the brush didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> Got this product in advance, everything as promised is in there except it comes with dead batteries, at first I thought there&#x27;s something wrong with the product because it won&#x27;t start at all, I was thinking some machine issues or something but it turned out it&#x27;s the batteries. I know it&#x27;s not really a big deal but if u buy something don&#x27;t u want everything to work flawless? Oh well, moving on but so far this works like a charm u just have to invest your time doing it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this - and I think I would have except the lack of power to the unit on batteries.  The idea is really great, the pads are firm, but soft and shaped well, and the product is much like what I use without the gadget.  Unfortunately, this just didn&#x27;t work out for me because without the oomph, there is little point to use this as opposed to my fingers.</li>
            <li> I have seen product reviews of this and got really curious so I bought one to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with the cleaning tool with 1 brush and 1 sponge and 2 small tubes of cleansing and exfoliating. It does clean well the first time I tried it. Rotates in one direction only but has 3 speed options. It&#x27;s been probably a month since I bought it and I can see that my pores has been slightly reduced. I will continue using it and will try it out with other cleansing products! Great cleansing option if you&#x27;re wanting something cheap but works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two months now and can see a difference in the texture of my skin. My skin is very dry and I am always combating dry scaly patches. With daily use of this product my skin is much smoother and softer. My make-up goes on smoothly and I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m peeling from a sunburn all the time. The only thing I am not pleased with is the foam head attachment for microdermabrasion. It is so large that you can&#x27;t really use it on or around the nose and I really wanted something to help clean and shrink the pores of my nose. I use my fingers for that area. I do love the warm tingle of the microdermabrasion scrub though.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received such compliments on my skin since using this kit. My skin is so much more brighter &amp; smoother. I had a little trouble trying to use the polishing pad because it doesn&#x27;t move gracefully over the skin but I&#x27;ve learned to correct that by lifting it off my skin just a tad so that it can move more freely. This is an amazing cleansing system &amp; you can use any cleanser with it.</li>
            <li> I am sure this works well, I just need to take the time to do it like it says.</li>
            <li> FYI - I have light ivory, sensitive skin. Dry/normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bought this after having used the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System. The Neutrogena one works very well, but I don&#x27;t enjoy having to replace the pads so much. I thought buying a system that had seperate tubes of the wash and polisher would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash is good.&lt;br /&gt;The Thermal Crystal Polisher is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The Cleansing Brush Head makes washing your face much easier and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;The Microdermabrasion Foam Head is crap. It does basically nothing. I&#x27;ve tried pushing it harder into my skin but I feel nothing but the foam head and don&#x27;t feel the polisher at all. You get MUCH better results with the polisher if you just use your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon inspecting my skin after using the foam head, it looks the same, just washed. I don&#x27;t get anything close to the results of the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give 3/5 stars because it makes washing your face a breeze, and the wash and polisher are very nice.</li>
            <li> it just does what its make for! machine does just ok for the cleaning and polishing purpose, but nothing supper special!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. The two included brush heads give you great microdermabrasion and cleansing, and the 3 speeds lets you customize your facial. I saw a difference from the first use. I&#x27;ve even used the brush with my ordinary cleanser. The included tubes of cleanser and microdermabrasion lotion are small, but you really use just a little to do your whole face so they will last a while. I absolutely love what this product is doing for my face.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier than using only my fingers to wash my face.  I do not like the microdermabrasion cleanser.  Doesn&#x27;t feel the way the 2 step Olay dermabrasion cleanser leaves my face.  Bristles are soft.  I use setting #3 which is strong enough to cleanse my face.</li>
            <li> The motor does not have enough power to do a good job I feel. Also, the tubes of product are super small so you have to buy replacements almos immediately.Sorry I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s...ok. I like the bristles a lot, they definitely leave my face feeling exfoliated. The polisher attachment doesn&#x27;t seem to provide much stimulation, even when used with the polishing cream. The cleanser is again ok, it doesn&#x27;t foam much and I would like for there to be more exfoliation beads. I think the best thing would be to use this system with a thicker more concentrated exfoliation cleaner for the best results.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Clarisonic, I own one but it is not comparable to this, it is also possible to do dermabrasion, GREAT!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this in the mail. When I received it I opened it up and it seems like there is a gel like substance in the machine that makes my battery all gooey and I have not used it yet... I have no idea what it is, but my machine works when I try to clean it out and put in the batteries. I hope the gel substance doesn&#x27;t break my machine. I tried to clean it out, but its still there. However, the stuff does make my face feel soft and clean. I hope I get results like all the reviews I read about.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean nice im 30 and have some expression lines and acne scars it has not magically disappeared but the system makes your face smooth and clean. It does what its suppossed to do essentially, clean.</li>
            <li> Good low price substitute to give cleaning brushes a try. I really like it, but the microderm attachment doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough for me. I use it 2x daily for cleansing and will continue to do so until it breaks. Then I&#x27;ll upgrade.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It really does a nice job on cleaning my face. I just have to see how long the creams and the brushes will last. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else since this is the first cleansing brush I&#x27;ve used. So I personally don&#x27;t know how it compares to Mia. I wish there were more than 3 speeds. I feel like the highest/fastest speed still isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; enough.</li>
            <li> works well , but very less quantity of serum and clenser send</li>
            <li> First product Ive used, so not much to compare it to.  Even at highest speed seems to move slower than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I can notice my skin really improved! i&#x27;m really satisfied for its effect at the same time with its value.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little more powerful but other than that it is great for the price</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it!  She uses it all the time (according to recommendations with instructions) and there is a visible difference in the condition of her skin!  Worth it!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like how hard it pulls my skin around my eyes. I primarily only use it on my cheek bones and jaw area and on the 3rd speed because the slowest one like I said before pulls my skin too hard.</li>
            <li> In love with this after 1 use! Couldn&#x27;t stop touching my skin afterwards in shock from the smoothness. And the pores on my nose are much smaller! I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother at her request, she loves this, it is not the first one she has used. She said it works excellent and helps make her look younger.</li>
            <li> the price- great&lt;br /&gt;the item-works awesome.&lt;br /&gt;this product helps remove dirt so well. i never realized how much makeup was left on my face until i started using this. it is so lovely.&lt;br /&gt;i would give it 100 stars if i could!!!!!</li>
            <li> My only regret is not purchasing this product sooner. Debated on this or claisonic for months. Noticed a huge difference in my skin in just two uses. Can&#x27;t wait to see the full results.</li>
            <li> This is for my mom. She likes it except for the red top tube which is I think the microdermabrasion. It gave her more dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am very glad I purchased the set instead of the regular Olay Pro-X system. This is gentler and I prefer to feel of the brush. The cleanser and exfoliants are gentle but effective as well. It is ideal to use the thermal peel, before cleansing and then the thermal peel directly on hyper pigmentation spots every other day if you have oiler skin. As another reviewer pointed out the activator from the peel is not included here so it will not be as strong but it is still a great deal and two quality products in generous sizes are yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said this is a device for the LOWER half of the face below the main pores ONLY! It pulls around the eye area (a huge no no) and along the temples and forehead where that skin needs to not be rippled or furrowed- ever. I would not use it directly on the upper nasasl pores as well if you have even slightly enlarged pores. Mine looked actually bigger the one time I used it directly. They shrunk back the next day thankfully! If you have younger skin it may not matter (though pulling the skin creates cumulative damage) but over 35 or sun damaged skin needs to be mindful of how to use this. The thermal polisher works just fine on areas where the skin can&#x27;t be pulled-just be cautious around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the eye area of someone over well half my age (zero crows feet, bags etc only slight shadows), almost no wrinkles but slightly large pores and some HP spots from wearing the wrong sunglasses this summer (Ray Ban Technicians) and a home glycolic peel gone awry plus some mild acne scarring and very slight sagging around my lower mouth. I&#x27;ve been able to reduce my pores and tighten up my jawline with high end peptides like Genifique and Lancome Regenerist multi lift tinted. There are only two ways to shrink pores, one is to use peptides and be patient while following a healthy berry, fruits and veggies based diet with lots of water or you can conceal them with silicone based products like Loreal Collagen filler (whichdoes keep forehead wrinkles down wonderfully) or Esttee lauder Pore minimizer. The latter solution is mostly temporary. The peptides DO work in the long haul but require a two month wait and then you have to keep using them. Genefique or Lancer method are the best after trying almost all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot offer many reviews of olay products as the anti-aging line is too thick for me so I preferred Neutrogena but now as I&#x27;m over 35, neutro. is not strong enough for me. This brush is still a great part of a regimen because it does keep the rest of your face very clean. My acne has been dramatically reduced along the lower cheeks, neck and jaw lines. Getting a few white heads means I can just brush them away and my dab of clearsil advanced which works in one night not a huge application applied for a week over skin not truly clean. After about two weeks I&#x27;m really happy as I&#x27;m finally breaking the breakout cycle that starts around my period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many on here I&#x27;m not ready to invest in a Clarisonic but will eventually. Having tested one out, I can say that his will not come close to replacing a clarisonic but will still keep you clean and hopefully reduce acne. My darker spots are starter to fade which is great but a Clarisonic, because it has ionic technology and sonic waves is going to get much deeper into the skin, kill bacteria better and stimulate the skin. It is like the difference between the old school interplak tooth brushes and the superior sonic care. One cleans the gums stimulating them (or tearing them if you were not careful) while the sonicare actually healed them and helps you retain youthful gum tissue. As for eyes, Clarisonic makes an applicator with sonic technology called Black Opal that is for use around the delicate eye are and is very pricey, Michael Todd organics eye sonic is half the price and actually as good if not much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all Olay did a great job and this device, if used carefully is an inexpensive way to dramatically improve your skin.</li>
            <li> First of all, the product comes with inadequate instructions.  The package comes with a cleansing product which has some abrasive grit in it, an abrasion only product, sponge attachment, brush attachment, and batteries.  The instructions say (in many languages) how to put the batteries in, and which product to use with which attachment.  It does not say whether to keep the brush and sponge wet, how often to use the products, or any warnings about the problems which I will now describe.&lt;br /&gt;Other similar devices that I have tried have a back and forth agitating movement.  This one has a three speed rotary action.  If you leave even a tiny whisp of hair loose, it can wind clear up to your scalp before you are able to turn the thing off. This is not a theoretical risk.If you decide to use this, make sure you have all your hair secured as if you were scrubbing in to surgery.  If you do get it caught, don&#x27;t panic. Just switch off the device, remove the attachment, and you can get your hair detatched from the attachment quite easily,  You might even  be able to get it untangled. I only had to cut a very little bit out because of the knotted twisting.&lt;br /&gt;Second, and this is more serious, you have to keep the sponge attachment sopping wet.  If you do not, either the motor will not turn  if you are holding it firmly to your skin, or if you press more lightly it grabs the skin intermittently and skips around.  Even if you soak the sponge, it dries out enough without warning to jump unpredictably.  It actually hit me in the open eye twice before I quit trying new strategies.  I didn&#x27;t sustain a corneal injury it could easily have caused a serious injury.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because the products included are actually quite nice.  Just massage around gently with your finger tips.  I have tried to think up what else I might be able to use the machine for but have concluded I might as well just throw it away.</li>
            <li> Olay Pro-X definitely does a great job at cleansing, and microdermabrasion. My complexion is brighter, my skin is softer, a darker patch on one cheek is lighter. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two attachments -- one for cleansing, one for microdermabrasion. There is a blue bottle, and a red bottle. The red goes with the daily attachment, the blue with the micro attachment. It would have been cool to have some color coding on the attachment to make it easier to remember which tool matches which product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My word of caution is to watch your hair, because the tool will catch it. Ouch. And if it doesn&#x27;t yank the hair out, the attachment will spool it, and head for your scalp. Yeah. This happened even though I had my hair pulled back. I now keep my hand between the tool and my hair line as a protective measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended, but be careful. :)</li>
            <li> As battery powered facial cleansing systems go, it&#x27;s ok. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power, but the point is not to scrub your face as if you were sanding wood. It does an ok job of keeping your feeling fresh and exfoliated without harsh chemicals. I would always reccommend to be sure and read the label to check for possible allergic reactions to any ingredients listed. Two or three times a week using this cleaning system is more than enough, followed by regular daily facial washing&#x27;s and once a week facial mask.</li>
            <li> This product comes as a complete package and consists of a hand wand approximately 5 inches long, two snap in/out heads, 2 AA Duracell batteries, a tube of exfoliating cleanser, amd a tube of self-warming thermal crystal polisher.  It is compact and can easily be transported on trips.  I really like the concept of having EVERYTHING you need in this kit when you bring it home.  (How many times do you get something home and say, \\&quot;Oh poo!  I need XYZ-450 batteries\\&quot;!).  Again you get everything and it operates on easy-to-find batteries. :) The wand even shows you which way the batteries go in. (Some other companies are getting lazy with that one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand has 3 speeds: one for gentle cleansing (with facial cleansing brush), one for deep cleansing (with facial cleansing brush), and one for microdermabrasion (with microdermabraision foam head).  If you are looking at the package, the microdermabraision head is the smooth one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package claims:&lt;br /&gt;-- \\&quot;after 1 microdermabraision use, see noticeable improvement in the appearance of fine lines, radiance, brightness, and pores.&lt;br /&gt;-- after 2 microdermabraision uses, visibly improved texture and more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;-- after 5 days of system use, over 90% of women noticed silkier, smoother-feeling skin, and a visible improvement in dullness and overall appearance of skin.\\&quot;  The package also promises satisfaction or refund, with receipt and within 60 days of purchase.  I believe I saw immediate results the morning after my first microdermabrasion treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer recommends limiting microdermabrasion treatments to two per week and on non-consecutive days. The in-between days, you use the face wash and the face wash brush. Of course, this product is not to be used on the delicate skin around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several brands of Microdermabrasion cleansing kits out there, Olay is easy to find.  If you need replacement brush or polishing heads, you should be able to find them easily.  AA batteries are a plus, too.  For the skin cleanser or scrub cream, again, Olay products are everywhere.  If you want to use another facial cleanser or scrubber, you should not have any problems there either. (I used other brands.)  I suggest you dampen the head before use and rinse it off after use, pat it dry, and set it somewhere to thoroughly dry overnight (medicine cabinet or wherever).  I also suggest you remove the head while wetting and rinsing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would like to see added would be a small, cloth, zippered fabric bag/case, about 6 inches long, with \\&quot;Olay\\&quot; on it (Hint to manufacturer), that would keep everything together.  (Of course, you could also use one of those free makeup bags you get from cosmetics companies, BUT I would think Olay would want to take this opportunity to advertise their product.  It would probably only cost them about 50 cents more.)to find them easily.  AA batteries are a plus, too.  For the skin cleanser or scrub cream, again, Olay products are everywhere.

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the Clarisonic Mia after hearing amazing things about it online and from my friends that have it.  The sonic vibration of the Mia is what made me want to get it (vs. the motorized turning of the Olay Pro-X brush)....and surprisingly, the sonic vibration is what I ended up not liking about it.  I felt like it didn&#x27;t exfoliate enough b/c there wasn&#x27;t enough motion (and apparently you&#x27;re not supposed to scrub your face with the brush either).  So I ended up returning the Mia after 3 months or so because I didn&#x27;t see that much difference on my skin.  After that, I just decided to buy a $5 manual facial brush from Sephora and that was working out great, but my face still had flaky skin despite me gently brushing my face for over 10 minutes at a time (I have very flaky skin, especially in the winter, when I use Retin-A).  I bought the Olay Pro-X microermabrasiona Plus system after seeing it in CVS (It&#x27;s $44.99 there and was on sale for $29.99 before tax).  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have to say I notice a big difference already.  For one thing, I no longer have these patchy embarassing flakes coming off my skin (especially around the nose area).  My skin definitely glows more now that I&#x27;ve properly exfoliated.  My dark spots from acne are decreasing more quickly (I think it&#x27;s because the Olay Pro-X exfoliates my skin and also lets the medication I use reach deeper down where it needs to go...not because the Pro-X directly lightens my skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually was considering the original Olay Pro-X brush (the one with 2 speeds), but ended up getting this one.  It&#x27;s $10 more but has an extra faster speed.  Part of me was wondering &amp;#34;who cares about the extra speed?  maybe it&#x27;ll be too fast and irritating&amp;#34;....but even on my super sensitive skin, I like to use the highest speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some reviews where it says your hair gets tangled in the spinning brush.  I haven&#x27;t personally found that to be the case.  I have reallylong hair (down to the middle of my back) and I am cursed with lots of &amp;#34;baby hairs&amp;#34; around my hairline.  Even when I tie back my hair, I still have these 4&amp;#34; wisps of hair that refuse to be tied back.  A lot of times, these wisps of hair are on my face when I use the Olay Pro-X and so far nothing has happened.  The hairs don&#x27;t get pulled into the spin brush.  They just get moved around on my face and there&#x27;s no tugging at all.  Maybe I&#x27;m just lucky...but I personally haven&#x27;t found the spin brush to catch on and pull out my hair like the other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the brush and the sponge as well as the cleanser and thermal crystals.  The cleanser and crystals are nice, but I just use Cetaphil on my skin and then apply the spin brush or sponge.  So far so good.  I have super sensitive skin that is either really oily or really dry (especially around the upper lip and nose when I use Retin-A and Tazorac cream for my acne/wrinkles).  So far, the Pro-X hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.  I try not to push it against my skin very hard, but sometimes I catch myself doing it around the nose area and the extra pressure doesn&#x27;t stop the spin brush from spinning.  I know some people mentioned that that can happen, but so far I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this and I personally prefer this over the Clarisonic in terms of the method of cleansing (I used to think physical spinning was the poor-man&#x27;s version of the sonic motion, but I personally like the spinning motion better).  The price is also very reasonable.  I&#x27;m 35, asian, have sensitive skin that borders on either being really oily or really dry.  I use Cetaphil as a cleanser and pure Argan Oil as my only type of lotion/moisturizer (I get mine off of Amazon...Mogador&#x27;s argan oil....I&#x27;ve really liked it and it&#x27;s helped me a lot!  I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 4 months and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference).  I&#x27;ve found that this Olay Pro-X brush has met my expectations and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my Son and he absolutely loves it :) Amazon was also the best deal I found on this. Great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brush for 3 months, the spots on my face have been clarified, have not disappeared but I can tell the difference, my skin is softer. I am using only the brush and I am not using Olay products. I use Lancome cleaning products with this brush and am very happy with the results</li>
            <li> I bought this and only was able to use it once or twice and simply just doesn&#x27;t work well.  Very low power and I would never recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> This worked excellent. Arrived very quickly.  Face feels so smooth. My daughter tried it and loved it as well. She wants her own now. She is 14. I&#x27;m so very happy I purchased this.</li>
            <li> brush is a little soft but its still effective</li>
            <li> Great price 4  a Great product!!! Quick delv. Will re-order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Easy brush change. Light and comfortable handling. Battery operated, so you can take it in shower, water resistant. Good for traveling too.</li>
            <li> great price for all you get, the brush is nice but the dermabrasion sponge is tricky to use.</li>
            <li> teriffic cleaning system. I like the additional speeds and the micro derma abrasion pad. Excellent, well priced product</li>
            <li> LOVE. LOVE. LOVE. My Dr couldnt believe it when I told her how old I really am. She had me 11 yrs younger.</li>
            <li> very good and reasonable price!</li>
            <li> It is not strong like clarisonic but you can use it for a little while until you can afford paying strong one</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kit. Everything you need to start working towards healthy looking skin. My only complaint is that the bristles on the brush are too soft and there are no alternative brush heads available. The 3 speeds are fantastic and the sponge head attachment works perfect on the highest setting just as the instructions suggest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I lived without this spin brush.  I wish we had had such a product when I was a teenager.  I haven&#x27;t tried the micro-dermabrasion brush head yet, but the regular scrubber works wonderful.</li>
            <li> It works great and fast shipping. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this kit!  Noticed a huge difference after just one use of the microdermabraision pad and cleanser. The cleansers that come with the kit will last you about five uses.  The price of the whole set on Amazon is the best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> This has been great. I&#x27;ve noticed the difference in my skin since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> This is a cleaning system that comes with 2 brush heads and two sample sizes of Olay&#x27;s cleansers.  You get one brush head for regular cleaning and one foam head for deep exfoliating.  There are two samples of the cleansers that comes with this.  One is a daily use cleaner with a bead like exfoliating agent that is designed to be used with the brush head.  The other is a thermal crystal (they heat up on contact with the skin) exfoliating cleanser that is designed to be used with the foam head.  You can also use regular facial soap with the brush.  The system has three speeds and comes with batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like the system.  After a few days of using this, I told my husband I thought my skin looked better and he agreed with me!  Since my husband is one of the world&#x27;s most honest men, if he didn&#x27;t agree with this, he would have said something noncommittal to skirt the issue.  So I had to believe it wasn&#x27;t just my wishful thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have been using this a month and I am pretty happy with the product.  The one thing this product could use is better instructions for when you use this the first time.  I would recommend starting with a slow speed and increasing the intensity as your skin adjusts.  I will probably not get thier daily cleanser but I will buy more of the exfoliating cleanser. Good product, recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. I do not use the products inside, I use professional products instead. The Brush itself is great. Does its job, skin feels clean and tight immediately after, love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom.  She loves it.  Her sensitive skin is always an issue but this device does not bother her.  Replacement heads are cheap too which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> I REALY ONLY WANTED TO GET THE MACHIE FOR THE MICRODERM BUT T WORKS SO WELL AND FEELS GREAK WITH JUST A REGUAR CLEANSER ALSO PLEASE HAS DIFFRENT SPEEDS FOR THE MOR HARSH SCRUBS.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> After first use, my skin felt better and softer.  Also did a good job of cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li> hello people, Alhamdulillah i ve received the item 2 days after i ordered it from saudi arabia. I am very satisfied with the package and the item itself, its just a little bit of trouble i ve got when i was trying to put in the batteries. Anyway i managed to make it function. Today is 5th day of using the system, i am very happy with a small result. My skin feel much better, less oily especially at my T-zone, and my skin is very clean and soft. Its an affordable price than the other expensive brands as i reviewed before i ordered this system. I totally promoted this items to whom that still in doubts to buy the expensive or cheaper item. Alhamdulillah again.</li>
            <li> supr value!buy 2,1 for free.&lt;br /&gt;express is very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Only use blue tube on my nose, the result is visible.&lt;br /&gt;skin become smoother  and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;but sensive skin must not use it frenquetly cause it could make your skin thinner than ever.</li>
            <li> This product was a complete disappointment and waste of money and time. I would not recommend it to anyone.  This product is quite overpriced for what it is.  The included device, which circulates the exfoliation sponge and liquid, isn&#x27;t worth any more than $10.  The exfoliation brushes are a joke and may best work with somebody with minor exfoliation needs and very delicate skin.  I immediately threw away the flat sponge which is only designed to give you a &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; and is completely useless to me.  They only send 2 very small sample bottles of their exfoliating liquid product which is supposed to work in conjunction with the device &amp; sponges.  Unless you only need/want a very minor and subtle exfoliating treatment, this is not the product for somebody with moderate to serious exfoliating needs.  A total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this thing I was unimpressed. I thought, &amp;#34;This little thing is going to do a number on my dull skin? No way.&amp;#34; But I was wrong! I don&#x27;t see the point in the slower speeds, but I just got it and I may make use of them in the future. After one use of this thing with the microdermabrasion pad and crystal polisher, my skin is glowing and fresh. I actually feel it to be more effective than the real microdermabrasion treatments I&#x27;ve received at a spa. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap.  Any pressure stops it from rotating.</li>
            <li> It was very smart decision to purchase this kit regarding the price although I rarely use the Microdermabrasion Foam Head and Thermal Crystal Polisher. I chose Olay because it is easy to access for brush head replacement. I experienced small breakouts for the first time use. But it got better and I am satisfied with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Eh. It works well but not as big and as powerful as I expected. Great for the price but doesn&#x27;t work miricles or anything.</li>
            <li> I just received  this today, and I usually don&#x27;t review  products this soon or ever..but I just used the product.. and wow!!! My face feels amazing I only used the cleansing  brush because it says you can&#x27;t use both in one day.. i am so excited to try the microdermabrasion  brush tommorrow.. my face is already soft from the cleanser!! I am so happy  I got this!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the advice of my mom who uses it. I&#x27;m impressed with how clean my face is after using the cleaning brush. It definitely reaches down and extracts the grime and dirt from my pores. My face feels clean and refreshed after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating brush is wonderful! I can see a noticeable difference after using it - my skin is brighter and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this - it&#x27;s helping take years off my skin!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an I-Skin device which I loved.  This product gets the job done, but is not as powerful as I expected it to be.  It is priced right and includes a cleanser and polisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something that really scrubs, you might need something more powerful.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and really like the feel of my skin after I use this with my Olay products.  Thanks for a great price.</li>
            <li> Good price and faster deliver</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy the exfoliation of this product and the cleansers that come with it. The exfoliation speeds are gently, yet efficient and I love how soft and smooth my face and neck felt after only 1 treatment. I used it 3 times per week and have only a bit of redness after the initial wash. This redness only lasts for a few minutes after I apply my daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> Easy to use....I alternate heads Monday,Tuesday and, Friday I use Micro Head and all other days mornings.and nights....I use the brush my skin looks brighter.</li>
            <li> Great delivery time and I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> Rotation speed is insufficient; it feels under-powered. The microderm gel is too course. I recommend finding an alternative microderm gel or cream and using it in conjunction with the Olay pad for better results.</li>
            <li> good quality&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Cleans my face pretty good. My skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li> This has no guts to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I just received it. So, didn&#x27;t have enough time to use.&lt;br /&gt;I hope my face get smoother with this Olay~:)</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as durable as I thought it would be, although it does get a light weight job done on cleaning the face etc.</li>
            <li> Unable to find microdermabrasion foam head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about as good as any $5 exfoliating cleanser, didn&#x27;t really do much of anything. Not worth the price, not even for the spinning brush that&#x27;ll break in a week.</li>
            <li> This is a desirable and easy to use product. It was well liked that we had to go back and purchase a second one for our other daughter.</li>
            <li> i bought this on my dads prime. and i love it&lt;br /&gt;i think if you dont have a lot of skin problems like serious acne this is perfect to use instead of the clairisonic. i have a breakout  maybe once or twice a week and some dry skin due to weather changes. this really really helps, i notice im breaking out less, and i had a few purple acne scars and it faded them to almost gone and i used some vitamin e oil on them as well, i tried lots of DIY treatments for my scars and this product worked SO well better than anything else, i only had about 3 or 4 small scars. i put enough of the crystals on my face that it hurts to touch it or else it doesnt feel effect with the brush at all, i really slather it on.&lt;br /&gt;this greats off so much of my makeup way more than using a makeup wipe or some cleaner with your hands. you can see it on the brush and thats yor proof. i think its perfect for anyone who wants something more than their hands but dont want to spend the 200 bucks.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;This works amazing.</li>
            <li> It is great. I love this.</li>
            <li> Too good.&lt;br /&gt;Over easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;But the face is a little scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;Washing want to make a more smooth cornering.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like so much....stopped using the scrubbing part broke my face out from the red tube...</li>
            <li> This is the worst microdermabrasion tool I&#x27;ve ever used :(</li>
            <li> I have been using for close to a month, I really cannot tell a difference from any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> I used this product only one time and the next day at work I had 2 co-workers approach me about my skin looking so good and what did I do different. I think that sums it up in a nutshell.</li>
            <li> Good!!&lt;br /&gt;Quality, Performance and so on. Very good</li>
            <li> Makes cleansing easier for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Really good product, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The hand held cleansing machine was pretty weak.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!  I had noticeably softer skin and smaller pores.  I read a lot of reviews and decided on this product, and I am so pleased.  I use other face washes with it but find olays were probably best exfoliants.</li>
            <li> love love this product!!! my skin is soooo glowing and mucj better looking!!! no more breakouts! my new must have! recomed it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I simply love this product!  I love the way the product makes my skin feel.  Since I have started using it, my skin feels really smooth and fresh.  That&#x27;s the only way I can explain it.  I have heard great reviews on this cleaning system and I was a little skeptical at first, but I don&#x27;t regret purchasing this product.  After using it, when I apply my night creams it goes on smooth and seeps into my skin perfectly.  I will be purchasing again as a gift for my mom and sister.</li>
            <li> I have this one, and that really expensive one &amp;#34;ClariXXX&amp;#34; something.  No comparison in quality.  Spend the money for the heavy duty one.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical to buy this after reading many mixed reviews. A few months after turning 30 my chin area started to get horrible cystic acne! I felt like I was back in high school. I&#x27;ve always had combination/acne prone skin but it has been clear for years with the occasional breakout. I was getting desperate as nothing was clearing up my face, I didn&#x27;t even want to go to work! I was nervous to try this as people were saying it made them break out for the first few weeks. But since nothing else was working I decided to go for it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I can happily say my face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in the past 6 months! It didn&#x27;t make me break out but it did take a few weeks (tops) to start clearing. At 3 weeks I have no new zits and my cystic acne on my chin is gone :) I use good face lotion right after I use this and I think that has helped too. I used the microdermabrasion pad for the first time last night and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with it. I had to keep putting more water on my face as it was pulling my skin really bad. I may do it once a week but the regular brush seems to be working great for me as of now. Keeping my fingers crossed that it continues to work for me! Oh, and I also use Purpose face soap with it instead of what they supply as I know that will not make me break out.</li>
            <li> works fine, skin feels great after using it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels nice after use. Pores still there - no changes there.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I thought it would be:  I can get a better cleaning experience using my hands. The rotating brush turns very very slowly on fast. This just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Very gentle thorough cleaning! Love that it came with both the brush and sponge heads. Have not used their cleaning products yet, use my own. Will probably try their products eventually, and if I really like them I will update.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have very sensitive skin and almost never try new products. However, I&#x27;ve had great luck with Olay products, including some (not all) of the Regenerist and Pro serums and moisturizers. I took a chance on this and it works well. I only use the crystals once a week and use a Regenerist cleanser no more than twice a week. My skin is very, very soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> It works absolutely perfect. I suffer from adult onset acne and have combination skin. I recently suffered from a heavy breakout which left my skin rough and scarred. I have been using the brush twice a week and dermabrasion once in ten days followed by an intense hydration mask. The frequency of use is so low for me because my skin is very sensitive and I am not even able to use setting more than one. But even with this frequency, I have noticed major difference. My skin is very smooth, soft and scars are slowly fading. I only use this in phases when I don&#x27;t have any active pimples. It is an absolute steal at the price. Will definitely advise people to try it for themselves.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well. I have oily skin and this helps plently. I also use this device when applying acne creme, very useful!</li>
            <li> Product is just ok. Definitely nowhere near as powerful as I imagined it would be. Instructions for use are almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> The Olay Exfoliating system works wonderfully! At first I was only getting this as a back up and travel exfoliating machine. I compared against higher end companies machines I have purchased. I achieved the same results! I absolutely love the way my skin glows now with both of the included products. My acne has disappeared with faithful usage! I highly recommend the whole kit! I have since purchased more product I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> Cleans OK. Not seeing any real improvement.</li>
            <li> This system is pretty foolproof - 2 cleaning heads and 2 cleaning products.  The head rotates instead of vibrating which I like.  After I used the microdermabrasion head and product my skin was sensitive for a day.  Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, and it seems really expensive so I might be ticked off if I&#x27;d paid full price!</li>
            <li> The brush is soft enough so that I can use it every without making my skin feel raw or tender.  I use the other pad twice a week for a slight abrasion.  The cleanser and polisher creams are good and the tubes have lasted a long time. I am happy with this reasonably priced item.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find an affordable cleansing system.  Bought another one for a friend&#x27;s birthday and will buy another soon for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  Easy to pack for a weekend away from home too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product has really changed the way my skin looks.  You can use it with the products enclosed or with your favorite products.</li>
            <li> Awful! Made my skin itch for weeks</li>
            <li> This should be a 3.5 star rating mainly because I wish this came with more cleansing product. Tubes aren&#x27;t even half full. As far as the little machine is concerned, it&#x27;s not as strong as I thought it might be but it did make my skin softer and cleaned most of my pores. I could see with extended use this improving skin appearance, not a bad little cleaner over all for the price..</li>
            <li> Great machine for the price!</li>
            <li> I had a Mia and it only lasted 6 months. This is just as good and less than a third of the price.  Good product</li>
            <li> Great price and works amazing!! After doing a ton of reviews on which one I should get I decided to go with this one and I am not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> helps my skin so much.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after a friend recommended the Clarisonic. After reading some reviews on Amazon I found that for the price this was the best bang for my buck. I also figured if my wife didn&#x27;t like it that I could just send it back with Amazons great return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife doesn&#x27;t have bad acne by any means, but she recently went off of birth control and was starting to have minor breakouts, especially on her chin. Within the first week we already noticed the acne clear up. Now she uses it twice a day for regular cleaning with basic face wash and once a week with the provided cleaner. For the most part she only uses the regular brush head and doesn&#x27;t use the microdermabrasion too often. We&#x27;ve had this for 2 months now and the brush head still looks new and still running on the original batteries. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and you notice how clean your skin is right after use.</li>
            <li> So so so glad I purchased this brush !! My face constantly felt tight and rough , the reason for this was due to soap residue . I purchased face scrub , exfoliators etc , nothing worked ! I started to break out really bad , due to residue build up my pores were clogged . While browsing on Amazon I bumped into this product , I had the option of choosing 1 of 2 olay brushes , this ones more expensive but I liked the fact that it has 3 rotation speed levels . The first day I used it I INSTANTLY noticed a difference . My face felt free clean soft renewed ! I have now been using this brush for about 4 days and my face has never looked better !</li>
            <li> Durable and works great...I wish the samples were a little bigger though</li>
            <li> I debated for awhile whether or not to get a cleansing brush. After seeing more expensive options I decided to try Olay since it was much cheaper. It is one of the best purchases I ever made. My skin is glowing now!! Definitely a must for everyone.</li>
            <li> Used and pleasantly surprised. Keeps face clean.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AMAZING.!! FOR THE PRICE I DIDNT THINK IT WAS GONNA BE ALL THAT GOOD BUT IT WAS, THE FIRST NIGHT I USED IT MY SKIN WAS NICE AND SOFT</li>
            <li> Thank you for good product with reasonable price. I used this from two weeks ago, and when this brush is used, my skin seems to be more clean and less greasy.</li>
            <li> Happy with this item.</li>
            <li> What works for me for night cleansing: I use my fingers using a good quality face creamy cleanser, compatible to my skin type, to remove make up or environmental dirt. Then the cleansing brush with some Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser on it for the 2nd cleanse. You use the cleansing brush daily for daily cleansing. For your weekly microdermabrasion treatment you put some Thermal Crystal on the foam to polish your skin. In general if you have a cleansing brush and a facial foam you do not need any device to cleanse &amp; exfoliate. Your fingers will do just as good a job as long as you do a thorough cleansing (double cleanse) &amp; your procedure is long enough. At any rate if you want to use a cleansing device only there is a cleansing brush by Olay without this hefty price tag. I find myself not using the foam head very often as it wastes a lot of crystals. I prefer to use my fingers as I could target the areas that need polishing more &amp; I could control how much crystals are needed for specific areas of my face. The Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser &amp; the Thermal Crystal Polisher that came with this device are brilliant products. You may use other crystals as long as they are rounded and not ground seeds of some sort. Some of those ground seeds have jagged edges which enlarge your pores after a while and/or graze your skin. If you have active acne, wait till your acne is under control before using this or any similar device. If you have superficial acne scars this device might help soften those especially if you have fair skin. If you&#x27;re olive skinned it might trigger hyperpigmentation if used weekly so experiment with it. In most cases I find using the crystals once every 2 weeks for olive or darker skins do not trigger hyperpigmentation. Microdermabrasion is used as a weekly or bi-weekly polishing procedure. I find using the brush for my daily 2nd cleansing routine very helpful. As an aside, applying vitamin C or alpha hydroxy serums is a real treat after microdermabrasion. Experiment on an area of your face to feel if it stings. If you can stand the sting for a few minutes, apply to your whole face. You will see the result the next morning. Actually even without microdermabrasion applying anti-oxidants to your face after a thorough cleanse is very beneficial. Back this up by eating foods rich in them as a way of life and you delay the signs of aging. Gravity is a different story.riment on an area of your face to feel if it stings.

            <li> I received this product a little over a week ago and so far I love it. I notice a significant difference in my skin. I am using my regular face wash with the every day brush twice a day and the micro sponge with the olay thermal Crystal cleanser twice a week. My skin type is dry combination but clear. I have a few fine lines on my forehead in particular. Overall, since using this my skin is so smooth. It feels so fresh, clean, and healthy. It is definitely more radiant. I really feel that with long term use my fine lines will be less noticeable and feel that this will help to reduce more lines. The only reasons I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars are because it would be nice to have a timer and I&#x27;m not quite sure how long it is going to last. Also, a few times I have gone to turn the unit on and it won&#x27;t start. I have to give the head a little spin and it will get going.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  Like getting a facial at a salon only so much cheaper.  excellent product.  Will buy the tubes of exfoliant and cleanser again to go with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my skin, used as directed for two weeks.  I still have blackheads, didn&#x27;t gain radiance, and it&#x27;s really messy to use.  I am middle-aged so have used quite a variety of products, and this one is so-so by my standards.  I think I&#x27;ll just go back to a good old-fashioned washcloth.  It&#x27;s much less messy and I get just as good of results.</li>
            <li> not sure why everyone raved about this product.  It is an average over the counter microdermabrasion kit.  The power is average and the cleaning is a little better than just putting cleanser on your face.  The price wasn&#x27;t bad so no regrets but would not purchase again for the lack of results.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face, but does not seem to be doing do much better than washing with my hands. I think the bristles need to be stronger, the rotation definitely needs some work. Maybe a faster speed would help too.</li>
            <li> I liked it at first. However, it lasted about 3-4 months after daily use. I am disappointed because I purchased one for a friend s gift.  I do NOT recommend it!!  Unfortunately it is CHEAP. It stalls, work occasionally. It is  NOT dependable for daily face cleaning.. SAVE UR money. I am disappointed of OIL of OLAY!  This brush is a flap</li>
            <li> Special offer when buy, wash very clean</li>
            <li> OMG i love this thing</li>
            <li> I am glad to have a great product at a low cost.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to supply a good product.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This is outstanding. I love it.face feels great.</li>
            <li> The bristles could be a little firmer but it&#x27;s all in your preference so I still give it full stars.</li>
            <li> Good for skin. Soft move and easy to use.</li>
            <li> got it less than 20 bucks.  It did a good job.</li>
            <li> I love, love this machine. I am amazed how gentle it is on my face and how soft and clean it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> just what my sister was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have had the Clarisonic Pro, its battery died and I didn&#x27;t want to spend money replacing it....especially since I didn&#x27;t love it.  This Olay Pro-X worked much better for me.  Also as the brush spins instead of vibrating, it cleans my skin faster and seems to leaving my skin glowing because its more vigorous and sends the blood up to my skin better.  The vibration on the Clarisonic didn&#x27;t do anything for me, but my skin is only slightly sensitive.  There are 3 speeds on this the Olay, and if I need to I just press very gently on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use the different speeds, I  use the lower speed for cheeks and top speed for my T-Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my own cleansers, I prefer to wet my face with cleanser first, and place the brush on dry so it doesn&#x27;t send spray everywhere.</li>
            <li> I am a male with occassional breakouts and combination skin. This is a really good product for deep cleaning my face and leaves you with a very clean feel, but personally, I find the bristles a bit harsh on my skin. I use it to clean my face at the highest setting but I put little to no pressure on my face, as the bristles are a little harsh on my face. Even so, I only use it once a day either in the morning or at night. The good thing about the bristles is that you can use less of your cleanser because the spinning action builds up bubbles. After using this for a few weeks I have fewer whiteheads and blackheads. As for the microdermabrasion, it doesn&#x27;t do much. The foam pad with the microdermabrasion gel gets really hot after spinning a few seconds on my face and does not work well, I have better results with my chemical exfoliator which I rub on my face. Overall, the bristle is quite effective but the microdermabrasion part of this product is almost useless.</li>
            <li> This has helped me so much with my acne. I never got more of the cleaning products that came with it. I just turn it on rub it against a bar of soap to get a lather and add a few drops of tea tree oil. I can tell a difference after a few day with using just a wash cloth when I didn&#x27;t have this brush with me. I started to get breakouts on my forehead and nose. Using this with regular bar soap and tea tree oil has done more for me that accutane or any over the counter acne medicine. I know different things work for different people, but as someone who has suffered from severe acne for almost 20 years this is at least worth a try.</li>
            <li> Using daily and seeing an improvement.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would. Great device for the price.</li>
            <li> I use to break out but not anymore since using this</li>
            <li> Not as powerful and I would expect.  Tubes of cleanser very tiny.  Be prepared to buy more soon.</li>
            <li> We love this mattress</li>
            <li> This facial microdermabrasion brush set works wonderfully. Many have commented about it pulling the thin skin around the eyes. If you rotate the brush in a small circle in the opposite direction in these areas, it counteracts the pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complexion has drastically improved...especially in the pores on my nose. I use an anti-acne face wash with this brush about 3 times per week.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase. It does indeed clean deep down, much deeper expected. Mine has worked just fine for my needs. Very pleased, and do recommend this for a more affordable option to clarisonic</li>
            <li> awesome lil system for a VERY reasonable price.  face feels GREAT after using it :)</li>
            <li> After only one month of average use, the motor died. I tried changing the batteries, but it still did not work.</li>
            <li> I love this device.  Can definitely see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;My skin love it :)</li>
            <li> I used it once and I love it so far. Definitely have to work it into my routine for at least once a week. I have a super busy schedule. My skin was so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Really well priced and it works very well.</li>
            <li> This is okay... It has three settings for speed/power, but I always use the highest and it still doesn&#x27;t feel strong enough... I like that it&#x27;s 100% waterproof, so you can use it in the shower. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t make a mess and the size is nice and small so it&#x27;s easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> It is a nice set but not enough power to clean a skin. Just a waste of money! Check other brands.</li>
            <li> 1 for wife ,1 for mommy. Good for ladies.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It says not to use everyday, but I do anyways. My skin is so soft and has cleared up! I didn&#x27;t realize how much gunk was left on my face - very gross. I ran out of the products that it came with and just use my daily skin cleaner instead. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I decided to save myself $200 buying the name brand competitor.  I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 weeks and noticed a difference in my complexion.  The combo of using this, good moisturizer, and a BB cream has eliminated foundation from my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like the daily cleansing wash, I use my regular face wash.  I haven&#x27;t had to buy the microderm wash just yet but I do like the feel.</li>
            <li> At the price, I expected to receive full size products not a small sample size, in addition the batteries were dead :(</li>
            <li> i feel that my skin got cleared all dead cell removed.&lt;br /&gt;i love to use this one, easy to use and not much take time</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprise to see just in 3 days how much this product not only cleared up my completion it also made my completion glow!&lt;br /&gt;Wash your face ever night with Pro-x Microdermabrasion and you will see results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was only twenty bucks because this was a real disappointment  As soon as you put the batteries in and start using it feels like it&#x27;s going dead already. I&#x27;d rather use a soft sponge and some dove soap. I believe my face gets a lot cleaner that way. This just doesn&#x27;t seem to do the job for me. It may work for some but it truly didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other cleaning systems of various price ranges.  Being an Olay user for years, I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try.  I do like the fact it actually rotates with 3 speeds instead of the standard pulsating vibrations of the others I have used.  The ONLY issue I have is the size of the applicators which are a bit smaller than what I am used to BUT this does make it easier to get a thorough clean.  Found it for half the price on Amazon so, if you want a fresh start for your skin this year, give this system a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush system after carefully reviewing this brush set against other face cleaning  system,  I must admit I love this system I uses it every other day to clean my face and I have seen so many improvements in my skin for example no more pimple break out, I&#x27;m very happy with my new clear skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! My daughter borrowed it and loved it so much I have to buy another for her...</li>
            <li> Product is cheap, not made well and I don&#x27;t expect it to last long. I should have Spent the extra few dollars and got the sonic handheld.</li>
            <li> This RUINED MY SKIN!!!! I have sensitive skin and have been using a sonic brush (another brand) for a year and it cleared up my skin due to it cleaning deeper than just your hands. I recently dropped my brush and it broke and saw one by Olay on sale (this packet). I decided to try it because it was by Olay. Week one: fine, soft skin Midway into week two: My entire skin is peeling, black and extremely rough (especially my cheeks, sides of my face, and around my mouth) I have to cake on makeup now to be presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I tried it myself before gifting. I have been using the &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; cleansing brush on the lowest speed and it has ruined me!! My skin has never been this black or especially this rough. It looks Damaged. I should have spent extra on the clarisonic; this is ABSOLUTELY not comparable. Now I have to undo this damage.</li>
            <li> Expected this product to have a stronger brush action...feels so light on the face.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have major blackhead problem &amp; with this product I can control my skin!</li>
            <li> Love it. Leaves my skin feeling fresh &amp; clean. Not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> I was worries when i read few negative reviews but at the end i purchased this and i&#x27;m happy i did it. The speed doesn&#x27;t matter, it do the job. I try using the product right after i received it (I was wondering......why couple reviewers are not satisfied with this cleansing system and complaint about the rolling speed...I guess they having a thick, rough face skin? *no offend please....) Anyway, i found this cleansing system kit is good purchase and i see changes on my face and feel it do the job, deep clean the pores and skin. (i got it at a very good price during the lightning deal!) I saw some merchandise sell it with quite pricey price. Hence, i am happy with this kit!</li>
            <li> works great!  The 2x week microdermabrasion tends to dry my face out in spots, so I found using it 1xweek for me is better.&lt;br /&gt;The other brush system works really good, makes my face feel cleaner and pores look better.</li>
            <li> Love this, bought me and my sister one we both love it.</li>
            <li> The works really good. In fact I found a skin cancer I had on my that I didn&#x27;t know I had. The pad on the cleansing system went over it and it started bleeding and when it didn&#x27;t heal I went to the doctor and he said I caught it just in time. So Thanks Oly Pro-X.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the high priced ones!  :)</li>
            <li> Using it every night and it has improved the appearance of my skin texture. I have found that I can use it to get into the areas of my face that are hard to get to and clean (between the nose and checks). I have also used the spinning brush with other cleansing products to eliminate acne. My pores are much cleaner and I am seeing better results from my facial night moisturizer. I would definitely recommend you buy this product, it’s worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use...cleans very well.</li>
            <li> The skin stays moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this device faithfully for two weeks (using the brush daily and the foam head twice a week), and all I can say is wow. I can really feel and see a difference in my skin. My husband has even commented on how soft my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush feels delicately soft in use with the red-capped wash. It rinses off well just standing at the sink, because let&#x27;s be honest...who wants to do this in the shower? I&#x27;ve yet to actually take my device in the shower for two reasons a.) I can&#x27;t see how close to my hairline I&#x27;m actually getting, and I don&#x27;t want my hair to get caught in the thing. b.) I want to keep water out of the water-proof looking container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foam head is nice, but I won&#x27;t replace it. In the two weeks I&#x27;ve used my unit, the pad had broken down considerably from the tiny beads in the blue cap wash. If you don&#x27;t squeeze out excess water when you are done with washing your face, I can only imagine how nasty it would get with mold. The blue cap cleanser...that is AMAZING. It is literally the best face scrubber I have ever used, and I will buy more after it is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried using this with another face wash I have, and I got a foamy mess that spun all over my bathroom mirror and me. I&#x27;m not sure if I just used too much cleanser, but it was a disaster. I&#x27;m hoping not, because as nice as this device is I don&#x27;t want to have to buy strictly Olay product in order to use it. Something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had quite a few breakouts in the past couple weeks, but I do not know whether it is from the device or stress. I&#x27;m not going to quit using it just because of the device even if it where as I&#x27;m sure my skin is just adjusting to the more vigorous scrubbing &#x27;ceremony&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This item was on her wish list and she couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It is light, fits in your hand very nicely and does a great job. It came with Olay cleansing products. The multi-speed circulating heads is also a very nice feature.</li>
            <li> This works just OK.  If you really want effective cleaning for your skin - save your money and buy a Clarisonic.  The amounts of the cleanser and exfoliater are about a sample size.  It won&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after having the Olay Cleansing System (after three years, I started to get moldy from being in the shower at all times) without the microdermabrasion serum and foam head. I really like that product but the microdermabrasion takes it to a whole new level! My skin was instantly smoother after using the foam head and heated crystals one time. The three speeds available make the regular cleansing head even more effective, as opposed to the two speeds with the older version.</li>
            <li> My microdermabrasion head sponge came off in just 3 uses. The regular head is great and u can see visible effects after 1 use.</li>
            <li> The product is great and it&#x27;s easy to use. I will continue to use this product as an essential for my regimen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the more expensive ones are like, but this one is pretty good for the money. I don&#x27;t know how it compares to the expensive ones, but seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS! Makes my face feel like baby skin... and if you do it before putting on your make up: WONDERFUL! Makes the makeup blend in with your face even more</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit from Target after reading good reviews from Amazon. I am pregnant and have been looking for something that will save me some time. I purchased 2 months ago and use the Advanced cleanser twice a week. I have combo to oily skin and have always had blackheads on my nose and chin. I&#x27;m happy to say this cleanser has brought all of the dirt/oil to the surface so it&#x27;s easy to get rid of.&lt;br /&gt;  My complaint about this kit is with the Thermal Polisher which is the main reason I bought this kit. Unfortunately the first and only time I used it, it burnt my skin. I had a red half-circle mark on my forehead which is the first area I washed. The rest of my face was slightly pink. Plus the cleansing pad is so soft it really doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s cleaning well.&lt;br /&gt; Maybe my skin is just more sensitive due to pregnancy?? I would just say be careful when using if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Being satisfied with the Advanced Cleanser and cleansing brush, I just bought a large tube of cleanser and 2 replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the brush - the brush pads wear out so quickly though. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try microdermabreasion, and this is a great first try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this. I don&#x27;t use the scrubs that come with it, just my usual face wash and exfoliate. I&#x27;ve been using this a couple months now and my pores look smaller and not as clogged and my skin is smooth. My skin is extremely acne prone and I only noticed that it broke me out for the first couple of days. I think my face needed to adjust because it&#x27;s been pretty clear ever since. I bought this because I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $300 on a Clarisonic and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Never tried one of these til now and I love it. I even have my son using it who is an auto mechanic. So it helps his face with all the grease he&#x27;s around. What a difference it makes and bought the replacement heads. good price and shipping.</li>
            <li> This really gets your face clean, and I think the moisturizer can sink in better then.  I always get compliments on my complexion and this is one reason.  I love the 3 speeds, and being ablle to use microdermabrasion head at home.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin smoother after using it, but i&#x27;m not sure if I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> These are the directions: Dampen facial skin and system head with water. Apply Pro-X formula to face. Turn on the system. gently massage on face for 60 seconds. avoid eye area. Rinse face and system head with water. Advanced daily cleansing gentle enough for daily use on days when microdermabrasion treatment not used. Microdermabrasion treatments should be limited to 2 non-consecutive days/week. Replace system head as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have done the microdermabrasion treatment 2x per week and I am impressed with the results. It exfoliates nicely and my skin feels smoother than before. It also brightens the appearance of my skin. It really feels like it is sloughing off the dead and dry skin, leaving a smoother result. I also like how easy it is to use. The brush feels nice on my face and is not abrasive. It is a gentle brush yet I do not use the system just for cleaning days. I like to give my face a break from the brush between microdermabrasion treatments. Though on the low settings I am sure it is fine to use on cleansing days. It is just a matter of preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And no, this is not the Clarisonic and I would not expect it to be because it does not cost hundreds of dollars. Instead, the price point is something that I can afford to keep doing as the cost of the refills are reasonable. All in all it works great for a home Microdermabrasion kit and I am pleased with my smoother skin!</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this product a little over a week ago because I was wanting the Clarisonic but it was just too much out of our price range for something I wasn&#x27;t sure about. I tried this product and I am VERY impressed. I am not sure how much better another brand could be, because I have seen a total transformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I was just using a Clinique cleanser and washing with my hands, no tools or wash cloths. I do not have acne, but my main problem is blackheads and white heads around my chin. I am so used to just having several imperfections on my face that always bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is now almost flawless. I still have a few dark spots from previous pimples, but I can finally can see myself having perfectly clear skin and I had no idea it was possible for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the settings as instructed--only using the high setting 2-3 times a week. I have always had oily skin and avoided moisturizers, but I might actually invest in one now. The oil has cut down dramatically and my face feels as soft as baby skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Clarisonic Mia for about three years, but wanted to try out this new Olay system since I was intrigued by the idea of the microdermabrasion head.  This is a quality product, and it&#x27;s a great value for those looking for something comparable to the Clarisonic, but at a better price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush comes with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  two Duracell batteries (which I really like, since you don&#x27;t have to worry about re-charging it)&lt;br /&gt;*  two brush heads (one for regular cleaning and one that is a buffing pad for microdermabrasion)&lt;br /&gt;*  two different cleansers (one for each brush head)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself also has three speeds, and you change the speeds by pushing on buttons, which are very easy to use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  Speed 1 is the Daily Gentle Cleansing Speed that is meant to be used with the regular brush head&lt;br /&gt;*  Speed 2 is the Daily Deep Cleansing Speed that that is meant to be used with the regular brush head; it supposedly cleans 600% better than regular cleansing&lt;br /&gt;*  Speed 3 is the Microdermabrasion Speed that is meant to be used with the Microdermabrasion Foam Head; it supposedly exfoliates 700% better than their scrub alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head itself also rotates, which it doesn&#x27;t do on the Clarisonic Mia.  According to the packaging, the brush heads are interchangeable with the other Pro-X brush heads in this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer mentioned, the frustrating thing is that the kit doesn&#x27;t come with a complete set of instructions; except for a brief brochure that tells you how to put the batteries in, everything is printed on the exterior of the box, and it&#x27;s actually a bit confusing to read since the information is scattered in various places.  It would have been nice to have had a pamphlet that spelled things out more clearly, especially since I plan on throwing the box away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, Olay recommends that you use the regular cleanser with the brush heads each day, but the microdermabrasion pad and cleanser only twice a week, on non-consecutive days.  When you use the microdermabrasion pad, it really tugs and sucks at your skin, so don&#x27;t be alarmed by this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this without Olay&#x27;s cleansers and it&#x27;ll work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head for regular cleansing is definitely not as soft and plush as the brush heads are on my Clarisonic Mia, but it didn&#x27;t feel too abrasive on my sensitive skin, which can flare up really badly if I use something too harsh on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and was a bit apprehensive about using the microdermabrasion part, but I did so yesterday and really liked how soft and smooth my skin felt afterwards.  My face was a bit red when I finished, but some soothing lotion helped calm it back down, and I was left with a nice healthy glow.  I also liked how it removed the skin flakes that I get from my nightly use of Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I bought my Clarisonic Mia, I had bought this Pretika brush:  [[ASIN:B001SERK9G Pretika SonicDermabrasion Facial Brush]].  This Olay brush is much better than the Pretika, and seems like it will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, here are the ingredients for the Thermal Crystal Polisher:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEG 8, Sodium Bicarbonate, Silica Silylate, Polysorbate 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients for the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water/Eau, Glycerin, Lauramidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Polyethylene, Sorbitol, Acrylates Copolymer, PEG-200 Hydrogenated Glyceryl Palmate, Citric Acid, Potassium Hydroxide, Polyquaternium-10, PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate, PEG-100, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Chloride, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone. Thermal Crystal Polisher Ingredients: PEG-8, Sodium Bicarbonate, Silica Silylate, Polysorbate 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great system for the price, and it seems like it&#x27;ll hold up nicely.  If you&#x27;re looking for a facial cleansing system, this is a nice one to get, especially since it comes with themicrodermabrasion buffer, too!microdermabrasion buffer, too!</li>
            <li> I have never used a microdermabrasion product, but I have heard from so many people that it is just wonderful. There are super pricey ones out there, but this one is absolutely great for the price. My face does feel a ton cleaner and smoother afterward. Creams and masks work so much better after using this product. I do wish there was a little more cleanser and polisher. The cleansing/spinning sponge brush works nicely, but the real gem is the exfoliating/spinning brush. The bristles are extra soft, but they really do remove the dull layers skin. I am convinced that a brush any rougher would be too much. I only use it once or twice a week tops. Love this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this cleansing system. When she first started using it, I asked her if it cleanses better. Her reply was \\&quot;Oh my gosh, way better!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after using the system for 3 weeks now, her skin is much smoother and clear of blemishes. She points out that she uses her own cleanser, not the cleanser provided by the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my daughter told me that this kit is a good budget-friendly substitute for the more expensive Clarisonic Mia. The Olay Pro-X brush works well enough for her that she doesn&#x27;t feel the need to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would be awesome, cost efficient and amazing for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I broke out.  At first I assumed this was because I had such an awesome deep clean, I&#x27;d get a little a be and then I would use it again and the acne would eventually fade off my face and break outs would stop.  This is not what happened.  I broke out directly in my T zone.  From my forehead all down my nose and chin.  I had more dirt not less in my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hopes were extremely high.  I love the idea of microdermabrasion and I was hoping to find an amazing product at an affordable price.  I have very large pores.  I normally don&#x27;t get acne, but I do get blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 3 weeks and my skin looks and feels smooth and softer!  These are the steps you take to use the Olay ProX cleaning system:  1.  wet face with water and wet the soft bristle brush.  2.  Put a small amount ( about the size of pencil eraser ) of Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser on your face.  3.  Turn on the Cleaning System and let the brush do its job of exfoliating for 1 minute.  4. Rinse your face with clear water. 5. Put a small amount of the Thermal Crystal Polisher on.  6.  Wet the foam brush and polish your skin for 1 minute. My skin was red for a few minutes after using the Olay System.  I found it easier to use this system just before a shower as the polish is gritty and to make sure my face is rinsed good.  Use this system 2 times a week for a better complexion.  I have noticed a big difference in my face. I am very, very happy with the Olay ProX system!</li>
            <li> Great until a few days later and I have broken out on my cheeks from the microdermabrasion.  My pores look awesome, then my clear skin literally freaks out days later.  I like the convenience of the brush head; I use that often, but I am sad I can&#x27;t use the microderm part, which was the sole purpose in buying this kit.</li>
            <li> I try one time is feel good I hope I will have some change</li>
            <li> Skin is smoother and softer..clears blemishes..dont like thermal crystal polisher it flakes on skin after you rinse face</li>
            <li> Male here. This is an amazing tool. I had to step up my facial cleansing game, so I bought this. I also bought face lotion (there is a difference between face and body lotion). After a few months now, I notice that my skin is smoother and I have less black heads. Pimples are a lot rarer now. You can use other facial cleansers with this. Do your face a favor and buy this.</li>
            <li> Not yet ues all. I only used daily one(red), it was good.&lt;br /&gt;After using it,I felt this one made it better smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;because I bought it special offer price, I think it was best choice.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll recommand it</li>
            <li> gift for my girl friend. she is very statisfied this gift</li>
            <li> Love it! This is a great little machine. i use it with my regular cleanser and with the included scrub and micro dermabrasion creams.  The included tubes of scrubs are really small and won&#x27;t last you long, but the machine is great.  It has two speeds and for me the lower speed works well. I&#x27;m 42 so no need to scrub too hard :-) Very nice set.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference in the bumps that build up on aging skin, especially at the end of summer. Also feels good.</li>
            <li> The skin gets better really. Thankyou</li>
            <li> Nice product.. as described.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus system for nearly a month and during this time I have noticed a fresher, smoother looking skin and my pores have minimized substantially plus a huge reduction in acne breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using this system, I used the included Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser once a day for around a minute each time (counting to 15 in the chin, each cheek and forehead areas) but soon found that it caused my acne prone skin to breakout. I suspected that the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser was the cause of the breakout so I switched to using my regular cleanser, Purpose, with the brush head and my face stopped breaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging, product description here on Amazon or at Olay&#x27;s website does not states this system is waterproof though I felt it probably was I wanted to be sure so I contacted Olay&#x27;s customer service and found out this system is indeed waterproof and can be used in the shower. I use this system in the shower and store it in the shower caddy. I&#x27;m so glad it can be used while bathing since the brush will send out tiny drops of water and cleanser around your hair, mirror etc., leaving a mess to clean up after using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used with own cleanser&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used in the shower/bath&lt;br /&gt;- Batteries have lasted for nearly a month and are still going strong while always being used on the high setting&lt;br /&gt;- Visual evidence of pore minimization after just a few days&lt;br /&gt;- Smoother skin&lt;br /&gt;- More even skin tone after about two weeks&lt;br /&gt;- Less frequent acne breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- No beeping/notification timer to indicate that the user should move to another area of the face so the user has to keep track of the time used on the different areas of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Limited instructions. The system does not come with detailed instructions, just a bare bones outline on how to use the microdermabrasion system.&lt;br /&gt;- Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser may cause those with acne prone skin to break&lt;br /&gt;- Because the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser causes me to breakout, I don&#x27;t know if I would have received better results if I could use it.&lt;br /&gt;- The system causes my nose area to produce blackheads but once I stopped using on my nose this stopped happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this system to anyone wanting help with dry, dull skin, minimizing pores and reduce acne breakouts. The Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus system is very reasonably priced for all of the benefits the user will receive. My daughter has the Mia 2 and based on the results she has gotten with it versus the results I have gotten with the Olay Pro-X system, I&#x27;d say save yourself some money and go with the Olay Pro-X system.Cleanser may cause those with acne prone skin to break&lt;br /&gt;- Because the Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser causes me to breakout, I don&#x27;t know if I would have received better results if I could use it.&lt;br /&gt;- The system causes my nose area to produce blackheads but once I stopped using on my nose this stopped happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this system to anyone wanting help with dry, dull skin, minimizing pores and reduce acne breakouts.

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this product is as effective as a professional microdermabrasion session but for home use, this is easy to use and costs a lot less than paying for a professional treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I found this kit super easy to use and since the tubes of product are not that large I used small amounts and only once or twice a week to keep from drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects of this Pro-X system are reduced pores and cleaner and healthier skin. The product hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin and I do like the polisher. The kit comes with a nice brush that really scrubs the skin without being abrasive and the polisher has a nice effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an easy to use microdermabrasion kit that you can use at home and not have to spend a lot of money, this kit may not be as good as a professional treatment but it does help.</li>
            <li> Works as described.  I already use the Olay Pro facial scrub brush, so I was disappointed to see that I could have just purchased the microderm pads.  Leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and she said after one use, she noticed a big difference and loves it!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Both brushes are very useful. I think the cleansers aren&#x27;t that great, but when used with something better, this thing is a beast.</li>
            <li> I have been using this system over one month and honestly it works, I had some marks on my chin and this was the only thing that worked for me. My mom also uses it and we both have noticed amazing results in just 4 weeks. Would highly recommend this product for busy women who don&#x27;t usually have time to get frequent facials, plus it&#x27;s much cheaper :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this, off and on, for a few weeks.  My skin is definitely softer!  I think my skin looks brighter, but I never saw any reduction in fine lines or anything.  The best thing about this product is that my skin feels very clean after I use it.  I think it&#x27;s versatile enough to use with other cleansers after I&#x27;ve finished using the cleanser/exfoliant that came with it.  It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this item.  It is so inferior to the Clarisonic and by the time you buy the batteries for it over time, you may as well bite the bullet and get the Clarisonic.  The pad has slow power, and does a bad job of buffing or cleansing.</li>
            <li> No surprises. Product was exactly as it was described. Love it! I also use it when I&#x27;m simply washing my face with Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a good facial cleansing system. This one was in Goodhouse Keeping. There are other very expensive ones but this one is great for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it! I had the original and replaced it with this one. Works great and my skin likes it, but not everyday and definitely not twice a day. I am also considering using a mild cleanser like Simple, instead of the Olay cleansers to be gentler on my skin.</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush works perfectly, but the microdermabraison is the real magic maker!&lt;br /&gt;I have imperfections and bumps from acne and my skin has been noticeably smoother only after a few weeks of usage.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried Clarisonic, but Olay Pro-X seems to do the job for 5x less the price.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for money and will be recommending this to friends.</li>
            <li> Has very little power, when it works, Mine Would turn on (not necessarily work) for a few minutes then promptly shut off and turn back on with minutes or fidgeting with it</li>
            <li> Recapture your youth,rediscover your beautiful skin without the cost</li>
            <li> Goods you received you are very happy&lt;br /&gt;,, You are the best of the seller</li>
            <li> Good product, once I&#x27;d used it noticed the difference On my skin as far how it felt and looked</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to open that thing to put power in..</li>
            <li> If you use before the evening you fall asleep , feeling the skin is recommended in the morning .</li>
            <li> This is seriously an awesome product.  My face looks and feels so smooth.  It&#x27;s cheaper than the more popular brands and does the same (or even better!) job.  If you&#x27;re looking for a microdermabrasion kit, don&#x27;t look further -- this one is it!</li>
            <li> good price, thank you</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!  After just one use I was amazed at how vibrant my skin looked.  I suffer with acne rosacea which often causes very dry patches of skin.  The Pro-X gently removes those ugly dry patches and leaves my skin glowing and feeling clean without irritation. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my little sisters birthday gift. She really liked it.</li>
            <li> I use this almost daily and really love it.  I can see the difference in my pores and in the cleanliness of my skin.  This is a great product if you don&#x27;t have money for the more expensive one or if you are like me and have never tried an expensive face cleansing machine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the trying stages but love the way it makes my skin feel and has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Works really well with my pores and I could already see the results in just after 3 uses. Good quality considering the price when compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> The cleansing system is great, though i haven&#x27;t used the microdermabrasion gel/brush. however it feels a bit rough on my skin, and after a couple weeks of using it i got really bad flaking skin on the sides of my eyes. it took over a month to heal. i will really avoid that area from now on.</li>
            <li> received it April 2nd, and used it immediately that morning, again that evening, and twice each day since its arrival. I use the brush attachment for my twice daily cleansing. Used the microdermabrasion/polishing head the first day  - it felt great, it was like having a facial massage.  My skin already feels smoother, and I notice that my moisturizer goes on so much better. I really look forward to the morning and evening cleansing sessions.  I compared the cleanliness of my face after washing with a wash cloth, after just washing using my bare hands with cleanser and water, and the Olay Pro-X. I didn&#x27;t know one&#x27;s face could get so dirty by the end of the day.  The Olay system showed me that my skin was not being properly cleaned. So, no more washcloths, no more bare hands, it&#x27;s Olay Pro-X all the way!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great little face cleaning tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;Its super easy to use and change out heads as needed&lt;br /&gt;Its small and fits in my small bathroom cabinet with no problem and it fits easily in my travel stuff without a problem&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;the little brush head is kinda annoying to clean when you use it - not sure that there is anyway they could have made this that would fix this problem but I wanted to put it out there anyway</li>
            <li> Love this product.....have only had for a month and can see changes in my skin already.</li>
            <li> good and reasonable price</li>
            <li> Lightened my dark spots, gives me that glow that older skin loses. Great item with a great price. I am 52, with MS and other major health issues. It is nice to feel my skin dewy again. Thank you, Olay!</li>
            <li> Works well and the brush is soft though it truly does a great job of cleaning. Just wish it came with a storage bag</li>
            <li> This item just arrived today!!! I already used it &amp; can see a BIG difference in my face!!! My face has never been this smooth and shiny!!! Easy to use!!!  I just think that they should make the cleanser &amp; shiner products bigger than trial sizes!!! Otherwise COMPLETELY satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so smooth. Cleans deep down to get all the yuck out. Love the 3 speed setting.</li>
            <li> I honestly had better expectations for this. I had the original version which didn&#x27;t have the microdermabrasion function, and it was the best money I ever spent. I ended up losing it while moving and saw they had this one so of course I had to try it out. I&#x27;m honestly not sure the microderm function has done much. The construction is a little worse than the first sadly. And the &amp;#34;warming thermal scrub&amp;#34; stuff for the microderm does seem to warm for me. It&#x27;s more of just the friction from the sponge. That being said: do I like it? Absolutely. I couldn&#x27;t live without this contraption. I haven&#x27;t tried the daily cleanser as I use my own.  To use it, I thoroughly wet my face, then apply my cleanser directly on my face. I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t have to use as much as I do if I apply it on the head of the brush. You&#x27;re only supposed to wash for a few minutes... But I do quite a bit longer than that. I have very sensitive skin and have never had any problems. Just DO NOT use the brush (or foam head for that matter) under your eyes. I know that&#x27;s a bit of an idiot warning.... But I did it so I had to say something. It hurts. And it makes you look like a zombie. Not attractive. At all. But anyway, I would say get the cheaper one with the 2 speed daily cleaner. It&#x27;s better quality and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought the original 2 speed version only a short while ago and was loving it, then I came across the Pro-X Microderm Plus featuring 3 speeds and suddenly wished I had found and purchased this one first. Though the Pro-X 2 speed worked fine and improved the texture of my skin, I didn&#x27;t feel like 2 speeds was really doing enough for a really deep cleanse. Upon finding the Microderm Plus, I purchased it immediately. I feel as though I wasted money buying the 2 speed Pro-X because I won&#x27;t ever use it again. The third speed on the Microderm Plus is just the increase in exfoliation that I was looking for, I even use the 3rd speed with the cleansing brush on nights when I am not using the microderm pad. I really like the thermal crystal wash, I have used it both with the microderm pad as well as the brush. The cleansing wash is okay, a pretty typical exfoliating cleanser and I often use my Proactiv exfoliating wash with the Pro-X instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this product has really enhanced the look, feel and texture of my skin. I feel that when used at night, after first removing most of my makeup with a wipe, using the Pro-X really gets the remaining traces of dirt, grime, and makeup out of my skin. I am prone to occasional breakouts and since using the Pro-X as an addition to my nightly face wash regimen, I have noticed a decrease in active breakouts, dry skin, and uneven texture. I also have some acne scars from those terrible high school years and I feel that regular use of the Pro-X system is beginning to help fade the most surface ones slightly.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t typically write reviews unless I am really impressed or really disappointed in something, in this case I am impressed. My skin just looks and feels healthier since I began using this product, it has gotten rid of the nasty dry patches on my cheeks, it keeps the pores on my nose from building up clogs, and it has decreased the amount of oil I produce in my T-zone. I use the Pro-X in the morning on the gentlecleansing setting with the brush in the shower (it is waterproof!) for a gentle morning exfoliation - pre toner, moisturizer, and makeup. I use the more intense 3rd setting at night either with the micoderm pad and thermal cleanser or the brush, after removing makeup with a wipe, prior to night cream.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am impressed with the Microdermabrasion Plus System, I will continue to use it daily and I will probably repurchase the thermal cleanser at some point. I would definitely recommend purchasing the Pro-X Microderm Plus over the original Pro-X because the Microderm Plus simply has more options, allowing you to choose between 3 speeds if you want a gentle cleanse, a moderate cleanse, or a deeper exfoliation. I think purchasing the Microderm Plus initially is a better investment - paying more in the beginning will save you from becoming quickly disenchanted with the limited 2 speed system and wasting money later when you upgrade to the 3 speed microderm system like I did.</li>
            <li> MY 15 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER ASKED FOR THIS FOR CHRISTMAS.  WAS TOLD THE OTHER DAY THAT SHE LOVED&lt;br /&gt;USING IT.</li>
            <li> The cleansing system machine did not open so it was useless. I will be calling the manufacturer to get a refund. Won&#x27;t ever get another one!</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves your skin skin feeling good and rejuvenated. The Olay Pro X is wonderful and does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> This is actually a replacement item.  They are not as waterproof as they claim so I won&#x27;t be using this one under water conditions.  The only drawback to this one as well as all of the others is that the motor spins too slowly for me.  I would much rather have higher speed rpm&#x27;s than these slow speeds which completely stop the unit from rotating if too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> So, this system is supposed to increase the effectiveness of your face wash up to 700 times more than hands alone.  I bought it to augment my Olay recommended regimen facial wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red stuff is your facial wash when you order the kit.  You put it on your face before using the machine.  I suggest either buying more of the red stuff or some other facial wash right away because the sample does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue stuff is the microdermabrasion stuff.  I really like the way it feels to put on your face.  The instructions don&#x27;t say one way or another when it should be applied, just to &amp;#34;use with&amp;#34; the machine.  I put it on before I use the machine.  It feels really good when you first put it on.  When I use the machine with it though, the heating effect does go away.  It may not feel like it it&#x27;s working but my face does feel different after using it.  There are a couple of weeks&#x27; worth in there since you don&#x27;t use it more than twice a week and not two days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m not quite sold is because I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in the quality or look of my skin.  It still looks the same.  It&#x27;s not different and not anything else.  It may be the regimen as a whole but I am still going to give the blue stuff another month.  The red stuff didn&#x27;t really clean my face so I sent with the facial wash the regimen recommended.</li>
            <li> Have been wanting one of these types of facial exfoliators for awhile. I am happy with the product. Skin looks radient and I have been using this product in the shower which is even more convient.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working well on my skin.  The cleanser is good and the skin looks polished and smooth.  I will be buying refills.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the Clairisonic, but its better than any other kit I&#x27;ve used. I like the polish, my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. The system doesn&#x27;t have enough speed and/or power to do anything. It feels nice to have your face rubbed, but that is the extent of what it does.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE LOVE it!!  Have had the first version for a few years but this one is so much stronger and the extra speed is great!!  I also love the face creams that it comes with</li>
            <li> I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like this thing but I actually do, I use it every night and my face is starting to feel and look more even, not instant results but it takes time. I don&#x27;t use Olay&#x27;s facewash, I use it with Simple Foaming Cleanser by Simple or DermaE exfoliating scrub. It comes with 2 batteries but if you use it everyday you need to change the batteries every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it every day! I love it!</li>
            <li> Really like this product. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my complexion or wrinkles but my face feels clean!</li>
            <li> Soft skin after use.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product one time, but I did like the effect.  The most difficult part, was trying to put the batteries in.  You don&#x27;t pull straight down, on the compartment area, but rock it side to side.  I used the microdermabrasion pad, with the enclosed crystals.  I have long hair, and had it pulled back, but managed to get some of the crystals in my hairline.  CAUTION - do not get close to your hair.  It took quite a bit of effort, to detangle the very small amount of hair that was affected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good stuff. Price is reasonable. My wife love it.</li>
            <li> This is a little small wish I would have went with a differant brand. Not what I expected at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Got this for the wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> You can purchase the brush heads seperately,BUT, you can NOT get the microdermabrasion pads unless you spend the 12.00+ to buy their product.  Well the pad wears out before the product is gone so you buy more to get the ONE head they supply and you end up with many unopened bottles.  Customer service pretty much said &amp;#34;oh well&amp;#34; and has no resolve for this problem.  I bought it for the pad which is much nicer than the brushes for my skin.  I will be looking for a different brand soon.  Dont waste your money !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this three months ago and love it. It is a great cleansing system- you can&#x27;t beat it for the price. You can use any cleanser that you want (I however use Olay) and you can get replacement heads on Amazon for as low at $6.99 for two cleansing brushes (watch the price because it fluctuates). Overall, I am very happy with this product. As I entered my late twenties, my skin got a mind of its own. This brush definitely helps keep my face cleaner. You can feel and see a difference.</li>
            <li> great price, works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I had just bought a Clairsonic, but I felt t it vibrated way too much.  I swear, even on the lowest speed (I have a 3 speed Aria), it felt like the thing was loosening my brain, LOL.  A friend suggested this newer 3 speed Oil of Olay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one differs from the original Oil of Olay, in that it has 3 speeds, so it can simply be used as a facial cleaner....which is how I am using it.  I love it.....and the Clairsonic is going back today.</li>
            <li> The scrub included in this kit is excellent.  I think it really gets down into the pores. It feels great when you are done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a rotating brush that I bought in the UK about 35 years ago and bought this as a replacement.  It&#x27;s very good (rotates rather than just vibrates which some do) although it&#x27;s a bit slow, even on the fastest speed.  It comes with a sponge head for the dermabrasion cream and a brush for the cleanser, but I use the brush with the dermabrasion below my eyes as the sponge drags the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part is the 2 creams (dermabrasion and cleanser) which come with the brush.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve used many facial scrubs (Estee Lauder, Crabtree and Evelyn, Clarins, etc) but the Olay ones work better than any I&#x27;ve used.  Unfortunately Olay don&#x27;t sell this range in South Africa where I live so I have to pay a premium to buy the creams overseas - but still worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is by far the cheapest supplier that I&#x27;ve found.  Haven&#x27;t used them before.  Great service - only niggle was parcel took about 4 weeks longer to arrive than the automated response said it would and I spent time writing back and forth to the shippers, who weren&#x27;t particularly helpful.  But when I wrote to Amazon about the problem, it was sorted within a very short time.  Impressed with Olay product and Amazon service.</li>
            <li> Such a great product!! I took two set for our family..&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for a few days and I am already seeing the difference. Works good and effective. The best price on Amazon for the product.</li>
            <li> Great product for a good price</li>
            <li> I like it overall it does bog down easily when touching the skin. It does a good job.I don&#x27;t like it as much as I did my Neutrogena .</li>
            <li> What they say is true. I noticed a difference immediately. And now at a week, my skin looks so very much better. I do wish it had a rechargeable battery and that&#x27;s why I only gave it 4 stars. It is a great value and the cleanser and polishing lotions - you only need a teeny bit and wow! You get a great lather/cleansing! I may try some other cleansing products just to see the difference, but the battery operated brush and polisher? Yeah, I&#x27;m going to be using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but I don&#x27;t know why this product has such high reviews. I have owned a Clarisonic for a long time. Finally, it broke. I purchased this set due to the great reviews and thought, way cheaper, maybe it&#x27;s good. Wrong. The power is very feeble. The brush, while spinning, wobbles and feels like it&#x27;ll fall off the unit. Does not clean very well because it really doesn&#x27;t do any more than manual cleaning. The brush is also way too soft for a deep clean. Maybe my unit was a dud and everyone else had a good one. However, after using a more powerful cleaner, this is a great disappointment. I suggest spending a little more for a much better clean.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush! I used it with the regenerist face wash and it has helped immensely!! I have had this kit for 2 months and the brush randomly stopped working. I tried new batteries and everything and never got it to turn on again. I am now 32 days out of my window to return it....I recommend this product, but not from Amazon.</li>
            <li> works ok not a lot of power but for the price not bad.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the clarisonic cleansing system, did my homework and found this, got good reviews and ordered it, even got $3 off coupon. Lemme say its the best clean I&#x27;ve ever had. The first time I used it I notice my face was brighter and softer, others have notice it as well, saying my face is brighter. I dont need clarisonic. I will forever use the olay cleansing sysytem. Thanks olay, looking forward to improved versions.</li>
            <li> It is okay something I would not purchase again&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything else to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;I just did not like it for myself</li>
            <li> My skin made the delightful decision to break out like I was going through puberty again (I&#x27;m 26) a couple of months ago- in fact it was way worse than what I remember my skin looked like during those troubling years. I don&#x27;t know if it has anything to do with it, but I began using the Oil Cleansing Method around the same time I started to break out, but even the reviews of OCM users didn&#x27;t mention your skin breaking out THAT much (they did mention you&#x27;d probably break out a bit). Anyway, with the new acne, came new acne scars. Lovely. I saw the Olay Microdermabrasion kit on Amazon and began reading the rave reviews on it and figured that at $30 it can&#x27;t hurt. I&#x27;m amazed at how well my skin looks. I think I&#x27;ve had this a week and a half and those acne scars? Those really bad, embarrassing acne scars have faded tremendously. My skin has cleared up (which it had been doing previously to starting using this) but not quite fast enough for me- with this kit, my skin is clear and I&#x27;d almost go as far as saying that it looks like it did before the horrible outbreak. I&#x27;m still using the OCM twice a week, and then use the two cleansing products the kit comes with as well and I haven&#x27;t had any nasty reaction for using all three. I&#x27;m using less foundation because I don&#x27;t have to worry about covering up my scars and incoming acne. For any OCM users reading this, I think I&#x27;m going to replace my brush head more often than what it calls for but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s really necessary. I am so pleased with this product and what my skin looks like now. It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Have really enjoyed using this because it makes my skin feel so clean and invigorated.  I look forward to it being a staple in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for what you get. I was debating between this and a version Ulta makes.  This was cheaper (paid $29 for it at Walmart.com) so I decided to try it and see how I like it.  Love that it comes with two different face cleansers to try out with the product and it comes with batteries so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting home and having to drive back out to buy some because you forgot.  I usually exfoliate my face in the shower every other day with St.Ives face wash with microbeads.  However once I get out and put moisturizer on it dries and I have dry patches that are flaky and gross looking.  I used this product the day I got it, immediately after getting home, with the bristle head.  I thought it would be rougher on my face, so I was surprised at how soft it felt. I thought there was no way it was going to solve my dry skin issue. WRONG! First off, the brush head was a bit brown after using it so you can actually see all the gunk it is taking out of your pores. I patted my face dry and put my face moisturizer on and when it dried I only had a tiny bit of flaky dry skin by my nose but that&#x27;s just because I didn&#x27;t go over that part of my face. I was more focused on my cheeks and forehead.  That night I used it again with the bristle brush (no brown gunk this time, woohoo!) and spent time going over every inch of my face.  Put my moisturizer on and NO MORE DRY SKIN FLAKES!!!!!!! :)  I plan to use this daily in the shower (it&#x27;s water resistant) and use the microdermabrasion sponge head with the sample product once a week for a deeper cleaning. This is so good I&#x27;m going to buy one for my mom for her Birthday. She has avoided these because she has sensitive skin, but after feeling how soft that brush is I know it won&#x27;t be an issue for her and she needs it to help get all the makeup out of her pores at the end of the day. I would have given the product 5 stars if it had better instructions in the packaging and the replacement heads weren&#x27;t so costly and difficult to find in stores. They say to replace the brushes after your bottles run out, so they should last a good while. Thank you Olay for making this wonderful product at an affordable price for those of us that can&#x27;t afford a $200 Clarisonic brush.d difficult to find in stores.

            <li> This was a purchase for my wife to replace a competitor&#x27;s faulty unit that was replaced 3 times and is currently being RMA&#x27;d for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this product. No explosions, battery failures, broken posts.</li>
            <li> This Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System did not work like I wanted it to. I have gotten numerous microdermabrasion treatments over the years and this did not even come close. The unit has power in the rotation, but when the unit touches my face it slows down and loses it&#x27;s power. I feel like I get a better microdermabrasion scrub from washing my face hard with a rag and an exfoliating agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side - It is good as tool to deep cleanse your face with the wash pad - and I use it as a simple deep cleanser - but I do not use it as a microdermabrasion unit.</li>
            <li> I Love how clean my face feels after using Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System. It works great for the price.</li>
            <li> I started by reading others reviews on this Product and everyone seemed to say the same thing, about what a GREAT Product this is and the Amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;So not reading but One or Two Negative remarks out of over 200 I figured I would try it. Also I will admit that the older reviewers who stated their ages ( being in late 50&#x27;s and up) also had a lot to do with my decision to purchace this item.  I absolutely LOVE it!!!! I was a smoker for many years (I am 68 yrs of age &amp; no longer smoke) so I have the &amp;#34;lines&amp;#34; and then some! the finer ones were noticeably reduced within two weeks. the very first time I used this  I felt amazing, My skin was so clean and had a light sheen. After 3 days I SAW a difference in my skin (not that the lines were gone) but more like when you apply makeup and your skin color is even and smooth. Can&#x27;t put your finger on it but U know you see a difference. I was so pleased with the results of just a few days use of this Product that got online and bought two more and gave one to my daughter and daughter in-law who are in their 30&#x27;s a Kit. They both take pride in their skin and do not have wrinkles other than the lil &amp;#34;kiss&amp;#34; marks at outer eye corner&#x27;s. I had to laugh when both of them called me a few days later (without having talked to each other) and said ….OMG I LOVE this!!!!  it has been over a month and MY lines are NOW most definitely much fainter!!! I used the Red Cap cleaner every night and the Blue Cap Polisher every other night and a lot of Moisturizer after treatment. My girls have a very even skin tone and both look so refreshed and neither wear liquid makeup or powder now…THAT is how lovely their skin is. I also admit to having left my house a few times with a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; face just Mascara and lip stick which I NEVER EVER do or did because I was one of those gals in my youth who thought baking in the Sun made me look good only to see at this age the results of all that Sun damage…. uneven skin tone and the red /brown blotches. Honestly that is how good your skin looks and how good you feel about yourself! I really hope this review helps someone else make their choice in trying this product. And by the way I have NEVER have done a Review before.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels wonderful. I was not going to pay $100+ for a facial cleaning brush and $50+ for replacement heads, this one works great for a fraction of the price and has inexpensive replacement heads. My pores are smaller, my skin looks healthier and a few old blemish scars have been lightened. I used the microdermabrasion twice in the 1st week and then once a week after that along with the daily exfoliating wash at night and a regular facial wash in the morning. This was a great edition to kick my daily facial routine into a more productive gear with visible results..</li>
            <li> After I use this product my face feel smooth and clean,after a week  I notice that my face look even more clear</li>
            <li> Makes my face very smooth and clean feeling.  Only use twice a week because that is all you need to look good.</li>
            <li> My wife said it did a really good job.  Now she needs to buy some refills for it.</li>
            <li> No power, stops with little pressure.. Not worth even $5.00..</li>
            <li> Already received compliments.....😀</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the expensive face brushes so I can&#x27;t really compare with those but I have tried the manual Face brush and even though you do need to do the work on your own you can control the pressure and motion, which in the case of this face brush I feel like is not strong enough. I did put 3 stars because I think for someone who has not used a face brush before it will make a big difference, I mean it does a good job, maybe not an excellent one but certainly much better than nothing</li>
            <li> This is a good buy. Not expensive; does what it is supposed to do. Not that strong, but then again, you get what you paid for. It does work for me very well.</li>
            <li> The three speed variation is great, works as well as clarisonic and has cleared up so many skin imperfections for me. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything--I was even considering microdermabrasion treatments from a dermatologist. Then I tried this. If you have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s really gentle and you can adjust how much pressure you apply to your affected area.</li>
            <li> Cleans okay, but not what I was expecting.  I thought it would give more of an actual microdermabrasion effect.  But the attachments for it, don&#x27;t give any better effects than a cheaper version in the drugstore, or even a &#x27;buff pad&#x27;.  I&#x27;ll stick to my baking soda mixed with a little liquid cleanser and gentle circular motion.  That actually worked better, and less abrasive to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;For the reasons above, I cannot condone spending the $40 + dollars this costs.  But if you like a spinning soft brush on the face or a spinning soft sponge, than by all means, go ahead and try it.  It&#x27;s just that you could find the same thing for much cheaper at any drugstore.  Also the little tubes of the cleanser and abrasive they give you is not worth it.  Didn&#x27;t find it any better than baking soda or any other cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great system for all skin types. I prefer to use a different cleanser to get a deeper clean, however. I wish that the brush was firmer or the motor stronger, but it is a wonderful system for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to using brushes on my face and wanted to try this as opposed to spending 200 dollars on a Clarasonic. I guess I&#x27;m stupid because it took me a while to figure out the directions are on the side of the box, not inside - ugh. So after using the &amp;#34;polishing lotion&amp;#34; incorrectly lol, I still got great results. I&#x27;m 36 with pretty good skin; some hormonal acne on my chin from time to time and a few lines when I smile, nothing too crazy. I used this on my face and neck and my skin looks great! those little lines are diminished after one use. I&#x27;m psyched to keep using this and see the end result in a few weeks. I will definitely be buying this kit again. The brush is great :)</li>
            <li> I think it was a good buy and would recommend it to others and have already to my son and his daughter.</li>
            <li> The skin brightenned.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend really.</li>
            <li> Its only been 5 days and my skin is already 10x clearer. It breaks out a bit at first because it brings everything to the surface, but clears up quickly. My skin feels smoother and is much clearer. I use on the highest setting unless I&#x27;m around sensitive skin. the only downside I&#x27;d say is that the foam head is hard to get completely clean, but I know they sell replacements, and honestly for something that is taking off dead skin, it should be replaced regularly anyways.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry skin. I am also allergic to most products causing a breakout. I use the Olay Pro-X microdermabrasion to wash my face daily and polish it weekly. My skin is very thin and this product does not hurt at all but actually feel nice. After washing my face, I use the Olay Active Hydrating Cream Original Facial Moisturizer. This is the only product that combats my dry skin without irritation. I put it on my face in the morning and before I go to bed at night. My skin feels so much softer. I can actually smile without my face cracking. I see the small lines in my face slowly diminishing. I LOVE this product. It does not leave a greasy feel but soft natural skin. I recommend the use of Olay products.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use. I plan on using every week and get a professional microdermabrasion quarterly.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with results</li>
            <li> I used my friends Clarisonic and really liked it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to spend the money for it so after reading some reviews, I decided to try Pro-X for a minimal investment.  It is not bad but it is not a Clarisonic.  The power of Pro-X (batteries) can&#x27;t compete with Clarisonic (electric).  However, Pro-X does have enough power to do a good job.  It does have a torque when you put it on your face so you have be mindful of the pull and keep it under control.  Pro-X is lighter and smaller than the Clarisonic model my friend have.  That is a plus for travel or gym bag.  I can see myself buying the Clarisonic to have at home and take the Pro-X on the go.  Besides being lighter and smaller, if I loose it I wouldn&#x27;t care as much.  I do like how my face feels after using both products.  Be sure to keep your hair back.  A few strands of my hair got caught and pulled out the other day.</li>
            <li> Very good! It is great!</li>
            <li> This is good product.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again .</li>
            <li> I kind of knew that I would love this product, but I have still been impressed by how much it has brightened my skin.  I use the Pro-X brush 5 days a week, and the microdermabrasion on the remaining 2 days per week.  My skin drinks in my moisturizer now, and has become so soft.  But I am most happy with my skin tone.  I have mostly stopped wearing makeup, because I think this product has made my skin so bright and has somehow evened out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use the cleanser provided to go with the brush.  I figure that the brush itself does the exfoliating, and I don&#x27;t want to waste my money buying more of that cleanser.  I do use the cleanser for the microdermabrasion, however, and will continue.  Since it has the little crystals that the foam sponge pushes around your skin, it&#x27;s necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this product and have sent my friends to get it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, had to return it.  I even put in my own batteries.  I&#x27;m used to Clarasonic brushes, and this Olay brush head was sooooo small compared to Clarasonic,</li>
            <li> Instead of spending almost $200 for a &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; brand do yourself a favor and get this. Works fabulously. Olay has always provided great alternatives for expensive skin care for hard working girls.</li>
            <li> I kept wanting to order this but kept putting it off because I thought it was too expensive. When I found this one. Felt it was at least part way reasonable. Am so glad I did. Wish I had found it earlier. It makes my face feel so good. I haven&#x27;t noticed any miracles with lines or wrinkles yet but haven&#x27;t used it that long and really don&#x27;t expect any miracles. But do like the way it makes my face feel smooth and clean. I would definitely would recommend this.</li>
            <li> This microdermabrasion system works just as well as the more expensive brand that I also own.  The replacement heads and crystals are more affordable for the Olay ProX so it&#x27;s a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> So far, so good and I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks now. As long as this facial brush lasts, then I do not see why anyone would spend $100 on these things. It works great and has three (3) speed settings and comes with an exfoliate pad and a facial brush attachments. I have pretty noticeable pores around my nose/cheek area and they&#x27;ve already become a bit smaller with this and quality cleansers and masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this brush lasts a long time, assume this review to be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my wife and she feel happy with it ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably only mine product, but it doesn&#x27;t work properly - turns on and off randomly, I hate it :-(. But when it works, it does miracles to my skin :-).</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought a more expensive cleansing system. The brush handle seems a bit cheap. It works okay but I&#x27;ll probably end up buying a more expensive sturdier product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now...it really helps exfoliate and my sun damage/dark spots seem to be disappearing faster. For this price, I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> my acne has decreased by 70% at least using this thing with my regular washes. If I miss a day or 2 i can tell. I would but another in a heartbeat. I also keep this in the shower and have had no issues with it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the microdermabrasion setting/brush, but the cleansing brush was nice. After several months of use I tried to switch the batteries and they got stuck in the device and I couldn&#x27;t get them out. I had to throw away the whole device plus my rechargeable batteries. I&#x27;m not sure what the issue was because the batteries were the right size. I will probably repurchase the original kit without the microdermabrasion attachment.</li>
            <li> Works well, not too rough</li>
            <li> love it! the only thing i hate is that I didn&#x27;t buy it before.&lt;br /&gt;Seller review: The product arrived as promised, the whole process was fast and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Product review: I saw a difference on my face the first day after using it. My skin looks beautiful, and it feels very soft. I&#x27;ll use this for ever and I&#x27;ll recommend it to all my friends. It&#x27;s also a good gift.</li>
            <li> Thank you great product</li>
            <li> Love it. My sister first got one and said I need to get one. First time I used it my face felt so smooth. I use it everyday. Can not believe how much cleaner my face looks and feels.  Even told my friend about it. She went out and got; loves it.</li>
            <li> the head only spins in one direction as opposed to the sonic back and forth i was expecting. This resulted in a lot of tangled hairs around my face.</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush is great but the tube of Thermal Crystals provided was almost empty.</li>
            <li> It works well by making my skin feel good after using it, I just wish it had a little more power to it</li>
            <li> My face feels so much more cleaner after using this.  I didn&#x27;t realize it would make that much of a difference over regular washing!</li>
            <li> good product so far.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a professional for skin but feeling much better than regular brush style cleaner.</li>
            <li> Good stuff,&lt;br /&gt;The price wasnt that great only saved on shipping.</li>
            <li> Alright product for price. Used it 3 times and batteries died. Hopefully it&#x27;ll work better once replaced</li>
            <li> My daughter researched the facial brushes and bought this one. I did the same. We both love it. Amazing how much cleaner it gets your skin!</li>
            <li> This product works!!! OMG, its unbelievable how fast u start noticing changes on your face after u start using this. I recommend this to all, even my haters lol. Product arrived on time!</li>
            <li> It was only&amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin after using it.  It got good reviews from other users so they must have a better result than I did.  I always wanted to try it, the price was good, so I did.  I get better results with a rough facial cloth.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!! Makes my skin feel soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li> Really helps shrink the pores and makes the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product so far.  I have been using it for about a week now.  There is definitely improvement on my skin.  The level of power it has is not quite as strong as I would like it to be, but works great.  It came with a small sample size of cleanser and exfoliating polish.</li>
            <li> This works great and at a great price! Even after I have washed my face in the shower, I have gone back over it with the everyday scrubber and wash and there&#x27;s still makeup on my face that it gets off. I have seen my moderate breakouts minimize and my face is less oily the next day. I would suggest not applying too much pressure and let the scrubbing pad/brush do the work because both scrubs have exfoliate in them and it could rub your skin raw. Only need to scrub for about a min or two. I am very pleased with this product and would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is really a good product.  I use it everyday and use the microdermabrasion twice a week.  You cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Use it with some bensol peroxide cleaner when I shower and my face is completely clean and refreshed. I have noticed my blemishes are almost gone my face is smoother and softer. I use foundation all day and after using I this my make up is gone.</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer after the first use, EXCELLENT product for the money.</li>
            <li> Works well....&lt;br /&gt;was a great gift!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite health and beauty item. It feels amazing during and after using.</li>
            <li> Great job on clearing my sons face.</li>
            <li> Has really helped with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> Not really worth it. I should of spent a little more to get a clarsonic.</li>
            <li> Ok i got this instead of buying the more flimsy non name brand facial brushes out there. I was very pleased as it is very sturdy and works well with its 3 speeds. I do like the included cleansing lotion and microdermabrassion lotion. The bottles are small and just for starter but a little can go a long way. There are two changeable heads. A brush for use with the cleanser and a tough sponge for microdermabrasion.They work well but be sure to use the right cream with the right head. I thought it was great that new batteries also came included so i could start using it right away!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend likes it,and that is enough</li>
            <li> Cleans my face but I haven&#x27;t had any significant improvements to my skin. But it&#x27;s easy to use and does a great job of cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for face cleaning, but not much else. The motor is too weak to make a serious impact on the real skin issues that plague most of the young adults today.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. Leaves face so smooth. One of the best things I have bought for my face.</li>
            <li> Great value, arrived promptly and works well.  Costs less than local stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, the only down side is having to buy the cream I&#x27;ve had to repurchase as a replacement for my mom.  But otherwise good deal and value for the price :)</li>
            <li> The Olay Microdermabrasion kit is awesome. For the price point, it is a great buy. It has three speed settings, although the only I really use is the fastest one. It has a bristle and soft buffing pad. The bristles are just the right mix of firmness and softness to be just right for your face. They are easy to switch out. It is battery powered and safe to use I the shower. It comes with a scrub cleanser and thermal polishing crystals. I like both, but it annoys me that that the thermal, as in warming, has the blue lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my skin, and it feels so much smoother. I have old red acne spots and scarring, and this has improved those issues. I like it so much, that I&#x27;m going to get one for my brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish that the device had a cord that you could slip around your wrist. Overall, great purchase. Would buy again, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this is really nice it does a wonderful job and your face feels so smooth when you&#x27;re done I really really like it</li>
            <li> I like this very much.  I think it is making my 51 year old skin look refreshed.  I have only had this for a short time, but so far I am happy with my purchase.  I have to say that I really like the way my skin feels after I have used the microdermabrasion cream/grit.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I love that it has the option to use every day as well as the microdermabrasion!  My skin feels soft and free of dirt afterwards!</li>
            <li> Best product. I love it. Good price for the kit. I recomend</li>
            <li> Given as a gift. Receipient uses it and likes it.</li>
            <li> Good, My sister likes it.</li>
            <li> Face feels cleaner. I could see the difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li> my face really need this product.</li>
            <li> does the job. very handy tool for beautifying and the little extras are nice.</li>
            <li> My pores are happy! I bought this because I notice my skin has been changing from being soft, young, and problem free....to dry patches, large pores, and little wrinkles. I love the scrubber. It has three speeds and 2 scrubbers. I think after day four my pores look cleaner and smaller.  I also feel like my face isn&#x27;t so tight after cleaning it like with other products. There was also a 3 dollar coupon when I checked out from amazon!</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has really cleared my dark spots. My dark spots are smaller and lighter after using this product for three weeks.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend use it and said her face is so good, feels soft. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed with this product. The two (2) attachments are quite small and pretty cheap. The speed of the unit, even on its highest setting, seems slow. The cleaner and crystal gel solution bottles are tiny, tiny. (The grit of the crystal is so fine I can&#x27;t even feel it.) Decided to give this to my teenage daughter to use as a bi-monthly exfoliating system. Not going to work for me. I ordered something different.</li>
            <li> really like using this tickly thing on my face. i don&#x27;t use the included abrasive soapy things, but i do use a little coconut oil as a lubricant. feels good, seems to very gently exfoliate  so skin looks a bit fresher. remember to wash the brush with soap after every use...</li>
            <li> I wasnt expecting too much of this, but actually i really like this product. I can see how the sponge is not going to last too long, but the actual device is pretty great! Recommended highly!</li>
            <li> Waste of money not enough product. Didn&#x27;t really do any better than the Neutrogena wave and products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times &amp; I absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel &amp; look !! For the ladies or men who want to try something new in your skin care routine this is a must try !!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> I really love this product! It makes a full clean up in face. The skin stay more soft to the touch and the other products that I use in my face have a better absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;O recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! After one week of use my skin is looking and feeling so much better and softer. My overall skin tone is improving and my pores look slightly more refined.</li>
            <li> simple：one motor and two button and two “face brush”es to work.</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My daughter swears by this and loves to clean her face with it.  I think it is as good as the $100 ones found in department stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Nothing special that sets it apart from others.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Gentle enough for everyday and makes my face feel so clean! Plus this was $40 in target and wal mart ... Much better deal here</li>
            <li> I love how this feels but can&#x27;t say it does much.</li>
            <li> i started noticing that not all of my makeup was coming off when washing my face. I vowed to take better care of my skin but didnt want to spend $200 on a clarisonic. Love this item, it was so easy to use and came with the betteries (def a plus). It visibly removed so much of my makeup and left my skin feeling super clean and soft. Just use a moisturizer after and clean the bristles!</li>
            <li> Like the combination of cleaning and bleaching! Price is cheaper than the stores.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I had the previous version but this one kicks it up a notch. The older brush had two settings where this one has three. I can tell a difference in the softness of my face after using this brush! Love it. Makes washing your face so easy</li>
            <li> I had purchased two others cleansers before purchasing this cleansing system.  I was surprised at how much power it has and does a great job.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower each day and it leaves my face smoother than a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Perfect packaging</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing kit, high quality low price. My face feels amazing after I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this ProX set! The scrubs are great!  The highest setting is still pretty slow but more gentile then the Clairisonic.</li>
            <li> Did an ok job wasn&#x27;t spectacular needs more heads</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks now. I&#x27;m a woman in her 50&#x27;s. I use the cleanser daily and the microdermabrasion attachment twice weekly. My skin is definitely smoother and skin much less flaky, but the most impressive result I&#x27;ve seen is a substantial reduction in the size of my pores. Even with my 10x magnification mirror the pores around my nose are barely visible, and I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of products before with no results in that area. I subtracted one star because the directions included in the box are totally inadequate. I had to go back to read the product details and customer questions on Amazon to get some idea of how to use this system.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this but i absolutely love it. I do wish the brush was a little softer.</li>
            <li> Really great for my skin!</li>
