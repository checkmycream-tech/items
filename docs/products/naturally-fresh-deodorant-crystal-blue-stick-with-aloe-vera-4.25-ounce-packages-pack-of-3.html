            <li>This is the best deodorant I have found!  </li>
            <li>but without smell is  the best!</li>
            <li>very happy</li>
            <li>This is great!</li>
            <li>Remember this is not a Anti-perspirant is a Deodorant, so if you don&#x27;t mind some sweating, go get it, I&#x27;m very happy with it,</li>
            <li>This is the best deodorant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>However out of all the deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used, this has been the best when it comes to smell and sweat!  </li>
            <li>Very Good product ,but one of the three</li>
            <li>This is an incredible product.  </li>
            <li>I never thought he&#x27;d ever give up his Gillette, but he&#x27;s done for good!  </li>
            <li>What a product!!&lt;br /&gt;I am totally delighted and impressed with the product and the company who made it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>The best way to use it is putting the deodorant under warm water and use it  inmediately after shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT !!  </li>
            <li>I wish it had a pleasant fragrance</li>
            <li>It is good, works well.  </li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t realize that sweating is actually good for us.</li>
            <li>Sweating is healthy, and I think this particular crystal deodorant is an excellent product and an excellent value here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have been VERY pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way better than rubbing chemicals all over my skin!</li>
            <li>but this can wean me off until I find the absolutely most natural/organic anti-pers/deodorant that has no \\&quot;alum\\&quot; ingredient whatsoever!</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the handle was longer.  </li>
            <li>Effective deodorant with no residue or aluminum.  </li>
            <li>I use it in combo with organic rose water in a spray bottle and it can be 98 degrees out</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, great product, but</li>
            <li>I made my own that worked better.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, effective, and affordable product if you are looking for an all natural deodorant!</li>
            <li>; the top and applying does not work</li>
            <li>ended up giving the 2 sticks I didn&#x27;t use to a friend hoping that they would work better for her.</li>
            <li>I love the addition of aloe.  </li>
            <li>Both my wife and I think it&#x27;s the best and works well without all the extra chemicals.  </li>
            <li>He has found that he prefers the mini-stick over the regular-sized tube, and it seems to dissolve better for him.  </li>
            <li>Knowingly, TCCD sells 12 or more Roll-On or Spray</li>
            <li>, hope to see more benefits out of it</li>
            <li>so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Overall Im very happy with the crystal deodorant as a healthy alternative.</li>
            <li>It does not work as well as Degree, which is what I used to use, but I can&#x27;t use anything else, so I didn&#x27;t have many options.</li>
            <li>If you want a chemical free way to prevent odor caused by bacteria that occurs when you perspire, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li>I love this deorderent.</li>
            <li>I wipe it off, then make sure it can move.  </li>
            <li>It might be OK if you want to apply 6 times per day, but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, even my hubby told me how great was working this new deodorant.</li>
            <li>If you buy one TCCD deodorant of any type from a store, blind-faith assuming that TCCD removes old Roll-On/Spray before shelf-life ends, and (uncommonly) begin use within days, TCCD says it \\&quot;can take 2-3 weeks for body to adjust\\&quot; - meaning, testing effectiveness can use up the  30-day refund period.  </li>
            <li>can it tends to rip apart easily</li>
            <li>Easy to use...</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>We both like it because it is easy to apply, long-lasting, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>It might cost more per unit, but the crystal lasts forever, making it much more economical too.</li>
            <li>Return/replacement was easy and quick!  </li>
            <li>Best of all it is one less thing to worry about in</li>
            <li>Love this, as it has no aluminum, and it keeps me smelling fresh</li>
            <li>It costs slightly more but its worth it.  </li>
            <li>you carry on when you fly as it is a solid and NOT liquid.</li>
            <li>Normally it is smooth going on.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>No rank odor.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>so if you drop it, there&#x27;s a good chance the case will shatter on the floor or more likely during shipment because</li>
            <li>I am pleased to have found a safer alternative to aluminum deodorants (and another huge added benefit that it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes like regular deodorant), BUT the verdict is not out yet whether the ammonium alum (found in this product) is actually completely safe.  </li>
            <li>No smell at all, yes is true you sweat</li>
            <li>(The Full Underarm side to side ...top to bottom)  </li>
            <li>The problem is that the stuff I used and applied liberally for years was full of harmful ingredients, including aluminum and who knows what else.  </li>
            <li>Packaged well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely had no smell!!  </li>
            <li>TCCD claims all Naturally Fresh Deodorant products have 1-yr use-life; Roll-On and Spray have 2-yr shelf-life, Stick</li>
            <li>I have used Naturally Fresh ever since.</li>
            <li>None work like Naturally Fresh Crystal Stick.  </li>
            <li>Underarms are fresh with soap and water and then reapply after your shower.  </li>
            <li>I will probably try to find a better natural deodorant if I feel up to the challange.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients and think one may last a full year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like the hairs create indention-lines all over the surface, making it less smooth and more prone to cracking and crumbling (which it finally did after just a couple of months).  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff actually makes you smell.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll try the crystal spray and see if that&#x27;s a better design.</li>
            <li>When I travel, I use the mini tubes of this exact crystal deodorant, so I let my husband give one of those a try.  </li>
            <li>After satisfactorily using first Stick for 6 months, it became ineffective.  </li>
            <li>I do this a couple of times to make sure enough</li>
            <li>A better value than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li>The tiny stick she used lasted more than 6 months and probably would have gone for an entire year or more.</li>
            <li>Having said that, you will just want to make sure you apply enough of the crystal and that you are not just wetting your arm with water!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you apply enough coverage</li>
            <li>My wife started using it 10 years ago after we got married.  </li>
            <li>Please be aware that this is deodorant, which helps with smell, not wetness.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>This  crystal itself is odorless, gentle, and powerful.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy enough, just roll it on right after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>The bottom turn screw to move it up and down, came off, which did allow me to push up the stick, and clean the salt residue from inside, which makes it work better.  </li>
            <li>It will keep the smell down for sure, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for sweat!</li>
            <li>After using this product, I have NEVER had break through odor even when working a 16 hour day, can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product, it also will not stain your clothes or show white places on your clothing.</li>
            <li>I keep this stick on a high ledge in my shower, so that I can apply it right there before drying off.</li>
            <li>Because he has armpit hair, unlike myself, the large stick doesn&#x27;t dissolve as evenly for him as it does for me.  </li>
            <li>A reviewer of another crystal deo product also recommended being very thorough when washing the pits in the shower, so I have incorporated that into my routine as well.</li>
            <li>Oh, one more thing, be careful with the plastic</li>
            <li>But, even though this is not an antiperspirant, my pits still don&#x27;t sweat that much.</li>
            <li>And no worries about the poisons we are absorbing.</li>
            <li>And no worries about the poisons we are absorbing.</li>
            <li>Love it, no chemical products, works as expected, you have to use about a week to get used</li>
            <li>I highly suggest you try it!</li>
            <li>Did I really want to be putting that stuff all over my skin?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>other good thing is that it lasts for several months.  </li>
            <li>Love that there is an option that works for me, as some of the other &#x27;</li>
            <li>Have been on the first crystal for a couple months now and expect it to last several more months....</li>
            <li>To make sure this does not happen too early, I always leave the cap off and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth - they had the bright idea to ship three of these sticks into a tiny manila-colored envelope which was barely big enough to contain them.</li>
            <li>This means I have been odor free for just as long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough to use as an everyday deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is one of the main ways that our bodies release the harmful toxins we store.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not too thrilled with the fact that it is not available locally like it was when I first started using it.  </li>
            <li>So the price is right and the product works and is in line with the cost of similar products and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that people switch to this.</li>
            <li>have high standards for giving out 5 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third is the product is made of hard plastic and not the softer rubbery kind</li>
            <li>is applied since it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell because it is a crystal.</li>
            <li>I deduce: Sticks - in non-airtight containers, start use-life at manufacture date, activated by normal humidity, and become ineffective after one year.    </li>
            <li>This is something you have to get used to, because it doesn&#x27;t work the first couple of days--but now, I have completely eliminated using my old antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>My husband and I try to use as many all natural personal care products as possible.  </li>
            <li>w contact info to ask for a new one.</li>
            <li>Even if you have a particularly active day, it&#x27;s cheap to get either the wipes or mini stick to carry with you for re-application.</li>
            <li>First, do what it says on the side of the product in big capital letters and MOISTEN THE STICK before you use it.</li>
            <li>It is sort of a gift for my wife as she seems to react badly to normal deodorants/anti-perspirants as she developed what I characterize as a chemical burn.</li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t smell anything however that 1 star is because I&#x27;m still not sure if ammonium alum is completely safe.  </li>
            <li>I want to be honest with readers, I had several issues for years in summer season with sweat, I tried all the &amp;#34;Clinical Products&amp;#34; who are not safe for us.</li>
            <li>I own a Family Practice and an Urgent Care, I do recommend this product when I see patients that have rashes or swelling under their arms due to using other deodorants.</li>
            <li>This is a safe, simple and cost-effective way to manage down the microbial environments that orchestrate body odor and beta versions of infectious potentials.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the same as when I used commercial deo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>: if my husband doesn&#x27;t make sure to reeeaaaally spread the crystal around and into/underneath the armpit hair, he develops a slight bit of BO - nothing that anyone could ever smell, though, and I&#x27;ve only smelled it when checking his tees before laundering.</li>
            <li>This large stick will likely get over 2 years in my estimation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a little water, it goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  </li>
            <li>Zero smells, and I think this stuff actually does help with the sweating a bit, the same way a dip in the ocean does - just don&#x27;t expect the same control as an antiperspirant, which is fine by me.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of odor protection, and it is no big deal to refresh with a little bit on a heavy sweat day.&lt;br /&gt;Note, that it is not an anti-perspirant</li>
            <li>and this deodorant takes care of it completely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using crystal deodorants for nearly 10 years now.</li>
            <li>BUT...with nearly every one I&#x27;ve tried, after a while, when I twist the bottom to move the stick up, the part of the crystal in the bottom section breaks off and all the twisting in the world does nothing.</li>
            <li>So I end up buying another before I&#x27;ve used up even one fifth of the old one.</li>
            <li>On Internet, TCCD offers discounts encouraging multi-pack buys.  </li>
            <li>Wow, no gunk, no scent and at the end of the day, no B.O..</li>
            <li>all natural&#x27; deodorants did not work.</li>
            <li>Not saying I won&#x27;t, just haven&#x27;t had to thus far.</li>
            <li>She tried out a tiny version of this product and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Additionally, while it is more pricey than other deodorants, it should last FOREVER (ultimately probably making it the cheaper alternative).  </li>
            <li>Follow instructions and wet before applying and it glides right on.</li>
            <li>Even if you have a particularly active day, it&#x27;s cheap to get either the wipes or mini stick to carry with you for re-application.stick of regular deo per month.</li>
            <li>Very small inconvenience for the safe odor protection it provides.  </li>
            <li>This has ammonium alum which is supposedly a natural ingredient compared to aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly which is the active ingredient in Dove Ultimate Go Fresh anti-perspirant deodorant that I&#x27;ve been using for years!  </li>
            <li>I was really apprehensive about this when I got it, thought it sounded pretty gimmicky</li>
            <li>Have to wet it first to activate it.</li>
            <li>use it every once in awhile, but am back to my normal Dove 99% of the time.  </li>
            <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, you will want to be aware before purchasing it that in order to apply, you do need to wet the crystal first.  </li>
            <li>The only place locally that I know of now is Wal-mart, and I am too much a gentleman to tell you what I think of them.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that after a while (many months)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely non-toxic which is one of the big reasons you&#x27;d want to buy this over some other more popular and less expensive</li>
            <li>When wet it goes on smoothly (must be very wet), dissolves evenly over time, and it does not burn at all.  </li>
            <li>About 10 years ago I developed an allergic reaction to apparently every commercial deodorant.</li>
            <li>Not quite up to the task of a hot summer day in my long sleeve shirt uniform and long pants</li>
            <li>I will not be going back to my old clinical strength.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at my local natural health store.</li>
            <li>However, when I used this, wow, it actually lasted all day including the bike rides.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t prevent me from sweating completely but it felt similar to when I was using Dove anyway.  </li>
            <li>I was worried switching from Secret but wanted to put better products on my body.</li>
            <li>but I can pack an underarm odor that is not great  : )  ...</li>
            <li>Even after a shower where I always scrubbed them clean, the stench would be rather nefarious no more than an hour later.</li>
            <li>Which I consider the true test because I work hard</li>
            <li>But even with 90F those didn´t work, a month ago I bought Naturally Fresh Deodorant, honestly very skeptical at the begining, the price was 50% less of the Clinical Deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprising started to work amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this will only last a day regardless of what you&#x27;re doing whereas other brands I&#x27;ve used have lasted much longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but any other normal situation it will hold up well.</li>
            <li>So when she dropped it and it broken leaving jagged edges, I got her this which is apparently like 8 times the size of the original.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is an incredible product.  </li>

            <li> Sweating is healthy, and I think this particular crystal deodorant is an excellent product and an excellent value here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have been VERY pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way better than rubbing chemicals all over my skin!</li>
            <li> but this can wean me off until I find the absolutely most natural/organic anti-pers/deodorant that has no \\&quot;alum\\&quot; ingredient whatsoever!</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the handle was longer.  </li>
            <li> Effective deodorant with no residue or aluminum.  </li>
            <li> I use it in combo with organic rose water in a spray bottle and it can be 98 degrees out</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product, but</li>
            <li> I made my own that worked better.  </li>
            <li> This is a great, effective, and affordable product if you are looking for an all natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> ; the top and applying does not work</li>
            <li> ended up giving the 2 sticks I didn&#x27;t use to a friend hoping that they would work better for her.</li>
            <li> I love the addition of aloe.  </li>
            <li> Both my wife and I think it&#x27;s the best and works well without all the extra chemicals.  </li>
            <li> He has found that he prefers the mini-stick over the regular-sized tube, and it seems to dissolve better for him.  </li>
            <li> Knowingly, TCCD sells 12 or more Roll-On or Spray</li>
            <li> , hope to see more benefits out of it</li>
            <li> so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Overall Im very happy with the crystal deodorant as a healthy alternative.</li>
            <li> It does not work as well as Degree, which is what I used to use, but I can&#x27;t use anything else, so I didn&#x27;t have many options.</li>
            <li> If you want a chemical free way to prevent odor caused by bacteria that occurs when you perspire, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I love this deorderent.</li>
            <li> I wipe it off, then make sure it can move.  </li>
            <li> It might be OK if you want to apply 6 times per day, but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , even my hubby told me how great was working this new deodorant.</li>
            <li> If you buy one TCCD deodorant of any type from a store, blind-faith assuming that TCCD removes old Roll-On/Spray before shelf-life ends, and (uncommonly) begin use within days, TCCD says it \\&quot;can take 2-3 weeks for body to adjust\\&quot; - meaning, testing effectiveness can use up the  30-day refund period.  </li>
            <li> can it tends to rip apart easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use...</li>
            <li> Easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> We both like it because it is easy to apply, long-lasting, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> It might cost more per unit, but the crystal lasts forever, making it much more economical too.</li>
            <li> Return/replacement was easy and quick!  </li>
            <li> Best of all it is one less thing to worry about in</li>
            <li> Love this, as it has no aluminum, and it keeps me smelling fresh</li>
            <li> It costs slightly more but its worth it.  </li>
            <li> you carry on when you fly as it is a solid and NOT liquid.</li>
            <li> Normally it is smooth going on.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> No rank odor.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> so if you drop it, there&#x27;s a good chance the case will shatter on the floor or more likely during shipment because</li>
            <li> I am pleased to have found a safer alternative to aluminum deodorants (and another huge added benefit that it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes like regular deodorant), BUT the verdict is not out yet whether the ammonium alum (found in this product) is actually completely safe.  </li>
            <li> No smell at all, yes is true you sweat</li>
            <li> (The Full Underarm side to side ...top to bottom)  </li>
            <li> The problem is that the stuff I used and applied liberally for years was full of harmful ingredients, including aluminum and who knows what else.  </li>
            <li> Packaged well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely had no smell!!  </li>
            <li> TCCD claims all Naturally Fresh Deodorant products have 1-yr use-life; Roll-On and Spray have 2-yr shelf-life, Stick</li>
            <li> I have used Naturally Fresh ever since.</li>
            <li> None work like Naturally Fresh Crystal Stick.  </li>
            <li> Underarms are fresh with soap and water and then reapply after your shower.  </li>
            <li> I will probably try to find a better natural deodorant if I feel up to the challange.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients and think one may last a full year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of like the hairs create indention-lines all over the surface, making it less smooth and more prone to cracking and crumbling (which it finally did after just a couple of months).  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff actually makes you smell.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll try the crystal spray and see if that&#x27;s a better design.</li>
            <li> When I travel, I use the mini tubes of this exact crystal deodorant, so I let my husband give one of those a try.  </li>
            <li> After satisfactorily using first Stick for 6 months, it became ineffective.  </li>
            <li> I do this a couple of times to make sure enough</li>
            <li> A better value than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> The tiny stick she used lasted more than 6 months and probably would have gone for an entire year or more.</li>
            <li> Having said that, you will just want to make sure you apply enough of the crystal and that you are not just wetting your arm with water!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you apply enough coverage</li>
            <li> My wife started using it 10 years ago after we got married.  </li>
            <li> Please be aware that this is deodorant, which helps with smell, not wetness.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> and it really works!</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> This  crystal itself is odorless, gentle, and powerful.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy enough, just roll it on right after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The bottom turn screw to move it up and down, came off, which did allow me to push up the stick, and clean the salt residue from inside, which makes it work better.  </li>
            <li> It will keep the smell down for sure, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for sweat!</li>
            <li> After using this product, I have NEVER had break through odor even when working a 16 hour day, can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product, it also will not stain your clothes or show white places on your clothing.</li>
            <li> I keep this stick on a high ledge in my shower, so that I can apply it right there before drying off.</li>
            <li> Because he has armpit hair, unlike myself, the large stick doesn&#x27;t dissolve as evenly for him as it does for me.  </li>
            <li> A reviewer of another crystal deo product also recommended being very thorough when washing the pits in the shower, so I have incorporated that into my routine as well.</li>
            <li> Oh, one more thing, be careful with the plastic</li>
            <li> But, even though this is not an antiperspirant, my pits still don&#x27;t sweat that much.</li>
            <li> And no worries about the poisons we are absorbing.</li>
            <li> And no worries about the poisons we are absorbing.</li>
            <li> Love it, no chemical products, works as expected, you have to use about a week to get used</li>
            <li> I highly suggest you try it!</li>
            <li> Did I really want to be putting that stuff all over my skin?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> other good thing is that it lasts for several months.  </li>
            <li> Love that there is an option that works for me, as some of the other &#x27;</li>
            <li> Have been on the first crystal for a couple months now and expect it to last several more months....</li>
            <li> To make sure this does not happen too early, I always leave the cap off and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth - they had the bright idea to ship three of these sticks into a tiny manila-colored envelope which was barely big enough to contain them.</li>
            <li> This means I have been odor free for just as long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough to use as an everyday deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is one of the main ways that our bodies release the harmful toxins we store.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not too thrilled with the fact that it is not available locally like it was when I first started using it.  </li>
            <li> So the price is right and the product works and is in line with the cost of similar products and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that people switch to this.</li>
            <li> have high standards for giving out 5 stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third is the product is made of hard plastic and not the softer rubbery kind</li>
            <li> is applied since it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell because it is a crystal.</li>
            <li> I deduce: Sticks - in non-airtight containers, start use-life at manufacture date, activated by normal humidity, and become ineffective after one year.    </li>
            <li> This is something you have to get used to, because it doesn&#x27;t work the first couple of days--but now, I have completely eliminated using my old antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> My husband and I try to use as many all natural personal care products as possible.  </li>
            <li> w contact info to ask for a new one.</li>
            <li> Even if you have a particularly active day, it&#x27;s cheap to get either the wipes or mini stick to carry with you for re-application.</li>
            <li> First, do what it says on the side of the product in big capital letters and MOISTEN THE STICK before you use it.</li>
            <li> It is sort of a gift for my wife as she seems to react badly to normal deodorants/anti-perspirants as she developed what I characterize as a chemical burn.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t smell anything however that 1 star is because I&#x27;m still not sure if ammonium alum is completely safe.  </li>
            <li> I want to be honest with readers, I had several issues for years in summer season with sweat, I tried all the &amp;#34;Clinical Products&amp;#34; who are not safe for us.</li>
            <li> I own a Family Practice and an Urgent Care, I do recommend this product when I see patients that have rashes or swelling under their arms due to using other deodorants.</li>
            <li> This is a safe, simple and cost-effective way to manage down the microbial environments that orchestrate body odor and beta versions of infectious potentials.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the same as when I used commercial deo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> : if my husband doesn&#x27;t make sure to reeeaaaally spread the crystal around and into/underneath the armpit hair, he develops a slight bit of BO - nothing that anyone could ever smell, though, and I&#x27;ve only smelled it when checking his tees before laundering.</li>
            <li> This large stick will likely get over 2 years in my estimation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With a little water, it goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  </li>
            <li> Zero smells, and I think this stuff actually does help with the sweating a bit, the same way a dip in the ocean does - just don&#x27;t expect the same control as an antiperspirant, which is fine by me.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of odor protection, and it is no big deal to refresh with a little bit on a heavy sweat day.&lt;br /&gt;Note, that it is not an anti-perspirant</li>
            <li> and this deodorant takes care of it completely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using crystal deodorants for nearly 10 years now.</li>
            <li> BUT...with nearly every one I&#x27;ve tried, after a while, when I twist the bottom to move the stick up, the part of the crystal in the bottom section breaks off and all the twisting in the world does nothing.</li>
            <li> So I end up buying another before I&#x27;ve used up even one fifth of the old one.</li>
            <li> On Internet, TCCD offers discounts encouraging multi-pack buys.  </li>
            <li> Wow, no gunk, no scent and at the end of the day, no B.O..</li>
            <li> all natural&#x27; deodorants did not work.</li>
            <li> Not saying I won&#x27;t, just haven&#x27;t had to thus far.</li>
            <li> She tried out a tiny version of this product and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Additionally, while it is more pricey than other deodorants, it should last FOREVER (ultimately probably making it the cheaper alternative).  </li>
            <li> Follow instructions and wet before applying and it glides right on.</li>
            <li> Even if you have a particularly active day, it&#x27;s cheap to get either the wipes or mini stick to carry with you for re-application.stick of regular deo per month.</li>
            <li> Very small inconvenience for the safe odor protection it provides.  </li>
            <li> This has ammonium alum which is supposedly a natural ingredient compared to aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly which is the active ingredient in Dove Ultimate Go Fresh anti-perspirant deodorant that I&#x27;ve been using for years!  </li>
            <li> I was really apprehensive about this when I got it, thought it sounded pretty gimmicky</li>
            <li> Have to wet it first to activate it.</li>
            <li> use it every once in awhile, but am back to my normal Dove 99% of the time.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, you will want to be aware before purchasing it that in order to apply, you do need to wet the crystal first.  </li>
            <li> The only place locally that I know of now is Wal-mart, and I am too much a gentleman to tell you what I think of them.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after a while (many months)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely non-toxic which is one of the big reasons you&#x27;d want to buy this over some other more popular and less expensive</li>
            <li> When wet it goes on smoothly (must be very wet), dissolves evenly over time, and it does not burn at all.  </li>
            <li> About 10 years ago I developed an allergic reaction to apparently every commercial deodorant.</li>
            <li> Not quite up to the task of a hot summer day in my long sleeve shirt uniform and long pants</li>
            <li> I will not be going back to my old clinical strength.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at my local natural health store.</li>
            <li> However, when I used this, wow, it actually lasted all day including the bike rides.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t prevent me from sweating completely but it felt similar to when I was using Dove anyway.  </li>
            <li> I was worried switching from Secret but wanted to put better products on my body.</li>
            <li> but I can pack an underarm odor that is not great  : )  ...</li>
            <li> Even after a shower where I always scrubbed them clean, the stench would be rather nefarious no more than an hour later.</li>
            <li> Which I consider the true test because I work hard</li>
            <li> But even with 90F those didn´t work, a month ago I bought Naturally Fresh Deodorant, honestly very skeptical at the begining, the price was 50% less of the Clinical Deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprising started to work amazing</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this will only last a day regardless of what you&#x27;re doing whereas other brands I&#x27;ve used have lasted much longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but any other normal situation it will hold up well.</li>
            <li> So when she dropped it and it broken leaving jagged edges, I got her this which is apparently like 8 times the size of the original.</li>
            <li> Do you really want to rub dry salt against your pits and/or naughty bits?</li>
            <li> On my quest to find a healthier less carcinogenic deodorant I tried a few all natural brands that actually gave me a rash(allergic reaction) and was starting to think I might just have to go back to my old antiperspirant</li>
            <li> It seems like it will last a long time too.</li>
            <li> This shuts down underarm odor completely.  </li>
            <li> Product Lasts a very long time and does not stain white t-shirts.  </li>
            <li> But, you may find that you are not as anxious about staying completely dry and probably don&#x27;t end up sweating as much as you did</li>
            <li> Sorry TCCD, mine is not a character that takes lightly to being taken.  </li>
            <li> I tried some other home remedies and other natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Growing up at the beach and swimming in the ocean almost on a daily basis, I never really had any use for deodorant or antiperspirants until I moved away for college</li>
            <li> (the one with aloe is slicker when wet), and started to become jagged and actually CUT my underarms.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed but still willing to experiment, I went back to the health store and found this Naturally Fresh crystal deodorant with the aloe.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll learn TCCD 30-day return/refund long ago expired.    </li>
            <li> five unanswered emails and a phone call later</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nourish Organic Deodorant and even though it lasted long, I still had a bit of smell at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It is different than other deodorants.</li>
            <li> and theres no odor all day long!</li>
            <li> It has none of the bad stuff as the mass-market products, and I think it actually works better.  </li>
            <li> I also recommend leaving the cap off to help the crystal dry out after use so that it doesn&#x27;t crumble.</li>
            <li> Dry your stick and put away.  </li>
            <li> and it would last only a few hours after application.  </li>
            <li> I can see it lasting a long time as it takes quite a while to work it down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with other natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product, just as I&#x27;m skeptical about most beauty and health products, but I was absolutely amazed by how well this stuff works to control body odor.  </li>
            <li> , TCCD said I&#x27;m a chronic complainer, \\&quot;Sticks only activate upon being wet, and anyway no refund due because 30-day return expired\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> No difference with my usual deodorant so far</li>
            <li> Upon arrival of first shipment, one of the crystals was broken.  </li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find an all natural deodorant that doesnt irriate my skin!</li>
            <li> After a few years of using antiperspirants, I had started getting clogged pores and small cysts under my arms, so I was feeling desperate one day while perusing the health aisle at my local organic/health food grocer when I spotted the kind of crystal deodorant shaped like a rock, no aloe.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the container is somewhat cheap plastic, so you need to be careful with it.  </li>
            <li> I read the directions an applied it wet, but I was stinky after an hour of office work.  </li>
            <li> that is having to wet the stick to put it on.  </li>
            <li> This negates my having to actually wet the crystal itself.</li>
            <li> In fact, there is absolutely no scent coming from either of us.</li>
            <li> Just a minimal amount.</li>
            <li> I was spending roughly $192 a year on deo per year.</li>
            <li> I was spending roughly $192 a year on deo per year.</li>
            <li> Al, the plastic container is really no match for the product.  </li>
            <li> For the record, I will be honest and say that my pits could get rather rank if I forgot to put on deo before using this.</li>
            <li> Considering one crystal will last a year for one person using daily, The money I am saving is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I am so allergic to other deodorants, but I can wear this with absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li> One of my three pack (which isn&#x27;t even necessary since they last so long) came broken.</li>
            <li> I apply not exactly liberally, but I do three swipes all over my pits.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers have said their husbands will use this as well.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how it will work given my husband&#x27;s armpit hair (how well it would actually apply and work)</li>
            <li> Even when we are highly active, no funk.</li>
            <li> Always a heavy sweater, I have always been obsessed with finding the right anti-perspirant and deodorant.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve finally coerced my husband into trying this salt deodorant because I was tired of throwing away t-shirts that had developed permanently hard, discolored areas fromantiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> Even if refund timely, will you pay non-refundable return shipping cost to get average $5 refund?    </li>
            <li> I always wipe down the stick afterwards, because the salt will eventually melt, and jam up the mechanism.  </li>
            <li> and I mean cover every last bit lest you get funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having skin reactions to other products, try this one!</li>
            <li> no more yellowing on the underarm of my shirts and  those disgusting spots that the regular deodorants leave, also if you are health concerned this is the right natural choice.</li>
            <li> I have found that on days where I&#x27;m very active I might need to apply again if I&#x27;m going out that evening.  </li>
            <li> I wet it under small faucet stream and apply thoroughly.</li>
            <li> and im a sweaty mess after.</li>
            <li> Consumers have no certainty purchase isn&#x27;t dead on arrival.    </li>
            <li> If you have developed allergies (really uncomfortable rashes in my case) to deodorant, give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li> That would make it easier to use on tall, narrow containers.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great! 24 hour odor protection. I expect this size to last me close to a year! The 1.4 oz. lasted me about 4 months!</li>
            <li> Awful product and wish I could return. &amp;#34;Moistening&amp;#34; the top and applying does not work and I&#x27;m pretty sure this stuff actually makes you smell. One of the worst purchases and I regret buying the three pack.</li>
            <li> I must be an overly stinky person because this did not work for me.  I read the directions an applied it wet, but I was stinky after an hour of office work.  After a run, I found it hard to stand down wind of myself.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving the 2 sticks I didn&#x27;t use to a friend hoping that they would work better for her.</li>
            <li> Love this, as it has no aluminum, and it keeps me smelling fresh--just gotta remember to not wipe the water off from under my arms after a shower before applying!</li>
            <li> I have used crystal deodorants for 10+ years.  I&#x27;m allergic to the common deodorants out there.  This is an incredible product.  I love the addition of aloe.  It costs slightly more but its worth it.  I have pretty bad body odor and this deodorant takes care of it completely.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with other natural deodorants.  This is doesn&#x27;t leak or spill.  It&#x27;s the one for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years now and will keep using it.  Both my wife and I think it&#x27;s the best and works well without all the extra chemicals.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> The crystal deodorant does work, and for that I&#x27;d give it five stars. I&#x27;ve been using crystal deodorants for nearly 10 years now. I&#x27;ll never go back to those waxy things that proliferate. BUT...with nearly every one I&#x27;ve tried, after a while, when I twist the bottom to move the stick up, the part of the crystal in the bottom section breaks off and all the twisting in the world does nothing. So I end up buying another before I&#x27;ve used up even one fifth of the old one. Next time I&#x27;ll try the crystal spray and see if that&#x27;s a better design.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully for those of us who don&#x27;t mind a bit of sweat but want protection from funk.  I was skeptical of this product, just as I&#x27;m skeptical about most beauty and health products, but I was absolutely amazed by how well this stuff works to control body odor.  I never have BO since I started using this product over a year ago. Growing up at the beach and swimming in the ocean almost on a daily basis, I never really had any use for deodorant or antiperspirants until I moved away for college (just goes to show you that salt water truly does keep the odor at bay!). After a few years of using antiperspirants, I had started getting clogged pores and small cysts under my arms, so I was feeling desperate one day while perusing the health aisle at my local organic/health food grocer when I spotted the kind of crystal deodorant shaped like a rock, no aloe.  I started with the other brand that did not contain aloe, and while it worked, it burned, was difficult to apply despite being wet (the one with aloe is slicker when wet), and started to become jagged and actually CUT my underarms.  No joke.  Disappointed but still willing to experiment, I went back to the health store and found this Naturally Fresh crystal deodorant with the aloe.  PERFECT.  When wet it goes on smoothly (must be very wet), dissolves evenly over time, and it does not burn at all.  And these tubes last forever - I&#x27;ve had mine for almost a year.  Also, the effect lasts for DAYS.  Zero smells, and I think this stuff actually does help with the sweating a bit, the same way a dip in the ocean does - just don&#x27;t expect the same control as an antiperspirant, which is fine by me.  Sweating is healthy, and I think this particular crystal deodorant is an excellent product and an excellent value here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve finally coerced my husband into trying this salt deodorant because I was tired of throwing away t-shirts that had developed permanently hard, discolored areas fromantiperspirant.  Shockingly...he likes it!  I never thought he&#x27;d ever give up his Gillette, but he&#x27;s done for good!  However, there are a couple of caveats.  Because he has armpit hair, unlike myself, the large stick doesn&#x27;t dissolve as evenly for him as it does for me.  It&#x27;s kind of like the hairs create indention-lines all over the surface, making it less smooth and more prone to cracking and crumbling (which it finally did after just a couple of months).  When I travel, I use the mini tubes of this exact crystal deodorant, so I let my husband give one of those a try.  He has found that he prefers the mini-stick over the regular-sized tube, and it seems to dissolve better for him.  This also helps with the problem that some have mentioned about the twist mechanism malfunctioning after a while.  I&#x27;ll agree with that critique - mine did the same thing, but I simply unscrewed the larger part of the crystal and began using it without the plastic dispenser.  By the way, the mini tubes do not have a twist-up mechanism.  Second caveat for the easily-funky: if my husband doesn&#x27;t make sure to reeeaaaally spread the crystal around and into/underneath the armpit hair, he develops a slight bit of BO - nothing that anyone could ever smell, though, and I&#x27;ve only smelled it when checking his tees before laundering.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 and one came broken and I have no packing slip w contact info to ask for a new one.</li>
            <li> TCCD claims all Naturally Fresh Deodorant products have 1-yr use-life; Roll-On and Spray have 2-yr shelf-life, Stick shelf-life \\&quot;never expires if unopened\\&quot;.  TCCD products have no mfg/exp date on label.  Consumers have no certainty purchase isn&#x27;t dead on arrival.    On Internet, TCCD offers discounts encouraging multi-pack buys.  Knowingly, TCCD sells 12 or more Roll-On or Spray (lasting 3 months each) - meaning, 2-yr shelf-life expires well before all purchase used.  Complain...  You&#x27;ll learn TCCD 30-day return/refund long ago expired.    If you buy one TCCD deodorant of any type from a store, blind-faith assuming that TCCD removes old Roll-On/Spray before shelf-life ends, and (uncommonly) begin use within days, TCCD says it \\&quot;can take 2-3 weeks for body to adjust\\&quot; - meaning, testing effectiveness can use up the  30-day refund period.  Even if refund timely, will you pay non-refundable return shipping cost to get average $5 refund?    TCCD sold me 12 Sticks, with &#x60;forever&#x27; shelf-life and 1-yr use-life.  After satisfactorily using first Stick for 6 months, it became ineffective.  I began a second Stick, problem persisted; third Stick, problem persisted.  Consulting TCCD, they suggested my chemistry/environment changed.  Not so.  I bought a 13th Stick from a local store.  It worked!  I informed TCCD; five unanswered emails and a phone call later, TCCD said I&#x27;m a chronic complainer, \\&quot;Sticks only activate upon being wet, and anyway no refund due because 30-day return expired\\&quot;.  I deduce: Sticks - in non-airtight containers, start use-life at manufacture date, activated by normal humidity, and become ineffective after one year.    TCCD dodges any fault, hides behind refund policy trickery, and accuses me of conning them.  Sad, TCCD thinks attacking my character justifies their irresponsible business practices.  Sorry TCCD, mine is not a character that takes lightly to being taken.  Since TCCD is not trustworthy, I&#x27;ll no longer entrust my body to their products.</li>
            <li> Just started using it by recommendation of my dermatologist. No difference with my usual deodorant so far, hope to see more benefits out of it</li>
            <li> As someone who struggles with finding a deodorant that works, i was shocked after trying this crystal stick.  It works so well!  I will not be going back to my old clinical strength.  I have found that on days where I&#x27;m very active I might need to apply again if I&#x27;m going out that evening.  I also recommend leaving the cap off to help the crystal dry out after use so that it doesn&#x27;t crumble.</li>
            <li> This deo works. I also found that it smelled a bit after just a couple of days of use, which I felt I could smell on myself after using it, but leaving the cap off worked to eliminate that odor, as another reviewer suggested. A reviewer of another crystal deo product also recommended being very thorough when washing the pits in the shower, so I have incorporated that into my routine as well. I wish it had a pleasant fragrance but it&#x27;s way better than rubbing chemicals all over my skin!</li>
            <li> First, do what it says on the side of the product in big capital letters and MOISTEN THE STICK before you use it. It&#x27;s a salt crystal. Do you really want to rub dry salt against your pits and/or naughty bits? Didn&#x27;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this is a deodorant and ONLY a deodorant. It is not an anti-persperant. You will still sweat if you wear this. It just won&#x27;t stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do the above the product works well enough. It&#x27;s completely non-toxic which is one of the big reasons you&#x27;d want to buy this over some other more popular and less expensive brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this will only last a day regardless of what you&#x27;re doing whereas other brands I&#x27;ve used have lasted much longer than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, in my experience you have to slather the s$#! out of your pits and I mean cover every last bit lest you get funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third is the product is made of hard plastic and not the softer rubbery kind so if you drop it, there&#x27;s a good chance the case will shatter on the floor or more likely during shipment because&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth - they had the bright idea to ship three of these sticks into a tiny manila-colored envelope which was barely big enough to contain them. Needless to say, the casings were damaged upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is if you&#x27;re looking for one of the cheapest deodorant sticks that doesn&#x27;t have toxins then this&#x27;ll do. If you don&#x27;t care about that then go pick up Speed Stick or whatever and save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for a year now. This means I have been odor free for just as long. It is different than other deodorants. I wet it under small faucet stream and apply thoroughly. I do this a couple of times to make sure enough is applied since it&#x27;s kind of hard to tell because it is a crystal. Wow, no gunk, no scent and at the end of the day, no B.O..If anyone says it does not work it is only because they are not applying it correctly. This deodorant stick lasts forever so I have saved a lot of money on deodorants.</li>
            <li> On my quest to find a healthier less carcinogenic deodorant I tried a few all natural brands that actually gave me a rash(allergic reaction) and was starting to think I might just have to go back to my old antiperspirant but I tried this on a whim and im so glad I did. It not bother my skin at all and works awesome. Goes on easy enough, just roll it on right after I get out of the shower. Protects me all day and continues to protect even through my evening workout. Which I consider the true test because I work hard and im a sweaty mess after. Its not antiperspirant but I dont care. Your meant to sweat so your body can get toxins etc out so thats not a problem for me. I can see it lasting a long time as it takes quite a while to work it down. Overall Im very happy with the crystal deodorant as a healthy alternative.</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago I developed an allergic reaction to apparently every commercial deodorant. I have used Naturally Fresh ever since. It does not work as well as Degree, which is what I used to use, but I can&#x27;t use anything else, so I didn&#x27;t have many options. If you have developed allergies (really uncomfortable rashes in my case) to deodorant, give this stuff a try. It will keep the smell down for sure, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for sweat!</li>
            <li> works excellent. I like the fact that it is odorless and does not leave any residue under arm. Best of all it is one less thing to worry about in you carry on when you fly as it is a solid and NOT liquid.</li>
            <li> This is a safe, simple and cost-effective way to manage down the microbial environments that orchestrate body odor and beta versions of infectious potentials. The product was delivered promptly with no problems.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have found!  Only one drawback and that is having to wet the stick to put it on.  Very small inconvenience for the safe odor protection it provides.  If you want a chemical free way to prevent odor caused by bacteria that occurs when you perspire, this is the way to go!</li>
            <li> It is good, works well.  Have to wet it first to activate it.</li>
            <li> I have used a stick for years. Normally it is smooth going on.&lt;br /&gt;This batch is like rubbing sandpaper under your arms.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the product before I ran out, so Amazon wouldn&#x27;t take it back.&lt;br /&gt;I called the manufacturer, they wouldn&#x27;t replace it, even though they agreed it shouldn&#x27;t feel like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, great product, but it fell once and crystal broke making it difficult to apply</li>
            <li> I want to be honest with readers, I had several issues for years in summer season with sweat, I tried all the &amp;#34;Clinical Products&amp;#34; who are not safe for us. But even with 90F those didn´t work, a month ago I bought Naturally Fresh Deodorant, honestly very skeptical at the begining, the price was 50% less of the Clinical Deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprising started to work amazing, even my hubby told me how great was working this new deodorant. No smell at all, yes is true you sweat but without smell is  the best! if you don´t mind sweat, for me change my way to see deodorants. The best way to use it is putting the deodorant under warm water and use it  inmediately after shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I´m very happy cause I had breast cancer history in my family, and my Dr´s recommended this too.</li>
            <li> Great product. I was worried switching from Secret but wanted to put better products on my body. It works well, even at the gym!</li>
            <li> This is something you have to get used to, because it doesn&#x27;t work the first couple of days--but now, I have completely eliminated using my old antiperspirant. Love that there is an option that works for me, as some of the other &#x27;all natural&#x27; deodorants did not work.</li>
            <li> I was really apprehensive about this when I got it, thought it sounded pretty gimmicky but it actually works quite well. It&#x27;s good enough to use as an everyday deodorant. Not quite up to the task of a hot summer day in my long sleeve shirt uniform and long pants but any other normal situation it will hold up well. It seems like it will last a long time too.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the handle was longer.  That would make it easier to use on tall, narrow containers.</li>
            <li> This is great! Remember this is not a Anti-perspirant is a Deodorant, so if you don&#x27;t mind some sweating, go get it, I&#x27;m very happy with it, no more yellowing on the underarm of my shirts and  those disgusting spots that the regular deodorants leave, also if you are health concerned this is the right natural choice. Oh, one more thing, be careful with the plastic can it tends to rip apart easily</li>
            <li> Effective deodorant with no residue or aluminum.  Product Lasts a very long time and does not stain white t-shirts.  A better value than regular deodorant.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local natural health store. I too, was skeptical...but worried about the toxic aluminum in commercial deo&#x27;s. Having read that pit odor usually comes from nasty bacteria, for the first two uses of the deo I would swab my pits with apple cider vinegar before getting in the shower. I also read that when you do this, not to wash the ACV off with soap, but only rinse it off. I keep this stick on a high ledge in my shower, so that I can apply it right there before drying off. This negates my having to actually wet the crystal itself. I apply not exactly liberally, but I do three swipes all over my pits. Pretty much the same as when I used commercial deo&#x27;s. For the record, I will be honest and say that my pits could get rather rank if I forgot to put on deo before using this. Even after a shower where I always scrubbed them clean, the stench would be rather nefarious no more than an hour later. My 13 yr.old daughter dealt with the same thing. As I said, I only did the ACV twice. As did she. Now, I can literally go 2 days without deo. No rank odor. In fact, there is absolutely no scent coming from either of us. I highly recommend that people switch to this. My hubs switched as well, and so are my two sons. Even when we are highly active, no funk. People don&#x27;t realize that sweating is actually good for us. This is one of the main ways that our bodies release the harmful toxins we store. This cleans out our lymph nodes. Aluminum is commercial deo&#x27;s is one of the biggest contributors to breast cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s. Google it &amp; see for yourself. One thing I have noticed, is that my bras are no longer getting stained. But, even though this is not an antiperspirant, my pits still don&#x27;t sweat that much. Just a minimal amount. I haven&#x27;t had to deal with issues with the container. Not saying I won&#x27;t, just haven&#x27;t had to thus far. Considering one crystal will last a year for one person using daily, The money I am saving is ridiculous. My hubs was going through a stick of regular deo per month. My daughter and I every two. My sons...the same as my hubs. I was spending roughly $192 a year on deo per year. With this, I spend maybe $25. And no worries about the poisons we are absorbing. Even if you have a particularly active day, it&#x27;s cheap to get either the wipes or mini stick to carry with you for re-application.stick of regular deo per month. My daughter and I every two.

            <li> I am so allergic to other deodorants, but I can wear this with absolutely no problems. I own a Family Practice and an Urgent Care, I do recommend this product when I see patients that have rashes or swelling under their arms due to using other deodorants. This is a fantastic product. After using this product, I have NEVER had break through odor even when working a 16 hour day, can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product, it also will not stain your clothes or show white places on your clothing.</li>
            <li> I have zero complaints about this product. It is sort of a gift for my wife as she seems to react badly to normal deodorants/anti-perspirants as she developed what I characterize as a chemical burn. She tried out a tiny version of this product and it worked very well. So when she dropped it and it broken leaving jagged edges, I got her this which is apparently like 8 times the size of the original. So the price is right and the product works and is in line with the cost of similar products and lasts much longer. The tiny stick she used lasted more than 6 months and probably would have gone for an entire year or more. This large stick will likely get over 2 years in my estimation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have high standards for giving out 5 stars. For me, 5 stars means exceeding expectations, hence 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this crystal stick for a couple months now and I have been VERY pleased with it.  It works great and I have 0 complaints.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you will want to be aware before purchasing it that in order to apply, you do need to wet the crystal first.  Having said that, you will just want to make sure you apply enough of the crystal and that you are not just wetting your arm with water!  Make sure you apply enough coverage and you should have no issues!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two reasons I am not giving this 5 stars:&lt;br /&gt;1. I am pleased to have found a safer alternative to aluminum deodorants (and another huge added benefit that it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes like regular deodorant), BUT the verdict is not out yet whether the ammonium alum (found in this product) is actually completely safe.  For now, it will have to do...&lt;br /&gt;2.  Some other reviewers have said their husbands will use this as well.  I am not sure how it will work given my husband&#x27;s armpit hair (how well it would actually apply and work) so we haven&#x27;t TRIED it yet....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This purchase comes in a package of 3 crystal.  Upon arrival of first shipment, one of the crystals was broken.  Return/replacement was easy and quick!  Additionally, while it is more pricey than other deodorants, it should last FOREVER (ultimately probably making it the cheaper alternative).  Have been on the first crystal for a couple months now and expect it to last several more months....</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have ever used.  I had been looking for an alternative to the popular antiperspirants and deodorants which contain aluminum which has been proven to be dangerous to your health.  I cant believe I just found this.  I LOVE IT !!  I dont sweat alot but I can pack an underarm odor that is not great  : )  ...This shuts down underarm odor completely.  I tried some other home remedies and other natural deodorants.  None work like Naturally Fresh Crystal Stick.  Easy to use...Easy to wash off.  Underarms are fresh with soap and water and then reapply after your shower.  No more scrubbing and rubbing trying to remove deodorant residue.  Follow directions.  Moisten the stick...Apply all over where you want protected...(The Full Underarm side to side ...top to bottom)  Dry your stick and put away.  This stick last and last and last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found another use.....Under that tummy fat overhang that gets musky.  Apply there and no more musky smell.  What a product!!&lt;br /&gt;I am totally delighted and impressed with the product and the company who made it.</li>
            <li> I love this deorderent. It works all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 20 years.  My wife started using it 10 years ago after we got married.  We both like it because it is easy to apply, long-lasting, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  However, I&#x27;m not too thrilled with the fact that it is not available locally like it was when I first started using it.  The only place locally that I know of now is Wal-mart, and I am too much a gentleman to tell you what I think of them.  Al, the plastic container is really no match for the product.  When there is still product left, the cap will not stay on.  It seems like the the threads are stripped.  This also happens to the screw that pushes the product forward in the container.</li>
            <li> My husband and I try to use as many all natural personal care products as possible.  This is the only thing he uses (and he has tried a ton of stuff).  Please be aware that this is deodorant, which helps with smell, not wetness.  You are still going to sweat (it&#x27;s not an anti perspirant)!  This is a great, effective, and affordable product if you are looking for an all natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> Love it, no chemical products, works as expected, you have to use about a week to get used</li>
            <li> Follow instructions and wet before applying and it glides right on. It lasts all day and even passed the beach test. I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients and think one may last a full year. One of my three pack (which isn&#x27;t even necessary since they last so long) came broken. I think they need to work on the packaging as I read others had similar issues.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now, and no stink!  I have even gone to the gym and worked out hard, and still no stink!  This stuff really works!  The only bad thing is that the container is somewhat cheap plastic, so you need to be careful with it.  I always wipe down the stick afterwards, because the salt will eventually melt, and jam up the mechanism.  I wipe it off, then make sure it can move.  The bottom turn screw to move it up and down, came off, which did allow me to push up the stick, and clean the salt residue from inside, which makes it work better.  I highly suggest you try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for the safer deodorant. This has ammonium alum which is supposedly a natural ingredient compared to aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly which is the active ingredient in Dove Ultimate Go Fresh anti-perspirant deodorant that I&#x27;ve been using for years!  Even with the Dove, it still wouldn&#x27;t last me all day.  I even bike 3 miles to/from work and it would last only a few hours after application.  However, when I used this, wow, it actually lasted all day including the bike rides.  I absolutely had no smell!!  It felt like a miracle!  It didn&#x27;t prevent me from sweating completely but it felt similar to when I was using Dove anyway.  I give it 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t smell anything however that 1 star is because I&#x27;m still not sure if ammonium alum is completely safe.  Perhaps it&#x27;s just the lesser of the two evils??  I&#x27;ve used Nourish Organic Deodorant and even though it lasted long, I still had a bit of smell at the end of the day.  This didn&#x27;t prevent me from sweating though.  At least this one prevents you from sweating which makes me wonder about ammonium alum.  However out of all the deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used, this has been the best when it comes to smell and sweat!  This will last me a while I assume since there are 3 but this can wean me off until I find the absolutely most natural/organic anti-pers/deodorant that has no \\&quot;alum\\&quot; ingredient whatsoever!</li>
            <li> Always a heavy sweater, I have always been obsessed with finding the right anti-perspirant and deodorant.  The problem is that the stuff I used and applied liberally for years was full of harmful ingredients, including aluminum and who knows what else.  Did I really want to be putting that stuff all over my skin?&lt;br /&gt;I found the crystal stick and have been using it for over a year.  It has none of the bad stuff as the mass-market products, and I think it actually works better.  With a little water, it goes on light and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  It does a great job of odor protection, and it is no big deal to refresh with a little bit on a heavy sweat day.&lt;br /&gt;Note, that it is not an anti-perspirant so it is not going to stop you from sweating at all.  But, you may find that you are not as anxious about staying completely dry and probably don&#x27;t end up sweating as much as you did before.&lt;br /&gt;The other good thing is that it lasts for several months.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find an all natural deodorant that doesnt irriate my skin! This does not irritate at all and it really works! I use it in combo with organic rose water in a spray bottle and it can be 98 degrees out and theres no odor all day long! Just apply once in the morning. No othe deodorant has worked this well.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after a while (many months) the stick may start to stink. To make sure this does not happen too early, I always leave the cap off and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Very Good product ,but one of the three i ordered arriived broken.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years. Packaged well and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  I made my own that worked better.  It might be OK if you want to apply 6 times per day, but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every once in awhile, but am back to my normal Dove 99% of the time.  I will probably try to find a better natural deodorant if I feel up to the challange.</li>
            <li> This  crystal itself is odorless, gentle, and powerful. The protection it provides lasts longer than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. It might cost more per unit, but the crystal lasts forever, making it much more economical too. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. If you&#x27;re having skin reactions to other products, try this one!</li>
