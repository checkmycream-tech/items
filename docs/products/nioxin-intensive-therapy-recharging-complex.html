            <li>My skin looks good</li>
            <li>This is a good product but take head</li>
            <li>I read that the vitamins were suppose to be good for the nails as well as the hair, and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>My hair does feel good and like something is happening.</li>
            <li>This product maybe good.</li>
            <li>I loved Nioxin when I was taking it.</li>
            <li>I plan to keep using this product because it has a lot of good vitamins</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your skin too.  </li>
            <li>My good friend and hairstylist recommended I try these vitamins</li>
            <li>I plan to keep using this product because it has a lot of good vitamins</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your skin too.</li>
            <li>i have read a lot of good review on this product and decided to try.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any shedding or breakage in my hair, my nails and skin are good too.</li>
            <li>Good product and found that it improved growth in nails and helped with my skin</li>
            <li>Loved the product.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and was the best product for my thinning hair.</li>
            <li>Since I am getting good results, I will continue to take it.</li>
            <li>Good deal too.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not that good.  </li>
            <li>Optimum Nutrition Opti-Men Multivitamins, 180-Count]]</li>
            <li>even reviews and rating was good...</li>
            <li>Hairomega is good too.</li>
            <li>The product is good been using for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker, more lustrous and healthier, I don&#x27;t think I will ever change products, because you know what they say, once you find a good thing...keep it!</li>
            <li>I thought the original formula worked awesome and to me</li>
            <li>With special references made to Ladies; Laura F. and Cindy (Rachel I) who advised the best steps to take for recourse.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, after 18 days my hair looks better, feels better and stronger.</li>
            <li>Great, the item was mailed fast and in perfect shape!!!</li>
            <li>BECAUSE THE GOOD PEOPLE AT AMAZON WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME A REFUND !</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with the processing time on this transaction and the product is something I will continue to buy.  </li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with performance.</li>
            <li>My hair is very healthy and grows faster.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks great, and I feel super great.</li>
            <li>Considering the price of Biotin supplements, etc, this seems like a much more precise way to try and address hair loss, while being cost efficient via Amazon&#x27;s great price!    </li>
            <li>MY BROWS NEED TOUCH UPS WAY MORE OFTEN!</li>
            <li>I am ordering more Nioxin vitamins today!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Also I have been taking BETTER CARE OF MY HAIR!</li>
            <li>I then ordered 2 more bottles!  </li>
            <li>and I think it looks a bit better!  </li>
            <li>so I purchased 3 more bottles and when I received them ALL the bottles had cracked pills in them!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy!    </li>
            <li>Yesterday my brother in law, sister and  coworker complimented me on how much better my skin looked!</li>
            <li>can\\&quot;t wait to see how much more these pills do!  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering some more soon!</li>
            <li>Bought this product and was surprisingly pleased!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>it has multiplied more than 6 times !</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I recieve so many compliments on how healthy and beautiful my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own nails for years .. and getting SO many compliments on them over the years!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, please - DO NOT purchase these vitamins thinking they are going to result in amazing hair regrowth and if you do want to take a vitamin for improved skin and hair, go to the store and spend $7 on a bottle of multivitamins vs $40+ or Nioxin.</li>
            <li>and I have nice nails now.  </li>
            <li>Rose Williams</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked all 3 but for the price and amount, I&#x27;m going to stick with this one.</li>
            <li>My hair was kind of thinning in the front</li>
            <li>There is no vitamin smell and was able to get a good price on Amazon for them.  </li>
            <li>I have 2 friends who also use them now having seen my hair, one being my hairdresser who has seen her own improvement in thinning hair at the crown.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say while taking this my hair thickened but just MAINTAINED, didnt grow.  </li>
            <li>AMAZON REALLY HAS THE BEST PRICE FOR THESE.  </li>
            <li>I used to take multivitamins for hair loss however didn&#x27;t find them that effective.</li>
            <li>I now have my own bottle.</li>
            <li>i dont know why there are so many good reviews they did absoultely nothing for my hair skin or nails</li>
            <li>They were a nice hair vitamin.</li>
            <li>super strong!!!</li>
            <li>those with thinning hair, they also have great hair kits with cleansers, conditioners and scalp treatments to ensure the health and quality of the scalp--definitely worth it !</li>
            <li>love, love this product my hair was going so good</li>
            <li>but when I opened the bottle all of the pills were cracked and the smell of them was off (very strong).  </li>
            <li>It is also a very easy pill to swallow.   </li>
            <li>It also grows your nails very strong as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I tell you Nioxin is the best my hair had completely returned and is fuller that ever.</li>
            <li>&quot; This advice I deviated from out of curiosity for another seemingly more popular product.</li>
            <li>One important note though is that people have told me my complexion looks really good.  </li>
            <li>Was nice to be able to find the product without having to pay salon pricing.  </li>
            <li>One important note though is that people have told me my complexion looks really good.</li>
            <li>she said my hair is around 18 inches at its longest point, and I can honestly say it is healthy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a difference from using the product, but I know others who have had great success.</li>
            <li>but this supplement has better effective quantities and cost me $10.</li>
            <li>I buy the 90 count bottle because it is way more cost effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot!!! :)</li>
            <li>Also the company deliver the product very quickly!</li>
            <li>She tried many things before but after reading all reviews in internet and taking this medicine, this is the best pdt so far.</li>
            <li>and it has really made a difference in keeping his beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>Or is it the vendors becoming greedy with a popular product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product, I&#x27;m writting my first review ever for anything.</li>
            <li>it seems too good to be true, it probably isn&#x27;t\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to continue treatment in order to form a more accurate review.</li>
            <li>One of the best products around, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>In addition, I have always had brittle nails and never been able to grow them out at all as they would always split or break.</li>
            <li>So we both Love these Pills.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I kept to it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>makes your hair look healthy</li>
            <li>I love, love these vitamins I have been using them for years.</li>
            <li>After the two weeks I thought I noticed a difference but wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>So many people have noticed the difference that I have been taking them for a year now.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s softer and has more shine.</li>
            <li>Give me a couple more months, and I can write a more in depth review.    </li>
            <li>My brother told me about Amazon, so I decided to see if Amazon sold this product and of course they did and the price was great and much lower than JCPenney.</li>
            <li>then you can do it for 3 more months</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I knew I would be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>What better time then now.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t do it any more.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the results.</li>
            <li>Skin is better :)</li>
            <li>But I know for SURE about the nails ..</li>
            <li>I have so many people asking me \\</li>
            <li>The ladies at my church are now taking Nioxin hair vitamins because they love that way my hair looks</li>
            <li>and I am seeing baby hairs and fuller on the top.  </li>
            <li>OK, joke&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li>It is so healthy now.</li>
            <li>so plan on waxing and shaving more often.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d been able to look at the label, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this item.  </li>
            <li>Yay :)</li>
            <li>So, fingers crossed, I&#x27;m hoping to get more results for the hair too.   </li>
            <li>I want to order more thru Amazon</li>
            <li>I think it was beginning to cause more hair to fall out.</li>
            <li>and I will keep buying more :]</li>
            <li>I am finding I have to shave more</li>
            <li>i returned to buy more and could not believe my eyes when i saw the price.</li>
            <li>i am not rockerfeller and this is just way more than i can afford.</li>
            <li>and I feel the product has worked okay for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with hair growth, my issue is with keeping my hair healthy as it grows</li>
            <li>many inches-</li>
            <li>After reading most of the reviews, it would appear that this product effectiveness depends on the severity of your hair loss.</li>
            <li>I also recommend eating more protein.</li>
            <li>May i start out with that this product may not even be authentic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: i will not be purchasing this product again since i have found better and alternative vitamins that give me results</li>
            <li>One more mention, I was also using the Ovation Hair Treatment system which may have contributed to the hair growth.  </li>
            <li>The product is awesome, however I will never order it from this last company that I did because they take forever to send it to you.</li>
            <li>The longer you take it the better the results.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel it was safe to take these</li>
            <li>I love the product and it does work</li>
            <li>I have Nioxin 5 stars, not because it earned it, but because I knew people would be more apped to reading it.</li>
            <li>Because of so many reviews the priced has jumped.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on how my hair looks so healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I will caution that I have had to be more aggressive with the management of my unwanted body hair.  </li>
            <li>IF YOUR LOOKING FOR HAIR GROWTH, AND FOR YOUR HAIR TO LOOK &amp; FEEL HEALTHY, THESE ARE THE PILLS TO GET.</li>
            <li>My skin appears more elastic and moist.  </li>
            <li>Started 9th August 2011: 3 month supply bottle    </li>
            <li>I think the title speaks for itself however, for those of you that need more here</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad she did.</li>
            <li>I love the vitamins andI</li>
            <li>Since I have begun taking the vitamins my hair has gotten thicker, softer,longer,shinier and just all around better.  </li>
            <li>My nails do grow and my hair feels better</li>
            <li>and I have to pluck and wax more often now than what I used to.</li>
            <li>When my 90 count bottle is gone, I&#x27;ll get another one for sure.</li>
            <li>I recommend that they be purchased through Amazon because you get more for your money.</li>
            <li>Two years later I still think their the best thing out there for our hair and nails!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes on top have grown longer.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It also was not as shiny or healthy looking.</li>
            <li>But one thing is for sure, my hair looks better than it has in probably 5 years or so.</li>
            <li>I think I see the results more in my nails though.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll definitely be able to tell once I stop taking them.</li>
            <li>LongHairDon&#x27;tCare. :)</li>
            <li>I love the results I would recommend this product and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>There is no \\&quot;magic</li>
            <li>Like the majority of reviews here, most of the pills are cracked and smell/taste</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li>the more you use the product.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend a healthy diet and water</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been using it for 2 years now and my hair is thicker, my finger nails grow faster.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>I for sure notice my hair&#x27;s texture and quality improve, but my nails is where I have noticed the most.</li>
            <li>I been taking this product for about 6 months, Im really satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>Nioxin helped renew the strands of my hair so that they were stronger and more durable.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments about my hair, sometimes people think its a wig.  </li>
            <li>I regret buying this supplement, and even more so, regret that I opened them.</li>
            <li>the better than this is a wig or plant hair,</li>
            <li>My dermatologist prescribed excellent tropical ointments that cured the eczema, and the hair grew back.  </li>
            <li>Im glad I found these vitamins, because others claim they work but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have 2 more months on my 90 day supply and will be order more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it and keep my hair when it belongs.</li>
            <li>she is a hairstylist and said she recommends this to most of her clients.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews appear to be from women, but guys should check this stuff out too.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I have NEVER written a review for ANYTHING I have bought online, but I just have to for this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>she had a lot more hair-</li>
            <li>but I have more hair coverage--</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly pleased with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>So just know you will have to shave more often.</li>
            <li>just glad I found something that lives up to their claim.</li>
            <li>Just beware of what your buying be safe people.</li>
            <li>After dealing with more fall out to where I could see my scalp, I decided to look into Nioxin and found it on here.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought it and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>Perhaps more time is needed to see results for me.</li>
            <li>Most online stores do not carry it anymore.</li>
            <li>but you could go to the drugstore, spend $10-$15 and get SO much more for your money.</li>
            <li>and/or some more Biotin if you like...</li>
            <li>Healthy &amp; growth are the results.</li>
            <li>BUT i started to look for something better</li>
            <li>It worked wonders for her but didn&#x27;t do a thing for me that I was able to discern.  </li>
            <li>If you like the retail results you love the shrinking price of buying on line.</li>
            <li>My hair is very healthy and full of elasticity.</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>so I pay no shipping on many products.</li>
            <li>Now the price is $149 or more?  </li>
            <li>oledas hair pills way better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used these vitamins for about 6 months and love them.  </li>
            <li>I went to get more of the vitamin to find out</li>
            <li>and then you could not buy it any more</li>
            <li>You would be better off buying some saw palmetto and biotin.</li>
            <li>at first i thought this was not because of this product because i have read so many good review in here.</li>
            <li>Great results highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li>i really wish people can be HONEST!.</li>
            <li>I was using Phyto at first for stronger hair and nails, before switching to Nioxin after reading all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see my nails grow, but hair started  THINNING OUT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these vitamins are good for you, having said that, unless they are putting some kind of magical substance in them that requires the cost to be many times greater than any other hair</li>
            <li>Great results so far.</li>
            <li>Sooooo, in any case, so far it seems like a great deal.  </li>
            <li>So Far EveryThing has been great with this product</li>
            <li>So far everthing is great</li>
            <li>More importantly I bought these to grow out my hair which is relaxed and colored.</li>
            <li>Please keep the price fair and reasonable.</li>
            <li>Do yourselves a favor folks and buy a good multi-vitamin until Nioxin sets the suggested retail price at a reasonable level.  </li>
            <li>A real shame because the products were quite good, but P&amp;G will probably change them at some point too.</li>
            <li>And my hair is so soft and healthy!!  </li>
            <li>I now have actual nails that have never looked so good, I&#x27;m amazed!  </li>
            <li>I have tried other biotin supplements (like the ones from the health sections in target and costco), but I would say these have worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li>Asked for a full refund!</li>
            <li>They have been growing way faster and don&#x27;t break quite as easily as they used to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the money; If you&#x27;re hesitant about ordering on Amazon (make sure sealed and cotton inside) go to Nioxin and find a certified salon :)</li>
            <li>Amazon makes it easy to buy on line.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble.</li>
            <li>I  strongly doubt I will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Do not have any strong smell.</li>
            <li>like they used to; they are strong.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that my nails, which have always tended to chip, are quite strong.</li>
            <li>I found this product as a great investment, if you really want your hair and nails to grow fast, thats what you will get for sure...    </li>
            <li>I have used many hair growth vitamins in my day (Phyto, GMC etc) and none hve made my hair grow so well, and it&#x27;s soo shiny and full of life.</li>
            <li>Skin has a nice glow to it, looks vibrant and healthy.</li>
            <li>(my nails were already fine).  </li>
            <li>While I am taking it, I see fine peach fuzz and baby hairs all around by face, but that is it.  </li>
            <li>With minoxidil 15%, i think it works fine,</li>
            <li>I also bought the Nioxin Maintenance Kit, System 2 hair treatment for fine, untreated, &amp; noticeably thinning hair.</li>
            <li>My hair grows fine</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy and shinny and is very pretty.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are growing out much faster, so I have to get them waxed more often now!</li>
            <li>Considering how many people have posted positive reviews of the product, it may well be that the magic is in the herbs.  </li>
            <li>Face appeared to breakout a little even though i dont have the best skin...</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve not noticed a huge difference there,</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years, and can see a HUGE difference in the strength of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Best Regards,  Consumer and Professional Services  P&amp;G Professional Care</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase, my nails are stronger like my hair, and I have grown up without bursting and that surprises me because I had some very fragile.</li>
            <li>After taking the entire bottle, I have to say that my hair is a great deal thicker than it was.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that you only need to take it once a day, too!  </li>
            <li>and then my hair dresser confirmed my suspicions and made a comment about how my hair seemed thinner.  </li>
            <li>and they have been absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t say 100% that the bald spot filled in, my hair has been growing like a weed, covering any patches.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Amazon to see if the product, which are vitamins for hair, skin, and nails, was available.  </li>
            <li>I bought the product primarily to help grow my fingernails</li>
            <li>liked the product, but I don&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
            <li>like they worked very well and effective at preventing with hair loss.</li>
            <li>3,000 Biotin...feel free to buy some MSM 1000mg</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Maxi Hair until the formula is available.  </li>
            <li>It will not be available again  until sometime around January of 2013.</li>
            <li>If you see results and it&#x27;s worth it to you then more power to you.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>But so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I thought the product was excellent, but now it is time to switch to something with similar ingredients that is available at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Be aware yo do not want to lose your hair!!</li>
            <li>and I come back to buy more and the price has increased from 30dollars to 119!?!?</li>
            <li>Three months treatment and my hair is growing so fast!!!  </li>
            <li>Check your local salons, most franchised ones sell them for about $20 to $30!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the progress so far!</li>
            <li>product really works and has excellent components, but what happened with the price?&lt;br /&gt;It used to be less than US$ 50 and now is selling for more than US$ 170??&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I cannot say much about my nails because I have always had very strong nails.  </li>
            <li>Had had thinning on the top of my head for years and now have new growth and the texture is also better</li>
            <li>and already I see significant growth in my hair along with a healthier look.  </li>
            <li>First of all, my nails have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>My skin is significantly softer.</li>
            <li>I say this product is worth a try!</li>
            <li>The investment made for me to purchase my items are unique, in that my purchases are delivered to me beyond the US borders.</li>
            <li>I must always prepare to add an additional 20% - 70% to the value of the original price of the goods purchase.   </li>
            <li>So I called Nioxin&#x27;s 1-800 number to ask them about it, but they wouldn&#x27;t give me a straightforward answer, since amazon is not an authorized salon reseller.  </li>
            <li>Well after using the 90 day pack, I saw a significant increase with the length and volume of my hair and my edges grew in dramatically.</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>First of all,all of my tablets are cracked and beat up!what&#x27;s up with that?Then to top it off</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it for my skin but discovered it made my hair grow stronger and thicker</li>
            <li>I purchased this (several bottles) as I thought it would be effective in hair growth (because of all these reviews!)</li>
            <li>I have really strong, healthy nails and decent skin</li>
            <li>Even though I didn&#x27;t get super fast hair growth I have retained more hair and have strong nails.</li>
            <li>i believe that most of these positive reviews were made buy people who have an interest in promoting this product.</li>
            <li>I stressed myself into hair loss right before midterms!</li>
            <li>The bald spot is mostly gone and the rest of my head is full and growing fast.</li>
            <li>No hairbrush full of hair after even the gentle-est hairbrushing.</li>
            <li>It only took a week of losing my gorgeous locks for me to RUN to my doctor.</li>
            <li>Now that the underlying cause of my hair loss is addressed I have found all nioxin products to be absolutely true to their word.</li>
            <li>Shiny and full of life.</li>
            <li>This product really does work, I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>Oh and it also has helped my fingernails to come in stronger and more quickly, it really helped to repair them after I removed my acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>This product so far has kind of lessen the amount of hair that is falling out.  </li>
            <li>when i wake up every morning i see my pillow is full of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair grew about twice as fast, and I saw more growth after 3 months.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, this supplement does benefit all three.</li>
            <li>I can only hope it will be just as good as it was and not way overpriced.</li>
            <li>and then my skin looks much better and my nails are getting much thicker</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s true, on this basis alone I don&#x27;t think I could ever use or recommend a product with the Nioxin name.   </li>
            <li>My hair became extremely full again - all over.</li>
            <li>Biotin, which also works, will be good enough a supplement from now on.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t even seen any results but thought it would be good to take a daily vitamin and one that would help my hair, skin, and nails as well.</li>
            <li>Within 2-3 weeks of taking one tablet daily, as recommended, I&#x27;ve grown a full set of long, strong beautiful nails!</li>
            <li>The first one was fine</li>
            <li>I did not expect such impressive results - especially in so short a time.</li>
            <li>I have taken these vitamins for several years and have gotten compliments on my hair looking better, which is what I was taking the vitamins for, more biotin in them.  </li>
            <li>I found this product worthy of using.</li>
            <li>I think that the difference is that I am able to retain more hair, especially the ends.</li>
            <li>I can say that my skin which is mildly acne prone has shown some improvement in terms of texture already.</li>
            <li>But the main reason I am in love with Nioxin is solely based on what it has done to my hair.</li>
            <li>Something I&#x27;m taking helped tremendously</li>
            <li>the S&amp;C. So have I noticed any super significance in hair growths?</li>
            <li>and my hair growth is tremendous.</li>
            <li>This supplement has improve my hair conditions tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Just received this product today, and the shipment was quick and on time, so</li>
            <li>The bottle was damaged during shipping (cap cracked, but luckily safety seal was intact).</li>
            <li>Thank you for sending so quickly.</li>
            <li>i was dying my hair to super blond for years, and i decided to stop killing them, cause they started to look like a floor mop after all,the day i decided to do that</li>
            <li>I LOVE NIOXIN, and would recommend it highly,  JH  Arkansas</li>
            <li>DO not except huge results off the first bottle.</li>
            <li>After taking Nioxin for about a month, the hair began to grow in where I was becoming very bald.  </li>
            <li>Let me first state that the shipper is super fast!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have very fine naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I didnt get the full results I wanted to get but who does right.</li>
            <li>I love them so much that I am leaving my first ever product review.</li>
            <li>I purchased my second supply of this product, which I LOVED the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back for more!  </li>
            <li>Even though my multi-vitamin had the same ingredients, this worked so much better!</li>
            <li>This is an increase of about 3 inches since I first started using them!</li>
            <li>Okay so I waited until I completed 2 months of taking this product to write my review because I wanted it to be as accurate as possible.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>So for the price, this is worth it, since they both contain the 90 pills.</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for about 6 years now, and my hair has NEVER been this shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since January, and I must say that it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>I am just a young man who noticed that I was thinning on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m AA with natural coily healthy hair that wanted to grow my hair faster</li>
            <li>, this is about the time that the nice extra hair you had during pregnancy, starts to fall out.  </li>
            <li>Despite that -- Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the try</li>
            <li>Nioxin is a wonder vitamin, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been falling out and I was starting to get worried and need an effective product to stop it.</li>
            <li>Its the 3rd purchase its not as effective  as it worked 1st time</li>
            <li>I am glad to put up with an even thicker mane to have clear skin.</li>
            <li>It takes about 3 months to work but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth trying.</li>
            <li>For a more detailed discussion of the problems with \\&quot;natural supplements,\\&quot;  Consumer Reports recently published an article about the dangers of many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients.</li>
            <li>but they are worth the price.</li>
            <li>but, I told her only that her hair looked nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural most of the time</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Nioxin is committed to delivering  innovation behind best in class product performance.</li>
            <li>by the end of the first month everything seems to have stabilized and not growing so quickly, but my nails are stronger and my hair is fuller and stronger and i&#x27;ve ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I also use the shampoo and the Therapy and I am growing new hair, I recommended this to some friends and they are using it too and also growing new hair.</li>
            <li>Originally my stylist recommended it to me to help with that original sighting of thinning at the top center (or crown) of the head.</li>
            <li>and if they do grow, they just tear right off.  </li>
            <li>It took me right about two months to see the results.</li>
            <li>and she noticed the difference right away.  </li>
            <li>bummer right?</li>
            <li>Do not expect to notice changes right away, things take time.</li>
            <li>so new growth can be seen easily in my hair.</li>
            <li>Also does a great job to strengthen my nails and have few breakouts on my face if I take them consistently.</li>
            <li>You will be able to see your hair&#x27;s full length potential with this product.</li>
            <li>But its worth it for me to have thick beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>I also had one to three very large zits at all times.</li>
            <li>so you can get super potent biotin at walmart or here for WAY cheaper and it does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went off this pill when I was pregnant, because my prenatal vitamins had many of the same nutrients.</li>
            <li>Noticing great growth--I already have super thick hair</li>
            <li>I lost my hair due to chemo theraphy and as it began to sprout new hair, I had a beautiful little male pattern baldness spot right in front on top of my head!!!</li>
            <li>I called Nioxin&#x27;s 1-800 number on the bottle to report this apparent quality issue and to ask if the cracked caplets were safe.</li>
            <li>My skin is beautiful and my hair is thick, but the biggest difference came to my lips and face &amp; hair thickness VS speed of hair growth-</li>
            <li>Ordered it based on exceptional reviews here and on other sites.</li>
            <li>Also, my eyebrows are growing quickly too, much fuller</li>
            <li>The vitamins are reasonably priced on Amazon &amp; the shipping is fast &amp; free.</li>
            <li>I saw a lot less hair loss after using this my skin looked good as well.</li>
            <li>My husband is a hairderesser and customers have come back with great response, especially if they have problems with thinning hair .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously purchased from amazon 4 bottles 90 caps for 25$ per bottle, I loved the product i was using it together with biotin and minoxidil, i came here to place another order</li>
            <li>Since I really cant say if it works just yet I can say that the size of the pill is about the normal size of a multi-vitamin, however the shape makes it easy for swallowing(and</li>
            <li>I like the product very much, I used to get a lot of split nails</li>
            <li>I have very VERY brittle nails</li>
            <li>Also, my fingernails are growing very, very fast.   </li>
            <li>AND IT MADE IT GROW VERY FAST.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed her hair coverage was very much improved after about 2 weeks-</li>
            <li>Really didnt notice any amazing hair growth my thinning hair line may have filled in slightly, but</li>
            <li>I do know Nioxin is a good product and their other products do really work.  </li>
            <li>The first time I started using Nioxin, I thought I was going to lose all my hair since the shedding of hair increased very much in the first one or two weeks.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product for hair growth, but this works much better with a good diet, plenty of water, a little scalp massage for 3 to 5 minutes a few times a week; you can do the scalp massage without the oils because this helps with blood circulation of the scalp in the thinning areas.</li>
            <li>l plan to continue buying this product through Amazon as it is MUCH cheaper and definitely worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>(First time in years).  </li>
            <li>; stay consistent.</li>
            <li>I at first didnt see the point in getting this since my multi-vitamin had everything this had.</li>
            <li>My first purchase was from JCPenney.</li>
            <li>Nothing happened at first.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to drink enough water with them and eat something as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was REALLY worried about my nails!  </li>
            <li>So I am a first year law student, and lo and behold</li>
            <li>I first purchased these pills a couple of months ago and the pills were cracked.</li>
            <li>I am able to style it in different ways now that it is thicker.</li>
            <li>You will notice a difference within the first bottle (90 days).</li>
            <li>First off let me state that I&#x27;m not basing this review on the performance of the supplement, since I haven&#x27;t taken it yet and in any case, my opinion would be subjective  </li>
            <li>In Febuary when I first purchased these vitamins, I was bald in the front of my head...</li>
            <li>This is my first review on amazon.</li>
            <li>These pills are definitely working for me, my hair feels more course.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just about to finish my first 90 count bottle and must say there was definitely even more hair growth taking the supplement.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie and say my hair is like it was 10 years ago, but my receding hairline filled in some and my vertex bald spot shrunk considerably.  </li>
            <li>So Nioxin promised the same and even better results and</li>
            <li>Sure enough when I opened my package</li>
            <li>Two to Three months ago the cost was only like $25-30 at the most.</li>
            <li>I hope to regain my hair thickness by taking a biotin supplement, which I probably should done in the first place instead of these overpriced vitamins.</li>
            <li>I just had a baby 5 months ago and from what I remember from my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>I spoke to one of my girlfriends who I knew had lost a ton of her hair after having her first baby (I have no children).  </li>
            <li>I ordered my first bottle about 7 months ago.  </li>
            <li>I took 2 pills a day at first (even though the recommended dose is 1 pill a day)</li>
            <li>Most women take care of all this pretty regularly anyway.  </li>
            <li>ps I had someone at work refer to me as Rapunzel last week!!! :)</li>
            <li>i had no any problem when i took the first 30 count.</li>
            <li>This has made my hair so much healthier!  </li>
            <li>but I have had the same problem for many years</li>
            <li>I just finished my first 30 day bottle of the Nioxin pills..</li>
            <li>these vitamins had WAY more of the exact same vitamins provided by each Nioxin</li>
            <li>I do know I saw better results with my nails  by using knox gelatin daily.  </li>
            <li>: Broke me out for the first week</li>
            <li>really helps the hair to grow faster!</li>
            <li>In 2 months all of his hair grow back and more then he had before.</li>
            <li>These vitamins really do what they are supposed to do!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is much thicker!</li>
            <li>Have I been a poster child and been consistent?</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>As with any product a person uses this will take time, requires consistent use to see results.</li>
            <li>Be patient and be consistent.</li>
            <li>and i will post  an update to really finalize this review!</li>
            <li>They really do work!</li>
            <li>I saw hair growth after the first month.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was because of Nioxin because I was doing nothing else different.</li>
            <li>Now I check the 1 star reviews first.</li>
            <li>funny (which means they are defective/old).</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s the price to pay for a product that really works!</li>
            <li>The most disconcerting is probably Bladderwrack, a seaweed that is considered \\&quot;possibly unsafe\\&quot; for consumption.</li>
            <li>Since supplements are unregulated in the U.S., it&#x27;s quite possible that these pills may contain more than you&#x27;re bargaining for.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m typically pretty skeptical :D</li>
            <li>if u take it consistently you will see results</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this product if you want your hair to be in better condition than it is now.</li>
            <li>Oh, &amp; also, my nails are growing extremely fast as well!</li>
            <li>and I actually feel like my hair has thinned more since I&#x27;ve been using this</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It appears that this is exactly what Amazon is doing with this product.   </li>
            <li>Interesting - when I purchased this several months ago the cost was around $30.  </li>
            <li>First off...</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d like to address reviews complaining of \\&quot;cracked\\&quot; pills and Nioxin&#x27;s quality control (or lack thereof).</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t take the tablets consistently for 90 days.  </li>
            <li>this was a purchase for a gift of a friend of mine and is exactly what she wanted , thank you</li>
            <li>and when I got low and went to buy more I saw that the price had gone up about 3 times that.</li>
            <li>But for that much money I need a miracle!</li>
            <li>You are spending $200 TOO MUCH!</li>
            <li>but 3 months of taking it now, and nothing, even my hair is still falling at the same rate or more.</li>
            <li>The product was sent quickly and received in new condition.  </li>
            <li>I myself do not like the taste of the supplement it has a kind of bitter after taste to it, but, I have found that it makes my nails grow two times as fast.</li>
            <li>I am now on my second bottle because the difference Nioxin has made really shows, but from time to time, I still lose more hair than I wish I did.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different shampoos and products to help my hair grow and this supplement really does work.</li>
            <li>Much to my amazement, I was able to buy two 90 days supply bottles for around the same price as I would have paid for two 30 days bottles.  </li>
            <li>A healthy diet consisting of vegetables, fruit and whole grain will improve the body&#x27;s overall health too.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much, hope to order from you very soon.</li>
            <li>I have a pixie bob right now, and my New Years resolution is to just let my hair GROW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing positive results.</li>
            <li>Also, you need to make sure that there are no bigger medical issues to see huge results with this that contribute to hair loss.</li>
            <li>By the time I finished the first 90 day bottle, I could see that my nails were much stronger.  </li>
            <li>My hair grows pretty fast; now that I&#x27;m taking the supplements my hair is growing even faster.  </li>
            <li>Like, they&#x27;d get really long and 4-5 of them would fall out at the end of the day to make room for more.</li>
            <li>The one thing I do notice is that my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be falling out as much as with my first pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I also notice my nails feel stronger and are growing pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>I used them consistently for months, and they really work well.  </li>
            <li>So after making some research, I bought my first bottle of Biotin 5000 mcg and after two weeks, I am amazed with how much stronger my hair has gotten.</li>
            <li>I have read almost all of these reviews posted here on Amazon prior to purchasing mainly to gain insight on what most people thought about them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a teen guy who made the mistake of getting my teen-heartthrob-esque bangs all cut off, and started to regret that decision pretty quick!</li>
            <li>It really depends on why you lost your hair and what type or hair you have in the first place to see certain results.</li>
            <li>I started taking the vitamins a month and half ago and the results have been amazing.  </li>
            <li>Found a nice product that works just as well and about 75% less too.</li>
            <li>There are no dramatic results</li>
            <li>So I cannot really be certain it works.  </li>
            <li>Nioxin is NOT a gene in a bottle, if a certain hair type or length doesn&#x27;t run in your family don&#x27;t expect to get it.</li>
            <li>I contacted Nioxin and was told that they are making a new formula (hope it is the same or better)</li>
            <li>I use the nioxin pills which are awesome with pure biotin and vitamin E pills and my hair is super thick and has grew a little since I started this regimen.</li>
            <li>Another website said it&#x27;s being reformulated &amp; repackaged  &amp; will be available in the fall &amp; that the leftover supply is safe .Anyhow when I ran out &amp; saw the price increase &amp; heard about the possible health scare &amp; reformulation delay I switched to HAIROMEGA DHT (available at Amazon) which works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li>My natural part also became super wide, and I  had what looked like a bald spot on the top of my head.      </li>
            <li>I also have noticed that not only has my hair on my head and eyelashes grown, all the fine hair on my arms and legs have lengthened.</li>
            <li>I would be fine if they actually worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pills are relatively small and do not have much smell compared to many other vitamins, which is good.</li>
            <li>Her hair is now very long, thick and beautiful and it is super shiny.  </li>
            <li>This surprises me, because Biotin is usually such a huge factor in hair loss treatments.  </li>
            <li>My skin does seem a bit healthier, but then again I&#x27;ve always had nice healthy skin, with the exception of the random pimples I would get, but I haven&#x27;t had one for a while, so it could be the Nioxin?</li>
            <li>Well my wife and I really believe these Pills Help.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that.  </li>
            <li>it changed my menstral flow, made it very short and light  </li>
            <li>but it must be hormonal, maybe it had something to do with me crushing the tablets too big for me to swallow,  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product as well as the company that sells it!</li>
            <li>and I did notice my eyelashes looked fuller today, which is ironic since I wore brown mascara today.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell much difference in my hair yet, but I am going to give the Nioxin products 1 year before making up my mind.  </li>
            <li>After the pills really got into my system (after 2 weeks maybe), my hair was growing faster EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li>So I really can&#x27;t judge if it is working.</li>
            <li>and/or how the pills are made because my pills which I purchased from an authorized vender very also cracked</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really notice anything yet.</li>
            <li>Yes, absolutely.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading</li>
            <li>As a side note, regrowing my beard happened much quicker this time around while on this product.  </li>
            <li>but the price is to much a friend told me u can get them in walmart hair salon</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>and my eyelashes grew REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li>After using for about three weeks, I noticed that when I washed my hair, it wasn&#x27;t falling out as much.  </li>
            <li>the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>Absolutely.  </li>
            <li>and I can really tell a difference in the reduction of losing hair</li>
            <li>AND EVERYONE IMMEDIATELY STARTED NOTICING HOW FAST MY HAIR WAS GROWING.</li>
            <li>THESE PILLS WORK FAST</li>
            <li>BUT NIOXIN REALLY DOES WORK.</li>
            <li>At about 25 or 26 cents per table, this product is very affordable...</li>
            <li>I think that after finishing up the 90 day bottle, the real difference will be seen.</li>
            <li>I am very optimistic about this product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve noticed a real growth spurt.</li>
            <li>This product works really well for me.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing really well.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t make a statement about my skin.</li>
            <li>When I stopped taking it, my hair grew an inch but got much much thinner.  </li>
            <li>Within two weeks I had to cut them because they were growing so fast.</li>
            <li>Will order again very soon.  </li>
            <li>Ships fast.</li>
            <li>Three months is probably when you will really start noticing a difference.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT REALLY DID WORK.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice my hair or skin improve.</li>
            <li>My hair thins on the side when I get stressed and I have really kinky hair.</li>
            <li>If your struggling with losing to much hair every time you brush this will help.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works for hair growth, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair thicker.</li>
            <li>My pills have been coming cracked also and some people have been really  complaining about it.  </li>
            <li>I think this product really works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any real skin issues so no noticable change there.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing much thicker and faster now that I am taking this.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t finish the whole bottle after a week of taking it</li>
            <li>they work really well for her</li>
            <li>I have found that this product really works.</li>
            <li>It really should be under $125 but lets hope it gets there soon.</li>
            <li>my nail tech told me that I could get them much cheaper online.</li>
            <li>Looks like a lot of people really like this product, but this one isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>Since all of these ingredients are listed as a proprietary blend, you don&#x27;t know how much of each you&#x27;re taking.</li>
            <li>It really works, but they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>The niacin caused me to have so much pain in my breast that I went to the doctor thinking I was getting inflammatory breast cancer again</li>
            <li>And it worked very well.</li>
            <li>In my opinion,this product does work very well for me, and I will continue to purchase it.   </li>
            <li>Price of product has really gone up...</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>My hair seems to grow so much faster.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that I notice much difference on my hair just yet.  </li>
            <li>My skin has become so much clearer since taking the vitamins.</li>
            <li>It takes I&#x27;d say about a month to notice changes, but it really worked.</li>
            <li>Received these from Amazon, and the vitamins are cracked and very \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>so end up throw a way the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>This one really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will correct baldness, it is really a vitamin that helps fullness when you still have your hair.</li>
            <li>i took them for 3 months straight and no improvement</li>
            <li>Now it is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>a 29 year old male and my hair was thinning on the top.</li>
            <li>It worked for the top middle section of my scalp but did not see any effects yet for the hair near to forehead.</li>
            <li>I am not sure exactly why amazon, ebay ect... upped the price so high on these pills (must be cause they were selling out so fast) but you should be able to spend $20 for a 30 count bottle!</li>
            <li>and I feel like I have a new head of hair, really!</li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t see significant results by the time I&#x27;m halfway through my 2nd bottle</li>
            <li>Like many other reviews mentioned - my pills were all cracked.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the reviews declared that these vitamins made their hair grow significantly faster and for me that simply wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li>Other hairs on my body have also grown more than usuall.</li>
            <li>(I guess that much is pretty natural) hair loss!</li>
            <li>(I bought it for $23 + shipping in January) when there are so many other working products on the market now.</li>
            <li>but since I was taking so many other vitamins, I thought I wouldn&#x27;t notice.  </li>
            <li>I am sure these were imitation pills since they appeared to be falling apart and had no effect on me</li>
            <li>Up until the last year, my hair had alway been thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The new product (with a  reformulation) is targeted to be available in the next 6-9 months.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t verify for certain that this is because of the Nioxin supplement, since I also started taking supplements for Thyroid at the same time, but I&#x27;m convinced enough to buy more and raise my review up to 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I guess it is good, but I only have taken half the bottle.</li>
            <li>Nails are growing healthy and strong, they used to be paper thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li>But I guess I need to take the entire bottle before I can give you the true results.</li>
            <li>(biting them doesn&#x27;t help either :P) and rather thin hair.</li>
            <li>I do have some loss, but no where near what it was like the first time.</li>
            <li>This is a product that turns out to contain exactly the same vitamins and minerals that are available in ANY standard multi-vitamin tablet, with the only difference being that most multi-vitamin tablets contain significantly higher doses of those same ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can put almost anything in a professional looking bottle, charge a pretty penny</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m natural 4a fine hair strands but lots of strands if you want to know my hair type hair texture is coarse.</li>
            <li>My hair is shinier and I am even growing new hairs on my scalp!  </li>
            <li>I noticed after 3 months new lashes were growing and filling in the spaces!</li>
            <li>Hey, I have a new job!</li>
            <li>I have been doing high protein diets and it&#x27;s taking its toll on my hair by making my fine hair dry and breakable.</li>
            <li>Overall our hair has grown or nails are hard and our skin looks great.</li>
            <li>Less hair on my brush, more hair on my head.</li>
            <li>Now I see less falling and more strength hair in the shower, in the bed and while combing.     </li>
            <li>Hopefully this product helps promote hair growth since that was the main reason I perchased it to begin with.</li>
            <li>When I was using Phyto my nails grew so quickly, and my hair felt thicker, so I will be going back to that brand.</li>
            <li>I was loosing clumps in the shower and on top of that I have a skin disease that is dandruff on steroids, and had low iron, so I had a double dose of hair loss.  </li>
            <li>Actually it seems fewer strands are falling out than ever for me, super stocked about it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a decent amount of growth.</li>
            <li>I am approaching my last 30 days on this bottle and will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li>main intent of purchasing these vitamins was to go along with their shampoo and conditioner systems for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>I used it for ninety days, and it seems to work better when I massaged my scalp and used it along with essential oils such as jojoba, tea tree and lavender.     </li>
            <li>Item can still be found in some retail stores at regular price if you act quickly before their stock runs out.</li>
            <li>During the time I was pregnant and off Nioxin pills, my acne came back.</li>
            <li>Until 2 months back, I used to have tremendous hair fall.</li>
            <li>Since this product hasn&#x27;t been manufactured for awhile, I just wanted to mention that I reviewed the ingredients and found that the main difference between it and the vitamins I was taking already was biotin.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen great result as my hair growth was slow prior to the use of this product.</li>
            <li>This is a really good supplement, my nails are growing and my skin is glowing not to mention my hair is thick and lush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken 2 years for my hair to stop producing that rough \\&quot;scab hair\\&quot;that comes in after years of perms due to damage to follicles, regain its original texture, &amp; become healthy again.</li>
            <li>If you have a super walmart and there is a salon inside they normally caring them for the low price!</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend Nioxin</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>SOOOOOO if you&#x27;re looking for something to help your hair growth I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>I wanted to give you a high review but not now.</li>
            <li>I am almost done with my first (90 count) bottle and have TONS of new growth and my fall out has decreased tremendously!!!</li>
            <li>I wish the results were a little better, but I&#x27;m hoping over time I will see thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I have lost a lot of hair over the past year due to different medications I have been on, within three months my hair was looking great with this product!</li>
            <li>Her nails grow strong and dont brake as much and her hair sheds less when she brushs it.</li>
            <li>The first benefit I noticed was to my skin, which suddenly became (much) softer--in the middle of winter, when I take very hot showers.</li>
            <li>These vitamins make my nails hard and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>By four weeks my natural hair had grown so much</li>
            <li>I like Nioxin Intensive therapy recharging complex because it really helps keep my hair healthy, and stops it from falling out so much.  </li>
            <li>I was transitioning to natural and this product really helped my hair growth.</li>
            <li>this product slowed my hair loss to a normal pace in just 2 weeks</li>
            <li>But have I noticed a change in the normal growth of my hair?</li>
            <li>My nails are more firm.</li>
            <li>I have just decided that the next bottle I take, I will be consistent so that I may see what kinda results I can really yield.</li>
            <li>all the moms i knew said the hair loss was normal</li>
            <li>but still i want to continue for few more tabs</li>
            <li>My hair grows a lot faster than it normally would.</li>
            <li>Well, I wanted to start using these again because when I used to take them, my hair was so soft and full and just luxurious, I always received compliments on my hair and it actually helped my complextion too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks....  </li>
            <li>especially since I&#x27;ve already taken almost a month worth.  </li>
            <li>I plan to complete the second bottle, maybe it takes a full 6 months.</li>
            <li>Not only have the bare spots shown significant improvement, my hair is growing.</li>
            <li>i bought these vitamins and cut my hair super long, and stopped coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;when</li>
            <li>Overall Nioxin products are effective but a little pricey.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the 90 day supply and this will continue to be my new multi-vitamin.</li>
            <li>I have new hair growth along my temples and throughout my scalp.  </li>
            <li>and she said I have new hair growth everywhere.  </li>
            <li>It did make my hair seem healthier, but I did not grow any new hair</li>
            <li>I ordred a new bottle of this product and the pills arrived cracaked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for three months and see new growth around my hairline.</li>
            <li>With a new sulfate-free shampoo and my nioxin I hope to see a difference soon.</li>
            <li>after 30 days of using the Nioxin vitamins I noticed new hair growth along my hair line.</li>
            <li>I can not find a lot of new hair</li>
            <li>and I live in the DMV.</li>
            <li>I am black so my hair is easily damaged.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 90 count Nioxin vitamins and took almost a month worth of vitamins until I got towards the middle of the bottle to recognize the vitamins were old, cracked, brittle and falling apart when I rubbed my finger across them.  </li>
            <li>The supplements were just old because they lacked the smell of fresh vitamins ALONG WITH the notion that they were starting to crack.  </li>
            <li>I bought this particular hair, skin, and nail supplement above the others because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>My hair is also growing very fast, which I did not buy the product for because I like wearing my hair short, but I wanted the fullness, now I have it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with fine 4a/b hair &amp; have gone natural after over 20 years of curly perms.</li>
            <li>Within weeks my hair was definitely thicker and after finishing the first bottle there was new hair growth.</li>
            <li>As of right now I do not really notice too much of a difference in my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised!</li>
            <li>I never really expected it to grow that much.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>If you do give the Nioxin vitamins a try, be aware that you may want to supplement it with Biotin (and possibly Zinc as well).    </li>
            <li>I went to the dermatologist and he gave me a topical solution, but what really worked was these vitamins!  </li>
            <li>It may have kept my hair healthy, but compared to other vitamins I&#x27;ve taken, this had low</li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s worth a shot to anyone out there who has noticed more of their hair jumping ship lately, and especially if you&#x27;re just beginning to bald.</li>
            <li>I have an allergy to horsetail which is usually an ingredient in most hair vitamins</li>
            <li>So out of caution, I contacted amazon and had them send me a replacement bottle (I thought the original bottle might have had cracked pills due to improper packaging).  </li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t broke so it didn&#x27;t need to be fixed!</li>
            <li>I noticed how my hair and nails got stronger during the first month and after the second month, I started growing some hair again.</li>
            <li>WOW does this stuff work!</li>
            <li>Based on my dilemma my case was assessed and a full refund granted minus (understandably) Customs charges.  </li>
            <li>I am about to order this product for the 8th time and swear by these little pills for rapid strong hair &amp; nail growth.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered the Nioxon Recharging Complex from Amazon (three months ago), everything was fine.</li>
            <li>Cloned \\&quot;grey market\\&quot; products of dubious quality from Asia and the Middle East can easily find their way to large distributors who then market the discounted \\&quot;brand-name\\&quot; product to online sellers including eBay and possibly Amazon.</li>
            <li>The first improvement I always notice is in my skin (which takes on a buttery soft, moisturized feel - which makes my skin look younger).  </li>
            <li>I first heard about this from my hairdresser, but it was kind of expensive</li>
            <li>I would like to address the price because I was initially in shock over the price, but remember certain companies realize that the Nioxin has stop making the old formula and will not come out with the new formula until Jan 2013.</li>
            <li>I will not buy from this seller again, because I am sure that the seller read all of the negative reviews about the cracks in the tablets, therefore they should have pull their expired stock from the shelves and replaced them with a new batch.</li>
            <li>But this certainly didn&#x27;t hurt matters, and at the low cost for a three month supply on subscription costing 7.00 a month what do you have to lose?</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve seen my hair growth go from 1/3 and 1/4 inches certain areas a month to 1/2 and 1/3 of an inch in the same areas.</li>
            <li>but because this is a supplement it is taking a little longer and will be available again in 6 to 9 months.</li>
            <li>Apparently they want to take advantage of the popularity this product is enjoying but is defintely not worth the price, DON&#x27;T BUY IT FOR THIS PRICE, SAVE YOUR MONEY !!</li>
            <li>Seriously, they are actually growing and are growing fast and strong!</li>
            <li>As far as hair growth, my hair has never had an issue with growth; it actually grows quite fast.</li>
            <li>Clearly P&amp;G doesn&#x27;t care about brand loyalty.</li>
            <li>I ordered these and have been taking them for about a month so far</li>
            <li>I want to wait until the entire packet is done before I can make a real judgement call on this product.</li>
            <li>This product has helped my hair considerably for her hair growth, and it&#x27;s even helped her during her menstrual cycle.</li>
            <li>Soon after that I developed breast cancer and went through surgery, Chemo, and Radiation treatments.  </li>
            <li>The first two months I didnt notice much of a change seeing as I chopped my long hair to shoulder and then later got a pixie cut.  </li>
            <li>but I think it is too early to tell if it works or not.  </li>
            <li>AND ALL OF THE ORDERS HAVE BEEN OLD.</li>
            <li>ALL OF THESE PILLS ARE OLD AND DEFECTIVE.</li>
            <li>As far as healthier skin - the jury is still out.</li>
            <li>Wild Yam Root  Sarsaparilla  </li>
            <li>Been taking them every day and WOW</li>
            <li>because that&#x27;s what acrylics do to your natural nails, damages them.</li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle of vitamins from COSTSELL which turns out to be old and out of date.  </li>
            <li>According the Nioxin, if your pills are cracked, they are old.  </li>
            <li>at the third week my legs were really itchy</li>
            <li>For 90 days straight, I took the pills and massaged my scalp daily, just like I was supposed to, and</li>
            <li>Not a big deal really, but it&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li>Naturally I freaked out and started doing research on what I could do about this.  </li>
            <li>and I only take this often because I don&#x27;t know what else to take, but it really does not regrow your hair...</li>
            <li>And i kid you not, four weeks later, my eyebrows have as much growth as a two month wait.  </li>
            <li>If you take the vitamins faithfully you will notice a marked improvement in hair growth and thickness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 years old and have always had fine/thin hair but never had any problems with it growing in length</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s just working on my head hair.</li>
            <li>I do have some loss, but no where near what it was like before.</li>
            <li>If this changes, I&#x27;ll post a update, but so far, nothing.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it works.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;glowing, positive\\&quot; reviews for this product are completely bogus.</li>
            <li>I am 25 years old and started loosing hair about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>So far no difference in the health of my nails.</li>
            <li>Over all I dont always eat the healthiest food &amp; I find these make a very noticable difference in the overall health of my hair!Definatly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair has become noticeably soft.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the growth yet as it is too early.</li>
            <li>As far as the hair on my head, I guess time will tell.</li>
            <li>i measured by using a tape measure on my roots as i was transitioning from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li>If these did help my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed because I was too busy stressing about my face.</li>
            <li>Neither company can be located except through an Amazon \\&quot;shell\\&quot; preventing any direct consumer contact.  </li>
            <li>I recieved my Nioxin supplements last week very prompt service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda to early to state weather</li>
            <li>I take Nioxin vitamins for my adult acne.</li>
            <li>If these greedy sellers have any conscious for the consumer&#x27;s health they wouldn&#x27;t sell this bottle here on amazon.</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>The Saw Palmetto and Wild Yam</li>
            <li>and Ive noticed the shedding has completely stopped.</li>
            <li>Thank you for contacting Procter and Gamble Professional Care Exclusive Lines.  </li>
            <li>as far as nixon supplements are concerned, i have stopped use, as it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I think lower price brands probably will do just as good as this expensive one.</li>
            <li>My hair also looks so shiny, thick, and healthy.    </li>
            <li>It is a good vitamin, but I think that $179.00 is a tad expensive.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, this is a sign of old vitamins---repackaged in a new container.</li>
            <li>I realize that hair only grows about 1/2 an inch per month, so I don&#x27;t expect to have super long hair after three months.</li>
            <li>And with the colder weather knocking on the door, I&#x27;ve been shedding worse than a Golden Retriever!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin and while I am taking the pills my hair has new growth and gets stronger.  </li>
            <li>My product arrived in tact and without broken pills like some other reviewers experienced.</li>
            <li>the product very much but at the new price, I will consider seeking other alternatives.</li>
            <li>mg&#x27;s of its ingredients making it less effective and less</li>
            <li>Comprare other because it&#x27;s worth, everyone sees the change in my eyelashes, my skin, my nails and my hair ...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if there is really any new growth, but I shortly noticed after I started taking Nioxin that the number of hairs in the drain when I wash my hair is much much lesser than beforehand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the huge issue with this is - maybe that means they&#x27;re old?  </li>
            <li>more however the price is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>I first got these back in October 2011 from a local beauty supply shop but they ran out &amp; I found them here &amp; ordered them.</li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;m african american and have had issues with my hair growing since I moved to GA in 96&#x27;</li>
            <li>I bought this product less than a month ago and have noticed a tremendous change in my skin.</li>
            <li>My nails are going out smoothly, except I do have a little peach fuzz above my upper lip, which I typically have but it grows at an extensive rate, I manage though, it&#x27;s not horrific.</li>
            <li>I think their effectiveness is due to the fact that they break down DHT, a form of male hormone that men &amp; women produce more of as they get older.</li>
            <li>so i stopped the pills and eventually everything got back to normal.  </li>
            <li>second issue with these vitamins, also mentioned in other reviews, is that they&#x27;re really not much different than the vitamins available at any CVS, Target, etc.  </li>
            <li>I notice new \\&quot;flyaways\\&quot; when I pull my hair back into a pony.  </li>
            <li>When I touch now the skin on my scalp, I can feel short newly grown hair.</li>
            <li>For all of you who rate this with negative comments, what are you doing differently to take better care of your hair?</li>
            <li>It may be possible to get the same ingredients without spending so much money, but for now I am sticking with it.</li>
            <li>It stopped my hair from falling further after 1 week of daily use, and my hair looks and feels much thicker.</li>
            <li>Never been keen on the issue of hairloss but it got to a point where I had to adress it, I used this as well as a cayenne fruit supplement and slowly but surely started to see fuzzys growing back</li>
            <li>I often get comments on my thick, healthy, bouncy hair and attribute it totally to my constant use of Nioxin vitamins.</li>
            <li>As I write this, I&#x27;ve just finished the 90-count bottle and my bangs have grown back completely!</li>
            <li>The only thing that can truly help thinning hair is Rogaine and possibly taking actual Biotin pills (which are a heck of a lot cheaper and have a higher dosage as well).  </li>
            <li>My relaxers usually last 3 months before the need of another, and usually about a month my hair is still easy to comb through, not this time.</li>
            <li>In terms of hair which was getting ready to show signs of new growth anyway since I usually get new-growth after about 4 weeks post relaxer is somewhat normal, I guess.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews which were almost all positive</li>
            <li>So I can wholeheartedly recommend the Nioxin supplements in general, but suggest getting them from somewhere else perhaps.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist loves it so much that she wants me to stop wearing weaves because my hair is now about five inches past my shoulder</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 50 year old female.</li>
            <li>I spent about 30 minutes searching the web for a label before I decided to buy this, but in the end, all I could find was a list of ingredients on the official Nioxin site, which told me what was in it, but not how much.  </li>
            <li>and it is sooo soft, almost like baby hair especially at the crown.  </li>
            <li>In my early 50&#x27;s and balding in the back and working it&#x27;s way forward.  </li>
            <li>But apparently they don&#x27;t manufacture these anymore.</li>
            <li>it was old yellow and cracked and passed the return date policy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them for hair growth and better looking hair for those with thin, puny hair.</li>
            <li>expedited heart beat, my blood pressure rose, and i was just uncomfortable in my skin...</li>
            <li>My hair was getting thin in the top just like a man.  </li>
            <li>For those loyal customers visit some of the local salons to see if you can still purchase them because some still have a few in stock and the 30 capsule is still $19.99</li>
            <li>So word to the wise, a number of persons have had identical bad experiences, one must also give considerations to the numbers that have not taken the time to express their misfortunes with the same item, hence the probability of your item being defective will therefore be high.   </li>
            <li>I was skeptical like most others of trying something new, but these definitely work.</li>
            <li>but I have very fine weak hair, also very long.</li>
            <li>and I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li>I am an African American woman with natural hair.</li>
            <li>I am an African American 20yr old, and my hair was between shoulder and bra length in Febuary.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars so far because it has been only 30 days.</li>
            <li>After bringing the bottle with me to compare vitamin content in the Nioxin pills versus other vitamins, I found that the Centrum daily multivitamin had almost the exact same levels of each and every vitamin found in the Nioxin pills.  </li>
            <li>My skin stays clear as long as I am taking them.</li>
            <li>I am a 31 year old caucasian woman with long blond hair.  </li>
            <li>and then all of a sudden I noticed that I could barely see my scalp--</li>
            <li>Our feedback is apparently the only quality control for Nioxin products.</li>
            <li>Apparently Nioxin has sold out to Proctor Gamble and the supplement has been taken off the market until January 2013 for \\&quot;repackaging\\&quot;; P&amp;G specifically answered my inquiry as such.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m through over half the bottle and so far have seen no results in new hair growth or thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product at the salon and paid a ridiculous price for a 30 day supply in an attempt to grow my hair longer in a shorter period of time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it does work and at the very least, makes your hair much healthier!</li>
            <li>The individual companies that still have the old formula are profiting on the demand, but when the new formula is released the price will go back down because there is not a shortage of the vitamins.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer said it was because the company recalled them due to a health concern &amp; now leftover supply is low but demand is high.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that my hair is growing longer faster so much as I have noticed that I am shedding less hair daily</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair has always been baby fine and thin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking biotin and other hair, skin, nail supplements for years with no real results but the Nioxin is the first product where I&#x27;ve seen a noticible change.</li>
            <li>I did find that nioxin makes your hair and nails grow a little faster and LaBeaute makes your hair grow thicker and stronger, but not as fast as Nioxin but noticeable as well.  </li>
            <li>: I have learned that the price increase is due to this product being discontinued by Nioxin with a \\&quot;new formula\\&quot; slated for release in August.</li>
            <li>I am experiencing some discomfort from the soy complex phytonutrients in the formula, as I am a little sensitive to soy, but the benefits are too important to stop using it.     </li>

            <li> But even my manicurist was really  impressed at how strong my nails were.</li>
            <li> My skin looks good</li>
            <li> This is a good product but take head</li>
            <li> I read that the vitamins were suppose to be good for the nails as well as the hair, and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> My hair does feel good and like something is happening.</li>
            <li> This product maybe good.</li>
            <li> I loved Nioxin when I was taking it.</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using this product because it has a lot of good vitamins</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your skin too.  </li>
            <li> My good friend and hairstylist recommended I try these vitamins</li>
            <li> I plan to keep using this product because it has a lot of good vitamins</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your skin too.</li>
            <li> i have read a lot of good review on this product and decided to try.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any shedding or breakage in my hair, my nails and skin are good too.</li>
            <li> Good product and found that it improved growth in nails and helped with my skin</li>
            <li> Loved the product.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and was the best product for my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Since I am getting good results, I will continue to take it.</li>
            <li> Good deal too.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that good.  </li>
            <li> Optimum Nutrition Opti-Men Multivitamins, 180-Count]]</li>
            <li> even reviews and rating was good...</li>
            <li> Hairomega is good too.</li>
            <li> The product is good been using for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker, more lustrous and healthier, I don&#x27;t think I will ever change products, because you know what they say, once you find a good thing...keep it!</li>
            <li> I thought the original formula worked awesome and to me</li>
            <li> With special references made to Ladies; Laura F. and Cindy (Rachel I) who advised the best steps to take for recourse.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, after 18 days my hair looks better, feels better and stronger.</li>
            <li> Great, the item was mailed fast and in perfect shape!!!</li>
            <li> BECAUSE THE GOOD PEOPLE AT AMAZON WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME A REFUND !</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with the processing time on this transaction and the product is something I will continue to buy.  </li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with performance.</li>
            <li> My hair is very healthy and grows faster.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks great, and I feel super great.</li>
            <li> Considering the price of Biotin supplements, etc, this seems like a much more precise way to try and address hair loss, while being cost efficient via Amazon&#x27;s great price!    </li>
            <li> MY BROWS NEED TOUCH UPS WAY MORE OFTEN!</li>
            <li> I am ordering more Nioxin vitamins today!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Also I have been taking BETTER CARE OF MY HAIR!</li>
            <li> I then ordered 2 more bottles!  </li>
            <li> and I think it looks a bit better!  </li>
            <li> so I purchased 3 more bottles and when I received them ALL the bottles had cracked pills in them!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy!    </li>
            <li> Yesterday my brother in law, sister and  coworker complimented me on how much better my skin looked!</li>
            <li> can\\&quot;t wait to see how much more these pills do!  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering some more soon!</li>
            <li> Bought this product and was surprisingly pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> it has multiplied more than 6 times !</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I recieve so many compliments on how healthy and beautiful my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my own nails for years .. and getting SO many compliments on them over the years!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, please - DO NOT purchase these vitamins thinking they are going to result in amazing hair regrowth and if you do want to take a vitamin for improved skin and hair, go to the store and spend $7 on a bottle of multivitamins vs $40+ or Nioxin.</li>
            <li> and I have nice nails now.  </li>
            <li> Rose Williams</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked all 3 but for the price and amount, I&#x27;m going to stick with this one.</li>
            <li> My hair was kind of thinning in the front</li>
            <li> There is no vitamin smell and was able to get a good price on Amazon for them.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 friends who also use them now having seen my hair, one being my hairdresser who has seen her own improvement in thinning hair at the crown.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say while taking this my hair thickened but just MAINTAINED, didnt grow.  </li>
            <li> AMAZON REALLY HAS THE BEST PRICE FOR THESE.  </li>
            <li> I used to take multivitamins for hair loss however didn&#x27;t find them that effective.</li>
            <li> I now have my own bottle.</li>
            <li> i dont know why there are so many good reviews they did absoultely nothing for my hair skin or nails</li>
            <li> They were a nice hair vitamin.</li>
            <li> super strong!!!</li>
            <li> those with thinning hair, they also have great hair kits with cleansers, conditioners and scalp treatments to ensure the health and quality of the scalp--definitely worth it !</li>
            <li> love, love this product my hair was going so good</li>
            <li> but when I opened the bottle all of the pills were cracked and the smell of them was off (very strong).  </li>
            <li> It is also a very easy pill to swallow.   </li>
            <li> It also grows your nails very strong as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :) LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I tell you Nioxin is the best my hair had completely returned and is fuller that ever.</li>
            <li> &quot; This advice I deviated from out of curiosity for another seemingly more popular product.</li>
            <li> One important note though is that people have told me my complexion looks really good.  </li>
            <li> Was nice to be able to find the product without having to pay salon pricing.  </li>
            <li> One important note though is that people have told me my complexion looks really good.</li>
            <li> she said my hair is around 18 inches at its longest point, and I can honestly say it is healthy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference from using the product, but I know others who have had great success.</li>
            <li> but this supplement has better effective quantities and cost me $10.</li>
            <li> I buy the 90 count bottle because it is way more cost effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot!!! :)</li>
            <li> Also the company deliver the product very quickly!</li>
            <li> She tried many things before but after reading all reviews in internet and taking this medicine, this is the best pdt so far.</li>
            <li> and it has really made a difference in keeping his beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li> Or is it the vendors becoming greedy with a popular product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this product, I&#x27;m writting my first review ever for anything.</li>
            <li> it seems too good to be true, it probably isn&#x27;t\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to continue treatment in order to form a more accurate review.</li>
            <li> One of the best products around, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> In addition, I have always had brittle nails and never been able to grow them out at all as they would always split or break.</li>
            <li> So we both Love these Pills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I kept to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> makes your hair look healthy</li>
            <li> I love, love these vitamins I have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> After the two weeks I thought I noticed a difference but wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> So many people have noticed the difference that I have been taking them for a year now.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s softer and has more shine.</li>
            <li> Give me a couple more months, and I can write a more in depth review.    </li>
            <li> My brother told me about Amazon, so I decided to see if Amazon sold this product and of course they did and the price was great and much lower than JCPenney.</li>
            <li> then you can do it for 3 more months</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I knew I would be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> What better time then now.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t do it any more.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the results.</li>
            <li> Skin is better :)</li>
            <li> But I know for SURE about the nails ..</li>
            <li> I have so many people asking me \\</li>
            <li> The ladies at my church are now taking Nioxin hair vitamins because they love that way my hair looks</li>
            <li> and I am seeing baby hairs and fuller on the top.  </li>
            <li> OK, joke&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li> It is so healthy now.</li>
            <li> so plan on waxing and shaving more often.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d been able to look at the label, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this item.  </li>
            <li> Yay :)</li>
            <li> So, fingers crossed, I&#x27;m hoping to get more results for the hair too.   </li>
            <li> I want to order more thru Amazon</li>
            <li> I think it was beginning to cause more hair to fall out.</li>
            <li> and I will keep buying more :]</li>
            <li> I am finding I have to shave more</li>
            <li> i returned to buy more and could not believe my eyes when i saw the price.</li>
            <li> i am not rockerfeller and this is just way more than i can afford.</li>
            <li> and I feel the product has worked okay for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with hair growth, my issue is with keeping my hair healthy as it grows</li>
            <li> many inches-</li>
            <li> After reading most of the reviews, it would appear that this product effectiveness depends on the severity of your hair loss.</li>
            <li> I also recommend eating more protein.</li>
            <li> May i start out with that this product may not even be authentic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: i will not be purchasing this product again since i have found better and alternative vitamins that give me results</li>
            <li> One more mention, I was also using the Ovation Hair Treatment system which may have contributed to the hair growth.  </li>
            <li> The product is awesome, however I will never order it from this last company that I did because they take forever to send it to you.</li>
            <li> The longer you take it the better the results.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel it was safe to take these</li>
            <li> I love the product and it does work</li>
            <li> I have Nioxin 5 stars, not because it earned it, but because I knew people would be more apped to reading it.</li>
            <li> Because of so many reviews the priced has jumped.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on how my hair looks so healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I will caution that I have had to be more aggressive with the management of my unwanted body hair.  </li>
            <li> IF YOUR LOOKING FOR HAIR GROWTH, AND FOR YOUR HAIR TO LOOK &amp; FEEL HEALTHY, THESE ARE THE PILLS TO GET.</li>
            <li> My skin appears more elastic and moist.  </li>
            <li> Started 9th August 2011: 3 month supply bottle    </li>
            <li> I think the title speaks for itself however, for those of you that need more here</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad she did.</li>
            <li> I love the vitamins andI</li>
            <li> Since I have begun taking the vitamins my hair has gotten thicker, softer,longer,shinier and just all around better.  </li>
            <li> My nails do grow and my hair feels better</li>
            <li> and I have to pluck and wax more often now than what I used to.</li>
            <li> When my 90 count bottle is gone, I&#x27;ll get another one for sure.</li>
            <li> I recommend that they be purchased through Amazon because you get more for your money.</li>
            <li> Two years later I still think their the best thing out there for our hair and nails!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes on top have grown longer.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It also was not as shiny or healthy looking.</li>
            <li> But one thing is for sure, my hair looks better than it has in probably 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> I think I see the results more in my nails though.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll definitely be able to tell once I stop taking them.</li>
            <li> LongHairDon&#x27;tCare. :)</li>
            <li> I love the results I would recommend this product and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> There is no \\&quot;magic</li>
            <li> Like the majority of reviews here, most of the pills are cracked and smell/taste</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li> the more you use the product.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend a healthy diet and water</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for 2 years now and my hair is thicker, my finger nails grow faster.  </li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> I for sure notice my hair&#x27;s texture and quality improve, but my nails is where I have noticed the most.</li>
            <li> I been taking this product for about 6 months, Im really satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Nioxin helped renew the strands of my hair so that they were stronger and more durable.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments about my hair, sometimes people think its a wig.  </li>
            <li> I regret buying this supplement, and even more so, regret that I opened them.</li>
            <li> the better than this is a wig or plant hair,</li>
            <li> My dermatologist prescribed excellent tropical ointments that cured the eczema, and the hair grew back.  </li>
            <li> Im glad I found these vitamins, because others claim they work but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have 2 more months on my 90 day supply and will be order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it and keep my hair when it belongs.</li>
            <li> she is a hairstylist and said she recommends this to most of her clients.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews appear to be from women, but guys should check this stuff out too.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have NEVER written a review for ANYTHING I have bought online, but I just have to for this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> she had a lot more hair-</li>
            <li> but I have more hair coverage--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly pleased with the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> So just know you will have to shave more often.</li>
            <li> just glad I found something that lives up to their claim.</li>
            <li> Just beware of what your buying be safe people.</li>
            <li> After dealing with more fall out to where I could see my scalp, I decided to look into Nioxin and found it on here.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought it and gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> Perhaps more time is needed to see results for me.</li>
            <li> Most online stores do not carry it anymore.</li>
            <li> but you could go to the drugstore, spend $10-$15 and get SO much more for your money.</li>
            <li> and/or some more Biotin if you like...</li>
            <li> Healthy &amp; growth are the results.</li>
            <li> BUT i started to look for something better</li>
            <li> It worked wonders for her but didn&#x27;t do a thing for me that I was able to discern.  </li>
            <li> If you like the retail results you love the shrinking price of buying on line.</li>
            <li> My hair is very healthy and full of elasticity.</li>
            <li> I really love it.  </li>
            <li> so I pay no shipping on many products.</li>
            <li> Now the price is $149 or more?  </li>
            <li> oledas hair pills way better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used these vitamins for about 6 months and love them.  </li>
            <li> I went to get more of the vitamin to find out</li>
            <li> and then you could not buy it any more</li>
            <li> You would be better off buying some saw palmetto and biotin.</li>
            <li> at first i thought this was not because of this product because i have read so many good review in here.</li>
            <li> Great results highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> i really wish people can be HONEST!.</li>
            <li> I was using Phyto at first for stronger hair and nails, before switching to Nioxin after reading all of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see my nails grow, but hair started  THINNING OUT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these vitamins are good for you, having said that, unless they are putting some kind of magical substance in them that requires the cost to be many times greater than any other hair</li>
            <li> Great results so far.</li>
            <li> Sooooo, in any case, so far it seems like a great deal.  </li>
            <li> So Far EveryThing has been great with this product</li>
            <li> So far everthing is great</li>
            <li> More importantly I bought these to grow out my hair which is relaxed and colored.</li>
            <li> Please keep the price fair and reasonable.</li>
            <li> Do yourselves a favor folks and buy a good multi-vitamin until Nioxin sets the suggested retail price at a reasonable level.  </li>
            <li> A real shame because the products were quite good, but P&amp;G will probably change them at some point too.</li>
            <li> And my hair is so soft and healthy!!  </li>
            <li> I now have actual nails that have never looked so good, I&#x27;m amazed!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other biotin supplements (like the ones from the health sections in target and costco), but I would say these have worked the best for me.  </li>
            <li> Asked for a full refund!</li>
            <li> They have been growing way faster and don&#x27;t break quite as easily as they used to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the money; If you&#x27;re hesitant about ordering on Amazon (make sure sealed and cotton inside) go to Nioxin and find a certified salon :)</li>
            <li> Amazon makes it easy to buy on line.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble.</li>
            <li> I  strongly doubt I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Do not have any strong smell.</li>
            <li> like they used to; they are strong.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that my nails, which have always tended to chip, are quite strong.</li>
            <li> I found this product as a great investment, if you really want your hair and nails to grow fast, thats what you will get for sure...    </li>
            <li> I have used many hair growth vitamins in my day (Phyto, GMC etc) and none hve made my hair grow so well, and it&#x27;s soo shiny and full of life.</li>
            <li> Skin has a nice glow to it, looks vibrant and healthy.</li>
            <li> (my nails were already fine).  </li>
            <li> While I am taking it, I see fine peach fuzz and baby hairs all around by face, but that is it.  </li>
            <li> With minoxidil 15%, i think it works fine,</li>
            <li> I also bought the Nioxin Maintenance Kit, System 2 hair treatment for fine, untreated, &amp; noticeably thinning hair.</li>
            <li> My hair grows fine</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy and shinny and is very pretty.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are growing out much faster, so I have to get them waxed more often now!</li>
            <li> Considering how many people have posted positive reviews of the product, it may well be that the magic is in the herbs.  </li>
            <li> Face appeared to breakout a little even though i dont have the best skin...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve not noticed a huge difference there,</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, and can see a HUGE difference in the strength of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Best Regards,  Consumer and Professional Services  P&amp;G Professional Care</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase, my nails are stronger like my hair, and I have grown up without bursting and that surprises me because I had some very fragile.</li>
            <li> After taking the entire bottle, I have to say that my hair is a great deal thicker than it was.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that you only need to take it once a day, too!  </li>
            <li> and then my hair dresser confirmed my suspicions and made a comment about how my hair seemed thinner.  </li>
            <li> and they have been absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t say 100% that the bald spot filled in, my hair has been growing like a weed, covering any patches.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try Amazon to see if the product, which are vitamins for hair, skin, and nails, was available.  </li>
            <li> I bought the product primarily to help grow my fingernails</li>
            <li> liked the product, but I don&#x27;t like it that much.</li>
            <li> like they worked very well and effective at preventing with hair loss.</li>
            <li> 3,000 Biotin...feel free to buy some MSM 1000mg</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Maxi Hair until the formula is available.  </li>
            <li> It will not be available again  until sometime around January of 2013.</li>
            <li> If you see results and it&#x27;s worth it to you then more power to you.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> But so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I thought the product was excellent, but now it is time to switch to something with similar ingredients that is available at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Be aware yo do not want to lose your hair!!</li>
            <li> and I come back to buy more and the price has increased from 30dollars to 119!?!?</li>
            <li> Three months treatment and my hair is growing so fast!!!  </li>
            <li> Check your local salons, most franchised ones sell them for about $20 to $30!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the progress so far!</li>
            <li> product really works and has excellent components, but what happened with the price?&lt;br /&gt;It used to be less than US$ 50 and now is selling for more than US$ 170??&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I cannot say much about my nails because I have always had very strong nails.  </li>
            <li> Had had thinning on the top of my head for years and now have new growth and the texture is also better</li>
            <li> and already I see significant growth in my hair along with a healthier look.  </li>
            <li> First of all, my nails have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> My skin is significantly softer.</li>
            <li> I say this product is worth a try!</li>
            <li> The investment made for me to purchase my items are unique, in that my purchases are delivered to me beyond the US borders.</li>
            <li> I must always prepare to add an additional 20% - 70% to the value of the original price of the goods purchase.   </li>
            <li> So I called Nioxin&#x27;s 1-800 number to ask them about it, but they wouldn&#x27;t give me a straightforward answer, since amazon is not an authorized salon reseller.  </li>
            <li> Well after using the 90 day pack, I saw a significant increase with the length and volume of my hair and my edges grew in dramatically.</li>
            <li> I was so excited.</li>
            <li> First of all,all of my tablets are cracked and beat up!what&#x27;s up with that?Then to top it off</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it for my skin but discovered it made my hair grow stronger and thicker</li>
            <li> I purchased this (several bottles) as I thought it would be effective in hair growth (because of all these reviews!)</li>
            <li> I have really strong, healthy nails and decent skin</li>
            <li> Even though I didn&#x27;t get super fast hair growth I have retained more hair and have strong nails.</li>
            <li> i believe that most of these positive reviews were made buy people who have an interest in promoting this product.</li>
            <li> I stressed myself into hair loss right before midterms!</li>
            <li> The bald spot is mostly gone and the rest of my head is full and growing fast.</li>
            <li> No hairbrush full of hair after even the gentle-est hairbrushing.</li>
            <li> It only took a week of losing my gorgeous locks for me to RUN to my doctor.</li>
            <li> Now that the underlying cause of my hair loss is addressed I have found all nioxin products to be absolutely true to their word.</li>
            <li> Shiny and full of life.</li>
            <li> This product really does work, I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Oh and it also has helped my fingernails to come in stronger and more quickly, it really helped to repair them after I removed my acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> This product so far has kind of lessen the amount of hair that is falling out.  </li>
            <li> when i wake up every morning i see my pillow is full of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair grew about twice as fast, and I saw more growth after 3 months.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, this supplement does benefit all three.</li>
            <li> I can only hope it will be just as good as it was and not way overpriced.</li>
            <li> and then my skin looks much better and my nails are getting much thicker</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s true, on this basis alone I don&#x27;t think I could ever use or recommend a product with the Nioxin name.   </li>
            <li> My hair became extremely full again - all over.</li>
            <li> Biotin, which also works, will be good enough a supplement from now on.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t even seen any results but thought it would be good to take a daily vitamin and one that would help my hair, skin, and nails as well.</li>
            <li> Within 2-3 weeks of taking one tablet daily, as recommended, I&#x27;ve grown a full set of long, strong beautiful nails!</li>
            <li> The first one was fine</li>
            <li> I did not expect such impressive results - especially in so short a time.</li>
            <li> I have taken these vitamins for several years and have gotten compliments on my hair looking better, which is what I was taking the vitamins for, more biotin in them.  </li>
            <li> I found this product worthy of using.</li>
            <li> I think that the difference is that I am able to retain more hair, especially the ends.</li>
            <li> I can say that my skin which is mildly acne prone has shown some improvement in terms of texture already.</li>
            <li> But the main reason I am in love with Nioxin is solely based on what it has done to my hair.</li>
            <li> Something I&#x27;m taking helped tremendously</li>
            <li> the S&amp;C. So have I noticed any super significance in hair growths?</li>
            <li> and my hair growth is tremendous.</li>
            <li> This supplement has improve my hair conditions tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Just received this product today, and the shipment was quick and on time, so</li>
            <li> The bottle was damaged during shipping (cap cracked, but luckily safety seal was intact).</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending so quickly.</li>
            <li> i was dying my hair to super blond for years, and i decided to stop killing them, cause they started to look like a floor mop after all,the day i decided to do that</li>
            <li> I LOVE NIOXIN, and would recommend it highly,  JH  Arkansas</li>
            <li> DO not except huge results off the first bottle.</li>
            <li> After taking Nioxin for about a month, the hair began to grow in where I was becoming very bald.  </li>
            <li> Let me first state that the shipper is super fast!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have very fine naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I didnt get the full results I wanted to get but who does right.</li>
            <li> I love them so much that I am leaving my first ever product review.</li>
            <li> I purchased my second supply of this product, which I LOVED the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back for more!  </li>
            <li> Even though my multi-vitamin had the same ingredients, this worked so much better!</li>
            <li> This is an increase of about 3 inches since I first started using them!</li>
            <li> Okay so I waited until I completed 2 months of taking this product to write my review because I wanted it to be as accurate as possible.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> So for the price, this is worth it, since they both contain the 90 pills.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about 6 years now, and my hair has NEVER been this shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since January, and I must say that it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I am just a young man who noticed that I was thinning on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m AA with natural coily healthy hair that wanted to grow my hair faster</li>
            <li> , this is about the time that the nice extra hair you had during pregnancy, starts to fall out.  </li>
            <li> Despite that -- Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the try</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a wonder vitamin, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been falling out and I was starting to get worried and need an effective product to stop it.</li>
            <li> Its the 3rd purchase its not as effective  as it worked 1st time</li>
            <li> I am glad to put up with an even thicker mane to have clear skin.</li>
            <li> It takes about 3 months to work but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth trying.</li>
            <li> For a more detailed discussion of the problems with \\&quot;natural supplements,\\&quot;  Consumer Reports recently published an article about the dangers of many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients.</li>
            <li> but they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> but, I told her only that her hair looked nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural most of the time</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is committed to delivering  innovation behind best in class product performance.</li>
            <li> by the end of the first month everything seems to have stabilized and not growing so quickly, but my nails are stronger and my hair is fuller and stronger and i&#x27;ve ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I also use the shampoo and the Therapy and I am growing new hair, I recommended this to some friends and they are using it too and also growing new hair.</li>
            <li> Originally my stylist recommended it to me to help with that original sighting of thinning at the top center (or crown) of the head.</li>
            <li> and if they do grow, they just tear right off.  </li>
            <li> It took me right about two months to see the results.</li>
            <li> and she noticed the difference right away.  </li>
            <li> bummer right?</li>
            <li> Do not expect to notice changes right away, things take time.</li>
            <li> so new growth can be seen easily in my hair.</li>
            <li> Also does a great job to strengthen my nails and have few breakouts on my face if I take them consistently.</li>
            <li> You will be able to see your hair&#x27;s full length potential with this product.</li>
            <li> But its worth it for me to have thick beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I also had one to three very large zits at all times.</li>
            <li> so you can get super potent biotin at walmart or here for WAY cheaper and it does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went off this pill when I was pregnant, because my prenatal vitamins had many of the same nutrients.</li>
            <li> Noticing great growth--I already have super thick hair</li>
            <li> I lost my hair due to chemo theraphy and as it began to sprout new hair, I had a beautiful little male pattern baldness spot right in front on top of my head!!!</li>
            <li> I called Nioxin&#x27;s 1-800 number on the bottle to report this apparent quality issue and to ask if the cracked caplets were safe.</li>
            <li> My skin is beautiful and my hair is thick, but the biggest difference came to my lips and face &amp; hair thickness VS speed of hair growth-</li>
            <li> Ordered it based on exceptional reviews here and on other sites.</li>
            <li> Also, my eyebrows are growing quickly too, much fuller</li>
            <li> The vitamins are reasonably priced on Amazon &amp; the shipping is fast &amp; free.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot less hair loss after using this my skin looked good as well.</li>
            <li> My husband is a hairderesser and customers have come back with great response, especially if they have problems with thinning hair .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously purchased from amazon 4 bottles 90 caps for 25$ per bottle, I loved the product i was using it together with biotin and minoxidil, i came here to place another order</li>
            <li> Since I really cant say if it works just yet I can say that the size of the pill is about the normal size of a multi-vitamin, however the shape makes it easy for swallowing(and</li>
            <li> I like the product very much, I used to get a lot of split nails</li>
            <li> I have very VERY brittle nails</li>
            <li> Also, my fingernails are growing very, very fast.   </li>
            <li> AND IT MADE IT GROW VERY FAST.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed her hair coverage was very much improved after about 2 weeks-</li>
            <li> Really didnt notice any amazing hair growth my thinning hair line may have filled in slightly, but</li>
            <li> I do know Nioxin is a good product and their other products do really work.  </li>
            <li> The first time I started using Nioxin, I thought I was going to lose all my hair since the shedding of hair increased very much in the first one or two weeks.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product for hair growth, but this works much better with a good diet, plenty of water, a little scalp massage for 3 to 5 minutes a few times a week; you can do the scalp massage without the oils because this helps with blood circulation of the scalp in the thinning areas.</li>
            <li> l plan to continue buying this product through Amazon as it is MUCH cheaper and definitely worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> (First time in years).  </li>
            <li> ; stay consistent.</li>
            <li> I at first didnt see the point in getting this since my multi-vitamin had everything this had.</li>
            <li> My first purchase was from JCPenney.</li>
            <li> Nothing happened at first.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to drink enough water with them and eat something as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was REALLY worried about my nails!  </li>
            <li> So I am a first year law student, and lo and behold</li>
            <li> I first purchased these pills a couple of months ago and the pills were cracked.</li>
            <li> I am able to style it in different ways now that it is thicker.</li>
            <li> You will notice a difference within the first bottle (90 days).</li>
            <li> First off let me state that I&#x27;m not basing this review on the performance of the supplement, since I haven&#x27;t taken it yet and in any case, my opinion would be subjective  </li>
            <li> In Febuary when I first purchased these vitamins, I was bald in the front of my head...</li>
            <li> This is my first review on amazon.</li>
            <li> These pills are definitely working for me, my hair feels more course.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just about to finish my first 90 count bottle and must say there was definitely even more hair growth taking the supplement.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie and say my hair is like it was 10 years ago, but my receding hairline filled in some and my vertex bald spot shrunk considerably.  </li>
            <li> So Nioxin promised the same and even better results and</li>
            <li> Sure enough when I opened my package</li>
            <li> Two to Three months ago the cost was only like $25-30 at the most.</li>
            <li> I hope to regain my hair thickness by taking a biotin supplement, which I probably should done in the first place instead of these overpriced vitamins.</li>
            <li> I just had a baby 5 months ago and from what I remember from my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> I spoke to one of my girlfriends who I knew had lost a ton of her hair after having her first baby (I have no children).  </li>
            <li> I ordered my first bottle about 7 months ago.  </li>
            <li> I took 2 pills a day at first (even though the recommended dose is 1 pill a day)</li>
            <li> Most women take care of all this pretty regularly anyway.  </li>
            <li> ps I had someone at work refer to me as Rapunzel last week!!! :)</li>
            <li> i had no any problem when i took the first 30 count.</li>
            <li> This has made my hair so much healthier!  </li>
            <li> but I have had the same problem for many years</li>
            <li> I just finished my first 30 day bottle of the Nioxin pills..</li>
            <li> these vitamins had WAY more of the exact same vitamins provided by each Nioxin</li>
            <li> I do know I saw better results with my nails  by using knox gelatin daily.  </li>
            <li> : Broke me out for the first week</li>
            <li> really helps the hair to grow faster!</li>
            <li> In 2 months all of his hair grow back and more then he had before.</li>
            <li> These vitamins really do what they are supposed to do!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is much thicker!</li>
            <li> Have I been a poster child and been consistent?</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> As with any product a person uses this will take time, requires consistent use to see results.</li>
            <li> Be patient and be consistent.</li>
            <li> and i will post  an update to really finalize this review!</li>
            <li> They really do work!</li>
            <li> I saw hair growth after the first month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was because of Nioxin because I was doing nothing else different.</li>
            <li> Now I check the 1 star reviews first.</li>
            <li> funny (which means they are defective/old).</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s the price to pay for a product that really works!</li>
            <li> The most disconcerting is probably Bladderwrack, a seaweed that is considered \\&quot;possibly unsafe\\&quot; for consumption.</li>
            <li> Since supplements are unregulated in the U.S., it&#x27;s quite possible that these pills may contain more than you&#x27;re bargaining for.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m typically pretty skeptical :D</li>
            <li> if u take it consistently you will see results</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this product if you want your hair to be in better condition than it is now.</li>
            <li> Oh, &amp; also, my nails are growing extremely fast as well!</li>
            <li> and I actually feel like my hair has thinned more since I&#x27;ve been using this</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It appears that this is exactly what Amazon is doing with this product.   </li>
            <li> Interesting - when I purchased this several months ago the cost was around $30.  </li>
            <li> First off...</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to address reviews complaining of \\&quot;cracked\\&quot; pills and Nioxin&#x27;s quality control (or lack thereof).</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t take the tablets consistently for 90 days.  </li>
            <li> this was a purchase for a gift of a friend of mine and is exactly what she wanted , thank you</li>
            <li> and when I got low and went to buy more I saw that the price had gone up about 3 times that.</li>
            <li> But for that much money I need a miracle!</li>
            <li> You are spending $200 TOO MUCH!</li>
            <li> but 3 months of taking it now, and nothing, even my hair is still falling at the same rate or more.</li>
            <li> The product was sent quickly and received in new condition.  </li>
            <li> I myself do not like the taste of the supplement it has a kind of bitter after taste to it, but, I have found that it makes my nails grow two times as fast.</li>
            <li> I am now on my second bottle because the difference Nioxin has made really shows, but from time to time, I still lose more hair than I wish I did.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different shampoos and products to help my hair grow and this supplement really does work.</li>
            <li> Much to my amazement, I was able to buy two 90 days supply bottles for around the same price as I would have paid for two 30 days bottles.  </li>
            <li> A healthy diet consisting of vegetables, fruit and whole grain will improve the body&#x27;s overall health too.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much, hope to order from you very soon.</li>
            <li> I have a pixie bob right now, and my New Years resolution is to just let my hair GROW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing positive results.</li>
            <li> Also, you need to make sure that there are no bigger medical issues to see huge results with this that contribute to hair loss.</li>
            <li> By the time I finished the first 90 day bottle, I could see that my nails were much stronger.  </li>
            <li> My hair grows pretty fast; now that I&#x27;m taking the supplements my hair is growing even faster.  </li>
            <li> Like, they&#x27;d get really long and 4-5 of them would fall out at the end of the day to make room for more.</li>
            <li> The one thing I do notice is that my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be falling out as much as with my first pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I also notice my nails feel stronger and are growing pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> I used them consistently for months, and they really work well.  </li>
            <li> So after making some research, I bought my first bottle of Biotin 5000 mcg and after two weeks, I am amazed with how much stronger my hair has gotten.</li>
            <li> I have read almost all of these reviews posted here on Amazon prior to purchasing mainly to gain insight on what most people thought about them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teen guy who made the mistake of getting my teen-heartthrob-esque bangs all cut off, and started to regret that decision pretty quick!</li>
            <li> It really depends on why you lost your hair and what type or hair you have in the first place to see certain results.</li>
            <li> I started taking the vitamins a month and half ago and the results have been amazing.  </li>
            <li> Found a nice product that works just as well and about 75% less too.</li>
            <li> There are no dramatic results</li>
            <li> So I cannot really be certain it works.  </li>
            <li> Nioxin is NOT a gene in a bottle, if a certain hair type or length doesn&#x27;t run in your family don&#x27;t expect to get it.</li>
            <li> I contacted Nioxin and was told that they are making a new formula (hope it is the same or better)</li>
            <li> I use the nioxin pills which are awesome with pure biotin and vitamin E pills and my hair is super thick and has grew a little since I started this regimen.</li>
            <li> Another website said it&#x27;s being reformulated &amp; repackaged  &amp; will be available in the fall &amp; that the leftover supply is safe .Anyhow when I ran out &amp; saw the price increase &amp; heard about the possible health scare &amp; reformulation delay I switched to HAIROMEGA DHT (available at Amazon) which works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> My natural part also became super wide, and I  had what looked like a bald spot on the top of my head.      </li>
            <li> I also have noticed that not only has my hair on my head and eyelashes grown, all the fine hair on my arms and legs have lengthened.</li>
            <li> I would be fine if they actually worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pills are relatively small and do not have much smell compared to many other vitamins, which is good.</li>
            <li> Her hair is now very long, thick and beautiful and it is super shiny.  </li>
            <li> This surprises me, because Biotin is usually such a huge factor in hair loss treatments.  </li>
            <li> My skin does seem a bit healthier, but then again I&#x27;ve always had nice healthy skin, with the exception of the random pimples I would get, but I haven&#x27;t had one for a while, so it could be the Nioxin?</li>
            <li> Well my wife and I really believe these Pills Help.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that.  </li>
            <li> it changed my menstral flow, made it very short and light  </li>
            <li> but it must be hormonal, maybe it had something to do with me crushing the tablets too big for me to swallow,  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product as well as the company that sells it!</li>
            <li> and I did notice my eyelashes looked fuller today, which is ironic since I wore brown mascara today.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell much difference in my hair yet, but I am going to give the Nioxin products 1 year before making up my mind.  </li>
            <li> After the pills really got into my system (after 2 weeks maybe), my hair was growing faster EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> So I really can&#x27;t judge if it is working.</li>
            <li> and/or how the pills are made because my pills which I purchased from an authorized vender very also cracked</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t really notice anything yet.</li>
            <li> Yes, absolutely.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading</li>
            <li> As a side note, regrowing my beard happened much quicker this time around while on this product.  </li>
            <li> but the price is to much a friend told me u can get them in walmart hair salon</li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes grew REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li> After using for about three weeks, I noticed that when I washed my hair, it wasn&#x27;t falling out as much.  </li>
            <li> the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> Absolutely.  </li>
            <li> and I can really tell a difference in the reduction of losing hair</li>
            <li> AND EVERYONE IMMEDIATELY STARTED NOTICING HOW FAST MY HAIR WAS GROWING.</li>
            <li> THESE PILLS WORK FAST</li>
            <li> BUT NIOXIN REALLY DOES WORK.</li>
            <li> At about 25 or 26 cents per table, this product is very affordable...</li>
            <li> I think that after finishing up the 90 day bottle, the real difference will be seen.</li>
            <li> I am very optimistic about this product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed a real growth spurt.</li>
            <li> This product works really well for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing really well.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t make a statement about my skin.</li>
            <li> When I stopped taking it, my hair grew an inch but got much much thinner.  </li>
            <li> Within two weeks I had to cut them because they were growing so fast.</li>
            <li> Will order again very soon.  </li>
            <li> Ships fast.</li>
            <li> Three months is probably when you will really start noticing a difference.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY DID WORK.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice my hair or skin improve.</li>
            <li> My hair thins on the side when I get stressed and I have really kinky hair.</li>
            <li> If your struggling with losing to much hair every time you brush this will help.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for hair growth, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> My pills have been coming cracked also and some people have been really  complaining about it.  </li>
            <li> I think this product really works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any real skin issues so no noticable change there.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing much thicker and faster now that I am taking this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t finish the whole bottle after a week of taking it</li>
            <li> they work really well for her</li>
            <li> I have found that this product really works.</li>
            <li> It really should be under $125 but lets hope it gets there soon.</li>
            <li> my nail tech told me that I could get them much cheaper online.</li>
            <li> Looks like a lot of people really like this product, but this one isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> Since all of these ingredients are listed as a proprietary blend, you don&#x27;t know how much of each you&#x27;re taking.</li>
            <li> It really works, but they stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> The niacin caused me to have so much pain in my breast that I went to the doctor thinking I was getting inflammatory breast cancer again</li>
            <li> And it worked very well.</li>
            <li> In my opinion,this product does work very well for me, and I will continue to purchase it.   </li>
            <li> Price of product has really gone up...</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems to grow so much faster.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that I notice much difference on my hair just yet.  </li>
            <li> My skin has become so much clearer since taking the vitamins.</li>
            <li> It takes I&#x27;d say about a month to notice changes, but it really worked.</li>
            <li> Received these from Amazon, and the vitamins are cracked and very \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so end up throw a way the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> This one really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will correct baldness, it is really a vitamin that helps fullness when you still have your hair.</li>
            <li> i took them for 3 months straight and no improvement</li>
            <li> Now it is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> a 29 year old male and my hair was thinning on the top.</li>
            <li> It worked for the top middle section of my scalp but did not see any effects yet for the hair near to forehead.</li>
            <li> I am not sure exactly why amazon, ebay ect... upped the price so high on these pills (must be cause they were selling out so fast) but you should be able to spend $20 for a 30 count bottle!</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have a new head of hair, really!</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t see significant results by the time I&#x27;m halfway through my 2nd bottle</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews mentioned - my pills were all cracked.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews declared that these vitamins made their hair grow significantly faster and for me that simply wasn&#x27;t the case.  </li>
            <li> Other hairs on my body have also grown more than usuall.</li>
            <li> (I guess that much is pretty natural) hair loss!</li>
            <li> (I bought it for $23 + shipping in January) when there are so many other working products on the market now.</li>
            <li> but since I was taking so many other vitamins, I thought I wouldn&#x27;t notice.  </li>
            <li> I am sure these were imitation pills since they appeared to be falling apart and had no effect on me</li>
            <li> Up until the last year, my hair had alway been thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The new product (with a  reformulation) is targeted to be available in the next 6-9 months.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t verify for certain that this is because of the Nioxin supplement, since I also started taking supplements for Thyroid at the same time, but I&#x27;m convinced enough to buy more and raise my review up to 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I guess it is good, but I only have taken half the bottle.</li>
            <li> Nails are growing healthy and strong, they used to be paper thin and flimsy.</li>
            <li> But I guess I need to take the entire bottle before I can give you the true results.</li>
            <li> (biting them doesn&#x27;t help either :P) and rather thin hair.</li>
            <li> I do have some loss, but no where near what it was like the first time.</li>
            <li> This is a product that turns out to contain exactly the same vitamins and minerals that are available in ANY standard multi-vitamin tablet, with the only difference being that most multi-vitamin tablets contain significantly higher doses of those same ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can put almost anything in a professional looking bottle, charge a pretty penny</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m natural 4a fine hair strands but lots of strands if you want to know my hair type hair texture is coarse.</li>
            <li> My hair is shinier and I am even growing new hairs on my scalp!  </li>
            <li> I noticed after 3 months new lashes were growing and filling in the spaces!</li>
            <li> Hey, I have a new job!</li>
            <li> I have been doing high protein diets and it&#x27;s taking its toll on my hair by making my fine hair dry and breakable.</li>
            <li> Overall our hair has grown or nails are hard and our skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Less hair on my brush, more hair on my head.</li>
            <li> Now I see less falling and more strength hair in the shower, in the bed and while combing.     </li>
            <li> Hopefully this product helps promote hair growth since that was the main reason I perchased it to begin with.</li>
            <li> When I was using Phyto my nails grew so quickly, and my hair felt thicker, so I will be going back to that brand.</li>
            <li> I was loosing clumps in the shower and on top of that I have a skin disease that is dandruff on steroids, and had low iron, so I had a double dose of hair loss.  </li>
            <li> Actually it seems fewer strands are falling out than ever for me, super stocked about it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a decent amount of growth.</li>
            <li> I am approaching my last 30 days on this bottle and will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> main intent of purchasing these vitamins was to go along with their shampoo and conditioner systems for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> I used it for ninety days, and it seems to work better when I massaged my scalp and used it along with essential oils such as jojoba, tea tree and lavender.     </li>
            <li> Item can still be found in some retail stores at regular price if you act quickly before their stock runs out.</li>
            <li> During the time I was pregnant and off Nioxin pills, my acne came back.</li>
            <li> Until 2 months back, I used to have tremendous hair fall.</li>
            <li> Since this product hasn&#x27;t been manufactured for awhile, I just wanted to mention that I reviewed the ingredients and found that the main difference between it and the vitamins I was taking already was biotin.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen great result as my hair growth was slow prior to the use of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a really good supplement, my nails are growing and my skin is glowing not to mention my hair is thick and lush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken 2 years for my hair to stop producing that rough \\&quot;scab hair\\&quot;that comes in after years of perms due to damage to follicles, regain its original texture, &amp; become healthy again.</li>
            <li> If you have a super walmart and there is a salon inside they normally caring them for the low price!</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend Nioxin</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> would recommend them highly to anyone looking to have the healthiest hair of their lives.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone for use.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> SOOOOOO if you&#x27;re looking for something to help your hair growth I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I wanted to give you a high review but not now.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with my first (90 count) bottle and have TONS of new growth and my fall out has decreased tremendously!!!</li>
            <li> I wish the results were a little better, but I&#x27;m hoping over time I will see thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I have lost a lot of hair over the past year due to different medications I have been on, within three months my hair was looking great with this product!</li>
            <li> Her nails grow strong and dont brake as much and her hair sheds less when she brushs it.</li>
            <li> The first benefit I noticed was to my skin, which suddenly became (much) softer--in the middle of winter, when I take very hot showers.</li>
            <li> These vitamins make my nails hard and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> By four weeks my natural hair had grown so much</li>
            <li> I like Nioxin Intensive therapy recharging complex because it really helps keep my hair healthy, and stops it from falling out so much.  </li>
            <li> I was transitioning to natural and this product really helped my hair growth.</li>
            <li> this product slowed my hair loss to a normal pace in just 2 weeks</li>
            <li> But have I noticed a change in the normal growth of my hair?</li>
            <li> My nails are more firm.</li>
            <li> I have just decided that the next bottle I take, I will be consistent so that I may see what kinda results I can really yield.</li>
            <li> all the moms i knew said the hair loss was normal</li>
            <li> but still i want to continue for few more tabs</li>
            <li> My hair grows a lot faster than it normally would.</li>
            <li> Well, I wanted to start using these again because when I used to take them, my hair was so soft and full and just luxurious, I always received compliments on my hair and it actually helped my complextion too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks....  </li>
            <li> especially since I&#x27;ve already taken almost a month worth.  </li>
            <li> I plan to complete the second bottle, maybe it takes a full 6 months.</li>
            <li> Not only have the bare spots shown significant improvement, my hair is growing.</li>
            <li> i bought these vitamins and cut my hair super long, and stopped coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;when</li>
            <li> Overall Nioxin products are effective but a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the 90 day supply and this will continue to be my new multi-vitamin.</li>
            <li> I have new hair growth along my temples and throughout my scalp.  </li>
            <li> and she said I have new hair growth everywhere.  </li>
            <li> It did make my hair seem healthier, but I did not grow any new hair</li>
            <li> I ordred a new bottle of this product and the pills arrived cracaked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for three months and see new growth around my hairline.</li>
            <li> With a new sulfate-free shampoo and my nioxin I hope to see a difference soon.</li>
            <li> after 30 days of using the Nioxin vitamins I noticed new hair growth along my hair line.</li>
            <li> I can not find a lot of new hair</li>
            <li> and I live in the DMV.</li>
            <li> I am black so my hair is easily damaged.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 90 count Nioxin vitamins and took almost a month worth of vitamins until I got towards the middle of the bottle to recognize the vitamins were old, cracked, brittle and falling apart when I rubbed my finger across them.  </li>
            <li> The supplements were just old because they lacked the smell of fresh vitamins ALONG WITH the notion that they were starting to crack.  </li>
            <li> I bought this particular hair, skin, and nail supplement above the others because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair is also growing very fast, which I did not buy the product for because I like wearing my hair short, but I wanted the fullness, now I have it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with fine 4a/b hair &amp; have gone natural after over 20 years of curly perms.</li>
            <li> Within weeks my hair was definitely thicker and after finishing the first bottle there was new hair growth.</li>
            <li> As of right now I do not really notice too much of a difference in my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised!</li>
            <li> I never really expected it to grow that much.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> If you do give the Nioxin vitamins a try, be aware that you may want to supplement it with Biotin (and possibly Zinc as well).    </li>
            <li> I went to the dermatologist and he gave me a topical solution, but what really worked was these vitamins!  </li>
            <li> It may have kept my hair healthy, but compared to other vitamins I&#x27;ve taken, this had low</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s worth a shot to anyone out there who has noticed more of their hair jumping ship lately, and especially if you&#x27;re just beginning to bald.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to horsetail which is usually an ingredient in most hair vitamins</li>
            <li> So out of caution, I contacted amazon and had them send me a replacement bottle (I thought the original bottle might have had cracked pills due to improper packaging).  </li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t broke so it didn&#x27;t need to be fixed!</li>
            <li> I noticed how my hair and nails got stronger during the first month and after the second month, I started growing some hair again.</li>
            <li> WOW does this stuff work!</li>
            <li> Based on my dilemma my case was assessed and a full refund granted minus (understandably) Customs charges.  </li>
            <li> I am about to order this product for the 8th time and swear by these little pills for rapid strong hair &amp; nail growth.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered the Nioxon Recharging Complex from Amazon (three months ago), everything was fine.</li>
            <li> Cloned \\&quot;grey market\\&quot; products of dubious quality from Asia and the Middle East can easily find their way to large distributors who then market the discounted \\&quot;brand-name\\&quot; product to online sellers including eBay and possibly Amazon.</li>
            <li> The first improvement I always notice is in my skin (which takes on a buttery soft, moisturized feel - which makes my skin look younger).  </li>
            <li> I first heard about this from my hairdresser, but it was kind of expensive</li>
            <li> I would like to address the price because I was initially in shock over the price, but remember certain companies realize that the Nioxin has stop making the old formula and will not come out with the new formula until Jan 2013.</li>
            <li> I will not buy from this seller again, because I am sure that the seller read all of the negative reviews about the cracks in the tablets, therefore they should have pull their expired stock from the shelves and replaced them with a new batch.</li>
            <li> But this certainly didn&#x27;t hurt matters, and at the low cost for a three month supply on subscription costing 7.00 a month what do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve seen my hair growth go from 1/3 and 1/4 inches certain areas a month to 1/2 and 1/3 of an inch in the same areas.</li>
            <li> but because this is a supplement it is taking a little longer and will be available again in 6 to 9 months.</li>
            <li> Apparently they want to take advantage of the popularity this product is enjoying but is defintely not worth the price, DON&#x27;T BUY IT FOR THIS PRICE, SAVE YOUR MONEY !!</li>
            <li> Seriously, they are actually growing and are growing fast and strong!</li>
            <li> As far as hair growth, my hair has never had an issue with growth; it actually grows quite fast.</li>
            <li> Clearly P&amp;G doesn&#x27;t care about brand loyalty.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and have been taking them for about a month so far</li>
            <li> I want to wait until the entire packet is done before I can make a real judgement call on this product.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hair considerably for her hair growth, and it&#x27;s even helped her during her menstrual cycle.</li>
            <li> Soon after that I developed breast cancer and went through surgery, Chemo, and Radiation treatments.  </li>
            <li> The first two months I didnt notice much of a change seeing as I chopped my long hair to shoulder and then later got a pixie cut.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is too early to tell if it works or not.  </li>
            <li> AND ALL OF THE ORDERS HAVE BEEN OLD.</li>
            <li> ALL OF THESE PILLS ARE OLD AND DEFECTIVE.</li>
            <li> As far as healthier skin - the jury is still out.</li>
            <li> Wild Yam Root  Sarsaparilla  </li>
            <li> Been taking them every day and WOW</li>
            <li> because that&#x27;s what acrylics do to your natural nails, damages them.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of vitamins from COSTSELL which turns out to be old and out of date.  </li>
            <li> According the Nioxin, if your pills are cracked, they are old.  </li>
            <li> at the third week my legs were really itchy</li>
            <li> For 90 days straight, I took the pills and massaged my scalp daily, just like I was supposed to, and</li>
            <li> Not a big deal really, but it&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li> Naturally I freaked out and started doing research on what I could do about this.  </li>
            <li> and I only take this often because I don&#x27;t know what else to take, but it really does not regrow your hair...</li>
            <li> And i kid you not, four weeks later, my eyebrows have as much growth as a two month wait.  </li>
            <li> If you take the vitamins faithfully you will notice a marked improvement in hair growth and thickness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 years old and have always had fine/thin hair but never had any problems with it growing in length</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s just working on my head hair.</li>
            <li> I do have some loss, but no where near what it was like before.</li>
            <li> If this changes, I&#x27;ll post a update, but so far, nothing.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it works.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;glowing, positive\\&quot; reviews for this product are completely bogus.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old and started loosing hair about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> So far no difference in the health of my nails.</li>
            <li> Over all I dont always eat the healthiest food &amp; I find these make a very noticable difference in the overall health of my hair!Definatly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair has become noticeably soft.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the growth yet as it is too early.</li>
            <li> As far as the hair on my head, I guess time will tell.</li>
            <li> i measured by using a tape measure on my roots as i was transitioning from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li> If these did help my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed because I was too busy stressing about my face.</li>
            <li> Neither company can be located except through an Amazon \\&quot;shell\\&quot; preventing any direct consumer contact.  </li>
            <li> I recieved my Nioxin supplements last week very prompt service.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda to early to state weather</li>
            <li> I take Nioxin vitamins for my adult acne.</li>
            <li> If these greedy sellers have any conscious for the consumer&#x27;s health they wouldn&#x27;t sell this bottle here on amazon.</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> The Saw Palmetto and Wild Yam</li>
            <li> and Ive noticed the shedding has completely stopped.</li>
            <li> Thank you for contacting Procter and Gamble Professional Care Exclusive Lines.  </li>
            <li> as far as nixon supplements are concerned, i have stopped use, as it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I think lower price brands probably will do just as good as this expensive one.</li>
            <li> My hair also looks so shiny, thick, and healthy.    </li>
            <li> It is a good vitamin, but I think that $179.00 is a tad expensive.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, this is a sign of old vitamins---repackaged in a new container.</li>
            <li> I realize that hair only grows about 1/2 an inch per month, so I don&#x27;t expect to have super long hair after three months.</li>
            <li> And with the colder weather knocking on the door, I&#x27;ve been shedding worse than a Golden Retriever!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and thin and while I am taking the pills my hair has new growth and gets stronger.  </li>
            <li> My product arrived in tact and without broken pills like some other reviewers experienced.</li>
            <li> the product very much but at the new price, I will consider seeking other alternatives.</li>
            <li> mg&#x27;s of its ingredients making it less effective and less</li>
            <li> Comprare other because it&#x27;s worth, everyone sees the change in my eyelashes, my skin, my nails and my hair ...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if there is really any new growth, but I shortly noticed after I started taking Nioxin that the number of hairs in the drain when I wash my hair is much much lesser than beforehand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the huge issue with this is - maybe that means they&#x27;re old?  </li>
            <li> more however the price is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I first got these back in October 2011 from a local beauty supply shop but they ran out &amp; I found them here &amp; ordered them.</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;m african american and have had issues with my hair growing since I moved to GA in 96&#x27;</li>
            <li> I bought this product less than a month ago and have noticed a tremendous change in my skin.</li>
            <li> My nails are going out smoothly, except I do have a little peach fuzz above my upper lip, which I typically have but it grows at an extensive rate, I manage though, it&#x27;s not horrific.</li>
            <li> I think their effectiveness is due to the fact that they break down DHT, a form of male hormone that men &amp; women produce more of as they get older.</li>
            <li> so i stopped the pills and eventually everything got back to normal.  </li>
            <li> second issue with these vitamins, also mentioned in other reviews, is that they&#x27;re really not much different than the vitamins available at any CVS, Target, etc.  </li>
            <li> I notice new \\&quot;flyaways\\&quot; when I pull my hair back into a pony.  </li>
            <li> When I touch now the skin on my scalp, I can feel short newly grown hair.</li>
            <li> For all of you who rate this with negative comments, what are you doing differently to take better care of your hair?</li>
            <li> It may be possible to get the same ingredients without spending so much money, but for now I am sticking with it.</li>
            <li> It stopped my hair from falling further after 1 week of daily use, and my hair looks and feels much thicker.</li>
            <li> Never been keen on the issue of hairloss but it got to a point where I had to adress it, I used this as well as a cayenne fruit supplement and slowly but surely started to see fuzzys growing back</li>
            <li> I often get comments on my thick, healthy, bouncy hair and attribute it totally to my constant use of Nioxin vitamins.</li>
            <li> As I write this, I&#x27;ve just finished the 90-count bottle and my bangs have grown back completely!</li>
            <li> The only thing that can truly help thinning hair is Rogaine and possibly taking actual Biotin pills (which are a heck of a lot cheaper and have a higher dosage as well).  </li>
            <li> My relaxers usually last 3 months before the need of another, and usually about a month my hair is still easy to comb through, not this time.</li>
            <li> In terms of hair which was getting ready to show signs of new growth anyway since I usually get new-growth after about 4 weeks post relaxer is somewhat normal, I guess.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews which were almost all positive</li>
            <li> So I can wholeheartedly recommend the Nioxin supplements in general, but suggest getting them from somewhere else perhaps.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist loves it so much that she wants me to stop wearing weaves because my hair is now about five inches past my shoulder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old female.</li>
            <li> I spent about 30 minutes searching the web for a label before I decided to buy this, but in the end, all I could find was a list of ingredients on the official Nioxin site, which told me what was in it, but not how much.  </li>
            <li> and it is sooo soft, almost like baby hair especially at the crown.  </li>
            <li> In my early 50&#x27;s and balding in the back and working it&#x27;s way forward.  </li>
            <li> But apparently they don&#x27;t manufacture these anymore.</li>
            <li> it was old yellow and cracked and passed the return date policy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them for hair growth and better looking hair for those with thin, puny hair.</li>
            <li> expedited heart beat, my blood pressure rose, and i was just uncomfortable in my skin...</li>
            <li> My hair was getting thin in the top just like a man.  </li>
            <li> For those loyal customers visit some of the local salons to see if you can still purchase them because some still have a few in stock and the 30 capsule is still $19.99</li>
            <li> So word to the wise, a number of persons have had identical bad experiences, one must also give considerations to the numbers that have not taken the time to express their misfortunes with the same item, hence the probability of your item being defective will therefore be high.   </li>
            <li> I was skeptical like most others of trying something new, but these definitely work.</li>
            <li> but I have very fine weak hair, also very long.</li>
            <li> and I am African American with natural hair.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with natural hair.</li>
            <li> I am an African American 20yr old, and my hair was between shoulder and bra length in Febuary.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars so far because it has been only 30 days.</li>
            <li> After bringing the bottle with me to compare vitamin content in the Nioxin pills versus other vitamins, I found that the Centrum daily multivitamin had almost the exact same levels of each and every vitamin found in the Nioxin pills.  </li>
            <li> My skin stays clear as long as I am taking them.</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old caucasian woman with long blond hair.  </li>
            <li> and then all of a sudden I noticed that I could barely see my scalp--</li>
            <li> Our feedback is apparently the only quality control for Nioxin products.</li>
            <li> Apparently Nioxin has sold out to Proctor Gamble and the supplement has been taken off the market until January 2013 for \\&quot;repackaging\\&quot;; P&amp;G specifically answered my inquiry as such.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m through over half the bottle and so far have seen no results in new hair growth or thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at the salon and paid a ridiculous price for a 30 day supply in an attempt to grow my hair longer in a shorter period of time.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it does work and at the very least, makes your hair much healthier!</li>
            <li> The individual companies that still have the old formula are profiting on the demand, but when the new formula is released the price will go back down because there is not a shortage of the vitamins.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said it was because the company recalled them due to a health concern &amp; now leftover supply is low but demand is high.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that my hair is growing longer faster so much as I have noticed that I am shedding less hair daily</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair has always been baby fine and thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking biotin and other hair, skin, nail supplements for years with no real results but the Nioxin is the first product where I&#x27;ve seen a noticible change.</li>
            <li> I did find that nioxin makes your hair and nails grow a little faster and LaBeaute makes your hair grow thicker and stronger, but not as fast as Nioxin but noticeable as well.  </li>
            <li> : I have learned that the price increase is due to this product being discontinued by Nioxin with a \\&quot;new formula\\&quot; slated for release in August.</li>
            <li> I am experiencing some discomfort from the soy complex phytonutrients in the formula, as I am a little sensitive to soy, but the benefits are too important to stop using it.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell the difference in hair right away</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old African American and I suffer from hair lost and hair thinning due to menopause and a history of \\&quot;male\\&quot; pattern baldness in my family.</li>
            <li> The price should go back down with new product.  </li>
            <li> The vitamin content may be weak, but in my hair&#x27;s opinion, the herbs apparently make the supplements worth taking.  </li>
            <li> Those little gray new growth strands keeping popping up out of nowhere!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old &amp; have extremely damaged hair..</li>
            <li> The price was a little high but since my Beautician recommended it, I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> I cut it to my shoulders back in May 2009 &amp; it barely had barely grown 4 inches in a year &amp; a half.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to write the actual results.</li>
            <li> but they are becoming too tough to bite!</li>
            <li> and recently I&#x27;ve been experiencing some major hair loss due to a hormonal imbalance.</li>
            <li> I learned a long time ago that not everything is gonna give everyone the same results, so we should remember that when we read or write reviews about anything.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell how it&#x27;s working for hair growth but will update this as soon as I flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought these and had so much new hair growth within three months that when my hairdresser flat ironed my hair, I had little sections of shorter hair standing up all over my head like Tweety Bird.</li>
            <li> I had extreme post-partum shedding, and it&#x27;s hard enough being a new mom without being a new Bald mom.  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s only been a week since I&#x27;ve had them taken off and my nails feel pretty much normal, not bending or breaking like they usually do after having acrylics on.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thin and fine, and it gets a lifeless look to it if I dont wash it every other day and keep it layered.</li>
            <li> It also has improved the natural color and there is much less grey.</li>
            <li> I recently straightened my hair and it is down to my upper back!!</li>
            <li> Also, I pluck my gray strands from my scalp and lately I have been plucking those little suckers a lot more often while taking this product!</li>
            <li> and I have not seen drastic results as far as hair growth besides little baby hairs.</li>
            <li> In fact, my nails are extremely weak right now...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar with some of the ingredients in the \\&quot;proprietary blend\\&quot;, but several of the vitamins (especially Biotin and Zinc) are quite low doses.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, the primary reason i got this was for my skin and there has been no change in my skin</li>
            <li> After cutting them off, I noticed my hair on the top was noticeably thinner.  </li>
            <li> I had a subscription for 25.99 for about a year, then bam, it&#x27;s canceled and now the bottles available are anywhere from 99 to a laughable 199 bucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this system for roughly 30 days</li>
            <li> and I do not want long nails</li>
            <li> This will be a long review...</li>
            <li> I have been taking this everyday so far</li>
            <li> I intend to keep taking it to see if this can help regrow any hair in the long term.</li>
            <li> my hair has grown so long-</li>
            <li> We have both noticed our grey hair is disappearing.</li>
            <li> To my surprise I Had expected the shipping date to be as approximated but in fact it came 4 DAYS EARLIER!!</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so long in its life.  </li>
            <li> I take one vitamin every day not really at the same time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to make this a long, drawn out review.  </li>
            <li> I took this stuff for a long while to realize that it wasn&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have taken them for about a year or more, however, I was disappointed with my last order because the seal was broken and has a smell that tells me it&#x27;s not fresh.</li>
            <li> I started using Nioxin and my hair got really thick and was growing really fast in 2 weeks...</li>
            <li> and that is the reason they are charging $100 for a bottle when it should be $30, because the supply is low and demand is high (and not many competitors also!).</li>
            <li> I had patchy baldness incurred due to high stress,and then heavy hair loss because of eczema.</li>
            <li> I am a black female in mid thirties..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old with my hair half down my back.</li>
            <li> Saw new growth in areas that hadn&#x27;t had hair growth in the past.</li>
            <li> People, if your hair is falling out suddenly and dramatically please go see a doctor-that is not normal!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used the folicle booster and it definitely thickens spots that are thinning &amp; you only need to use a little, I apply it with a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to the other vitamins.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s as likely the Nioxin tablets as the other things I added (or a combination thereof).</li>
            <li> No weight gain, no unwanted facial hair, or hair on any other part of my body for that matter.</li>
            <li> So in this case I my order total was $27.15, plus other stipulated charges, totalling $16.24.</li>
            <li> The tablets are middle size compared to other brands of vitamins.</li>
            <li> This was due to the constant weight and pulling on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Other solutions seem kinda external on the scalp but this one is composition of vitamins.</li>
            <li> Did other factors probably contribute to my hair coming back?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the biotin supplements as well as NUMEROUS other hair, nail, skin vitamins</li>
            <li> Obviously pricing is skyrocketing due to no product being produced.</li>
            <li> Nioxin, as with any salon quality product (most salons have exclusivity contracts which subsequently will accept returns, and guarantee their products; past that they are unable to verify the authenticity of the products (I work in a salon--it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have noticed that last bottle does not have a expiration date printed like other items.</li>
            <li> I will be looking for other alternatives and if the price comes back to earth</li>
            <li> The container did not come with the safety cover and all the pills looks old and cracked and also looked a little different from what I bought in the store previously.  </li>
            <li> The thyroid supplements I&#x27;m taking are Nature&#x27;s Way Kelp and Natural Sources Raw Thyroid</li>
            <li> and I noticed my hair started to get dry and brittle again.  </li>
            <li> but it is dry.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair not as dry and brittle anymore.</li>
            <li> Seriously, your WHOLE body (hair/skin/nails included)and your wallet/purse will thank you.</li>
            <li> I stopped taking them for a few months and when I stared back up the change was obvious.  </li>
            <li> and I have only just starting taking it a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to think this was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> and im not sure if i should take them or not because thats a whole lot of money , going down the drain if dont.</li>
            <li> Typically, I can wait a few months (with normal growth) for a relaxer retouch but while taking this product</li>
            <li> I paid a lot of money for those shots, but I was realistic in knowing that just because I didn&#x27;t get the effect I wanted, didn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> it is NOT normal.</li>
            <li> so you could see her scalp beacuse of the contrast between her dark hair and the white scalp.  </li>
            <li> Amazon is going to loose business because of sellers like these.</li>
            <li> Lower the price back down to what it was before</li>
            <li> One day I got in my car with the sun roof open and could see down to my scalp...</li>
            <li> I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this product until the price comes down.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get them, but I didn&#x27;t pay for any type of express shipping, but that was a small inconvenience compared to how much I saved.</li>
            <li> I would NOT highly recommend at all.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these Nioxin vitamins for about six months and used to get about 1/4 inch a month of new growth----I am now getting at least 1/2 inch a month ....</li>
            <li> I am an African American who has been attempting to grow out my hair for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve only been taking this product for less than a month, I KNOW it will do</li>
            <li> I am half way through my third month</li>
            <li> Yes, I was skeptical at first as not every supplement works equally well for everyone, but after reading all the raging reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> so I have also opted to begin with protective styling (less heat and chemicals) to assure that I am not counter acting against anything that the Nioxin could be doing for my hair.</li>
            <li> They definitely seem stronger now and chip less.    </li>
            <li> Prior to taking this vitamin, I had always had black heads all around my chin and mouth.</li>
            <li> I started taking this about 9 months ago( estimate ) after several months I did notice less hair in my brush &amp; bathroom drain.</li>
            <li> Every single pill in the bottle was cracked!!I would rather take my chances paying a little extra and purchasing it at a store.</li>
            <li> I tried this for about a month at which time I noticed my hair getting very dry, brittle, breaking off/falling out.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and brittle before I used Nioxin.</li>
            <li> With working out and coloring my hair the sweat was really making it dry and unhealthy.</li>
            <li> I questioned as such with P&amp;G and communicated my disappointment after decades of loyal use but never received a follow up response.</li>
            <li> Overall, my hair and skin just seemed healthier and less dull and I received multiple compliments on my complexion within the last month or so.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels a little longer but it is too soon to have big results.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it was a little cheaper, but I&#x27;m going to continue using it.</li>
            <li> None of the bald spots grew back, not even a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Only been using this for a little over 30 days</li>
            <li> only made my skin a little clearer.</li>
            <li> Its only been a little under two months</li>
            <li> My hair also became shinier and the little hairs at my temple got thicker and are harder to manage, which I attribute to Nioxin since I was doing nothing different in my routine.</li>
            <li> It would be hard to give a proper review of this product, I have only been using it for about a month now.</li>
            <li> one thing, the pills smell bad and look a little bit wet, and i am only able to drink them after some food at night , on the empty stomach they make me dizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neither product will make new hair grow if your hair loss is from a serious conditions like alopecia or pattern baldness.  </li>
            <li> I really love the results of this product and it did work, but then all of the sudden you all kicked up the price so stupid.</li>
            <li> In case you can&#x27;t find the herbal ingredients elsewhere, they are: wild yam root, sarsaparilla root, stinging nettle root, oat extract, pygeum bark, saw palmetto, bladderwrack, ubiquinone, tocotrienols, soy phytosterol complex.     </li>
            <li> i spent almost 80 dollars for these nioxin pills .</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says and if you stop taking it you will notice a decreased rate in growth.</li>
            <li> I received Nioxin about three months ago and took one pill everyday along with lots of water daily</li>
            <li> Hair was still falling out at an alarming rate.</li>
            <li> and I am looking foward to the next few months.</li>
            <li> Her hair was falling out in clumps after she delivered and she has long dark brown hair</li>
            <li> My hair has been very damaged from all the times I have switched hair colors over the years and was brittle,dry and thin from all the breakage and abuse.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these pills for about 1 1/2 months now, but I noticed results after only a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I also notice when I part my hair, it&#x27;s not as wide as it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Not much change in eyebrows...</li>
            <li> A few months ago I noticed the fullness of my hair was getting thinner, especially when I put it up in a pony tail to work out.  </li>
            <li> I do not really suffer from hair loss</li>
            <li> I did have some success where hair growth was noticeable (not perfect) over a 6-month period before I began taking the Nioxin.</li>
            <li> But now, since I used Nioxin, I have absolutely minimal</li>
            <li> The result: Unknown quality and no accountability.  </li>
            <li> It seems a few of the third-party sellers here on Amazon still have some supply left</li>
            <li> I compared it with my daughter&#x27;s vitamins and they were running neck and neck minus the amount of biotin...</li>
            <li> This product didnt work as expected .</li>
            <li> be careful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, lush, manageable.</li>
            <li> From research I have discovered that this could possibly mean that these pills are not what they say they are or are old.</li>
            <li> (although it does reach a \\&quot;breaking point\\&quot; about half way down my back).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s kind of bad thing for me because I dont want long hard nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been serious about this product for the last 45 days.  </li>
            <li> My hair grew about 3/4 of an inch in a month.. which is CRAZY &amp; has me SO excited.</li>
            <li> I know this was a major complaint for some of the reviewers.</li>
            <li> This alone tells me that the bottom line is just to make money and that they are not interested in the creditability of their company.</li>
            <li> Your hair grows fast!\\&quot; with really wide eyes (I&#x27;VE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE!).</li>
            <li> oh and just the other day, I was in a Marshall&#x27;s store and saw that they sold the Shampoo and Conditioner from Nioxin.</li>
            <li> The other brands required that I take one after every meal.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products</li>
            <li> But I had to discontinue after 2 weeks due to constipation.</li>
            <li> who says there no underlined cause, other than unpricribed supplements.</li>
            <li> I just went back to her this past week after taking vitamins for two months</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on other reviews I have read about this and people swear that it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> They have grown with other products, but this growth is thicker and faster.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do now except go back on the vitamins until I don&#x27;t care about my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this product is working or not cause I use other supplements as well.</li>
            <li> For the skeptics: Not every bottle of pills will be cracked, (as some other reviews said)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware of the practice of having shills writing fake reviews extolling the virtues of the product being sold.</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive lesson.</li>
            <li> We stopped taking them for a while because the place where we boght them ran out due to a change in distributor.  </li>
            <li> Its been a month since I&#x27;ve started using this along with other Biotin tablets.</li>
            <li> There are also a number of other ingredients that can slow blood clotting, interact with estrogen in birth control pills, or generally cause stomach upset and nausea.</li>
            <li> Which is a relief compared to the horse pills and multiple pills I&#x27;ve had to take in the past.</li>
            <li> and like the other reviews</li>
            <li> I bought this due to all the rave reviews and advice of a hairdresser.</li>
            <li> By the time I opened the second bottle it was past Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return policy.     </li>
            <li> Quality is a serious issue with supplements including vitamins as they are not subject to FDA or any other scrutiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other hair vitamins that work just as well.</li>
            <li> I do see some thickness in my strands, but new growth is still very slow.</li>
            <li> especially due to the poor quality of the item received, but they certainly don&#x27;t hurt (it does make your dead hairs fall out initially; do not be alarmed).</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but well worth the investment in your hair and nails.</li>
            <li> They seem a little expensive but they are worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I confirmed that I was speaking with an actual employee of Nioxin Research Labs, the company responsible for manufacturing and distributing this product and that shockingly, I was informed that Nioxin does not have a quality control department and that they are not able to comment or advise any non-salon purchasers.</li>
            <li> this is the only thing that has finally made my hair grow past my shoulders!!</li>
            <li> My female doctor mentioned the Nioxin vitamins and other of their products to me because my hair was starting to thin as well.  </li>
            <li> I saw results after I started my 2 bottle, my hair in the back which was badly broken off grew back.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I have thick hair again, but it seems at least to not fall out as much as it did.  </li>
            <li> The only other negative impact is that it causes my eyebrows and other hair on the body to grow faster.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s still soft, but thick!</li>
            <li> This is not fun, due to the fact</li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s not worth taking a supplement that could cause other problems for you down the road.    </li>
            <li> I ALSO think it is thickening my hair .. hard to actually tell ..</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time with the growth of my hair especially the edges.</li>
            <li> Its always hard to tell what is actually helping your hair.</li>
            <li> had chronic issue with hair loss and had tried every supplement there is with no success.</li>
            <li> I am trying to grow my hair at least 4 inches by summer or summers end...is that possible????</li>
            <li> so I have patches of hair missing around my head (sometimes big, sometimes small patches).  </li>
            <li> I have been using them religiously (taking one everyday) for the past 6 months</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would help with my hair loss, but sadly it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The product is definitely not worth almost $200.  </li>
            <li> The Recharging Complex is currently unavailable.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as I&#x27;d like it to be, but I definitely see the difference after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I hate the thoughts of putting goo on top of my head, so I am trying Nioxin one pill a day.  </li>
            <li> My typically thick hair suddenly started falling out, to the point that I could see my scalp</li>
            <li> My nails are very thin and peel after they reach a certain length.  </li>
            <li> and I realized that those short little hairs were about 6 inches long now and thus the thick pony tail!</li>
            <li> I know if I keep taking these vitamins, by the end of the year, I&#x27;ll have hair down to my ears or neck.  </li>
            <li> Since taking these vitamins the shedding seems to be way down.  </li>
            <li> But another down fall is once you stop taking it your hair breaks all over.</li>
            <li> so I dropped down to 1 a day.  </li>
            <li> I also like that the price has come down which helps a ton.</li>
            <li> The price has gone down over the years.</li>
            <li> This may work for other people but I won&#x27;t be using it ever again!</li>
            <li> I will say that you must give them time to work because I was taking some other vitamins (Maxi-Hair) that I purchased from the Vitamin Shoppe and those worked!</li>
            <li> I used this with other products, but I know that this helped a little.</li>
            <li> DUE TO PRICE INCREASE!</li>
            <li> I mean my hair was looking like I was starting to go bald.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer - will not pay triple the price even tho</li>
            <li> After about three and a half months... it happened.</li>
            <li> decrease the hair shed in less than three months from 200 a day to anywhere between 50-100 a day 4)</li>
            <li> the time I was ordering this product from Amazon, I was paying less than $30 for a 90-count bottle.  </li>
            <li> so I bought it like a month and half ago.</li>
            <li> Im loosing much less amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> so I order this product and began taking them for a month in half.</li>
            <li> and I also think my arms hairs are slightly longer than they were previously.  </li>
            <li> about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> Im 39, typical guy losing hair at his age.</li>
            <li> Hair seems to be shedding less after I wash it</li>
            <li> However, after going on this vitamin, all of my black heads went away and I now never have a zit....</li>
            <li> After half months of use, my bf and I dont see any improvement from this product.</li>
            <li> After 2 weks I noticed less shedding and the sides of my hair looks visibly thicker.</li>
            <li> so that wasn&#x27;t a concern--but as someone who goes back and forth from artificial nails to natural, nail growth and strength was a concern; noticing additional strength and growth which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve never really had skin or complexion issues, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s improved my skin health.   </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical before trying this but someone gave me two weeks worth</li>
            <li> This coming from a girl who already has LONG, thick eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin due to my thyroid being out of wack, and I got on pills for that at the same time that I started these.</li>
            <li> After reading almost all of the reviews, there are a few \\&quot;myths\\&quot; I hope to knock down.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps because I know it is difficult to determine if you want to try a new product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 33yo male and I&#x27;m not sure when, but my hair has started to slowly march away from my forehead ...</li>
            <li> I noticed results in as little as 2 wks.</li>
            <li> Then after 4 months, I noticed some of the little bald patches in front weren&#x27;t bald anymore.</li>
            <li> After taking it for about 1 1/2 months, I started to see my existing baby hair getting longer, so my hair looks a little fuller.  </li>
            <li> The growth is not significant for me but there has been rapid growth, a lot faster than if I wasn&#x27;t using this product.</li>
            <li> I have taken other hair vitamins in the past and people say that these products don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> so that made me a little suspicious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little embarrassing, but there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it.  </li>
            <li> but I can see that my hair is a little longer.</li>
            <li> I take one every morning along with my little thyroid pill.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> these pills work... a little too well.  </li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, it appears that cracked pills are a sign of age (but the bottle&#x27;s expiration date is 2013, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on).    </li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for a little over two weeks now.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d recommend the product on the nail growth alone (and am still hopeful that the hair part just takes a little longer to kick in).</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for about a year, maybe a little longer.</li>
            <li> These may be a little pricey</li>
            <li> Both make the hair already on your head grow a little faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with hair loss for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I thought of discontinuing a few times because results weren&#x27;t coming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Nature&#x27;s choice, purvana, and this one.</li>
            <li> This is not fun when the result of a defect and/or the need for returns and refunds will usually be my loss at some point.</li>
            <li> What made my situation worse was our Customs policy does not allow export of drugs/dietary supplements, which means I am not allowed to send my item back to the US for a refund.</li>
            <li> So basically I wasted $50 on this junk ($25 for a 3 month supply).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this overpriced, overhyped garbage.  </li>
            <li> so i took the pills for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Ive been taking the pill everyday day</li>
            <li> dont waste your money</li>
            <li> These products were a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> A few days before using this product I used a relaxer.</li>
            <li> because I&#x27;m so young &amp; it was just weird.</li>
            <li> I saw all these short thin hairs popping up out of my scalp.</li>
            <li> your hair are totally dead from bleach-</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> like I told CostSell don&#x27;t get his self in trouble</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t waste my gas.</li>
            <li> Not sure why Nioxin thinks the average consumer will keep buying a product they TRIPLE the price on</li>
            <li> I use to buy these vitamins at the beauty supply shop for $29.00 a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I stopped taking it a few months ago</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> I took my hair down from my twists about a month ago and was SHOCKED at how much my hair grew!</li>
            <li> My hair seams healthier &amp; like I said less in my brush!</li>
            <li> The pills taste horrible and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s due to the cracked pills.</li>
            <li> I was so irritated that even though I&#x27;d been using their shampoo and conditioner for the last 3 years (also with no amazing results) I was done with this ridiculous company.</li>
            <li> These vitamins have made my hair thick thick thick, but I am only on 2mnths and it is growing a little faster.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s a little excessive in cost.</li>
            <li> I guess it was bad for you ;)</li>
            <li> I touched my face and it felt smoother, still have a few small pimples here and there.</li>
            <li> my hair has stopped shedding like crazy; I mean it&#x27;s only a few strands in the shower, a few when I brush it and a few here and there, nothing alarming.</li>
            <li> And I agree with the other review about the quality of the pills as they seem to break easily and taste horrible.</li>
            <li> BTW, I stupidly used these for 6 months hoping my thinning hair would be \\&quot;revitalized\\&quot; BEFORE checking with my dermatologist only to discover the veracity of the old adage, \\&quot;If</li>
            <li> It has a horrible taste to it, but its worth the final results!</li>
            <li> I have been taking Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex for less than a month and already I am receiving visible results.</li>
            <li> Being over 60 my hair, eye brows and eye lashes are thinning, as expected, but I thought I should at least try to find something that would help slow the process.</li>
            <li> I even have my little sister using it!</li>
            <li> My hair was in an extremely fraigle and damaged condition, it was dry, breaking, falling out and very unhealthy.</li>
            <li> And this has happened on various other products like benefiber as well where the price inexplicably has been tripled overnight.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re talking those large, painful acne bumps that take forever to go away.</li>
            <li> there is very little shedding and my roots feel a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also always had very little to no hair on front sides of head.</li>
            <li> the price wasn&#x27;t too bad, and thats what really got my attention.</li>
            <li> After two months of this product my nails are stronger and I have had no breakage or splitting in the past month.</li>
            <li> Not sure what caused it, but thought it might be hormanal.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product is working yet.  </li>
            <li> Sorry for the gross TMI</li>
            <li> Not sure, I&#x27;ll give it the benefit of the doubt though.</li>
            <li> in just the past few months!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I am still not sure I can see any difference--</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m anxious to see my results after 3 months.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if this is because the supplements seemed to have \\&quot;expired\\&quot; or it was the supplement itself...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does or not.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it promotes hair growth yet.</li>
            <li> Needless to say this will be my third bottle</li>
            <li> It would always grow shoulder length but not much more.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 1 small pill a day</li>
            <li> I was losing small handfuls in the shower.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was never able to take these pills after realizing when I finally opened the bottle</li>
            <li> usually they have buy one get one 50% off</li>
            <li> : Not sure what happened</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of reading reviews because I&#x27;m worried they are fake; but I assure you, I&#x27;m a real person who bought this item based on the reviews that were already here.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve always seemed weak, thin and tend to chip to the point that I didn&#x27;t even bother with professional manicures because the filing seemed to make things worse.</li>
            <li> To bad the price went so high.  </li>
            <li> the visual is DRAMATIC!</li>
            <li> I dont know what the secret is in this pill because I have taken other multivitamins and not gotten these results!</li>
            <li> Previously product was being sold for approximately $26 for a 90 count.</li>
            <li> I have changed my skin care regimen so it is hard to give 100% credit to Nioxin, but I can assure you that it has not harmed my skin in anyway.</li>
            <li> But i would think thats something thats hard to notice</li>
            <li> and I have always had a hard time with hair growth.</li>
            <li> So, I know that the Recharging Complex will continue to help.</li>
            <li> B001394530 Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex, 90 Count]]</li>
            <li> Soy Phytotosterol Complex  </li>
            <li> and I had the recharging complex recommended to me by her stylist.  </li>
            <li> but I see the difference within a week after taking the Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex for three months now after purchasing the 90-count bottle here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex for about a month-and-a-half and can already visibly notice the difference in the condition of my hair, skin, and nails.  </li>
            <li> My hair is at least 2\\&quot; longer.</li>
            <li> at least not yet.</li>
            <li> B001394530 Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex, 90 Count]]</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars, I would.</li>
            <li> I ordered one bottle of this therapy recharging complex from Amazon.com on Oct. 23rd.</li>
            <li> You do have to give it at least three months, though.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of getting back on them and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman who&#x27;s desperate because my hair is thinning and my nails are always chipping and breaking because they&#x27;re brittle (possibly because I swim six days a week in chlorinated water).</li>
            <li> B001394530 Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex, 90 Count]]</li>
            <li> I started to notice I was losing a lot of hair in my late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t expect Amazon to check the quality of every product they sell but when they receive repeated negative feedback on a product they need to stop selling that product and qualify an alternative supplier.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin Recharging complex pill bottle has been pulled off the market and recalled by the Nioxin company because of health concerns.</li>
            <li> The product will still be called Recharging Complex.  </li>
            <li> So at least that worked for me and am so grateful for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I have thick hair now.</li>
            <li> I have never had thick hair.</li>
            <li> My nail tech says my nails grow fairly slow</li>
            <li> My personal opinion is I took this product for 3 weeks and my hair was constantly shedding very bad</li>
            <li> so im not sure which one is working!</li>
            <li> , I WAS SKEPTICAL BECAUSE OTHER HAIR PILLS DON&#x27;T DO WHAT THEY CLAIM.</li>
            <li> As it works on hair, that would mean hair elsewhere will grow faster too.</li>
            <li> My doctor was unable to determine whether this was due to hormones or the number of stressful situations I had been in.</li>
            <li> My hair due to the treaments become very thin to the point of ball spots through out the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing works.</li>
            <li> I guess the price is a function of supply and demand, but it&#x27;s getting a bit ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> If not I will have to seriously consider whether or not the expense is warranted to continue with the treatment.</li>
            <li> they should be taken off the market and the price is ridiculous</li>
            <li> I hate the fact that my hair has broken off so much</li>
            <li> I must admit despite the rave reviews I was a little skeptical since everything else people claim to work never worked for me.</li>
            <li> and I was expecting my nails to be all nasty looking and super weak</li>
            <li> I have been taking nioxin recharging complex for approximate 5 months.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE be advised that purchasing them off of this site is not a good thing because of the price gouging.    </li>
            <li> My hair was thinning due to stress, age and childeren and I was desperate to do something about it.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviews from men on this product, I too was desperately searching for a solution to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> But, my nails are growing like gang busters and they are hard as nails!    </li>
            <li> my hair has grown at least two inches and is thicker!</li>
            <li> I was mortified to say the least!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way too expensive now, so no more bottles will be coming from this product</li>
            <li> Well I already have very thick hair and wish it was thinner.</li>
            <li> I have very thick neck line hair.</li>
            <li> When she finished I was crying!!!</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it grows very slowly.</li>
            <li> I really do not have one bad thing to say about this pills.</li>
            <li> I have always had paper thin nails that don&#x27;t grow</li>
            <li> The shedding of my hair hasn&#x27;t stopped, but it has decreased.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was not sealed, I am doubtful that the pills are actually  Dioxin vitamins.    </li>
            <li> I am not happy with my order.</li>
            <li> Tissue paper thin.  </li>
            <li> I have had thin hair all of my life</li>
            <li> The 90 count makes it easier to continue the treatment rather than run out of the product and miss unnecessary day of taking it.  </li>
            <li> I had thin edges which I had went to a doctor and received treatments for.</li>
            <li> This time, all the pills in the bottle were cracked or broken.</li>
            <li> Anyways I think it prevented worse situation from happening.</li>
            <li> The problem got progressively worse.</li>
            <li> so I knew they weren&#x27;t broken hairs.</li>
            <li> Now the pricing has been over inflated to what you see at approximately $100+ for 90 count.</li>
            <li> and I havent seen dramatic results in the length.</li>
            <li> The only downside of this product is that the pills smell bad and have a bad taste but that goes away immediately after swallowing.</li>
            <li> Although, it&#x27;s always 1 or 2 shy off the 90-count...</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I was skeptical but hopeful when I oredered these.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed weird hair growth anywhere else-</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t think to include that in theoriginal review.    </li>
            <li> CostSell&#x27;s lame advice was for me to bring the item to a post office and \\&quot;refuse\\</li>
            <li> How sad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was hoping for increased hair growth as well and have yet to notice any difference</li>
            <li> Im trying to go 6 months without one, but the pills are making it difficult to control because of its rapid growth.</li>
            <li> Needless to say this has never happened to me before.</li>
            <li> unable to buy at this time...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical...</li>
            <li> I am not happy with that at all!</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s wrong with these pills</li>
            <li> buy doing wrong things.</li>
            <li> Sorry Nioxin,</li>
            <li> I notified the seller, COSTSELL, and never even got a return message, refund, or sorry.</li>
            <li> This product is fake and/or expired.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s up to you guys to believe me or some fake posters from the seller itself.</li>
            <li> a sad truth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i dont see how something that doesnt even work can be so expensive</li>
            <li> Sorry for the inconvenience.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am sure these were imitation pills since they appeared to be falling apart and had no effect on me</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for 2 months now. I take one tablet twice a day with a Evening Primrose capsule to help thicken my hair as it grows. I do see some thickness in my strands, but new growth is still very slow. I think lower price brands probably will do just as good as this expensive one. I would NOT highly recommend at all.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I also use the shampoo and the Therapy and I am growing new hair, I recommended this to some friends and they are using it too and also growing new hair. Best product ever..</li>
            <li> These are excellent vitamins.  I have taken them for years. My nails are very thin and peel after they reach a certain length.  These vitamins make my nails hard and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month. No any changes. My hair loss even bacame worst.</li>
            <li> One of the best products around, especially for the price! Although, it&#x27;s always 1 or 2 shy off the 90-count...</li>
            <li> so you can get super potent biotin at walmart or here for WAY cheaper and it does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;brands: spring valley or natures bounty.</li>
            <li> These are the best vitamins on the market for hair care!! Of course it great too to have the vitamin for health purposes. I recommend this and all the hair cair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase, my nails are stronger like my hair, and I have grown up without bursting and that surprises me because I had some very fragile. Almost 3 months I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins and I&#x27;m really happy happy. Comprare other because it&#x27;s worth, everyone sees the change in my eyelashes, my skin, my nails and my hair ... I recommend 100%</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this system for roughly 30 days so there&#x27;s no way of saying ye&#x27; or nay regarding this product. I will say this though, MY BROWS NEED TOUCH UPS WAY MORE OFTEN! I hope this growth soon translates to the hair on my head :-D.</li>
            <li> This vitamin truly does what it claims to do.  I have been taking it for about a month now and already I see significant growth in my hair along with a healthier look.  Additionally, my skin is indeed clearer.  I purchased the 90 day supply and this will continue to be my new multi-vitamin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had issues with hair loss for a few years now. I started taking the vitamins a month and half ago and the results have been amazing.  I&#x27;ve seen a reduction in hair loss and have actually started regrowing hair around the temple of my forehead where the loss was noticeable.  My hair is growing at a faster rate then before and I have nice nails now.  I will definitely continue to take these vitamins.</li>
            <li> I tried this for about a month at which time I noticed my hair getting very dry, brittle, breaking off/falling out.  That was it for me!  Enough is enough!  I just hope the damage isn&#x27;t permanent!!!  This may work for other people but I won&#x27;t be using it ever again!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at the salon and paid a ridiculous price for a 30 day supply in an attempt to grow my hair longer in a shorter period of time. I have thin hair and it grows very slowly. I haven&#x27;t noticed that my hair is growing longer faster so much as I have noticed that I am shedding less hair daily and it looks fuller and healthier. In addition, I have always had brittle nails and never been able to grow them out at all as they would always split or break. After two months of this product my nails are stronger and I have had no breakage or splitting in the past month. And this was after just removing acrylic nails that I have had off and on for ten years. l plan to continue buying this product through Amazon as it is MUCH cheaper and definitely worth the money in my opinion. Even though I didn&#x27;t get super fast hair growth I have retained more hair and have strong nails. May not work for everyone but it&#x27;s definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I have bleached blonde hair that wouldnt grow and kept breaking! this is the only thing that has finally made my hair grow past my shoulders!!</li>
            <li> Well my wife and I really believe these Pills Help. Are hair grows stronger and faster. Beware that hair everywhere will grow faster(Ears,nose,etc). Her nails grow strong and dont brake as much and her hair sheds less when she brushs it. My nails no longer have the white calcium spots. So we both Love these Pills. $25 for 90 count isn&#x27;t bad either, Do not buy them from your local beauty store they want $40 minimum.</li>
            <li> Every single pill in the bottle was cracked!!I would rather take my chances paying a little extra and purchasing it at a store. Never again....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back for more!  This stuff is great! Not only have the bare spots shown significant improvement, my hair is growing. (First time in years).  I&#x27;m so pleased.  Try it and give it about 3 mos.  You&#x27;ll be very pleased!!!!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I was skeptical but hopeful when I oredered these.  My hair was thinning due to stress, age and childeren and I was desperate to do something about it.  I ordered these and have been taking them for about a month so far and I will say what I&#x27;ve noticed.  First of all, my nails have never looked better.  I have always had paper thin nails that don&#x27;t grow and if they do grow, they just tear right off.  I now have actual nails that have never looked so good, I&#x27;m amazed!  My hair \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; has slowed and I&#x27;m looking forward to my hair thickening up in time but we&#x27;ll see.  It&#x27;s hard to tell the difference in hair right away but I&#x27;m hopeful.  My skin looks good but I&#x27;ve not noticed a huge difference there, but I didn&#x27;t really buy it for that.  I would totally buy these again if just for the difference in my nails.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews from men on this product, I too was desperately searching for a solution to my thinning hair. I&#x27;m glad I tried it out. Some people say they see a difference in a couple weeks, others say it takes a couple months. It took me right about two months to see the results. Its amazing! Such a stress reliever knowing I&#x27;m not helplessly losing my hair anymore. The shedding of my hair hasn&#x27;t stopped, but it has decreased. I can tell it is working because the widening circle on my crown is now filling back in. Just one helpful hint; stay consistent. I thought of discontinuing a few times because results weren&#x27;t coming. I&#x27;m glad I kept to it.</li>
            <li> Got pills in the time frame predicted by shipper. Upon opening the container I found all the pills to be cracked. I did say all not some. I was very disappointed because I read the reviews of some of the consumers and I thought that they were just being harsh on the seller but they weren&#x27;t! I will not buy from this seller again, because I am sure that the seller read all of the negative reviews about the cracks in the tablets, therefore they should have pull their expired stock from the shelves and replaced them with a new batch. This alone tells me that the bottom line is just to make money and that they are not interested in the creditability of their company.</li>
            <li> I truly believe this vitamin made my hair stop falling out.  Not sure what caused it, but thought it might be hormanal.</li>
            <li> Really didnt notice any amazing hair growth my thinning hair line may have filled in slightly, but what I did notice was it changed my menstral flow, made it very short and light  almost non exsistent, I dont know whats in the proprietary blend but it must be hormonal, maybe it had something to do with me crushing the tablets too big for me to swallow,  I no longer take these switched back to regular multi vitamins.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product is working yet.  I want to wait until the entire packet is done before I can make a real judgement call on this product.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer - will not pay triple the price even tho I have been using this product for quite some time.</li>
            <li> i spent almost 80 dollars for these nioxin pills . and these pills arrived cracked and yellow . and im not sure if i should take them or not because thats a whole lot of money , going down the drain if dont. i really wish people can be HONEST!. UPDATE!!! IM NOT SOOO PISSED ANYMORE BECAUSE THE GOOD PEOPLE AT AMAZON WAS ABLE TO GIVE ME A REFUND ! SO LESSONED LEARNED I WILL NOT EVER BUY NIOXION AGAIN EVER</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;The product really works and has excellent components, but what happened with the price?&lt;br /&gt;It used to be less than US$ 50 and now is selling for more than US$ 170??&lt;br /&gt;Like the product very much but at the new price, I will consider seeking other alternatives.</li>
            <li> makes your hair look healthy but i have been using it for 3 mths and I havent seen dramatic results in the length. I will probably buy another 90 day bottle. DO not except huge results off the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex for less than a month and already I am receiving visible results. My hair has thickened noticeably. My nails are fuller and longer. My skin is significantly softer. I purchased this product to help regrow my hair which was damaged by heat and chemicals. I did not expect such impressive results - especially in so short a time. And I did not expect my nails and skin to improve.     I am experiencing some discomfort from the soy complex phytonutrients in the formula, as I am a little sensitive to soy, but the benefits are too important to stop using it.     I am really impressed!</li>
            <li> I at first didnt see the point in getting this since my multi-vitamin had everything this had. I bought it anyway and I was really surprised! Even though my multi-vitamin had the same ingredients, this worked so much better! I noticed my hair getting thicker and  healthier! I used to use biotin (which didnt do anything), but after using this,  I will never go back. I say this product is worth a try! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but it does work and at the very least, makes your hair much healthier!</li>
            <li> I am an African American who has been attempting to grow out my hair for the past 5 years. When I began using this product last Summer (&#x27;09), I noticed that my hair was growing faster than ever...that includes ALL hair (don&#x27;t think I need to spell this one out). This product really does what it says and if you stop taking it you will notice a decreased rate in growth. If you are looking for a good product for hair growth, this is it!!!</li>
            <li> Great results highly reccommend this product. I noticed results in as little as 2 wks.</li>
            <li> I love, love these vitamins I have been using them for years. They stop your hair from shedding and and your hair will grow.</li>
            <li> My husband takes these and also uses the Nioxin shampoo and it has really made a difference in keeping his beautiful hair.  Before he started using it, there was always hair in the shower; now...no hair on the floor</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical before trying this but someone gave me two weeks worth and I tried it.  After the two weeks I thought I noticed a difference but wasn&#x27;t sure so I decided to try it for a month.  After that I was sold.  So many people have noticed the difference that I have been taking them for a year now.  I just started buying them from Amazon at almost a 50% savings from that of the salon.</li>
            <li> It would be hard to give a proper review of this product, I have only been using it for about a month now. I have noticed a change in the appearance of my hair, it&#x27;s softer and has more shine. Give me a couple more months, and I can write a more in depth review.    Rose Williams</li>
            <li> The service and the product were both great.  I will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was not sealed, I am doubtful that the pills are actually  Dioxin vitamins.    I am not happy with my order.</li>
            <li> I received Nioxin about three months ago and took one pill everyday along with lots of water daily my hair has grown at least two inches and is thicker! My hair is healthy and shinny and is very pretty. My hairstylist loves it so much that she wants me to stop wearing weaves because my hair is now about five inches past my shoulder and I am African American with natural hair. I am ordering more Nioxin vitamins today! This is a good product but take head this product does make your hair grow everywhere ladies!</li>
            <li> I started using this product approx three months. My first purchase was from JCPenney. The price was a little high but since my Beautician recommended it, I bought it anyway. My brother told me about Amazon, so I decided to see if Amazon sold this product and of course they did and the price was great and much lower than JCPenney. I will definitely be purchasing this product again and I also recommended my Sister do the same.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, and can see a HUGE difference in the strength of my hair.  I highly recommend the product as well as the company that sells it!</li>
            <li> I have taken these vitamins for several years and have gotten compliments on my hair looking better, which is what I was taking the vitamins for, more biotin in them.  I would recommend them for hair growth and better looking hair for those with thin, puny hair.</li>
            <li> I just recently starting using the product. As of right now I do not really notice too much of a difference in my hair and skin. But my nails have become stronger! I am also using a nail polish so im not sure which one is working! I will give Nioxin the credit though and i continue using to see the truth lol</li>
            <li> I found this product as a great investment, if you really want your hair and nails to grow fast, thats what you will get for sure...    take it for three months daily, and then stop for a month, so you can give your body a rest. then you can do it for 3 more months and so it goes..!    good luck!!</li>
            <li> had chronic issue with hair loss and had tried every supplement there is with no success. this product slowed my hair loss to a normal pace in just 2 weeks</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Nioxin. I myself do not like the taste of the supplement it has a kind of bitter after taste to it, but, I have found that it makes my nails grow two times as fast. I also find that taking Nioxin gives my skin that extra glow and I have smoother skin since taking the supplement. I started taking Nioxin in January of 2011 and it is now approching May of 2011 and I have not seen drastic results as far as hair growth besides little baby hairs. But I don&#x27;t know if thats the product itself working or my wishful thinking or just biological with no help from Nioxin at all. But since hair grows 1/2 inch per month I will continue to take Nioxin for six months before writing another review. Hopefully this product helps promote hair growth since that was the main reason I perchased it to begin with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old female. I started losing my hair about 14 years ago, but this year, it started coming out in fistfuls. FISTFULS!!! Every shower, every hair brush, every time someone ran their hand thru my hair. It was awful. I felt embarrassed and depressed. I finally decided I had to do something. My hairdresser recommended Nioxin. I started taking those pills the same day I started using Rogaine. Nothing happened at first. Hair was still falling out at an alarming rate. After 2 weeks, I noticed my skin looked clearer. That was the Nioxin kicking in. After 2 months, I noticed that the hair that was growing was thicker. Again, the Nioxin. After about three and a half months... it happened. My hair stopped falling out. No fistfuls when I showered. No hairbrush full of hair after even the gentle-est hairbrushing. Then after 4 months, I noticed some of the little bald patches in front weren&#x27;t bald anymore. Ladies, I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how joyful this is. My hair looks great! It&#x27;s thick, lush, manageable. I will use the one-two punch of Nioxin &amp; Rogaine til the day I die. Be patient and you will have great results, too. Good luck, ladies!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few Nature&#x27;s choice, purvana, and this one. It&#x27;s better than Purvana, Nature&#x27;s choice yielding the fullest results, it has 3x the biotin, BUT it was a thrice daily supplement, and a ill tasting horse pill. So for the price, this is worth it, since they both contain the 90 pills. My nails are going out smoothly, except I do have a little peach fuzz above my upper lip, which I typically have but it grows at an extensive rate, I manage though, it&#x27;s not horrific. Also, my eyebrows are growing quickly too, much fuller and I did notice my eyelashes looked fuller today, which is ironic since I wore brown mascara today. I&#x27;ve liked all 3 but for the price and amount, I&#x27;m going to stick with this one.</li>
            <li> After having acrylic nails on for some time, I decided to have them taken off.  Boy, were my nails in bad shape.  Tissue paper thin.  My female doctor mentioned the Nioxin vitamins and other of their products to me because my hair was starting to thin as well.  I read that the vitamins were suppose to be good for the nails as well as the hair, and decided to give it a try.  By the time I finished the first 90 day bottle, I could see that my nails were much stronger.  I can&#x27;t tell much difference in my hair yet, but I am going to give the Nioxin products 1 year before making up my mind.  Hopefully it will work.</li>
            <li> I am about to purchase another one of these bottles. After the pills really got into my system (after 2 weeks maybe), my hair was growing faster EVERYWHERE. My hairstylist said to me, \\&quot;GIRL! Your hair grows fast!\\&quot; with really wide eyes (I&#x27;VE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE!). That&#x27;s when I knew I would be buying more of these. Not to mention when my EYELASHES got even longer and thicker! What girl doesn&#x27;t want that?! This coming from a girl who already has LONG, thick eyelashes. I LOVE IT! I have a pixie bob right now, and my New Years resolution is to just let my hair GROW! Haven&#x27;t done that in 10 years. What better time then now. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to write the actual results. Ordered it based on exceptional reviews here and on other sites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a wonderful product !!!   My hair fell out entire tufts, I&#x27;ve lost all hope. And saw myself bald. Just a couple of weeks since I started taking this drug, believe it or net,but hair stopped falling out. I do not know at the expense of restoring lost hair. But definitely, I stopped losing hair. And very sorry I did not use this product before.   I recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the most expensive vitamin I have tried. I only took one bottle. So I really can&#x27;t judge if it is working. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t afford to taking more. The pills are relatively small and do not have much smell compared to many other vitamins, which is good.</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;ve only been using this product for a month and I can see the difference in my nail and hair! My hair has grown so much in such short span and I am looking foward to the next few months.</li>
            <li> I definitely see results.  I&#x27;ve been using Nioxin for about five months and my hair is growing faster after some severe breakage and shedding.  It does cause your scalp to itch initially, but it goes away after two weeks or so.  The only other negative impact is that it causes my eyebrows and other hair on the body to grow faster. I&#x27;ve also used the folicle booster and it definitely thickens spots that are thinning &amp; you only need to use a little, I apply it with a Q-tip. Overall Nioxin products are effective but a little pricey.  To me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these pills for about 3 weeks and my hair is growing in thicker already.  Great results so far.</li>
            <li> I found this product worthy of using. Saw new growth in areas that hadn&#x27;t had hair growth in the past.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much, I used to get a lot of split nails and they don&#x27;t do it any more.  My hair seem like they are growing in thicker which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with natural hair. I have been natural for about 6 years now, and my hair has NEVER been this shiny and healthy. I have been using this product since January, and I must say that it is well worth the money.  My hair is shinier and thicker.  I took my hair down from my twists about a month ago and was SHOCKED at how much my hair grew! I never really expected it to grow that much.  I realize that hair only grows about 1/2 an inch per month, so I don&#x27;t expect to have super long hair after three months. I think that the difference is that I am able to retain more hair, especially the ends. I just wanted to have a healthy head of hair, and these vitamins are awesome!! Just make sure to drink enough water with them and eat something as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Now July 1st, and I have still been taking the vitamins. I LOVE the results. I recently straightened my hair and it is down to my upper back!! This is an increase of about 3 inches since I first started using them! Also I have been taking BETTER CARE OF MY HAIR! That is the key here. For all of you who rate this with negative comments, what are you doing differently to take better care of your hair? I stopped using brushes and combs that rip my hair out, and I also changed my washing and conditioning regimen.  The results don&#x27;t lie. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I was using Phyto at first for stronger hair and nails, before switching to Nioxin after reading all of the good reviews. I used the entire 90 pills and still, no difference. In fact, my nails are extremely weak right now... When I was using Phyto my nails grew so quickly, and my hair felt thicker, so I will be going back to that brand. I switched it up simply because Nioxin is quite a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> i think this product is working for me. Ordered my second bottle. Over time i have seen a difference. Its vitamins, so cannot be bad for you.</li>
            <li> People, if your hair is falling out suddenly and dramatically please go see a doctor-that is not normal!! Why just cover up the symptoms without checking out the issue causing it?   When it happened to me, I was traumatized. It only took a week of losing my gorgeous locks for me to RUN to my doctor. Dr found I was low thyroid. Now that the underlying cause of my hair loss is addressed I have found all nioxin products to be absolutely true to their word. These vitamins have made my hair thick thick thick, but I am only on 2mnths and it is growing a little faster. I am so happy to have found it is decreasing the wrinkles in my face, my lips are plumper and the marionette lines around my mouth have almost disappeared. My skin is beautiful and my hair is thick, but the biggest difference came to my lips and face &amp; hair thickness VS speed of hair growth- which is just a bit faster. I have not noticed weird hair growth anywhere else- like others have noticed. It will not cause stomach upset. Please see a doctor if your hair is falling out dramatically- it is NOT normal.</li>
            <li> I guess it is good, but I only have taken half the bottle. My nails have not grown. My hair does feel good and like something is happening. But I guess I need to take the entire bottle before I can give you the true results.</li>
            <li> 2 inches of hair growth in a month! I was  taking 5,000mc of Biotin and it started making me breakout!!!!! I switched  to Nioxin, m hair has not fallen off like  it used  to!!!!! Skin is better :)</li>
            <li> This product is really great for nails!  I was REALLY worried about my nails!  I have been doing my own nails for years .. and getting SO many compliments on them over the years!  Over the months they started peeling to the point I just could not believe it .. of course this led to a weakness that led to breakage .. just a vicious cycle.  I was at my wits end .. didn&#x27;t know if it was caused by my diet .. a medication I was taking .. just what.  I read about this product .. decided to try it.  WOW!  By the time I was 2/3rd through the one bottle I ordered I saw a BIG improvement in my nails!  I then ordered 2 more bottles!  I am going to continue using the product .. am NOT going back to those damaged nails again!  I ALSO think it is thickening my hair .. hard to actually tell .. but I believe it is.  My hair was kind of thinning in the front and I think it looks a bit better!  But I know for SURE about the nails .. the visual is DRAMATIC!</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hair considerably for her hair growth, and it&#x27;s even helped her during her menstrual cycle.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I have to say about these vitamins! I have been using them for almost 2 weeks. I am an African-American woman with a relaxer and neck-length hair. I have read almost all of these reviews posted here on Amazon prior to purchasing mainly to gain insight on what most people thought about them. I did not purchase my vitamins through Amazon; I got mine (30 day supply) from Ulta here in Chicago on State Street. However, I will order a 90 day supply from Amazon before my current supply runs out. Just a heads up to anyone concerned about some of the pills being cracked if you order from Amazon, I&#x27;d like to say that it may just be the pill and/or how the pills are made because my pills which I purchased from an authorized vender very also cracked and I had 1 extra pill. So I don&#x27;t think it matters whether you purchase online or in a store. My pills expire 1/2013.   So, based off taking the pills for a short time I can say that my skin which is mildly acne prone has shown some improvement in terms of texture already. It was like one day I touched my face and it felt smoother, still have a few small pimples here and there. In terms of hair which was getting ready to show signs of new growth anyway since I usually get new-growth after about 4 weeks post relaxer is somewhat normal, I guess. My nails are the same and I do not want long nails so I keep them clipped anyway. So far so good...I&#x27;ll post another review about my progress soon.  I will say that you must give them time to work because I was taking some other vitamins (Maxi-Hair) that I purchased from the Vitamin Shoppe and those worked! I saw results after I started my 2 bottle, my hair in the back which was badly broken off grew back. However, I decided to try these vitamins out and if I don&#x27;t see significant results by the time I&#x27;m halfway through my 2nd bottle I&#x27;ll go back to the other vitamins. I am trying to grow my hair at least 4 inches by summer or summers end...is that possible???? Lol!!</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve only been taking this product for less than a month, I KNOW it will do it&#x27;s thing! I&#x27;ve been using the Nioxin Follical Booster for about three months now. It is wonderful!!! I lost my hair due to chemo theraphy and as it began to sprout new hair, I had a beautiful little male pattern baldness spot right in front on top of my head!!! I was devastated. A friend told me about Nioxin and after researching their products, I purchase the Follical Booster. It works!! The bald spot is mostly gone and the rest of my head is full and growing fast. My \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair has always been baby fine and thin. Now it&#x27;s still soft, but thick! Can&#x27;t believe it. So, I know that the Recharging Complex will continue to help. You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this. [[ASIN:B001394530 Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex, 90 Count]]</li>
            <li> I was visiting Dillards hair salon and noticed that they carried Nixon Hair Vitamins. Never heard of this producut before. Decided to give the vitamins a try. Soon after that I developed breast cancer and went through surgery, Chemo, and Radiation treatments.  I had to discontinue the product during this time. My hair due to the treaments become very thin to the point of ball spots through out the scalp.  As soon as the treatments were over the received the go ahead and take my vitamins.  I tell you Nioxin is the best my hair had completely returned and is fuller that ever. Shiny and full of life. I have so many people asking me \\&quot; is that your  hair or is it a wig\\&quot;? The ladies at my church are now taking Nioxin hair vitamins because they love that way my hair looks</li>
            <li> This will be a long review...So I am a first year law student, and lo and behold I stressed myself into hair loss right before midterms! I was loosing clumps in the shower and on top of that I have a skin disease that is dandruff on steroids, and had low iron, so I had a double dose of hair loss.  Well of course I hopped on to amazon since I couldnt get to my derm till I got home for thanksgiving and found this product. The first two months I didnt notice much of a change seeing as I chopped my long hair to shoulder and then later got a pixie cut.  I took it two months every day and at the end of the second month noticed that my hair fall in the shower and combing was decreasing. Plus, after having my pixie cut for one month my hair had grown a good inch in length! I am half way through my third month and I am seeing baby hairs and fuller on the top.  My hair isn&#x27;t back to pre shed but I am hoping that by continuing this pill it will get there by summer. Also, when i started the third month I started taking one pill in the morning and one in the evening before bed.  This isn&#x27;t an overnight miracle hair growth pill. It really depends on why you lost your hair and what type or hair you have in the first place to see certain results. Also, you need to make sure that there are no bigger medical issues to see huge results with this that contribute to hair loss. But overall I will continue to use this product just because it has made my hair 1) grow faster than ever 2) changed the softness and texture of my hair 3) decrease the hair shed in less than three months from 200 a day to anywhere between 50-100 a day 4) it just works as an awesome multivitamin. I dont know what the secret is in this pill because I have taken other multivitamins and not gotten these results!</li>
            <li> I use Nioxin shampoo and conditioner and have for years.  I have been taking this everyday so far but I think it is too early to tell if it works or not.  I read the other reviews which were almost all positive so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle.  After taking it for about 1 1/2 months, I started to see my existing baby hair getting longer, so my hair looks a little fuller.  I intend to keep taking it to see if this can help regrow any hair in the long term.</li>
            <li> I have been using these vitamins for about two years. My hair seems fuller, others have commented on the improved appearance. I use the Nioxin shampoo, too. It could be all in my head - wait it is all in my head. OK, joke&#x27;s over. The vitamins are reasonably priced on Amazon &amp; the shipping is fast &amp; free.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My hair is very fine and thin and while I am taking the pills my hair has new growth and gets stronger.  My nails also become stronger.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!!! I take it along with a multivitamin and biotin supplement. I have been taking these Nioxin vitamins for about six months and used to get about 1/4 inch a month of new growth----I am now getting at least 1/2 inch a month ....my skin also did a 360 and I am glowing like never before. This is def a staple in my daily hair/skin care regimine....Well worth the money</li>
            <li> I first purchased these pills a couple of months ago and the pills were cracked. I was close to finishing off the bottle so I purchased 3 more bottles and when I received them ALL the bottles had cracked pills in them! Every pill was cracked. The pills taste horrible and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s due to the cracked pills. I&#x27;ve read on hair forums that others had the same problem with the pills. I  strongly doubt I will purchase again. The taste it just too horrid.</li>
            <li> THE CONDITION SAYS \\&quot;NEW\\&quot;, BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE. THIS IS MY 2ND TIME ORDERING THESE PILLS AND ALL OF THE ORDERS HAVE BEEN OLD. I WILL NEVER ORDER COSMETICS FROM AMAZON AGAIN. ALL OF THESE PILLS ARE OLD AND DEFECTIVE. I AM GETTING A REFUND.</li>
            <li> Never been keen on the issue of hairloss but it got to a point where I had to adress it, I used this as well as a cayenne fruit supplement and slowly but surely started to see fuzzys growing back lol...happiest day of my life Will Update later to check progress.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 3rd bottle of the Nioxin pills. I love this stuff! In the 6 months of taking Nioxin I&#x27;ve noticed longer and stronger nails, which is great. But the main reason I am in love with Nioxin is solely based on what it has done to my hair. It is so healthy now. I have had thin hair all of my life and I feel like I have a new head of hair, really! I am able to style it in different ways now that it is thicker. As others have mentioned, it does make your hair grow EVERYWHERE so plan on waxing and shaving more often. I really do not have one bad thing to say about this pills. As far as healthier skin - the jury is still out. I have changed my skin care regimen so it is hard to give 100% credit to Nioxin, but I can assure you that it has not harmed my skin in anyway. If you are contemplating rather or not to purchase these pills, just do it. You will notice a difference within the first bottle (90 days).</li>
            <li> First off let me state that I&#x27;m not basing this review on the performance of the supplement, since I haven&#x27;t taken it yet and in any case, my opinion would be subjective  See addendum at bottom for my opinion after taking them).  I&#x27;m basing it on the product label I now have in front of me.  If I&#x27;d been able to look at the label, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this item.  I spent about 30 minutes searching the web for a label before I decided to buy this, but in the end, all I could find was a list of ingredients on the official Nioxin site, which told me what was in it, but not how much.  So, I decided to post my review without waiting around to see if I like it after taking it for three months, because I thought others would benefit from a look at the label.  I&#x27;m not familiar with some of the ingredients in the \\&quot;proprietary blend\\&quot;, but several of the vitamins (especially Biotin and Zinc) are quite low doses.  Biotin content in my last hair vitamin (GNC Brand) was 3000 mcg--10x the amount in the Nioxin.  This surprises me, because Biotin is usually such a huge factor in hair loss treatments.  Considering how many people have posted positive reviews of the product, it may well be that the magic is in the herbs.  If you do give the Nioxin vitamins a try, be aware that you may want to supplement it with Biotin (and possibly Zinc as well).    For reference, here is the product label:  Vitamin A 1250 IU  25%  Vitamin C 30 mg  50%  Vitamin D 200 IU  50%  Thiamine 1.5 mg  100%  Riboflavin 1.7mg  100%  Niacin 25mg  125%  Vitamin B6 2mg  100%  Folic Acid 200 mcg  50%  Vitamin B12 6 mcg  100%  Biotin 300 mcg  100%  Pantothenic Acid 25mg  250%  Zinc 3mg  20%  Proprietary Blend 235 mcg...  Wild Yam Root  Sarsaparilla  Stinging Nettle  Oat  Pygeum  Saw Palmetto  Bladderwrack  Ubiquinone  Tocotrienols  Soy Phytotosterol Complex  Addendum 10/01/2011  To answer the question of the person who commented:  Serving size was one tablet.  Sorry I didn&#x27;t think to include that in theoriginal review.    After taking the entire bottle, I have to say that my hair is a great deal thicker than it was.  I can&#x27;t verify for certain that this is because of the Nioxin supplement, since I also started taking supplements for Thyroid at the same time, but I&#x27;m convinced enough to buy more and raise my review up to 5 stars.  Something I&#x27;m taking helped tremendously and it&#x27;s as likely the Nioxin tablets as the other things I added (or a combination thereof). The vitamin content may be weak, but in my hair&#x27;s opinion, the herbs apparently make the supplements worth taking.  FYI:  The thyroid supplements I&#x27;m taking are Nature&#x27;s Way Kelp and Natural Sources Raw Thyroid and I&#x27;ve been also taking Biotin from Wal-Mart)</li>
            <li> Ladies - this vitamin is the bomb! I have very VERY brittle nails (biting them doesn&#x27;t help either :P) and rather thin hair. And with the colder weather knocking on the door, I&#x27;ve been shedding worse than a Golden Retriever!!! I&#x27;ve always had that problem, and trust me when I say I tried every fancy vitamin and product out there. So then I invested time in some research and found Nioxin. Yes, I was skeptical at first as not every supplement works equally well for everyone, but after reading all the raging reviews I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s been only 2 weeks as I&#x27;ve been taking it and I have nails! haha Seriously, they are actually growing and are growing fast and strong! Sorry for the gross TMI but they are becoming too tough to bite! Yay :) Although, my hair is still falling out the same, I can feel it getting smoother and silkier. So, fingers crossed, I&#x27;m hoping to get more results for the hair too.   It&#x27;s worth a shot!!! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thru Amazon.  This is my second bottle and I have not noticed any difference in my hair.  However, I will continue to use these Nioxin tablets for awhile longer.  Amazon does a great job getting all my orders to me timely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time I was ordering this product from Amazon, I was paying less than $30 for a 90-count bottle.  I want to order more thru Amazon but this product is now absorbently costly.  Why??</li>
            <li> I had extreme post-partum shedding, and it&#x27;s hard enough being a new mom without being a new Bald mom.  I went to the dermatologist and he gave me a topical solution, but what really worked was these vitamins!  OMG, I can See my hair growing!  In Febuary when I first purchased these vitamins, I was bald in the front of my head...now I have an afro!  And my hair is so soft and healthy!!  I know if I keep taking these vitamins, by the end of the year, I&#x27;ll have hair down to my ears or neck.  Thank God for Nioxin!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, this thing works. I&#x27;m 22 years old with my hair half down my back. My hair had been shedding like crazy for about 5 months, it got me so stressed out I think it was beginning to cause more hair to fall out. So I came across this product and the reviews seemed great and the price was good so I bought it like a month and half ago. Been taking them every day and WOW my hair has stopped shedding like crazy; I mean it&#x27;s only a few strands in the shower, a few when I brush it and a few here and there, nothing alarming. Actually it seems fewer strands are falling out than ever for me, super stocked about it. My skin does seem a bit healthier, but then again I&#x27;ve always had nice healthy skin, with the exception of the random pimples I would get, but I haven&#x27;t had one for a while, so it could be the Nioxin? Not sure, I&#x27;ll give it the benefit of the doubt though. My nails though, OH MY!!! super strong!!! I just recently had to take off my acrylics and I was expecting my nails to be all nasty looking and super weak because that&#x27;s what acrylics do to your natural nails, damages them. But even my manicurist was really  impressed at how strong my nails were. I mean it&#x27;s only been a week since I&#x27;ve had them taken off and my nails feel pretty much normal, not bending or breaking like they usually do after having acrylics on. This product really does work, I&#x27;m glad I bought it and I will keep buying more :]</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and I haven&#x27;t really notice anything yet. I am finding I have to shave more but I can&#x27;t tell if it making my hair grow. I&#x27;m going to keep at it though. I would imagine if my hair is growing everywhere else it has to be growing on my head. I def will continue to use. I even have my little sister using it! I&#x27;ll check back in about a month to give an update tho.</li>
            <li> at 59 years my hair started falling out, big time. i bought this product (two) because the price was spot on and i knew i would need to take the supplements for a while. it worked. my hair stopped falling out. i returned to buy more and could not believe my eyes when i saw the price. i am not rockerfeller and this is just way more than i can afford. so you&#x27;ll know who falls below upper class; we&#x27;ll be the ones with no hair.</li>
            <li> Okay so I waited until I completed 2 months of taking this product to write my review because I wanted it to be as accurate as possible. I have not missed a day of taking my Nioxin and I feel the product has worked okay for me. I have noticed a decent amount of growth. I don&#x27;t have an issue with hair growth, my issue is with keeping my hair healthy as it grows so I have also opted to begin with protective styling (less heat and chemicals) to assure that I am not counter acting against anything that the Nioxin could be doing for my hair. I am African American, with relaxed hair so new growth can be seen easily in my hair. The growth is not significant for me but there has been rapid growth, a lot faster than if I wasn&#x27;t using this product. Typically, I can wait a few months (with normal growth) for a relaxer retouch but while taking this product, it seemed, I was in need of a retouch within 3 weeks.Also, I pluck my gray strands from my scalp and lately I have been plucking those little suckers a lot more often while taking this product! Those little gray new growth strands keeping popping up out of nowhere! I have to keep my tweezers in my pocket these days. LOL! My product arrived in tact and without broken pills like some other reviewers experienced. I am approaching my last 30 days on this bottle and will be purchasing more soon. I have taken other hair vitamins in the past and people say that these products don&#x27;t work but I beg to differ. I will continue to take my Nioxin...oh and just the other day, I was in a Marshall&#x27;s store and saw that they sold the Shampoo and Conditioner from Nioxin. I got both for $20! So now I am using the Nioxin in conjunction with the S&amp;C. So have I noticed any super significance in hair growths? No. But have I noticed a change in the normal growth of my hair? Yes, absolutely. No weight gain, no unwanted facial hair, or hair on any other part of my body for that matter. I purchased this for $36.99 and now it&#x27;s $129.99!! WHAT? WHY?!!</li>
            <li> My hair got stronger and Healthier. I used this with other products, but I know that this helped a little. Not to mention I received extra vitamins a day.</li>
            <li> For the amount of product you receive, the price on these vitamins is unbeatable.  My hairstylist recommended them to me as my hair sheds quite a bit when washing or combing.  Since taking these vitamins the shedding seems to be way down.  Also does a great job to strengthen my nails and have few breakouts on my face if I take them consistently.</li>
            <li> SUPERB! I have been using this along with Biotin and BOTH are remarkable- my hair has grown so long- many inches- in just the past few months!  I Highly recommend Nioxin - I take it once in the morning - Amazing product! Very pleased with the progress so far!</li>
            <li> This is my first review on amazon. I purchased this product about 3 weeks ago. I probably was the most skeptical of all buyers. Im a 29 year old male and my hair was thinning on the top. I started noticing changes in about a week. Im on my third week and my hair growth is tremendous. After reading most of the reviews, it would appear that this product effectiveness depends on the severity of your hair loss. I am not a doctor, physician or anything. I am just a young man who noticed that I was thinning on top. My nails are more firm. That&#x27;s kind of bad thing for me because I dont want long hard nails but this stuff does what it says its going to do. I also recommend eating more protein. I started eating about 120 grams of protein a day. Just a suggestion. Thanks for reading</li>
            <li> May i start out with that this product may not even be authentic.  I went to the official nioxin website and they don&#x27;t even sell a 90 count bottle..so that made me a little suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I did not see increased hair growth whatsoever.  It may have kept my hair healthy, but compared to other vitamins I&#x27;ve taken, this had low mg&#x27;s of its ingredients making it less effective and less value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: i will not be purchasing this product again since i have found better and alternative vitamins that give me results</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning from wearing micro braids for years.  I took my braids out and started going to the salon once a week again.  My hair was so thin and and ugly to me, but I kept going to the salon.  I remember the salon owner telling me that hair repair starts from the inside and suggested these pills to me.  I finished the bottle I purchased yesterday (Saturday), I ordered another bottle today and requested two-day shipping.  These pills are definitely working for me, my hair feels more course.  My hair is also growing very fast, which I did not buy the product for because I like wearing my hair short, but I wanted the fullness, now I have it!  I cannot say much about my nails because I have always had very strong nails.  One more mention, I was also using the Ovation Hair Treatment system which may have contributed to the hair growth.  Now, I am just going with Nioxin Intensive Therapy.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of vitamins from COSTSELL which turns out to be old and out of date.  According the Nioxin, if your pills are cracked, they are old.  They recommend that you return pills and purchase from an authorized salon.  Nioxin does NOT authorize sales online through any vendor.</li>
            <li> I have alopecia areata so I have patches of hair missing around my head (sometimes big, sometimes small patches).  It&#x27;s a little embarrassing, but there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it.  It&#x27;s in my genes.  People with alopecia areata will have patches of hair that go through the growing phase and resting phase.  Although, these pills do not cure my alopecia, it does speed up the hair growth when hair in that region re-enter the growing phase.  I have tried other biotin supplements (like the ones from the health sections in target and costco), but I would say these have worked the best for me.  It&#x27;s great that you only need to take it once a day, too!  The other brands required that I take one after every meal.</li>
            <li> I have been doing high protein diets and it&#x27;s taking its toll on my hair by making my fine hair dry and breakable. Have been using Nioxin for a couple of weeks now and it seems to be helping.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I began using this product in conjunction with the Nioxin #2 cleanser, conditioner and scalp activator system several months after I&#x27;d started using the hair products.  My fiancée and I had noticed a difference in the thickness and distribution of my hair while using the hair products and I had the recharging complex recommended to me by her stylist.  I&#x27;m just about to finish my first 90 count bottle and must say there was definitely even more hair growth taking the supplement.  I won&#x27;t lie and say my hair is like it was 10 years ago, but my receding hairline filled in some and my vertex bald spot shrunk considerably.  As a side note, regrowing my beard happened much quicker this time around while on this product.  I say it&#x27;s worth a shot to anyone out there who has noticed more of their hair jumping ship lately, and especially if you&#x27;re just beginning to bald.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for six months; it has helped strengthen my hair and nails.  My hair grows pretty fast; now that I&#x27;m taking the supplements my hair is growing even faster.  I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, after 18 days my hair looks better, feels better and stronger. Im loosing much less amounts of hair. It worked for me, and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I been using nioxin for abt march 12th 2012 i can tell the thickness in my hair i order a 90ct an i want to keep using nioxin but the price is to much a friend told me u can get them in walmart hair salon i call an they do sell nioxin for 21$ so i will b going there.</li>
            <li> The product is awesome, however I will never order it from this last company that I did because they take forever to send it to you.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for maintaining hair in healthy condition.  I have tried other products but I see the difference within a week after taking the Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex.  The 90 count makes it easier to continue the treatment rather than run out of the product and miss unnecessary day of taking it.  The longer you take it the better the results.  I have been taking it for years.</li>
            <li> My Granny always say \\&quot;Stick to the evil that you know.\\&quot; This advice I deviated from out of curiosity for another seemingly more popular product. I have used &#x27;Phytophanere Dietary Supplement&#x27; tablets for 2 months and have received lustrous hair results. Just this morning I have had my co-workers admiring the life and shine in my strands. So Nioxin promised the same and even better results and this I decided to give this product a try with the 90 day supply. Amidst all the reviews on cracked tablets I decided to risk this factor hoping I would not receive defective pills.   Sure enough when I opened my package I found that MY PILLS WERE ALL CRACKED too!!! The investment made for me to purchase my items are unique, in that my purchases are delivered to me beyond the US borders. Hence, I am plagued with the perpetual nightmare of Customs Duties, Taxes and and Air Freight cost. This is not fun, due to the fact I must always prepare to add an additional 20% - 70% to the value of the original price of the goods purchase.   So in this case I my order total was $27.15, plus other stipulated charges, totalling $16.24. This is not fun when the result of a defect and/or the need for returns and refunds will usually be my loss at some point. What made my situation worse was our Customs policy does not allow export of drugs/dietary supplements, which means I am not allowed to send my item back to the US for a refund. I was distraught, so again I called Amazon, hoping for a solution and again they came through for me. With special references made to Ladies; Laura F. and Cindy (Rachel I) who advised the best steps to take for recourse. Based on my dilemma my case was assessed and a full refund granted minus (understandably) Customs charges.  Personally I would not have given any stars for this product as I never had an opportunity to even try it for it&#x27;s so called rated performance. The risk of still ingesting these pills was a chance I would not take because I did make contact themanufactures and they too advised not to ingest the pills in it&#x27;s defective state. So word to the wise, a number of persons have had identical bad experiences, one must also give considerations to the numbers that have not taken the time to express their misfortunes with the same item, hence the probability of your item being defective will therefore be high.   I am happy to say that since my report, Amazon now has this product under review. Thanks again Amazon I will today be purchasing phytophanere dietary supplement.</li>
            <li> I had to return this product.  The container did not come with the safety cover and all the pills looks old and cracked and also looked a little different from what I bought in the store previously.  I didn&#x27;t feel it was safe to take these so I returned them.</li>
            <li> This product maybe good. But I had to discontinue after 2 weeks due to constipation. The tablets are middle size compared to other brands of vitamins. Do not have any strong smell.</li>
            <li> My wife is using this product. She is getting result after a month. Its a great prdt and she noticed thickness of hair. She tried many things before but after reading all reviews in internet and taking this medicine, this is the best pdt so far. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the product and it does work but all of a sudden folks are selling this product at ridicilous prices its like price gouging for gasline here. I can&#x27;t believe the robbery..</li>
            <li> I used to take this when the 90pill bottle was $30.  Now it&#x27;s at $170.  I guess the price is a function of supply and demand, but it&#x27;s getting a bit ridiculous.  I have now switched over to another product.</li>
            <li> I have Nioxin 5 stars, not because it earned it, but because I knew people would be more apped to reading it. I loved Nioxin when I was taking it. Its cost have increased like crazy. Two to Three months ago the cost was only like $25-30 at the most. This $179 is totally insane. But another down fall is once you stop taking it your hair breaks all over. I am an African American 20yr old, and my hair was between shoulder and bra length in Febuary. In March about 3weeks after running of Nioxin my hair was breaking severly. I dont use chemicals or heat and I could not figure out what it was. I have gone to both doctor and dermatoligist, who says there no underlined cause, other than unpricribed supplements. Then I thought\\&quot; what supplements....Nioxin\\&quot; it works wounders when your using it and is a nightmare when your not. Because of so many reviews the priced has jumped.I cant afford it anymore. I hate the fact that my hair has broken off so much I now have a wig because(which i hate being forced to wear) of this. A total nightmare.</li>
            <li> Let me first state that the shipper is super fast!!! I use the nioxin pills which are awesome with pure biotin and vitamin E pills and my hair is super thick and has grew a little since I started this regimen.</li>
            <li> within two weeks i noticed increased hair growth at my scalp and increased growth of my finger and toe nails.  at the third week my legs were really itchy and i noticed that hair was growing faster and thicker there as well. by the end of the first month everything seems to have stabilized and not growing so quickly, but my nails are stronger and my hair is fuller and stronger and i&#x27;ve ordered another bottle. unfortunately, the primary reason i got this was for my skin and there has been no change in my skin and i had to buy something else. would not recommend to improve skin health.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a friend and on Youtube for hair growth. I&#x27;m AA with natural coily healthy hair that wanted to grow my hair faster so I order this product and began taking them for a month in half. I was excited to see my nails grow, but hair started  THINNING OUT! I WILL NEVER USE THESE PRODUCTS AGAIN... I hope to regain my hair thickness by taking a biotin supplement, which I probably should done in the first place instead of these overpriced vitamins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teen guy who made the mistake of getting my teen-heartthrob-esque bangs all cut off, and started to regret that decision pretty quick! So I found this stuff.  As I write this, I&#x27;ve just finished the 90-count bottle and my bangs have grown back completely! For 90 days straight, I took the pills and massaged my scalp daily, just like I was supposed to, and what do you know, it paid off. I&#x27;m pretty happy!    I can only give this 4 out of 5 stars though, because there actually WEREN&#x27;T 90 pills in the container. It was, like, 87. Not a big deal really, but it&#x27;s something. Otherwise, solid product!       Oh yeah, and my eyelashes grew REALLY FAST. Like, they&#x27;d get really long and 4-5 of them would fall out at the end of the day to make room for more.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical like most others of trying something new, but these definitely work. My hair is naturally thin and fine, and it gets a lifeless look to it if I dont wash it every other day and keep it layered. These have grown my hair out, and added a TAD bit of thickness... Not as thick as I&#x27;d like it to be, but I definitely see the difference after 3 weeks. I bought the 30 day supply to give them a try, but I&#x27;ll definitely get the 90 day the next go around.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended these vitamins because my hair was falling out.  After using for about three weeks, I noticed that when I washed my hair, it wasn&#x27;t falling out as much.  I just went back to her this past week after taking vitamins for two months and she noticed the difference right away.  I get a lot of compliments on how my hair looks so healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;ve read the reviews and people swear that it makes a difference.  I just had a baby 5 months ago and from what I remember from my first pregnancy, this is about the time that the nice extra hair you had during pregnancy, starts to fall out.  The one thing I do notice is that my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be falling out as much as with my first pregnancy.  I do have some loss, but no where near what it was like the first time. I think this product might be holding on to the extra hair. I plan to keep using this product because it has a lot of good vitamins and it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your skin too.  One important note though is that people have told me my complexion looks really good.  I think that could be from the vitamins.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my beautician, but quite expemsive.  I went on Amazon, found it and the price was reasonable so I ordered it.  After taking Nioxin for about a month, the hair began to grow in where I was becoming very bald.  My hair is now perfect all over my head--I LOVE NIOXIN, and would recommend it highly,  JH  Arkansas</li>
            <li> I had gastric bypass surgery in June and was losing ALOT of hair about 3 weeks after taking the Nioxim it stoppedthank goodness!</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old caucasian woman with long blond hair.  Up until the last year, my hair had alway been thick and beautiful. I used to get tons of compliments on my hair. About a year ago, I started noticing that my pony tail was thinner and I thought maybe I was just imagining it... and then my hair dresser confirmed my suspicions and made a comment about how my hair seemed thinner.  Naturally I freaked out and started doing research on what I could do about this.  I spoke to one of my girlfriends who I knew had lost a ton of her hair after having her first baby (I have no children).  Her hair was falling out in clumps after she delivered and she has long dark brown hair so you could see her scalp beacuse of the contrast between her dark hair and the white scalp.  She told me about Nioxin.  She took it for about 2 years (her baby just turned 3).  Her hair is now very long, thick and beautiful and it is super shiny.  She no longer takes Nioxin and her hair still looks great.  I ordered my first bottle about 7 months ago.  I took 2 pills a day at first (even though the recommended dose is 1 pill a day) but recently my doctor advised against this so I dropped down to 1 a day.  I have definetely seen a difference in my hair.  I have new hair growth along my temples and throughout my scalp.  How do I know?  I get my hair highlighted so my stylist has to part my hair all over to get the dye on it and she said I have new hair growth everywhere.  I notice new \\&quot;flyaways\\&quot; when I pull my hair back into a pony.  I have also noticed that my eyebrows are thickening up (they had stopped growing completely prior to taking Nioxin) and my eyelashes are thicker.  I will caution that I have had to be more aggressive with the management of my unwanted body hair.  It has made my facial hair grow faster (ie chin hair, upper lip, and the peach fuzz on my cheeks) and I also think my arms hairs are slightly longer than they were previously.  Despite that -- Is it worth it?  Absolutely.  Most women take care of all this pretty regularly anyway.  Try this product.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  ps I had someone at work refer to me as Rapunzel last week!!! :)</li>
            <li> i had no any problem when i took the first 30 count. however, when i started the second one with 90 counts, my heart started beating rapidly. so i got to have to stop taking it.</li>
            <li> This has made my hair so much healthier!  This is my second bottle and I can really tell a difference in the reduction of losing hair and it&#x27;s growing faster.  I haghly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product can assist in hair regrowth, I believe it helps grow your hair and probably nails but I have had the same problem for many years and I only take this often because I don&#x27;t know what else to take, but it really does not regrow your hair...maybe each situation is different.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first 30 day bottle of the Nioxin pills..I havent seen any results yet; I realize things take time so thats why I just purchased a 90 day supply. After that if no results are seen by me then I&#x27;m calling it quits!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THESE PILLS BECAUSE A FRIEND RECOMMENDED THEM AND EVERYONE IMMEDIATELY STARTED NOTICING HOW FAST MY HAIR WAS GROWING. THESE PILLS WORK FAST, I WAS SKEPTICAL BECAUSE OTHER HAIR PILLS DON&#x27;T DO WHAT THEY CLAIM. BUT NIOXIN REALLY DOES WORK. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR HAIR GROWTH, AND FOR YOUR HAIR TO LOOK &amp; FEEL HEALTHY, THESE ARE THE PILLS TO GET.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex for three months now after purchasing the 90-count bottle here on Amazon.  Like many other reviews mentioned - my pills were all cracked.  I&#x27;m not sure what the huge issue with this is - maybe that means they&#x27;re old?  I&#x27;m not sure.  In any case, after taking these vitamins daily for three months, I do think they helped improve the quality of my hair and skin (my nails were already fine).  Overall, my hair and skin just seemed healthier and less dull and I received multiple compliments on my complexion within the last month or so.  With that being said - this is NOT a miracle pill...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main intent of purchasing these vitamins was to go along with their shampoo and conditioner systems for thinning hair.  A lot of the reviews declared that these vitamins made their hair grow significantly faster and for me that simply wasn&#x27;t the case.  It did make my hair seem healthier, but I did not grow any new hair and I didn&#x27;t notice any increase in hair growth at all.  So, I definitely would NOT recommend purchasing these vitamins with the intent of helping them regrow your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second issue with these vitamins, also mentioned in other reviews, is that they&#x27;re really not much different than the vitamins available at any CVS, Target, etc.  After bringing the bottle with me to compare vitamin content in the Nioxin pills versus other vitamins, I found that the Centrum daily multivitamin had almost the exact same levels of each and every vitamin found in the Nioxin pills.  While browsing I also came across some vitamins specifically labeled to improve hair and skin and these vitamins had WAY more of the exact same vitamins provided by each Nioxin pill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, please - DO NOT purchase these vitamins thinking they are going to result in amazing hair regrowth and if you do want to take a vitamin for improved skin and hair, go to the store and spend $7 on a bottle of multivitamins vs $40+ or Nioxin.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I have been taking Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex for about a month-and-a-half and can already visibly notice the difference in the condition of my hair, skin, and nails.  My hair is shinier and I am even growing new hairs on my scalp!  Unbelievable.  My skin appears more elastic and moist.  My nails are growing and not \\&quot;flaking\\&quot; like they used to; they are strong.  I am impressed.  Just ordered my second bottle today.  At about 25 or 26 cents per table, this product is very affordable...</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of the Nioxin Intensive Therapy treatment, 90 ct.  I am still not sure I can see any difference--but since I realize it can sometimes take 6 months, I will continue with the treatment.  I do know Nioxin is a good product and their other products do really work.  I do know I saw better results with my nails  by using knox gelatin daily.  Can&#x27;t see any improvement in the strength of my nails yet--or the strength of my hair.  Hope I will see results at the end of this bottle.  If not I will have to seriously consider whether or not the expense is warranted to continue with the treatment.</li>
            <li> Have been taking these vitamins for years. Don&#x27;t ever want to be without them. Take one in the afternoon to keep me going for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> The product was sent quickly and received in new condition.  Was nice to be able to find the product without having to pay salon pricing.  Was very pleased with the processing time on this transaction and the product is something I will continue to buy.  Was a great transaction all around.</li>
            <li> Started 9th August 2011: 3 month supply bottle    ist month update: Broke me out for the first week and i almost stopped takking it.  Boy am I glad i didn&#x27;t!!!! By four weeks my natural hair had grown so much and it is sooo soft, almost like baby hair especially at the crown.  I waxxed my eyebrows the same day i started taking the pills. And i kid you not, four weeks later, my eyebrows have as much growth as a two month wait.  The best surprise has been the improvement in my skin!  After fighting post acne marks for over a  year,  my skin texture is improving leaps and bounds after startinf Nioxin.  Yesterday my brother in law, sister and  coworker complimented me on how much better my skin looked! I got the three month supply so i can\\&quot;t wait to see how much more these pills do!  Will update in four weeks time on october 9th.     It&#x27;s definitely worth the try</li>
            <li> I think the title speaks for itself however, for those of you that need more here it is.  Do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dollars. STOP.</li>
            <li> Great product! really helps the hair to grow faster! My son 19, using it with Men&#x27;s Premium Minoxidil 15% &amp; Azelaic Acid 5% DHT Inhibitor. In 2 months all of his hair grow back and more then he had before.</li>
            <li> Nioxin is a wonder vitamin, worth every penny. My hair dresser recommended it and I&#x27;m so glad she did. Since I&#x27;ve taken the vitamins, my hair is in the best condition it has ever been. I relax my hair and have for years. My hair was in an extremely fraigle and damaged condition, it was dry, breaking, falling out and very unhealthy. Now my hair is in excellent condition, stronger, shiny, more resillient and is growing. I love the vitamins andI would recommend them highly to anyone looking to have the healthiest hair of their lives. I recieve so many compliments on how healthy and beautiful my hair looks. Thank you Nioxin!</li>
            <li> My good friend and hairstylist recommended I try these vitamins and they have been absolutely fabulous.  My hair has been very damaged from all the times I have switched hair colors over the years and was brittle,dry and thin from all the breakage and abuse. Since I have begun taking the vitamins my hair has gotten thicker, softer,longer,shinier and just all around better.  It feels like my hair is well nourished now.  Also, once I ran out of these for about a month and I noticed my hair started to get dry and brittle again.  Totally worth the money.  Oh and it also has helped my fingernails to come in stronger and more quickly, it really helped to repair them after I removed my acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin vitamins was recommend to me by a friend.  This supplement has improve my hair conditions tremendously.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These are great vitamins.  I have an allergy to horsetail which is usually an ingredient in most hair vitamins but these do not have it.  There is no vitamin smell and was able to get a good price on Amazon for them.  My nails do grow and my hair feels better and I definately would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 1 month now. There are no dramatic results but I can see that my hair is a little longer. Other hairs on my body have also grown more than usuall. The hair on my arms, eyebrows, upper lip grow faster than usuall and I have to pluck and wax more often now than what I used to. It seems like it is a very good product. I think that after finishing up the 90 day bottle, the real difference will be seen. My hair feels a little longer but it is too soon to have big results. I am very optimistic about this product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical about things like this but decided to give these a try.  My hair was thin due to my thyroid being out of wack, and I got on pills for that at the same time that I started these. What a difference! Not night &amp; day but a definite improvement. I have all these hairs popping up everywhere I wanted. Part of me wonders if it&#x27;s because I got my thyroid sorted - but considering there&#x27;s hair growing Everywhere - I have to credit these. I&#x27;ve been taking them for... about a month and a half. There is a definite improvement. Patience &amp; commitment is a must. I take one every morning along with my little thyroid pill. When my 90 count bottle is gone, I&#x27;ll get another one for sure.</li>
            <li> I am a Filipina who had dreadlocks for 4 years.  After cutting them off, I noticed my hair on the top was noticeably thinner.  This was due to the constant weight and pulling on my scalp.  My natural part also became super wide, and I  had what looked like a bald spot on the top of my head.      I have been taking these pills for about 1 1/2 months now, but I noticed results after only a few weeks.  While I can&#x27;t say 100% that the bald spot filled in, my hair has been growing like a weed, covering any patches.  I also notice when I part my hair, it&#x27;s not as wide as it used to be.  My hair also looks so shiny, thick, and healthy.    I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Whithin two weeks of using the product, I saw who my hair lost diminished.  You need to be faithful to the product and take your vitamin every night in order to see the results.</li>
            <li> These vitamins really do what they are supposed to do! I recommend that they be purchased through Amazon because you get more for your money. You are likely to see a difference in your skin, nail and hair growth within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> If you take the vitamins faithfully you will notice a marked improvement in hair growth and thickness. I am very happy with the results of the oral Nioxin!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over a month now and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is much thicker! I&#x27;ve also seen that it is growing at a faster rate.   However, I&#x27;ve never really had skin or complexion issues, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s improved my skin health.   My eyebrows are growing out much faster, so I have to get them waxed more often now! Also, my fingernails are growing very, very fast.   Overall, I will continue to use this product and I&#x27;m anxious to see my results after 3 months. I will be ordering some more soon!</li>
            <li> Just received this product today, and the shipment was quick and on time, so A+ to the distributer! I&#x27;m 26 years old and have always had fine/thin hair but never had any problems with it growing in length (although it does reach a \\&quot;breaking point\\&quot; about half way down my back). But the baby hairs I had around my temples are gone, and the hair at the nape of my neck (which was the thickest spot) is nothing like it used to be. I have really strong, healthy nails and decent skin but it is dry. I hope this product will thicken up the thinning patches and make my nails even stronger and add some hydration to my skin. Giving it 3 stars for good delivery from distributor and hoping for the best!</li>
            <li> These \\&quot;supplements\\&quot; are a joke.  I have been using them religiously (taking one everyday) for the past 6 months and there has been NO improvement in my hair.  So basically I wasted $50 on this junk ($25 for a 3 month supply).  Oh, and don&#x27;t forget that I&#x27;ve also been using Nioxin&#x27;s Shampoo for Thinning Hair (ANOTHER $20) as well and even the combination of Nioxin products have done NOTHING.    Don&#x27;t waste your money on this overpriced, overhyped garbage.  PLEASE save your money.  The only thing that can truly help thinning hair is Rogaine and possibly taking actual Biotin pills (which are a heck of a lot cheaper and have a higher dosage as well).  Again, I&#x27;m trying to save you money, so please don&#x27;t waste your money on crap!</li>
            <li> I am about to order this product for the 8th time and swear by these little pills for rapid strong hair &amp; nail growth. I have 2 friends who also use them now having seen my hair, one being my hairdresser who has seen her own improvement in thinning hair at the crown. I often get comments on my thick, healthy, bouncy hair and attribute it totally to my constant use of Nioxin vitamins. This is the only item in the range I use and would never be without it. Two years later I still think their the best thing out there for our hair and nails!</li>
            <li> I first got these back in October 2011 from a local beauty supply shop but they ran out &amp; I found them here &amp; ordered them. It is now January 2012 &amp; I&#x27;ve noticed a real growth spurt. My hair is at least 2\\&quot; longer. I&#x27;m African American with fine 4a/b hair &amp; have gone natural after over 20 years of curly perms. It&#x27;s taken 2 years for my hair to stop producing that rough \\&quot;scab hair\\&quot;that comes in after years of perms due to damage to follicles, regain its original texture, &amp; become healthy again. Another problem was slowed growth. Since starting these vitamins my hair has started to grow faster, softer &amp; healthier. I&#x27;d heard raves about these vitamins on youtube, reviews here, &amp; on message boards &amp; decided to try them.Folks said it made hair all over their bodies grow,even eyebrows. So far it&#x27;s just working on my head hair. Not much change in eyebrows...at least not yet. I plan to continue using these vitamins. I think their effectiveness is due to the fact that they break down DHT, a form of male hormone that men &amp; women produce more of as they get older. It&#x27;s known to cause thinning hair &amp; baldness in midlife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*******************************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE STOPPED USING THESE VITAMINS DUE TO PRICE INCREASE! Another reviewer said it was because the company recalled them due to a health concern &amp; now leftover supply is low but demand is high.  Another website said it&#x27;s being reformulated &amp; repackaged  &amp; will be available in the fall &amp; that the leftover supply is safe .Anyhow when I ran out &amp; saw the price increase &amp; heard about the possible health scare &amp; reformulation delay I switched to HAIROMEGA DHT (available at Amazon) which works just as well if not better. I&#x27;ve had excellent growth this summer.</li>
            <li> Being over 60 my hair, eye brows and eye lashes are thinning, as expected, but I thought I should at least try to find something that would help slow the process. My husband and I started with Nioxin shampoo and conditioner over a year ago. We have both noticed our grey hair is disappearing. We have both been taking the \\&quot;intensive therapy recharging complex\\&quot; now for 6 months and we have both noticed changes in hair growth. My eyelashes on top have grown longer. My bottom lashes had spaces with no lashes at all. I noticed after 3 months new lashes were growing and filling in the spaces! I mentioned this to the gal that cuts my hair and she said that another one of her clients uses Nioxin and said the same thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on other reviews I have read about this and people swear that it makes a difference. My hair has been falling out and I was starting to get worried and need an effective product to stop it. This product so far has kind of lessen the amount of hair that is falling out.  I do have some loss, but no where near what it was like before. I think this product might be holding on to the extra hair. I plan to keep using this product because it has a lot of good vitamins and it&#x27;s supposed to be good for your skin too. One important note though is that people have told me my complexion looks really good. I think that could be from the vitamins.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week... and it&#x27;s suppose to take around 3 months to show progress I think.  Sooooo, in any case, so far it seems like a great deal.  Considering the price of Biotin supplements, etc, this seems like a much more precise way to try and address hair loss, while being cost efficient via Amazon&#x27;s great price!    Dustin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have very fine naturally wavy hair.  A few months ago I noticed the fullness of my hair was getting thinner, especially when I put it up in a pony tail to work out.  I&#x27;ve been using the Nioxin Intensive Therapy for about 2 weeks and already see a difference. When I wash/comb my hair there is very little shedding and my roots feel a bit thicker. I also notice my nails feel stronger and are growing pretty fast.  Lastly, when my order arrived..there were NO cracked caplets.  I know this was a major complaint for some of the reviewers. Will come back in another month or two with an update.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles of Nioxin and all pills in both bottles are cracked... From research I have discovered that this could possibly mean that these pills are not what they say they are or are old.</li>
            <li> Months ago i have cut my hair really short and i want to make it longer. i have read a lot of good review on this product and decided to try. After 3 weeks of using this product my i started to lose my hair like crazy. it have never happened in my life. I have never had to face with losing my hair like now. when i wake up every morning i see my pillow is full of hair. when i brush my hair by hand the hair come out like crazy. at first i thought this was not because of this product because i have read so many good review in here. however, i decided to stop taking the pills and after 2 weeks, my hair stop losing. i read the reviews again and see some situations are just like mine. people losing hair when taking this pill. Be aware yo do not want to lose your hair!!</li>
            <li> This product works really well for me. I learned a long time ago that not everything is gonna give everyone the same results, so we should remember that when we read or write reviews about anything. I had thin edges which I had went to a doctor and received treatments for. That didn&#x27;t work. I paid a lot of money for those shots, but I was realistic in knowing that just because I didn&#x27;t get the effect I wanted, didn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t work. It just didn&#x27;t work for me and my body chemistry. After using one bottle of the Nioxin, my edges look like they did before I lost them. I have thick hair now. I have never had thick hair. My hair is growing really well. I actually appreciate the thickness over the length. I have seen a difference in my nails. They have grown with other products, but this growth is thicker and faster. I really can&#x27;t make a statement about my skin. I don&#x27;t see a difference. I haven&#x27;t had the growth of hair in \\&quot;other\\&quot; places. I&#x27;m thankful for that. I&#x27;ve never had to shave, and I don&#x27;t wanna start. Have I been a poster child and been consistent? I haven&#x27;t. I have just decided that the next bottle I take, I will be consistent so that I may see what kinda results I can really yield. How do I know it&#x27;s the Nioxin and nothing else? My diet is jacked up. I know this. The only thing I changed was taking that, and like I said, it works well for me.</li>
            <li> This product works! Within weeks my hair was definitely thicker and after finishing the first bottle there was new hair growth. I&#x27;m now on my second bottle and I&#x27;m still seeing results. I only wish that it was a little cheaper, but I&#x27;m going to continue using it. My hair is healthier as well.</li>
            <li> I formerly purchased this product, 30-count per bottle, at my hair salon for $30.00...that&#x27;s $1.00 per vitamin and the salon mark-up was 60%!  I decided to try Amazon to see if the product, which are vitamins for hair, skin, and nails, was available.  To my pleasant surprise, they were/are and I paid close to the same price for 90-count per bottle and saved $60.00!  I WILL stay with the Amazon supplier.</li>
            <li> the product is excellent have been very good  and has helped in my acne problem love it .The product arrived as described and  had no problem in getting my product as stated. excellent product</li>
            <li> I have taken this product for over a year. It actual inhibits my hair growth.  No kidding.  While I am taking it, I see fine peach fuzz and baby hairs all around by face, but that is it.  When I stopped taking it, my hair grew an inch but got much much thinner.  None of the bald spots grew back, not even a little bit.  I can honestly say while taking this my hair thickened but just MAINTAINED, didnt grow.  My hair was shiny,healthy and thicker looking but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPdate&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So its true....if you stop taking it, all benefits are lost. Within one month of discontinued use, my hair thinned out horribly. It also was not as shiny or healthy looking. Nothing about my regimen changed besides not taking these vitamins.  Not sure what to do now except go back on the vitamins until I don&#x27;t care about my hair anymore. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!! Avoid Costsell!  I ordred a new bottle of this product and the pills arrived cracaked.  My pkg was sealed but how could the pills possible be cracked????? Either they are not stored properly or there is impropriety going on!  Refunded by Amazon.  Avoid Costsell!</li>
            <li> so i never leave reviews for anything but i i was so bummed i had to warn anyone who would listen...  so i got the nioxin in a timely manner but the supplements in the bottle were all cracked like they&#x27;d been sitting some where for an extended period of time...  i tried them out thinking it wouldn&#x27;t matter and i had horrible side effects.  expedited heart beat, my blood pressure rose, and i was just uncomfortable in my skin... i&#x27;m not sure if this is because the supplements seemed to have \\&quot;expired\\&quot; or it was the supplement itself... if your going to try it dont do it from here...  bummer right?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance whose hair is thinning, and decided to start taking it because my nails were very fragile. Within two weeks I had to cut them because they were growing so fast. I got compliments on my hair because it was bouncier, shinier and fuller. As for my fiance, his hair does appear fuller. I will definitely continue taking it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it is supposed to help hair loss. I&#x27;m not sure if it does or not.</li>
            <li> Great, the item was mailed fast and in perfect shape!!! Will order again very soon.  Thank you very much, hope to order from you very soon.</li>
            <li> Very good product! It really does work! I would highly recommend this product to anyone for use. Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Im 39, typical guy losing hair at his age. Not balding, but my hair is definitely thinning. Been using product for about 5 months now. I&#x27;m seeing positive results. I wish the results were a little better, but I&#x27;m hoping over time I will see thicker hair. But one thing is for sure, my hair looks better than it has in probably 5 years or so. I&#x27;m going to keep on buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT. I had a subscription for 25.99 for about a year, then bam, it&#x27;s canceled and now the bottles available are anywhere from 99 to a laughable 199 bucks. Forget about it. I&#x27;m done using this product. Found a nice product that works just as well and about 75% less too.</li>
            <li> Only been using this for a little over 30 days and I already see a difference. Hair seems to be shedding less after I wash it and I am noticing that the hair around my crown which seemed to be thinning a bit seems to be coming. I have baby hair! I think I see the results more in my nails though. They&#x27;ve always seemed weak, thin and tend to chip to the point that I didn&#x27;t even bother with professional manicures because the filing seemed to make things worse. They definitely seem stronger now and chip less.    Would definitely recommend you give it a try. I only gave it 4 stars so far because it has been only 30 days.</li>
            <li> The Nioxin supplement tablets shipped to me from seller \\&quot;Costsell\\&quot; were counterfeit and I have informed Amazon Customer service in detail.</li>
            <li> these pills work... a little too well.  4 months after i had my baby, i started freaking out because my hair was falling out.  so i took the pills for a few weeks but my hair got thicker EVERYWHERE.  arms, face, legs.  all the moms i knew said the hair loss was normal so i stopped the pills and eventually everything got back to normal.  didn&#x27;t need the pills after all.</li>
            <li> Ships fast. Was shipped immediately the day after i ordered it. Have been using this product for almost 3 months now. Not really sure if it promotes hair growth yet. Nails are growing healthy and strong, they used to be paper thin and flimsy. They feel thicker and sturdier. Skin has a nice glow to it, looks vibrant and healthy. Will defenitely order again, just ordered my second 90 bottle tablets. As with any product a person uses this will take time, requires consistent use to see results. Do not expect to notice changes right away, things take time. Three months is probably when you will really start noticing a difference. Be patient and be consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Nioxin supplements a couple times from amazon and everything was always great.  I used them consistently for months, and they really work well.  I stopped taking them for a few months and when I stared back up the change was obvious.  The first improvement I always notice is in my skin (which takes on a buttery soft, moisturized feel - which makes my skin look younger).  My nails also get thicker and stronger.  Finally, my shedding decreases, while my hair&#x27;s rate of growth increases.    So why two stars?  Well I&#x27;m thinking the vendor that amazon uses (which is now costsell) must have changed recently.  I purchased a bottle of pill a couple weeks ago but when I opened the bottle all of the pills were cracked and the smell of them was off (very strong).  So I called Nioxin&#x27;s 1-800 number to ask them about it, but they wouldn&#x27;t give me a straightforward answer, since amazon is not an authorized salon reseller.  So out of caution, I contacted amazon and had them send me a replacement bottle (I thought the original bottle might have had cracked pills due to improper packaging).  But when I opened the replacement bottle all of those pills were cracked as well.  So I&#x27;m planning to send both bottles back and ask for a refund.  Based on other reviews, it appears that cracked pills are a sign of age (but the bottle&#x27;s expiration date is 2013, so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on).    So I can wholeheartedly recommend the Nioxin supplements in general, but suggest getting them from somewhere else perhaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m through over half the bottle and so far have seen no results in new hair growth or thicker hair.  If this changes, I&#x27;ll post a update, but so far, nothing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this product is working or not cause I use other supplements as well. I have not noticed any shedding or breakage in my hair, my nails and skin are good too. I&#x27;m almost finished with the bottle so I&#x27;ll definitely be able to tell once I stop taking them.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY DID WORK.  IT HELPED MY HAIR GET A BIT THICKER AND IT MADE IT GROW VERY FAST.  AMAZON REALLY HAS THE BEST PRICE FOR THESE.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Its the 3rd purchase its not as effective  as it worked 1st time but still i want to continue for few more tabs</li>
            <li> Hey, this supplement works if you keep using it! I&#x27;ve used it for three months and see new growth around my hairline.</li>
            <li> Well I Have To Say, So Far EveryThing has been great with this product the price wasn&#x27;t too bad, and thats what really got my attention. To my surprise I Had expected the shipping date to be as approximated but in fact it came 4 DAYS EARLIER!! Ive been taking the pill everyday day and I will update ASAP! For the skeptics: Not every bottle of pills will be cracked, (as some other reviews said) mine came perfectly intact! So far everthing is great and i will post  an update to really finalize this review!</li>
            <li> I took this everyday, really stuck to it. annddd I really didn&#x27;t notice my hair or skin improve. But i would think thats something thats hard to notice so I dont know lol</li>
            <li> I like Nioxin Intensive therapy recharging complex because it really helps keep my hair healthy, and stops it from falling out so much.  It also has improved the natural color and there is much less grey.</li>
            <li> I purchased these vitamins in May of 2011. I was having a hard time with the growth of my hair especially the edges. Well after using the 90 day pack, I saw a significant increase with the length and volume of my hair and my edges grew in dramatically. My stylist was so impressed, she decided to purchase them. I swear by these vitamins. They really do work! After seeing the results, I have all my friends and girlfriends using them. My hair has never been so long in its life.  Signed,   LongHairDon&#x27;tCare. :)</li>
            <li> Product&#x27;s great. Does what it says and doesn&#x27;t cause stomach distress like others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, for some reason the price just triple as others have stated. And this has happened on various other products like benefiber as well where the price inexplicably has been tripled overnight.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.  It is suppposed to grow hair and I have only just starting taking it a few weeks ago.  So I cannot really be certain it works.  But so far so good.  Purchased at Amazon and had a great seller.</li>
            <li> Its always hard to tell what is actually helping your hair. But since I have been taking this vitamin I have noticed my hair seems thicker/stronger and shinier. It may be possible to get the same ingredients without spending so much money, but for now I am sticking with it.</li>
            <li> My hair thins on the side when I get stressed and I have really kinky hair. I noticed that it takes forever for my hair to grow back when I trim the ends. So I decided to start taking these pills again. My hair grows a lot faster than it normally would. I love the results I would recommend this product and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot less hair loss after using this my skin looked good as well. If your struggling with losing to much hair every time you brush this will help. Great product.</li>
            <li> Good product and found that it improved growth in nails and helped with my skin</li>
            <li> The pills were cracked and my hair started shedding like crazy. I&#x27;m so mad. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and I&#x27;m shedding EVERYWHERE!!!  Never again will I touch this product. I returned this product ASAP.</li>
            <li> The first time I started using Nioxin, I thought I was going to lose all my hair since the shedding of hair increased very much in the first one or two weeks. But then it stopped. When I touch now the skin on my scalp, I can feel short newly grown hair. It worked for the top middle section of my scalp but did not see any effects yet for the hair near to forehead. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Can only give this product three stars, since I&#x27;ve had it for just a bit over two weeks now. I will monitor any progress, then report back after a couple of months. Too early to tell if it works.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works for hair growth, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair thicker. I saw hair growth after the first month. I used it for ninety days, and it seems to work better when I massaged my scalp and used it along with essential oils such as jojoba, tea tree and lavender.     I am a 55 year old African American and I suffer from hair lost and hair thinning due to menopause and a history of \\&quot;male\\&quot; pattern baldness in my family. Overall this is a good product for hair growth, but this works much better with a good diet, plenty of water, a little scalp massage for 3 to 5 minutes a few times a week; you can do the scalp massage without the oils because this helps with blood circulation of the scalp in the thinning areas. My hair grew about twice as fast, and I saw more growth after 3 months.     I recommend this product, and I will buy it again. [[ASIN:B001394530 Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex, 90 Count]]</li>
            <li> I bought this particular hair, skin, and nail supplement above the others because of the positive reviews. It&#x27;s true, this supplement does benefit all three. The first benefit I noticed was to my skin, which suddenly became (much) softer--in the middle of winter, when I take very hot showers. I&#x27;m sure it was because of Nioxin because I was doing nothing else different. My hair also became shinier and the little hairs at my temple got thicker and are harder to manage, which I attribute to Nioxin since I was doing nothing different in my routine. I keep my nails short, so I can&#x27;t comment.     I WILL be purchasing Nioxin supplement again, and probably always will.</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars, I would. The \\&quot;glowing, positive\\&quot; reviews for this product are completely bogus. I wasn&#x27;t aware of the practice of having shills writing fake reviews extolling the virtues of the product being sold. I used to count on the 5 star Amazon customer reviews as a gauge of the product&#x27;s performance. Now I check the 1 star reviews first. BTW, I stupidly used these for 6 months hoping my thinning hair would be \\&quot;revitalized\\&quot; BEFORE checking with my dermatologist only to discover the veracity of the old adage, \\&quot;If it seems too good to be true, it probably isn&#x27;t\\&quot;. There is no \\&quot;magic pill\\&quot; for thinning hair. Pretty expensive lesson.</li>
            <li> Loved the product. Healthier hair and skin overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but what happened to the price? Did it all sellout everywhere? What&#x27;s going on? how come I can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore?</li>
            <li> In my early 50&#x27;s and balding in the back and working it&#x27;s way forward.  I hate the thoughts of putting goo on top of my head, so I am trying Nioxin one pill a day.  Have been using it for four months now.  Don&#x27;t know if there is really any new growth, but I shortly noticed after I started taking Nioxin that the number of hairs in the drain when I wash my hair is much much lesser than beforehand. My pills have been coming cracked also and some people have been really  complaining about it.  Farmers crack shelled corn for cattle to digest easier, and that is the way I look at it.  It is not like the pills are falling apart.  I have not noticed anything different with my nails.  I am going to keep taking this item.</li>
            <li> I used to take multivitamins for hair loss however didn&#x27;t find them that effective. Bought this product and was surprisingly pleased! My hair is thicker, more lustrous and healthier, I don&#x27;t think I will ever change products, because you know what they say, once you find a good thing...keep it! My hair looks great, and I feel super great.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed that my item came in a poorly padded envelope instead of a box. The bottle was damaged during shipping (cap cracked, but luckily safety seal was intact). Like the majority of reviews here, most of the pills are cracked and smell/taste funny (which means they are defective/old). CostSell&#x27;s lame advice was for me to bring the item to a post office and \\&quot;refuse\\&quot; the package (it was already opened and I&#x27;ve never heard such a thing before), instead of sending a return label or replacement item immediately. I don&#x27;t have time for games which is why I purchased online, so I ended up just keeping them and will not be buying from this seller again. I can&#x27;t say for sure how well it&#x27;s working for my hair after almost 75 pills (am using in combination with Pura d&#x27;or and Rogaine foam), especially due to the poor quality of the item received, but they certainly don&#x27;t hurt (it does make your dead hairs fall out initially; do not be alarmed). I would have liked to continue treatment in order to form a more accurate review. I will not be purchasing again due to the outrageous exponential price increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I have learned that the price increase is due to this product being discontinued by Nioxin with a \\&quot;new formula\\&quot; slated for release in August. Item can still be found in some retail stores at regular price if you act quickly before their stock runs out.</li>
            <li> I just bought this vitamin 3 months ago for $38.00 dollars, and I come back online to purchase it again and I see a  price of 179.00.  What the hell happened? It is a good vitamin, but I think that $179.00 is a tad expensive.  Apparently they want to take advantage of the popularity this product is enjoying but is defintely not worth the price, DON&#x27;T BUY IT FOR THIS PRICE, SAVE YOUR MONEY !!</li>
            <li> Prior to taking this vitamin, I had always had black heads all around my chin and mouth. I also had one to three very large zits at all times. When I got engaged nine years ago, I had very short hair. I wanted to grow it for the wedding and only had six month. A hair dresser suggested this vitamin. I didn&#x27;t notice that my hair grew faster, but I did notice that it grew thicker. Well I already have very thick hair and wish it was thinner. However, after going on this vitamin, all of my black heads went away and I now never have a zit....ever. I went off this pill when I was pregnant, because my prenatal vitamins had many of the same nutrients. During the time I was pregnant and off Nioxin pills, my acne came back. When I went back on them after having my son, my acne went away again and has never come back. I am glad to put up with an even thicker mane to have clear skin.</li>
            <li> It takes about 3 months to work but it&#x27;s worth it. You hair get healthier the more you use the product. I would also recommend a healthy diet and water otherwise you are defeating the purpose. Also the company deliver the product very quickly! I was very satisfied with performance.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for a little over two weeks now. I do see a difference in my nails, they are stronger and healthier. More importantly I bought these to grow out my hair which is relaxed and colored. With working out and coloring my hair the sweat was really making it dry and unhealthy. With a new sulfate-free shampoo and my nioxin I hope to see a difference soon. Face appeared to breakout a little even though i dont have the best skin...going to stick to the vitamins until all 90 pills are gone and then decide whether to continue..</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for 2 years now and my hair is thicker, my finger nails grow faster.  It also makes my hair not as dry and brittle anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a product that turns out to contain exactly the same vitamins and minerals that are available in ANY standard multi-vitamin tablet, with the only difference being that most multi-vitamin tablets contain significantly higher doses of those same ingredients.</li>
            <li> this item did not do a thing. i believe that most of these positive reviews were made buy people who have an interest in promoting this product. dont waste your money</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered the Nioxon Recharging Complex from Amazon (three months ago), everything was fine. This time, all the pills in the bottle were cracked or broken. I&#x27;ll be returning and ordering elsewhere. I&#x27;m giving them one star for prompt shipping....</li>
            <li> I love the product but I am so disappointed with this ridiculous price of these vitamins! It&#x27;s been about 5 years since I stopped using NIOXIN vitamins (why i stopped, I&#x27;ll never know) and recently I&#x27;ve been experiencing some major hair loss due to a hormonal imbalance. Well, I wanted to start using these again because when I used to take them, my hair was so soft and full and just luxurious, I always received compliments on my hair and it actually helped my complextion too. And at that time, I paid $23 with tax for 90 count. I went to the beauty stores where they used to sell them and they weren&#x27;t in store so I looked online to find that now they are $110 PLUS for a bottle!?!?! I figured they must have been discontinued or something because that&#x27;s the only way to explain the rip off price increase, which is still robbery even though they are discontinued. When I contacted NIOXIN about this they said it&#x27;s because they are re-packaging and re-formulating this product, as they did with the entire product line but because this is a supplement it is taking a little longer and will be available again in 6 to 9 months. How sad. I thought the original formula worked awesome and to me it wasn&#x27;t broke so it didn&#x27;t need to be fixed! I can only hope it will be just as good as it was and not way overpriced. What a shame.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year for like 30 dollars and I come back to buy more and the price has increased from 30dollars to 119!?!? How does that happen!!! It is not acceptable.</li>
            <li> I did buy and use this for some time but I then switched over to a different pill which I am testing now. I didnt get the full results I wanted to get but who does right. Anyways I think it prevented worse situation from happening.</li>
            <li> I for sure notice my hair&#x27;s texture and quality improve, but my nails is where I have noticed the most. They have been growing way faster and don&#x27;t break quite as easily as they used to. I&#x27;m happy I got the 90-day supply.</li>
            <li> I ordered one bottle of this therapy recharging complex from Amazon.com on Oct. 23rd. After half months of use, my bf and I dont see any improvement from this product.I checked the web again,amazon.com put this item under review. All my pills are craked....Asked for a full refund!</li>
            <li> I think this product really works.  I take it once a day and my hair does seem to grow faster while using it.  You do have to give it at least three months, though.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old and started loosing hair about 2 years ago. After using a topical treatment for about 9 months, I came across these vitamins that were recommended to me by my hair stylist. I noticed how my hair and nails got stronger during the first month and after the second month, I started growing some hair again. I am now on my second bottle because the difference Nioxin has made really shows, but from time to time, I still lose more hair than I wish I did. I have been reading a lot of customer reviews on this product and I noticed that a lot of people combine this treatment with Biotin. So after making some research, I bought my first bottle of Biotin 5000 mcg and after two weeks, I am amazed with how much stronger my hair has gotten. I will continue to take both supplements together until I achieve the results I want and then I will see that supplement to stick to.....but overall, Nioxin has worked well on me and I am really happy I came across this product!</li>
            <li> I have lost a lot of hair over the past year due to different medications I have been on, within three months my hair was looking great with this product! It has a horrible taste to it, but its worth the final results!</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out and it did make the hair stop falling out.</li>
            <li> I bought the product primarily to help grow my fingernails and I&#x27;ll say that it did not disappoint. I&#x27;ve been taking biotin and other hair, skin, nail supplements for years with no real results but the Nioxin is the first product where I&#x27;ve seen a noticible change. Within 2-3 weeks of taking one tablet daily, as recommended, I&#x27;ve grown a full set of long, strong beautiful nails! I&#x27;ve never had any real skin issues so no noticable change there. Unfortunately I was hoping for increased hair growth as well and have yet to notice any difference but I&#x27;d recommend the product on the nail growth alone (and am still hopeful that the hair part just takes a little longer to kick in). If when my hair begins growing faster, I&#x27;ll glady edit my review and upgrade to 5 stars! Great product that I&#x27;ll be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different shampoos and products to help my hair grow and this supplement really does work. My hair is growing much thicker and faster now that I am taking this. The only downside of this product is that the pills smell bad and have a bad taste but that goes away immediately after swallowing. I also have noticed that not only has my hair on my head and eyelashes grown, all the fine hair on my arms and legs have lengthened. I guess that&#x27;s the price to pay for a product that really works! When I last went to the hairdresser she said my hair is around 18 inches at its longest point, and I can honestly say it is healthy. So far no difference in the health of my nails.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me... Didn&#x27;t finish the whole bottle after a week of taking it I started getting dizzy and off balance. Just went back to taking hair skin and nail pills.</li>
            <li> these vitamins were recommended to me by a family member. they work really well for her but they did spark a lot of body hair for me it took sometime getting use to because i have a low tolerance for vitamins. Overall our hair has grown or nails are hard and our skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I really love the results of this product and it did work, but then all of the sudden you all kicked up the price so stupid. It was 29.99 for 90 ct bottle and now it is 399.99 for a 30 ct bottle this is nuts.</li>
            <li> The sides of my hair were thining so me and two of my girlfriends diecided to buy a 90 day bottle and split it in three.  After 2 weks I noticed less shedding and the sides of my hair looks visibly thicker. I now have my own bottle.</li>
            <li> I have found that this product really works. However, the downside is that if you only want hair on your head, this is not the product for you as it promotes hair growth everywhere! Head, Legs, arms, upper lip, chin.... the list goes on! But if you can tolerate this, then this is the best I&#x27;ve seen and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products</li>
            <li> I have been using this for months now and can see a difference. I also like that the price has come down which helps a ton. Please keep the price fair and reasonable. It really should be under $125 but lets hope it gets there soon.</li>
            <li> Good product! Still using it... Works great! Works for the hair loss as well as clarity on the skin! Recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is cheap and was the best product for my thinning hair. I just wish they still made it...</li>
            <li> The product is great! The Prices on here are OUTRAGEOUS!! I get mine in the store for $22 for a 30 day supply! If you have a mastercuts by you go there and pay the $22!</li>
            <li> Great product, been taking these vitamins for 2 yrs.  Will definitely order them again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see ANY improvwement in my hair. I&#x27;m starting to think this was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I started using Nioxin and my hair got really thick and was growing really fast in 2 weeks... highly recommended</li>
            <li> I been taking this product for about 6 months, Im really satisfied with the results. Less hair on my brush, more hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I started taking this about 9 months ago( estimate ) after several months I did notice less hair in my brush &amp; bathroom drain. I do not really suffer from hair loss but I have very fine weak hair, also very long. I ran out for a month &amp; noticed a difference! I reordered &amp; will definatly not run out again! My hair seams healthier &amp; like I said less in my brush! The best thing about this supplement is I can take it with out any stomache upset, alot of vitamins do upset my stomache. Over all I dont always eat the healthiest food &amp; I find these make a very noticable difference in the overall health of my hair!Definatly recommend!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have used these vitamins before when I was having problems with my hair thinning out and she was just wanting to grow longer healthier hair, so we already knew how wonderful they were.  We stopped taking them for a while because the place where we boght them ran out due to a change in distributor.  I was paying $20+ for a 30 day supply but I didn&#x27;t know any different. I was in desperate need of getting back on them and my nail tech told me that I could get them much cheaper online. I searched online and since I&#x27;ve purchased things through Amazon.com before and never had any problems, I decided to buy them through them.  Much to my amazement, I was able to buy two 90 days supply bottles for around the same price as I would have paid for two 30 days bottles.  It took a little while to get them, but I didn&#x27;t pay for any type of express shipping, but that was a small inconvenience compared to how much I saved.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and brittle before I used Nioxin.Its been a month since I&#x27;ve started using this along with other Biotin tablets. My hair has become noticeably soft.I can&#x27;t comment on the growth yet as it is too early.Worth trying.</li>
            <li> I tried this because my hair is thinning.  I do not know why it works.  I can&#x27;t say I have thick hair again, but it seems at least to not fall out as much as it did.  A side benefit is my fingernails are stronger.    It is also a very easy pill to swallow.   Since I am getting good results, I will continue to take it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nioxin for about a year, maybe a little longer. I am black so my hair is easily damaged. I used to have hair that shedded like crazy and snapped off when I combed it. Nioxin helped renew the strands of my hair so that they were stronger and more durable. If I pull a strand between my fingers it stretches and doesn&#x27;t break like it used to. NOTE: Nioxin is NOT a gene in a bottle, if a certain hair type or length doesn&#x27;t run in your family don&#x27;t expect to get it. Nioxin only helps the health of the hair. You will be able to see your hair&#x27;s full length potential with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great vitamin. A little expensive, but well worth the investment in your hair and nails. Hair has grown longer and stronger, and I no longer suffer from brittle nails.</li>
            <li> Looks like a lot of people really like this product, but this one isn&#x27;t for me.  I was really hoping this would help with my hair loss, but sadly it didn&#x27;t.  Hopefully this works for you.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with hair loss!!!  Good deal too.  Cost $40 in salon.</li>
            <li> I have been taking nioxin recharging complex for approximate 5 months.  I was introduced to this product by a friend, after noticing how heatlhy her hair was.  I then tried it and stopped taking the capsules and instantly noticed a difference with my hair.  My hair is very healthy and grows faster.  I get many compliments about my hair, sometimes people think its a wig.  They seem a little expensive but they are worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its working yet since its only been a month but the vitamins don&#x27;t make me feel jittery at all. My nails do seem stronger and my facial skin looks supple. As far as the hair on my head, I guess time will tell.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this supplement, and even more so, regret that I opened them. There are a number of herbal ingredients in this product that should give you pause before ordering. The most disconcerting is probably Bladderwrack, a seaweed that is considered \\&quot;possibly unsafe\\&quot; for consumption. Bladderwrack can contain iodine which can exacerbate thyroid problems. The plant can also concentrate toxic chemicals like arsenic.  Since supplements are unregulated in the U.S., it&#x27;s quite possible that these pills may contain more than you&#x27;re bargaining for. There are also a number of other ingredients that can slow blood clotting, interact with estrogen in birth control pills, or generally cause stomach upset and nausea. In case you can&#x27;t find the herbal ingredients elsewhere, they are: wild yam root, sarsaparilla root, stinging nettle root, oat extract, pygeum bark, saw palmetto, bladderwrack, ubiquinone, tocotrienols, soy phytosterol complex.     Since all of these ingredients are listed as a proprietary blend, you don&#x27;t know how much of each you&#x27;re taking. In my opinion it&#x27;s not worth taking a supplement that could cause other problems for you down the road.    For a more detailed discussion of the problems with \\&quot;natural supplements,\\&quot;  Consumer Reports recently published an article about the dangers of many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using this pills for weeks. Other solutions seem kinda external on the scalp but this one is composition of vitamins. This is not a cure like it says on the bottle, but it works. All vitamins are fully enough for your hair, nail and skin. Now I see less falling and more strength hair in the shower, in the bed and while combing.     Distinctively, i don&#x27;t take it daily, 1 day off between days... With minoxidil 15%, i think it works fine, the better than this is a wig or plant hair, man ;)</li>
            <li> Great!  To bad the price went so high.  Can no longer afford it.  Now taking 10,000 mg. Biotin now instead.</li>
            <li> I will like to see its contents..all ingredients..It does not show it at all..</li>
            <li> It really works, but they stopped making it.  I guess it was bad for you ;)</li>
            <li> I had hoped this would be the product that would work for me after reading all the reviews. I&#x27;m a woman who&#x27;s desperate because my hair is thinning and my nails are always chipping and breaking because they&#x27;re brittle (possibly because I swim six days a week in chlorinated water). This product does not work for me because it has niacin in it. The niacin caused me to have so much pain in my breast that I went to the doctor thinking I was getting inflammatory breast cancer again and my face was constantly flushed--something specific to me and would not be to others. I used it for about 58 days and saw no improvement in my nails or hair. [[ASIN:B001394530 Nioxin Intensive Therapy Recharging Complex, 90 Count]] I also bought the Nioxin Maintenance Kit, System 2 hair treatment for fine, untreated, &amp; noticeably thinning hair. The only thing I noticed after using the treatment was that it thickened the strains of my hair which made my hair appear to be fuller, but the texture of my hair became coarse. It does not grow hair! [[ASIN:B002N5MHYM Nioxin Maintenance Kit, System 2 (Cleanser 8.5 Ounce, Scalp Treatment 3.4 Ounce, Scalp Therapy 4.2 Ounce)]] These products were a waste of money for me. I&#x27;m going back to using Biotin 5000 mcg. I did have some success where hair growth was noticeable (not perfect) over a 6-month period before I began taking the Nioxin.</li>
            <li> After reading almost all of the reviews, there are a few \\&quot;myths\\&quot; I hope to knock down. If you are suffering from hair loss, you should see a dermatologist.  I had patchy baldness incurred due to high stress,and then heavy hair loss because of eczema. Both are medical issues that should be addressed by professionals. My dermatologist prescribed excellent tropical ointments that cured the eczema, and the hair grew back.  I began to to take Nioxin as a supplement to help my hair grow in faster. And it worked very well. It will take time, over 3 months to see results, but continual use kept up the accelerated growth. As it works on hair, that would mean hair elsewhere will grow faster too. My lashes for example are longer than I ever had in my life.  Do keep in mind that not all medication and supplements will work the same for everyone. A healthy diet consisting of vegetables, fruit and whole grain will improve the body&#x27;s overall health too.  In my opinion,this product does work very well for me, and I will continue to purchase it.   Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a lil over a month. A few days before using this product I used a relaxer. I have very thick neck line hair. My relaxers usually last 3 months before the need of another, and usually about a month my hair is still easy to comb through, not this time. These vitamins have made my roots look like its time for another. I can&#x27;t even comb it through. I have been on a hair journey since the day of my last relaxer. Im trying to go 6 months without one, but the pills are making it difficult to control because of its rapid growth. Im glad I found these vitamins, because others claim they work but don&#x27;t. I have 2 more months on my 90 day supply and will be order more. I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very good product, after 60 days my hair and nails have grown a great deal. I will be buying for now on.</li>
            <li> Decided to try Nioxin after having it recommented to me by several people.  I have been taking it about a year now and have found it to make a welcome difference in my hair and nails.  Had had thinning on the top of my head for years and now have new growth and the texture is also better</li>
            <li> My typically thick hair suddenly started falling out, to the point that I could see my scalp and I was clogging my drains. Needless to say this has never happened to me before. My doctor was unable to determine whether this was due to hormones or the number of stressful situations I had been in. I bought these and had so much new hair growth within three months that when my hairdresser flat ironed my hair, I had little sections of shorter hair standing up all over my head like Tweety Bird. I also noticed that my nails, which have always tended to chip, are quite strong. Needless to say this will be my third bottle and I&#x27;ll never stop taking it unless they stop making it. Did other factors probably contribute to my hair coming back? I&#x27;m sure. But this certainly didn&#x27;t hurt matters, and at the low cost for a three month supply on subscription costing 7.00 a month what do you have to lose? She recommends it to everyone and so do I...and I&#x27;m typically pretty skeptical :D</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make these anymore :(</li>
            <li> Why is it that I paid $30 a bottle 4 years ago and now it&#x27;s $300??? That&#x27;s crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the product, but I don&#x27;t like it that much. Lower the price back down to what it was before and then we can talk.</li>
            <li> like they worked very well and effective at preventing with hair loss. But apparently they don&#x27;t manufacture these anymore. Too bad, borderline 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending so quickly. I was able to use it and keep my hair when it belongs. Happy Easter.</li>
            <li> Price of product has really gone up...unable to buy at this time...this hair product worked on my thinning hair problem</li>
            <li> Only thing that has worked with my AA.</li>
            <li> Excellent product . My husband is a hairderesser and customers have come back with great response, especially if they have problems with thinning hair . Great if u wanna hv great hair and nails .</li>
            <li> These may be a little pricey but they are worth the price. I found out about them on youtube from SalonCabelo she is a hairstylist and said she recommends this to most of her clients. if u take it consistently you will see results i know i did. I take one vitamin every day not really at the same time but I&#x27;ve seen my hair growth go from 1/3 and 1/4 inches certain areas a month to 1/2 and 1/3 of an inch in the same areas. i measured by using a tape measure on my roots as i was transitioning from relaxed to natural. i&#x27;m natural 4a fine hair strands but lots of strands if you want to know my hair type hair texture is coarse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to make this a long, drawn out review.  But I had to come back and rate this item...I was skeptical...after a couple of weeks I thought my hair seemed thicker, shinier, healthier.  But I still wanted to wait before I reviewed it.  I have been taking them for a month faithfully.  And you know what?  This stuff really works.  My hair seems to grow so much faster.  It&#x27;s shinier, healthier and thicker.  I would totally recommend this product if you want your hair to be in better condition than it is now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 33yo male and I&#x27;m not sure when, but my hair has started to slowly march away from my forehead ... after 30 days of using the Nioxin vitamins I noticed new hair growth along my hair line. Most of the reviews appear to be from women, but guys should check this stuff out too.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have NEVER written a review for ANYTHING I have bought online, but I just have to for this product. I&#x27;m always skeptical of reading reviews because I&#x27;m worried they are fake; but I assure you, I&#x27;m a real person who bought this item based on the reviews that were already here. I&#x27;m on my second bottle.. I LOVE it. I&#x27;m 20 years old &amp; have extremely damaged hair.. It began to fall out like crazy &amp; took FOREVER to grow. I cut it to my shoulders back in May 2009 &amp; it barely had barely grown 4 inches in a year &amp; a half. I started to panic.. because I&#x27;m so young &amp; it was just weird. SOOO I came across this stuff &amp; decided what the heck.. I guess I&#x27;ll try it. My hair grew about 3/4 of an inch in a month.. which is CRAZY &amp; has me SO excited. I&#x27;ve tried literally everything.. INCLUDING Biotin supplements- they didn&#x27;t work for me at all.. only made my skin a little clearer. SOOOOOO if you&#x27;re looking for something to help your hair growth I HIGHLY recommend this. Oh, &amp; also, my nails are growing extremely fast as well! :) LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for about 3 weeks.  Can&#x27;t say that I notice much difference on my hair just yet.  I&#x27;ll give it a few more weeks....  But, my nails are growing like gang busters and they are hard as nails!    Haven&#x27;t had a nail break off in a couple weeks now.</li>
            <li> These vitamins promised to help thinning hair grow and brittle nails to grow and strengthen - the only thing they did for me was cause my face to break out in a catastrophic way. We&#x27;re talking those large, painful acne bumps that take forever to go away. My face hurt, they took forever to go away, and I looked awful. If these did help my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed because I was too busy stressing about my face. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started using Nioxin vitamins about 6 weeks ago- I purchased a bottle and halfed with my sister and I noticed her hair coverage was very much improved after about 2 weeks- but, I told her only that her hair looked nice-did not specify that it looked thicker- anyway- my younger sister was fixing her hair and asked her what happened- she had a lot more hair- and then all of a sudden I noticed that I could barely see my scalp-- I can not find a lot of new hair but I have more hair coverage-- and then my skin looks much better and my nails are getting much thicker--I will continue taking the vitamins-- I just ordered another bottle!!! don&#x27;t want to run out!</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;m african american and have had issues with my hair growing since I moved to GA in 96&#x27; It would always grow shoulder length but not much more. I&#x27;ve also always had very little to no hair on front sides of head. I&#x27;ve tried the biotin supplements as well as NUMEROUS other hair, nail, skin vitamins and I never saw a difference. Well in Jan 2011 I decided to try yet another supplement, Nioxin. I must admit despite the rave reviews I was a little skeptical since everything else people claim to work never worked for me. WOW does this stuff work! Its only been a little under two months and I can see the difference. You can no longer see my scalp on the front side of my head. My hair has grown past my shoulders. I&#x27;m truly pleased with the product and will continue to use it. It&#x27;s 1 small pill a day so the bottle lasts 3 months. Which is a relief compared to the horse pills and multiple pills I&#x27;ve had to take in the past. Oh yeah and like the other reviews YES IT GROWS ALL HAIR. So just know you will have to shave more often. But oh well Im just glad I found something that lives up to their claim.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to all the rave reviews and advice of a hairdresser. I just received them today. Since I really cant say if it works just yet I can say that the size of the pill is about the normal size of a multi-vitamin, however the shape makes it easy for swallowing(and I&#x27;m not big on taking pills at all.     I am a black female in mid thirties.. My hair grows fine but since I cut it to a pixie cut and decided I wanted a longer style for the upcoming summer I wanted to give it a try. I have no skin issues. My nail tech says my nails grow fairly slow so we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;ll update you in about a month!</li>
            <li> I started to notice I was losing a lot of hair in my late 40&#x27;s. I think a lot of woman do. The problem got progressively worse. I was losing small handfuls in the shower. One day I got in my car with the sun roof open and could see down to my scalp...I mean my hair was looking like I was starting to go bald. I was mortified to say the least! My hairdresser suggested the nioxin shampoo and conditioner. I started using it but it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything. Then I saw the nioxin vitamins online and after reading the reviews I decided to give them a try. After about three months, I was checking out my scalp in the mirror. I saw all these short thin hairs popping up out of my scalp. They were all the same length so I knew they weren&#x27;t broken hairs. I was so excited. Today (one year later) I was pulling my hair back into a pony tail and I noticed that my hair felt a lot thicker. I&#x27;ve been taking the vitamins every day for a year and I realized that those short little hairs were about 6 inches long now and thus the thick pony tail! Ladies, if you&#x27;re losing you hair give these a try. It&#x27;s worth the $$$. You won&#x27;t know if it works unless you try. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I bought this product less than a month ago and have noticed a tremendous change in my skin. My skin has become so much clearer since taking the vitamins. I can also say that it has increased my nail growth and believe it has helped with stopping hair breakage as I am not noticing a lot in the comb when I wash and condition. I wear my hair natural most of the time so I can&#x27;t tell how it&#x27;s working for hair growth but will update this as soon as I flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is a really good supplement, my nails are growing and my skin is glowing not to mention my hair is thick and lush.  I will order again</li>
            <li> I have used many hair growth vitamins in my day (Phyto, GMC etc) and none hve made my hair grow so well, and it&#x27;s soo shiny and full of life. I would highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> i was dying my hair to super blond for years, and i decided to stop killing them, cause they started to look like a floor mop after all,the day i decided to do that i bought these vitamins and cut my hair super long, and stopped coloring my hair.&lt;br /&gt;when your hair are totally dead from bleach- NOTHING WILL HELP!&lt;br /&gt;BUT!  THEY DID, I MONTH AFTER USING THEM I SEE THE RESULTS,&lt;br /&gt;ok, after just 1 month my hair is 2! inches longer, yes i see that, cause the rest of the hair is blond, but roots are black,&lt;br /&gt;only one thing, the pills smell bad and look a little bit wet, and i am only able to drink them after some food at night , on the empty stomach they make me dizzy.</li>
            <li> I have taken these vitamins for 6 months now and it has not helped AT ALL with my thinning hair. As far as hair growth, my hair has never had an issue with growth; it actually grows quite fast. However, I was hoping this supplement would help with the thinning that I&#x27;m experiencing. Well, it hasn&#x27;t and I actually feel like my hair has thinned more since I&#x27;ve been using this, thus it has not even helped to maintain hair thickness. Waste of money. Beware of all the excellent reviews. Some of them are probably written by folks who are associated with the brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 90 count Nioxin vitamins and took almost a month worth of vitamins until I got towards the middle of the bottle to recognize the vitamins were old, cracked, brittle and falling apart when I rubbed my finger across them.  Not Kool especially since I&#x27;ve already taken almost a month worth.  I am not happy with that at all!</li>
            <li> I have never written a product review before. Nioxin worked wonders for  my hair and I though I definitely need to write one.   Until 2 months back, I used to have tremendous hair fall. I could see hair all over the house (bed,kitchen, ahh everywhere!) and my bath tub used to get clogged with hair after I shampooed it 2-3 times.  But now, since I used Nioxin, I have absolutely minimal (I guess that much is pretty natural) hair loss! For all women facing hair loss problems, this product is a great buy. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles in September. The first one was fine but when I opened the second bottle all of the caplets were cracked (as described by others). By the time I opened the second bottle it was past Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return policy.     I called Nioxin&#x27;s 1-800 number on the bottle to report this apparent quality issue and to ask if the cracked caplets were safe. I confirmed that I was speaking with an actual employee of Nioxin Research Labs, the company responsible for manufacturing and distributing this product and that shockingly, I was informed that Nioxin does not have a quality control department and that they are not able to comment or advise any non-salon purchasers. Amazing! Is it possible that any manufacturer today would not have a quality dept?  If it&#x27;s true, on this basis alone I don&#x27;t think I could ever use or recommend a product with the Nioxin name.   Quality is a serious issue with supplements including vitamins as they are not subject to FDA or any other scrutiny. Cloned \\&quot;grey market\\&quot; products of dubious quality from Asia and the Middle East can easily find their way to large distributors who then market the discounted \\&quot;brand-name\\&quot; product to online sellers including eBay and possibly Amazon. The result: Unknown quality and no accountability.  In my case, Amazon&#x27;s supplier for this product was Yongho Kong who is now known as CostSell.  Neither company can be located except through an Amazon \\&quot;shell\\&quot; preventing any direct consumer contact.  The Nioxin company guy said they only sell their products to qualified retail salon suppliers and not to Amazon. If this is the case, you have to wonder by what route any of their products actually wind up at Amazon for sale.  We can&#x27;t expect Amazon to check the quality of every product they sell but when they receive repeated negative feedback on a product they need to stop selling that product and qualify an alternative supplier. It appears that this is exactly what Amazon is doing with this product.   Our feedback is apparently the only quality control for Nioxin products. Hey, I have a new job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review so people can beware of what their purchasing online.I recieved my Nioxin supplements last week very prompt service.It&#x27;s kinda to early to state weather their working for me or not.But I will talk about how these pills are looking.First of all,all of my tablets are cracked and beat up!what&#x27;s up with that?Then to top it off I counted 92 tablets instead of 90.The expiration on it says 2013,so what&#x27;s wrong with these pills people?????You do your judgment,but like I told CostSell don&#x27;t get his self in trouble buy doing wrong things.Just beware of what your buying be safe people.</li>
            <li> I love these pills!!! I love them so much that I am leaving my first ever product review. I am almost done with my first (90 count) bottle and have TONS of new growth and my fall out has decreased tremendously!!! I first heard about this from my hairdresser, but it was kind of expensive so I didn&#x27;t get it. After dealing with more fall out to where I could see my scalp, I decided to look into Nioxin and found it on here. I am so glad I bought it and gave it a shot. I didn&#x27;t start to see any thing until about 60 days for the hair on my head, but everywhere else was growing, lol. But its worth it for me to have thick beautiful hair. I had terribly patchy eyebrows, but now they are awesome and I have been getting complements on them! I just got my second (90 count) bottle today and will write another review when I am almost done with that one too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference from using the product, but I know others who have had great success. Perhaps more time is needed to see results for me.</li>
            <li> i did see results with this product. it was cheaper here than walmart</li>
            <li> Worst waste of money on Amazon! I thought Amazon endorsed reliable sellers only - this was not one of them. Unfortunately, I was never able to take these pills after realizing when I finally opened the bottle it was old yellow and cracked and passed the return date policy. The bottle says not expired until 11/2012... it looks like it could have expired 10 years ago on 11/2002! Overall, the pills looks unsafe and not recommended by doctor since it is not FDA approved - won&#x27;t take a chance on losing all my hair.</li>
            <li> I take Nioxin vitamins for my adult acne. My skin stays clear as long as I am taking them. If I run out and don&#x27;t take them for awhile my skin can get in really bad shape. I hope they never stop making Nioxin vitamin.</li>
            <li> When you lower the price, I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Interesting - when I purchased this several months ago the cost was around $30.  Now it&#x27;s over 100 for the same bottle.  I think that&#x27;s a little excessive in cost.</li>
            <li> I used this product for several years.  It&#x27;s an excellent hair vitamin.  Yes, it does make all the hair on your body grow a bit faster, but that was not a problem.  I would continue to use if not for the current price.  The price has doubled and in some cases quadrupled.  No vitamin should cost over $150 for a 90 day supply.  Sorry Nioxin, but it&#x27;s not that good.  Do yourselves a favor folks and buy a good multi-vitamin until Nioxin sets the suggested retail price at a reasonable level.  Or is it the vendors becoming greedy with a popular product.  I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m not buying it at these prices!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously purchased from amazon 4 bottles 90 caps for 25$ per bottle, I loved the product i was using it together with biotin and minoxidil, i came here to place another order and i was chocked with the price tag to exceed 160$ per bottle ! it has multiplied more than 6 times ! it&#x27;s way too expensive now, so no more bottles will be coming from this product</li>
            <li> I purchased my second supply of this product, which I LOVED the first time. I was transitioning to natural and this product really helped my hair growth. It takes I&#x27;d say about a month to notice changes, but it really worked. But this time I purchased the product I received cracked pills. All of the pills in the bottle had cracks throughout the pill, and I wasn&#x27;t about to risk my health and take them.. I notified the seller, COSTSELL, and never even got a return message, refund, or sorry. DO NOT BUY THE PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER!!</li>
            <li> The Nioxin Recharging complex pill bottle has been pulled off the market and recalled by the Nioxin company because of health concerns. This is the reason why i cant find this product anywhere in the hair salon stores that carry Nioxin products. Most online stores do not carry it anymore. It seems a few of the third-party sellers here on Amazon still have some supply left and that is the reason they are charging $100 for a bottle when it should be $30, because the supply is low and demand is high (and not many competitors also!). If these greedy sellers have any conscious for the consumer&#x27;s health they wouldn&#x27;t sell this bottle here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried these tablets and I&#x27;m very happy with the results. My hair is growing faster now than ever. I&#x27;m 59 yrs. old and I have always had a hard time with hair growth.Same with eye brows,finger nails and toe nails.  With just 30 tabs,1 aday I&#x27;m seeing great results with all these things.I&#x27;m so happy with this product, I&#x27;m writting my first review ever for anything. Thank you, Janet</li>
            <li> Be forewarned. Apparently Nioxin has sold out to Proctor Gamble and the supplement has been taken off the market until January 2013 for \\&quot;repackaging\\&quot;; P&amp;G specifically answered my inquiry as such. Previously product was being sold for approximately $26 for a 90 count. Now the pricing has been over inflated to what you see at approximately $100+ for 90 count. Obviously pricing is skyrocketing due to no product being produced. Why a company would discontinue a product for over 1/2 a year for \\&quot;repackaging\\&quot; is beyond me. I questioned as such with P&amp;G and communicated my disappointment after decades of loyal use but never received a follow up response. Clearly P&amp;G doesn&#x27;t care about brand loyalty. I thought the product was excellent, but now it is time to switch to something with similar ingredients that is available at a reasonable price. P&amp;G and the Nioxin label are now no longer part of my hair care because if you can&#x27;t depend on them for their products there isn&#x27;t a reason to do business with them. A real shame because the products were quite good, but P&amp;G will probably change them at some point too.</li>
            <li> Bought this on the advice of my hair stylist. I&#x27;ve used it for about a year, now, and can&#x27;t see that it has had any impact on the fullness or texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> Since this product hasn&#x27;t been manufactured for awhile, I just wanted to mention that I reviewed the ingredients and found that the main difference between it and the vitamins I was taking already was biotin.  I added 10,000 mcg of biotin, and it&#x27;s working just as well as Nioxin ever did.  Not trying to sell you anything; just wanted to pass the information along.</li>
            <li> Compared to your leading multivitamin, Nioxin does not do anything! I take [[ASIN:B0015R3AAO Optimum Nutrition Opti-Men Multivitamins, 180-Count]] and it has 3x times the key ingredients Nioxin uses for hair/skin/nails and it&#x27;s the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put almost anything in a professional looking bottle, charge a pretty penny and you&#x27;ll have people buying it. I&#x27;m not saying spend the same amount on my type of multivitamin but you could go to the drugstore, spend $10-$15 and get SO much more for your money. I&#x27;m only even righting this review because my sister was about to purchase these when I screamed at her to take a multivitamin instead. Seriously, your WHOLE body (hair/skin/nails included)and your wallet/purse will thank you.</li>
            <li> I was an inocent victim of my daugther&#x27;s hair dresser, cutting my hair toooooo muchhhh in a horrible style. When she finished I was crying!!! I start a search on the Internet, I found Nioxin and I can&#x27;t be happier. Three months treatment and my hair is growing so fast!!!  I relly recomend the product!  The service and price in Amazon are excelent!!!!</li>
            <li> First off...THE SELLER IS GREAT!  The supplements were just old because they lacked the smell of fresh vitamins ALONG WITH the notion that they were starting to crack.  The problem is the product...I compared it with my daughter&#x27;s vitamins and they were running neck and neck minus the amount of biotin...I was like WHAT?  I might as well buy Biotin.  The Saw Palmetto and Wild Yam that&#x27;s in the product seems to make breasts grow and lactate.  If there&#x27;s anyone thinking of Hairfinity...allow me to say...GREAT SUPPLEMENTS because of what they have in it...but you can get similar things from CVS...like NATURE&#x27;S BOUNTY HAIR, SKIN, AND NAILS supplements...3,000 Biotin...feel free to buy some MSM 1000mg and/or some more Biotin if you like...but this supplement has better effective quantities and cost me $10. vs. $25 plus</li>
            <li> Received these from Amazon, and the vitamins are cracked and very \\&quot;dry\\&quot;. Apparently, this is a sign of old vitamins---repackaged in a new container.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I can see a big difference in my hair after taking Nioxin for 30-days.  Healthy &amp; growth are the results.</li>
            <li> This product is fake and/or expired. I bought it for my wife and when we opened the bottle all the tablets were cracked and smelly. When we asked our physician, he told us not to use the tablets and dump them in garbage. I think that is the place it belonged. I am never ever going to buy items from this seller. Amazon is going to loose business because of sellers like these. It&#x27;s up to you guys to believe me or some fake posters from the seller itself.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 months. I can not say that it has helped with my hair loss. I have not yet noticed a difference in the thickness of my hair nor have I noticed growth in the temple area which has thinned over the years. I plan to complete the second bottle, maybe it takes a full 6 months.</li>
            <li> This stuff works BUT i started to look for something better and i found it. I tried to find it on Amazon i wish they carried it its called \\&quot;ResVit&amp;aacute;le Keratin Enhance\\&quot; i buy it here usually they have buy one get one 50% off so i always wait for that. I swear buy this stuff:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> My personal opinion is I took this product for 3 weeks and my hair was constantly shedding very bad so I stopped taking them on the fourth week  and Ive noticed the shedding has completely stopped. So I will no longer be using nioxin again as part of my hair care regimen. Again that&#x27;s the results that I had so what didn&#x27;t work for me might work for someone else.</li>
            <li> This product didnt work as expected . I always buy stuff after checking the rating ...but ion this case even reviews and rating was good...but this product never worked for me.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on recommendation of a friend to help my splitting fingernails.  It worked wonders for her but didn&#x27;t do a thing for me that I was able to discern.  Maybe her being in her 20&#x27;s and I in my 60&#x27;s makes a difference in its ability to work.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to address reviews complaining of \\&quot;cracked\\&quot; pills and Nioxin&#x27;s quality control (or lack thereof). Nioxin, as with any salon quality product (most salons have exclusivity contracts which subsequently will accept returns, and guarantee their products; past that they are unable to verify the authenticity of the products (I work in a salon--it&#x27;s a sad truth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are priced great, however I did purchase mine at a salon. Noticing great growth--I already have super thick hair so that wasn&#x27;t a concern--but as someone who goes back and forth from artificial nails to natural, nail growth and strength was a concern; noticing additional strength and growth which is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in the ever-so-awkward phase of growing out a pixie cut--I&#x27;ll keep you posted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money; If you&#x27;re hesitant about ordering on Amazon (make sure sealed and cotton inside) go to Nioxin and find a certified salon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with thinning hair, they also have great hair kits with cleansers, conditioners and scalp treatments to ensure the health and quality of the scalp--definitely worth it !</li>
            <li> I like the results. Hair and nails seem stronger and  healthier. Bargain price compared to retail stores. Give it a try. If you like the retail results you love the shrinking price of buying on line. Amazon makes it easy to buy on line.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have taken them for about a year or more, however, I was disappointed with my last order because the seal was broken and has a smell that tells me it&#x27;s not fresh. I have noticed that last bottle does not have a expiration date printed like other items. I open the bottle about a week later and I didn&#x27;t keep the label to send it back so end up throw a way the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> ***Update 12/15/2014**** After doing a lot of research, I found a comparable product with Biotin and Horsetail ingredients. It&#x27;s made by Ovation and cost under $13.00 for 60 count bottle!!! It works wonderfully. I love it!  Go to this site:  http://ovationhair.com/vitamins.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***: Not sure what happened but I am extremely disappointed! This product has been going up in price and I get that... inflation whatever, but the last time I got it is was up to $34 for a 90 count bottle (on 3/20/2012) and I wanted to get 3 more bottles today (8/2/2012) and saw that it had jumped to over a minimum of $83.99 per bottle!!!! What Happened!!!!!!!!! I won&#x27;t be getting it anymore now, can&#x27;t afford it!!!!!!! Below is what I use to think.....&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking Nioxin for over 8 years now. Originally my stylist recommended it to me to help with that original sighting of thinning at the top center (or crown) of the head. It&#x27;s fantastic. My hair became extremely full again - all over. You can not see any scalp unless I intentionally part it. My hair is very healthy and full of elasticity. I really love it.  I buy the 90 count bottle because it is way more cost effective. I am an Amazon Prime member so I pay no shipping on many products. It&#x27;s just like going to the store to get this but I don&#x27;t waste my gas. Hope this helps because I know it is difficult to determine if you want to try a new product. This one really works. I don&#x27;t think it will correct baldness, it is really a vitamin that helps fullness when you still have your hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure why Nioxin thinks the average consumer will keep buying a product they TRIPLE the price on (I bought it for $23 + shipping in January) when there are so many other working products on the market now. Biotin, which also works, will be good enough a supplement from now on. Hairomega is good too. And shame on you Nioxin- I wanted to give you a high review but not now.</li>
            <li> This product is great and I have seen great result as my hair growth was slow prior to the use of this product. It does cause an increase in hair growth every but it is worth it. Why did the price increase?!</li>
            <li> Doesnt work, noticed no improvements at all, save your money and buy something else like a hat!!! I continued to lose hair during the time I was taking this product,</li>
            <li> The product is good been using for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;Last week I realized my 90 day supply was about done so I came on here expecting to pay $30 for another bottle. Now it&#x27;s over $100 are you fricking kidding me. The nerve of these thieves. I will be looking for other alternatives and if the price comes back to earth I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Nioxin (90 tablets) earlier this year.  I can&#x27;t say that I am overwhelmed by the results but I didn&#x27;t take the tablets consistently for 90 days.  I&#x27;ve only been serious about this product for the last 45 days.  However, I came on here to purchase another bottle and noticed the jump in price!  I paid under $30 (shipping included) for 90 tablets earlier this year.  Now the price is $149 or more?  This is crazy!  The product is definitely not worth almost $200.  Save yourself some money and go purchase biotin pills (which is basically what Nioxin is).  I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing this product until the price comes down.</li>
            <li> these pills are garbage i dont know why there are so many good reviews they did absoultely nothing for my hair skin or nails i took them for 3 months straight and no improvement they should be taken off the market and the price is ridiculous i dont see how something that doesnt even work can be so expensive save your money and dont buy these try oledas hair pills way better.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting thin in the top just like a man.  I&#x27;m African American and I had a permanent put in by my stylist about every six months.  I stopped the perm, but my hair kept falling out.  My stylist gave me a bottle of the Nioxin and the shedding stopped.  My hair is stronger and growing now.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used these vitamins for about 6 months and love them.  I was going to order more however the price is ridiculous.  I contacted Nioxin and was told that they are making a new formula (hope it is the same or better) and it should be out within the next 6-9 months.  The price should go back down with new product.  I decided to try Maxi Hair until the formula is available.  Nobody should pay this price for any vitamin.  I paid about $27 for 90 before they stopped making them.</li>
            <li> I use to buy these vitamins at the beauty supply shop for $29.00 a few years ago.  They were a nice hair vitamin. But no way in the world am I going support the price gouging simply because they know people will pay for if it promises to grow your hair. There is nothing in this product that would support the price they are charging now. I went to get more of the vitamin to find out that instead of $29.00, it&#x27;s now $240-$300 for a 3-month supply. Are you kidding me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other hair vitamins that work just as well. I use LaBeaute by Scandanavian Formulas (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016BESGO/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_sfl_title_1).  I originally purchased it for my skin but discovered it made my hair grow stronger and thicker and I have thinning hair. I stopped taking it a few months ago and I can see a big difference in my hair. I&#x27;d been taking it for over 10 years. The price has gone down over the years. 10 years ago it was over $100 for a 90-day supply.  Now it is reasonable. If fluctuates between $56-$61 nowadays. I could definitely see that my hair changed and it started thinning and breaking and looking lifeless. I knew I would see a difference but since I was taking so many other vitamins, I thought I wouldn&#x27;t notice.  It also grows your nails very strong as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither product will make new hair grow if your hair loss is from a serious conditions like alopecia or pattern baldness.  Both make the hair already on your head grow a little faster. I did find that nioxin makes your hair and nails grow a little faster and LaBeaute makes your hair grow thicker and stronger, but not as fast as Nioxin but noticeable as well.  Don&#x27;t support greed.</li>
            <li> I would like to address the price because I was initially in shock over the price, but remember certain companies realize that the Nioxin has stop making the old formula and will not come out with the new formula until Jan 2013. In the meantime, the demand for this product is driving up the cost. The individual companies that still have the old formula are profiting on the demand, but when the new formula is released the price will go back down because there is not a shortage of the vitamins. I did email the company and this is what they said. For those loyal customers visit some of the local salons to see if you can still purchase them because some still have a few in stock and the 30 capsule is still $19.99 and I live in the DMV. PLEASE be advised that purchasing them off of this site is not a good thing because of the price gouging.    Thank you for contacting Procter and Gamble Professional Care Exclusive Lines.  The Recharging Complex is currently unavailable. They are not discontinued, but  they are improving and reformulating the product. It will not be available again  until sometime around January of 2013. Nioxin is committed to delivering  innovation behind best in class product performance. The new product (with a  reformulation) is targeted to be available in the next 6-9 months.  The product will still be called Recharging Complex.  Sorry for the inconvenience. Have a great day!

            <li> this was a purchase for a gift of a friend of mine and is exactly what she wanted , thank you</li>
            <li> love, love this product my hair was going so good and then you could not buy it any more don&#x27;t know what happen to this product it need to come back.</li>
            <li> Works great just as advertised. Easy to assemble. Used the day it was received. Shipped fast. No hassles with any part of the process!</li>
            <li> Had no luck with this product. You would be better off buying some saw palmetto and biotin. I took this stuff for a long while to realize that it wasn&#x27;t doing anything. Sorry this review isn&#x27;t more lengthy. All you need to know is that it didn&#x27;t work for me (male, 24)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these vitamins are good for you, having said that, unless they are putting some kind of magical substance in them that requires the cost to be many times greater than any other hair vitamin out there I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money. I bought a 3 month supply for about $62. and when I got low and went to buy more I saw that the price had gone up about 3 times that. I hadn&#x27;t even seen any results but thought it would be good to take a daily vitamin and one that would help my hair, skin, and nails as well. I was so irritated that even though I&#x27;d been using their shampoo and conditioner for the last 3 years (also with no amazing results) I was done with this ridiculous company. If you see results and it&#x27;s worth it to you then more power to you. But for that much money I need a miracle! I will NOT be buying anything ever again from this company.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles of the 90 count nioxin intensive recharging therapy. On opening one of them, I was shocked. All the yellow tablets are cracked horizontally in the middle, the the inscribed hallmark is Nixoin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon service is very good. They immediately let me return.</li>
            <li> I am not sure exactly why amazon, ebay ect... upped the price so high on these pills (must be cause they were selling out so fast) but you should be able to spend $20 for a 30 count bottle! Check your local salons, most franchised ones sell them for about $20 to $30!! You can also ask your hair stylist if she can order them for you and it should be in this low price range! If you have a super walmart and there is a salon inside they normally caring them for the low price! Hope this helps BUT DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ONLINE!!!!!!!!!!! You are spending $200 TOO MUCH!</li>
            <li> All I can say is it made my blood workup bad, it looked like my liver was not working so be careful</li>
            <li> I purchased this (several bottles) as I thought it would be effective in hair growth (because of all these reviews!) but 3 months of taking it now, and nothing, even my hair is still falling at the same rate or more. And I agree with the other review about the quality of the pills as they seem to break easily and taste horrible. I would be fine if they actually worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was searching for hair growth methods online (which one was nixon), and stumbled on the Immortals oil for hair growth, which you massage into the scalp.. It stopped my hair from falling further after 1 week of daily use, and my hair looks and feels much thicker. So at least that worked for me and am so grateful for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but as far as nixon supplements are concerned, i have stopped use, as it did not work for me.</li>
