            <li>Although I just started using it, I do see that my face is brighter and more even in tone.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately most makers of vitamin c serums do not bottle it correctly which means it&#x27;s</li>

            <li>Very nice not heavy and light citrus smell.</li>
            <li>and I plan to repurpose the bottle since a dark glass bottle is best used.  </li>
            <li>It is not a bad product but it is not my favorite face serum.</li>

            <li>and i see a huge improvement in the smoothness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>so I cannot accurately report on results.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C has always been so useful and healthy.</li>
            <li>Great serum to add to daily beauty regimen</li>
            <li>I found this Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s texture to be a bit thicker than I usually enjoy.</li>
            <li>I got this cheap from elite deals.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Leaves me refreshed in the morning and leaves my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have read literature that indicated  Vit C can help to restore my skins texture and appearance, while attacking free radicals which come with aging.</li>
            <li>Great serum to add to daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it a week, but I am seeing great results.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the serum feel of this product.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps my face oil free.</li>
            <li>dryness of my skin is decreasing and feels so smooth all day.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the pump this brand used.  </li>
            <li>Goes on so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This anti aging serum is not tested on animals and is paraben free.</li>
            <li>And would gladly trade in the thicker texture for the more gentle approach towards my skin.</li>
            <li>feels good in my skin so far, just started using this</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, I pump 2 pumps into my palm rub hands together and apply to full face and neck.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on sales promotion and it is a very nice basic Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is amazing for your skin, and this product proves exactly that.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li>really nice packaging, just started using it and so far so good, my skin is very sensitive and I have not had any reactions.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and works great with my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for one week and already have seen significant results in the radiance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought this for my girlfriend but decided to use it myself.</li>
            <li>Since using it I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in the discoloration in my face.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh on my skin!</li>
            <li>The serum is absorbed easily and does not leave your skin feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and so far my skin is a lot smoother after using this.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs and leaves me with a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>This make my face feel super smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li>It goes on my face smooth and my skin quickly absorbs it.  </li>
            <li>I will need to use it longer to see the real benefits and leave a more detailed review.</li>
            <li>I wondered if this would be any good,  after trying many other things.  </li>
            <li>For the price point it&#x27;s good that the serum is completely clear and gets absorbed quickly so you can put it on before makeup</li>
            <li>Make-up glides right on!</li>
            <li>BUT what I can say is that they bottled it right!</li>
            <li>Make sure to put this on and leave it alone with no other products on top for 15-20 minutes to let the vitamin c work.  </li>
            <li>Like this product, makes my face nice and soft.</li>
            <li>and I think it could have been avoided with daily usage of vitamin C and a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it absorbs into my skin so fast and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling sticky or as if it has anything on it at all.</li>
            <li>After I finish this bottle, I will buy it at full price.</li>
            <li>Good serum that will make your skin feel &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; (makes you look somewhat younger)!</li>
            <li>It takes a good four pumps to dispense enough to cover my face and neck</li>
            <li>would buy this again, and at full price.</li>
            <li>I love it so much. .</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved this product, and we will definitely purchase it again when she runs out.</li>
            <li>I had tons of people tell me I look good &amp; younger!</li>
            <li>No bad reaction or anything and haven&#x27;t started seeing results yet but will update my review after using for a while.</li>
            <li>It feels so light, I may use it right before makeup.</li>
            <li>So far I love it very much, can&#x27;t wait to see the better result  after a month.</li>
            <li>A little sticky, but does smooth out and makes hands feel great.</li>
            <li>Someone told me that I looked like I was 29 the other day in a picture on facebook lol.</li>
            <li>This serum absorbs quickly into your skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok,  I bought a different brand and it has more moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I have used many different vitamin c serums and really love this one.</li>
            <li>applying it is a little more challenging than others because it is much more liquid-y.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a visible reduction in wrinkles or smile lines; however, I had several blemishes that this product cleared away and left looking perfect.</li>
            <li>With consistent use it leaves your skin brighter, smooth and pores are refined.  </li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t specific as to how much to use, so I&#x27;m just kind of using my judgment and doing one to one-and-a-half pumps (any more than that</li>
            <li>It gives my aging skin a good repair after long day exposure to sun.</li>
            <li>As suggested I love the idea to keep my new serum refrigerated.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy and smooth to use and absorbed fast</li>
            <li>I know it sounds odd to be so happy about the bottle but</li>
            <li>Really good for dry skin, I didn&#x27;t get it for the anti aging aspect</li>
            <li>Over tried a couple of different vitamin c oil and this one is among the top!</li>
            <li>The pump takes a couple presses to get started the first time you use it and rotates very easily but getting the serum out is easy enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just easy and simple way to keep the skin healthy.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and easily and its souks and completely.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft, reduces dark circles, and smells very nice!</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency and the smooth, silky way</li>
            <li>I really like this serum its light and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and has kept my skin feeling fresh everyday</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed by my skin without any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled to finally found this product.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed after a while.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>Vit C plays an important role in maintaining healthy, resilient skin, preventing wrinkles and reversing the UV damage such as age spots.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>All I noticed so far is that my skin is more softer and adds radiance during the day.</li>
            <li>face feels fresh after every use.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>The price for me on this product was well worth it</li>
            <li>i am 85 years old and my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>I use this every evening and every morning , it makes my skin so soft and lovely.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s going pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I use this right away after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>tried it right after it arrived to see if my skin will react from using this Serum.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s right on target.</li>
            <li>This type of product really need to be used a long time to give a good review.</li>
            <li>I have actually received several compliments on how I have beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used anti-aging serums in the past, and this one is by far the best I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The instructions don&#x27;t say (or I don&#x27;t remember), but 3-5 pumps is more than enough for each application (I was applying more liberally at first, but it goes pretty fast when you do that).</li>
            <li>.. im a big fan of vitamin C .. this is one of my favorite :) it was truly absorb when u put it on your face.. and it gives you a natural glow.</li>
            <li>so it gets absorbed first.</li>
            <li>other then tht, it&#x27;s a pretty good serum.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s absorbs quite nicely and does not take long to absorb</li>
            <li>No rashes or any allergic reaction right after using it for the first time until now.</li>
            <li>My face soaks it up quickly and it leaves my face feeling very  </li>
            <li>The Herbalist Vitamin C serum is light and has a fresh fragrance leaving the skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Great product I love that is did NOT leave a sticky residue or have a weird odor to it.</li>
            <li>I feel like I might need more time to see if it works really well, but so far my skin loves it.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and the smell is so great compared to other vitamin c products I have recently tried</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what makes it possible of promoting a youthful healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Love to use this serum after a deep cleaning of my face.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly by the directions, which says to use after you shower.</li>
            <li>It has a clear and gel-like texture and helps to prevent advanced aging.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a pretty glow.</li>
            <li>Agec spot really diminish!  </li>
            <li>I love the bottle it came in as I mix a lot of essential oils for my hair</li>
            <li>Once the bottle is finished, I plan to purchase more in the future as I do see a difference</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say I look younger, but I love the way my makeup goes on after I use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rejuvenating!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a vitamin c serum before and know that it takes some time to notice visible results but even in a very short time, I am pleased with how my skin is responding.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with the initial results of this serum and look forward to seeing what happens with continued use.</li>
            <li>This serum is not only contains vitamin C but also Hyaluronic Acid serum and more.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft &amp; smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>My face is starting to look better already.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and my skin has a more even tone.</li>
            <li>I have been using vitamin c serums for over six months consistently once or twice a day</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a serum like this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely hooked!</li>
            <li>first when applying it feels as if your skin tightens, kind of like when you apply rubbing alcohol to your face just with out the burn or extreme tightness.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and keeps your face feeling tight and looking even better.</li>
            <li>So once you finish using this really nice serum you can use the bottle for other homeopathic oils.  </li>
            <li>It gentle removes dead skin and gives you a bright complexion.</li>
            <li>The serum is just as good as the more expensive ones you can buy at specialty stores.</li>
            <li>, the ingredients are good and there is little scent which I like!  </li>
            <li>and I expect to continue seeing  positive results.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin c is ph dependent and if you toss other high ph products on top it won&#x27;t work as well!  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out either.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and I was able to use a small amount to use all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing a positive change in the texture of my skin all ready.</li>
            <li>This serum was not too potent for my skin since I have used it for over 6 months however a new user needs to ensure this potency and product are tested on a smaller part of the skin before all over the face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it actually does help my fine lines disappear from my face.  </li>
            <li>I have been putting it on every night and love how smooth my skin has been feeling lately.</li>
            <li>The formula doesnt leave my face really sticky like some serums do.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like that the directions say follow with a moisturizer, because then you don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s working, or if it&#x27;s just your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>I finished the whole bottle in 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I use it every night and it really has helped my skin</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my skin</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product, looks promising</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>hahaha.</li>
            <li>i really like the vitamin c in the morning</li>
            <li>Face has really improved since using this.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any real results from using this product</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen much of a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I got this to review and really like it alot.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>For an honest review, I will mention that I received this product at an extremely discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum for a little over a week, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and sinks into the skin right away.</li>
            <li>I have spent more money than I should have on some items and loved them but ultimately given up due to price.</li>
            <li>First, I love that this came with a pump to make dispensing easier and less chances of contamination.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend the product (this one or taking a little time each week to make your own and very inexpensive).  </li>
            <li>I also preferred the pump instead of the dropper most the other companies use</li>
            <li>When I found Herbalist 20% Vitamin C Serum with Medical grade hyaluronic acid, I was excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to use it after I clean my face every night.</li>
            <li>I noticed less of the fine grooves along my laugh lines within minutes of application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really sensitive to anything too heavy and perfumed, but this serum was easy and light.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the reason for that, but I would assume it is because the heat opens your pores and that would mean the serum can get down in the pores and do the most good.</li>
            <li>I always prefer to go natural but also I love all the natural benefit of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Also, really like that it has a pump dispenser vs the normal dropper.  </li>
            <li>Also, really like that it has a pump dispenser vs the normal dropper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using vitamin C serums for months and it has gotten rid of all my post acne hyper pigmentation as well as prevented any new acne from forming!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it with my new Hitachi Hada Crie moisturizer tool to aid the absorption and have noticed a brightening of my acne scars!</li>
            <li>Love this.. using it on stretch marks and seems to be making a slight difference.  </li>
            <li>This particular serum has a 20% concentration, double the amount of many serums currently  on the market.  </li>
            <li>has a dropper I use it mainly at night then a face moisturizer would recommend</li>
            <li>I am in my sixties and know this is a must have product for older skin.</li>
            <li>This is a decent Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for your nightly routine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a highly discounted price for my unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I like how highly absorbent it is.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt very smooth after a few days of use.</li>
            <li>My wrinkles are really starting to show, so I need this kind of product to shock it back to looking younger again.  </li>
            <li>I have also seen a difference in the laugh lines around my mouth, which is not as deep.</li>
            <li>Love this Vit C. Use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few now and in comparison I&#x27;d say this product is just ok.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the quality of the product and I particularly like that there is no strong fragrance added.  </li>
            <li>I like that this Herbalist Serum does not leave any greasy residue and it indeed absorbs and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>love the consistency, it seems thick, but absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>, I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It was very soft when applied.</li>
            <li>It did not affect my very sensitive skin  </li>
            <li>but I have used other similar products that seem to soak into the skin better.</li>
            <li>well moisturized and soft!</li>
            <li>My fine lines seem less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>My whiteheads are nearly gone!</li>
            <li>Tightened my pores almost instantly and lifted my whole face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the way it looks, but it feels better.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly dry skin and always am very careful about trying only products that are good for sensitive yet aging skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it simply because it haven&#x27;t noticed it making my dark spots go away.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C helps the body produce collagen which makes the skin looks young and very soft.</li>
            <li>Since I start to put this on my skin, my skin feel rejuvenated, tight , and smooth.</li>
            <li>I live in Las Vegas, and it&#x27;s dry and hot as heck.  </li>
            <li>vitamin c deteriorates with the presence of air and/or light and this serum comes in a dark glass bottle and is dispensed via pump!</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C Serum is comparable and possibly even better than ANY high end product I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>It helped soften my skin and also helped clear up some rashes and acne.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>Skin felt soft after use.</li>
            <li>Herbalist.com has been so helpful with all needs from aging, to weight loss, very knowledgeable and terrific products.</li>
            <li>Used it and skin feels soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is lighter and soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised at how this felt when I put it on alone.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin feel so soft - and it also has brightened up my face.  </li>
            <li>I like this vitamin C  Serum so far, I have used it on my skin.</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural instead of a ton of chemicals.</li>
            <li>was a bit worried that applying this, along with my daily moisturizer would cause too much oil and breakouts</li>
            <li>Só far the smell and texture leaves spaces for doubt of the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>Really light and not too heavily scented.</li>
            <li>absorbs well into skin without feeling sticky like some vital c products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a week it leaves my skin felling soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>As far as what it&#x27;s done for my skin</li>
            <li>I do like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li>makes skin soft.</li>
            <li>and when I put this on my face I feel refreshed, and my skin seems to stay soft all day.</li>
            <li>Leaves no greasy residue and my face hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was a baby.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t use a lot of facial products but really like this.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised on how this serum felt on my face upon application.</li>
            <li>Too early to tll is it is effectiv but like the texture</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s still too early to notice any results</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and had no redness, or irritation from this product.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a week so far.</li>
            <li>Instead when I used it on my face it seemed to leave my skin feeling smooth and soft once it dried.  </li>
            <li>I like that it comes in a dark bottle with a pump and was mostly full but</li>
            <li>so you get the right amount, not too much and not too little</li>
            <li>The pump is great, and though the bottle is small it will last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see so many women with seriously wrinkled skin</li>
            <li>Studies show that Vitamin C is highly effective in reversing the signs of aging, so long as it has at least a 10% concentration of absorbic acid.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and to keep purchasing to keep your skin looking younger and firmer!</li>
            <li>It helped brighten my face when it was becoming dull.</li>
            <li>Vitamin c serum smooth a small amount over neck and face.</li>
            <li>I have mixed normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>I use this daily makes my fave clear and soft.</li>
            <li>This serum leaves your skin feeling tight and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Have used for a few days so not sure of the long term effects, but so far it seems to be good.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing for my dry skin!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my other half as a gift as she has tried many similar products before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 4 days and so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Vitamin C Serum and I&#x27;ved used a couple Vitamin C Serum so far aside from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As I mentioned earlier the moisture locking didn&#x27;t work too well on me, but I could chalk it up to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, coming in a little pump spray bottle, and for the extra few seconds it takes before putting on your regular moisturizer before bed, it&#x27;s SO  worth the investment for fresher, younger feeling skin!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to get the full effects that other users describe.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product over many of those expensive name-brand serums out there, costing only a fraction of the exorbitant prices out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Herbalist vitamin C serum is by far the only one which immediately results in my skin looking and feeling younger.</li>
            <li>Heavy vitamin C products tend to do that with me though, but I will always have high hopes and try new brands.</li>
            <li>I have had not had any breakouts so far as I am always worried about this due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and I&#x27;ve been using some type of vitamin C for years.  </li>
            <li>However, I have used other Vitamin C facial products that emit a somewhat intense Orange Essence that I quite like and look for in a Vitamin C facial product.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I will see results right away</li>
            <li>My wrinkles are much less noticeble and my face is much softer.</li>
            <li>I feel it has really help the slight sun damage I have on my chest.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice drastic results, but it makes skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>so I am able to apply my make up and go about my usual day in a few minutes after application.</li>
            <li>Always store in a dark cool place ideally in a dark glass dropper or bottle.  </li>
            <li>Not only did I have dry, uneven skin tone, but I also noticed the appearance of dark circles and fine lines around my eyes.</li>

            <li> More about this product...</li>
            <li> light, not the kind of serum that could be used in place of a moisturizer; more of an undermoisturizer type of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I would not expect to see more results than I already have.  </li>
            <li> Most produced vitamin c serum has additives to preserve the serum.  </li>

            <li> Leaves skin feeling so smooth!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s important to use this before you apply any kind of moisturizer</li>
            <li> Although I just started using it, I do see that my face is brighter and more even in tone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately most makers of vitamin c serums do not bottle it correctly which means it&#x27;s</li>

            <li> dryness of my skin is decreasing and feels so smooth all day.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the pump this brand used.  </li>
            <li> Goes on so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This anti aging serum is not tested on animals and is paraben free.</li>

            <li> It is easy to apply, I pump 2 pumps into my palm rub hands together and apply to full face and neck.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on sales promotion and it is a very nice basic Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is amazing for your skin, and this product proves exactly that.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth, and clean.</li>

            <li> The serum is absorbed easily and does not leave your skin feeling sticky.</li>

            <li> This make my face feel super smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li> It goes on my face smooth and my skin quickly absorbs it.  </li>
            <li> I will need to use it longer to see the real benefits and leave a more detailed review.</li>
            <li> I wondered if this would be any good,  after trying many other things.  </li>
            <li> For the price point it&#x27;s good that the serum is completely clear and gets absorbed quickly so you can put it on before makeup</li>
            <li> Make-up glides right on!</li>
            <li> BUT what I can say is that they bottled it right!</li>
            <li> Make sure to put this on and leave it alone with no other products on top for 15-20 minutes to let the vitamin c work.  </li>
            <li> Like this product, makes my face nice and soft.</li>
            <li> and I think it could have been avoided with daily usage of vitamin C and a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love this product it absorbs into my skin so fast and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling sticky or as if it has anything on it at all.</li>
            <li> After I finish this bottle, I will buy it at full price.</li>
            <li> Good serum that will make your skin feel &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; (makes you look somewhat younger)!</li>
            <li> It takes a good four pumps to dispense enough to cover my face and neck</li>
            <li> would buy this again, and at full price.</li>
            <li> I love it so much. .</li>
            <li> She absolutely loved this product, and we will definitely purchase it again when she runs out.</li>
            <li> I had tons of people tell me I look good &amp; younger!</li>
            <li> No bad reaction or anything and haven&#x27;t started seeing results yet but will update my review after using for a while.</li>
            <li> It feels so light, I may use it right before makeup.</li>
            <li> So far I love it very much, can&#x27;t wait to see the better result  after a month.</li>
            <li> A little sticky, but does smooth out and makes hands feel great.</li>
            <li> Someone told me that I looked like I was 29 the other day in a picture on facebook lol.</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs quickly into your skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok,  I bought a different brand and it has more moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have used many different vitamin c serums and really love this one.</li>
            <li> applying it is a little more challenging than others because it is much more liquid-y.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a visible reduction in wrinkles or smile lines; however, I had several blemishes that this product cleared away and left looking perfect.</li>
            <li> With consistent use it leaves your skin brighter, smooth and pores are refined.  </li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t specific as to how much to use, so I&#x27;m just kind of using my judgment and doing one to one-and-a-half pumps (any more than that</li>
            <li> It gives my aging skin a good repair after long day exposure to sun.</li>
            <li> As suggested I love the idea to keep my new serum refrigerated.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy and smooth to use and absorbed fast</li>
            <li> I know it sounds odd to be so happy about the bottle but</li>
            <li> Really good for dry skin, I didn&#x27;t get it for the anti aging aspect</li>
            <li> Over tried a couple of different vitamin c oil and this one is among the top!</li>
            <li> The pump takes a couple presses to get started the first time you use it and rotates very easily but getting the serum out is easy enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just easy and simple way to keep the skin healthy.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and easily and its souks and completely.</li>

            <li> I really like the consistency and the smooth, silky way</li>
            <li> I really like this serum its light and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and has kept my skin feeling fresh everyday</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed by my skin without any sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled to finally found this product.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed after a while.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and feels so much better.  </li>
            <li> Vit C plays an important role in maintaining healthy, resilient skin, preventing wrinkles and reversing the UV damage such as age spots.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> All I noticed so far is that my skin is more softer and adds radiance during the day.</li>
            <li> face feels fresh after every use.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> The price for me on this product was well worth it</li>
            <li> i am 85 years old and my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> I use this every evening and every morning , it makes my skin so soft and lovely.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s going pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I use this right away after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> tried it right after it arrived to see if my skin will react from using this Serum.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s right on target.</li>
            <li> This type of product really need to be used a long time to give a good review.</li>
            <li> I have actually received several compliments on how I have beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used anti-aging serums in the past, and this one is by far the best I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The instructions don&#x27;t say (or I don&#x27;t remember), but 3-5 pumps is more than enough for each application (I was applying more liberally at first, but it goes pretty fast when you do that).</li>
            <li> .. im a big fan of vitamin C .. this is one of my favorite :) it was truly absorb when u put it on your face.. and it gives you a natural glow.</li>
            <li> so it gets absorbed first.</li>
            <li> other then tht, it&#x27;s a pretty good serum.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s absorbs quite nicely and does not take long to absorb</li>
            <li> No rashes or any allergic reaction right after using it for the first time until now.</li>
            <li> My face soaks it up quickly and it leaves my face feeling very  </li>
            <li> The Herbalist Vitamin C serum is light and has a fresh fragrance leaving the skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great product I love that is did NOT leave a sticky residue or have a weird odor to it.</li>
            <li> I feel like I might need more time to see if it works really well, but so far my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and the smell is so great compared to other vitamin c products I have recently tried</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what makes it possible of promoting a youthful healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Love to use this serum after a deep cleaning of my face.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly by the directions, which says to use after you shower.</li>
            <li> It has a clear and gel-like texture and helps to prevent advanced aging.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a pretty glow.</li>
            <li> Agec spot really diminish!  </li>
            <li> I love the bottle it came in as I mix a lot of essential oils for my hair</li>
            <li> Once the bottle is finished, I plan to purchase more in the future as I do see a difference</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say I look younger, but I love the way my makeup goes on after I use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rejuvenating!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a vitamin c serum before and know that it takes some time to notice visible results but even in a very short time, I am pleased with how my skin is responding.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with the initial results of this serum and look forward to seeing what happens with continued use.</li>
            <li> This serum is not only contains vitamin C but also Hyaluronic Acid serum and more.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft &amp; smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> My face is starting to look better already.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and my skin has a more even tone.</li>
            <li> I have been using vitamin c serums for over six months consistently once or twice a day</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a serum like this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely hooked!</li>
            <li> first when applying it feels as if your skin tightens, kind of like when you apply rubbing alcohol to your face just with out the burn or extreme tightness.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and keeps your face feeling tight and looking even better.</li>
            <li> So once you finish using this really nice serum you can use the bottle for other homeopathic oils.  </li>
            <li> It gentle removes dead skin and gives you a bright complexion.</li>
            <li> The serum is just as good as the more expensive ones you can buy at specialty stores.</li>
            <li> , the ingredients are good and there is little scent which I like!  </li>
            <li> and I expect to continue seeing  positive results.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin c is ph dependent and if you toss other high ph products on top it won&#x27;t work as well!  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out either.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly and I was able to use a small amount to use all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing a positive change in the texture of my skin all ready.</li>
            <li> This serum was not too potent for my skin since I have used it for over 6 months however a new user needs to ensure this potency and product are tested on a smaller part of the skin before all over the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it actually does help my fine lines disappear from my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been putting it on every night and love how smooth my skin has been feeling lately.</li>
            <li> The formula doesnt leave my face really sticky like some serums do.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like that the directions say follow with a moisturizer, because then you don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s working, or if it&#x27;s just your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> I finished the whole bottle in 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use it every night and it really has helped my skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my skin</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product, looks promising</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> hahaha.</li>
            <li> i really like the vitamin c in the morning</li>
            <li> Face has really improved since using this.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen any real results from using this product</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen much of a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I got this to review and really like it alot.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> For an honest review, I will mention that I received this product at an extremely discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum for a little over a week, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and sinks into the skin right away.</li>
            <li> I have spent more money than I should have on some items and loved them but ultimately given up due to price.</li>
            <li> First, I love that this came with a pump to make dispensing easier and less chances of contamination.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend the product (this one or taking a little time each week to make your own and very inexpensive).  </li>
            <li> I also preferred the pump instead of the dropper most the other companies use</li>
            <li> When I found Herbalist 20% Vitamin C Serum with Medical grade hyaluronic acid, I was excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to use it after I clean my face every night.</li>
            <li> I noticed less of the fine grooves along my laugh lines within minutes of application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sensitive to anything too heavy and perfumed, but this serum was easy and light.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the reason for that, but I would assume it is because the heat opens your pores and that would mean the serum can get down in the pores and do the most good.</li>
            <li> I always prefer to go natural but also I love all the natural benefit of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Also, really like that it has a pump dispenser vs the normal dropper.  </li>
            <li> Also, really like that it has a pump dispenser vs the normal dropper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using vitamin C serums for months and it has gotten rid of all my post acne hyper pigmentation as well as prevented any new acne from forming!  </li>
            <li> I have been using it with my new Hitachi Hada Crie moisturizer tool to aid the absorption and have noticed a brightening of my acne scars!</li>
            <li> Love this.. using it on stretch marks and seems to be making a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> This particular serum has a 20% concentration, double the amount of many serums currently  on the market.  </li>
            <li> has a dropper I use it mainly at night then a face moisturizer would recommend</li>
            <li> I am in my sixties and know this is a must have product for older skin.</li>
            <li> This is a decent Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for your nightly routine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this company.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a highly discounted price for my unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like how highly absorbent it is.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt very smooth after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are really starting to show, so I need this kind of product to shock it back to looking younger again.  </li>
            <li> I have also seen a difference in the laugh lines around my mouth, which is not as deep.</li>
            <li> Love this Vit C. Use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few now and in comparison I&#x27;d say this product is just ok.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the quality of the product and I particularly like that there is no strong fragrance added.  </li>
            <li> I like that this Herbalist Serum does not leave any greasy residue and it indeed absorbs and dry quickly.</li>
            <li> love the consistency, it seems thick, but absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> , I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It was very soft when applied.</li>
            <li> It did not affect my very sensitive skin  </li>
            <li> but I have used other similar products that seem to soak into the skin better.</li>
            <li> well moisturized and soft!</li>
            <li> My fine lines seem less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My whiteheads are nearly gone!</li>
            <li> Tightened my pores almost instantly and lifted my whole face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the way it looks, but it feels better.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly dry skin and always am very careful about trying only products that are good for sensitive yet aging skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it simply because it haven&#x27;t noticed it making my dark spots go away.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C helps the body produce collagen which makes the skin looks young and very soft.</li>
            <li> Since I start to put this on my skin, my skin feel rejuvenated, tight , and smooth.</li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas, and it&#x27;s dry and hot as heck.  </li>
            <li> vitamin c deteriorates with the presence of air and/or light and this serum comes in a dark glass bottle and is dispensed via pump!</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is comparable and possibly even better than ANY high end product I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It helped soften my skin and also helped clear up some rashes and acne.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> Skin felt soft after use.</li>

            <li> It has made my skin feel so soft - and it also has brightened up my face.  </li>
            <li> I like this vitamin C  Serum so far, I have used it on my skin.</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural instead of a ton of chemicals.</li>
            <li> was a bit worried that applying this, along with my daily moisturizer would cause too much oil and breakouts</li>
            <li> Só far the smell and texture leaves spaces for doubt of the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> Really light and not too heavily scented.</li>
            <li> absorbs well into skin without feeling sticky like some vital c products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years old</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a week it leaves my skin felling soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> As far as what it&#x27;s done for my skin</li>
            <li> I do like it a lot so far.</li>
            <li> makes skin soft.</li>
            <li> and when I put this on my face I feel refreshed, and my skin seems to stay soft all day.</li>
            <li> Leaves no greasy residue and my face hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was a baby.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t use a lot of facial products but really like this.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised on how this serum felt on my face upon application.</li>
            <li> Too early to tll is it is effectiv but like the texture</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s still too early to notice any results</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and had no redness, or irritation from this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a week so far.</li>
            <li> Instead when I used it on my face it seemed to leave my skin feeling smooth and soft once it dried.  </li>
            <li> I like that it comes in a dark bottle with a pump and was mostly full but</li>
            <li> so you get the right amount, not too much and not too little</li>
            <li> The pump is great, and though the bottle is small it will last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see so many women with seriously wrinkled skin</li>
            <li> Studies show that Vitamin C is highly effective in reversing the signs of aging, so long as it has at least a 10% concentration of absorbic acid.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and to keep purchasing to keep your skin looking younger and firmer!</li>
            <li> It helped brighten my face when it was becoming dull.</li>
            <li> Vitamin c serum smooth a small amount over neck and face.</li>
            <li> I have mixed normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I use this daily makes my fave clear and soft.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves your skin feeling tight and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Have used for a few days so not sure of the long term effects, but so far it seems to be good.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my other half as a gift as she has tried many similar products before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 4 days and so far I&#x27;m liking it.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Vitamin C Serum and I&#x27;ved used a couple Vitamin C Serum so far aside from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As I mentioned earlier the moisture locking didn&#x27;t work too well on me, but I could chalk it up to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, coming in a little pump spray bottle, and for the extra few seconds it takes before putting on your regular moisturizer before bed, it&#x27;s SO  worth the investment for fresher, younger feeling skin!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to get the full effects that other users describe.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product over many of those expensive name-brand serums out there, costing only a fraction of the exorbitant prices out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Herbalist vitamin C serum is by far the only one which immediately results in my skin looking and feeling younger.</li>
            <li> Heavy vitamin C products tend to do that with me though, but I will always have high hopes and try new brands.</li>
            <li> I have had not had any breakouts so far as I am always worried about this due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and I&#x27;ve been using some type of vitamin C for years.  </li>
            <li> However, I have used other Vitamin C facial products that emit a somewhat intense Orange Essence that I quite like and look for in a Vitamin C facial product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will see results right away</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are much less noticeble and my face is much softer.</li>
            <li> I feel it has really help the slight sun damage I have on my chest.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice drastic results, but it makes skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> so I am able to apply my make up and go about my usual day in a few minutes after application.</li>
            <li> Always store in a dark cool place ideally in a dark glass dropper or bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not only did I have dry, uneven skin tone, but I also noticed the appearance of dark circles and fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> not super thick which i like it easy to use and not oilly</li>
            <li> I wish I had taken a before and after photo just to remind myself how much of a difference a few weeks has made!</li>
            <li> but i have not used it long enough to say it works or not.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve not been using it long enough</li>
            <li> and it just doesn&#x27;t absorb), which will make this last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps my skin is a bit too sensitive as it had a drying affect on me, which is odd, I know, since the hyaluronic acid is meant to bind moisture.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it in the morning after I have clean my face and add a little on my face, and let it dry for about 10 mins or while I finish getting dressed.</li>
            <li> In other words, it helps to slow down your skin&#x27;s losing ability to hold its elasticity, its pliability, which leads to wrinkles, crows&#x27; feet, fine lines, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of all the serums I have used lately this one seems to be very efficient.  </li>
            <li> My skin is also smoother and softer than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I expected my face to look and feel different.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long to see any difference, but I feel it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Even better, this costs a lot less than the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Product texture and color is similar to more expensive vitamin c serums I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have personally always been skeptical of such products, but this really has softened my wife&#x27;s skin, made it smoother!</li>
            <li> dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;4 stars because of the dry patches I got after testing.  </li>
            <li> I wake up every morning with really dry skin</li>
            <li> I have big pores on my nose and a few on my forehead, and they appear to be getting smaller.</li>
            <li> Bumps and sun damage to my face which I just accepted as part of getting older are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make the appearance of my dark spots less noticeable, but as far as the suppleness of my skin...</li>
            <li> I have been tying to get rid of dark spots after having facial moles removed from the sides of my face and neck and I am truly seeing a difference, however,  </li>
            <li> I had previously had a different brand vitamin C serum and couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I am not particularly fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to see a little bit of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Only been using a couple weeks so not sure of long term</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few days, but I can already see results.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had similar products that have a dropper, and disliked it.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum does make my Face/Neck feel extra clean/smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> I have noticed some decrease in my hyperpigmentation, but not much.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in just a few short days - my skin is softer, smoother and brighter.  </li>
            <li> Never really used anything like this before.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days but am noticing a difference in my skin tone and firmness.  </li>
            <li> no Huge Change in a Short amount of time.</li>
            <li> No apparent results after few uses.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left feeling very tight and itchy around my mouth.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My daughter said to me the other day my face looks smoother and tighter.</li>
            <li> A bit different from the other one I have tried in the past .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has not caused any breakouts or other issues.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as sticky as a lot of other vitamin c serums are.</li>
            <li> It doesnt dry out my eyes &amp; keeps my skin firm</li>
            <li> Herbalist - think you have a customer for life in my other half.</li>
            <li> I have used this for awhile and it seems to lighten up my dark spots a bit.  </li>
            <li> helps the dark spots.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been noticed a big change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel as if it reduced my sleepy dark circles under my eyes which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Some other reviews said that it&#x27;s a little drying, and I have to agree.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that every time you get a drop the serum runs down your finger if you are not quick to get it to your face.</li>
            <li> After using this a few times my face is extremely greasy feeling</li>
            <li> I have noticed less acne and softer and smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way finished with the bottle and have seen some brightness in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It gives a slight blush to my skin but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve notice some change I have a few dark spots on my face that seems to be lighting up</li>
            <li> Minimal air and no light!</li>
            <li> This one leaves your skin a little sticky.</li>
            <li> when i used it during the day, gave me a little breakout on my jaw.</li>
            <li> I feel like it sets into my face instead of adding my makeup in the morning since it is a little thicker.</li>
            <li> and i like to be a little lighter and thia helps me.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it needs a little shake before use?</li>
            <li> Vitamin c serums take a little bit of time to show results to improve skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the reason, I can already see the difference in my skin after just a few days.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly , it&#x27;s not greasy, and  </li>
            <li> Medicine droppers tend to be messy for me.</li>
            <li> (I bought this from another online retailer at a fraction of the cost, so I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted money even if I never see a difference.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the potency of the serum (20%) would be harsh for my skin</li>
            <li> I used this just a few times and can already feel the skin on my face getting firmer and &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer if I continue to apply it like I have been</li>
            <li> Also a few of my age spots are fading as well.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have already been experiencing reduction in the wrinkles that were on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using once</li>
            <li> This Product is a little Runny their&#x27;s hardly any Oil in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what my skin would look like if I hadn&#x27;t, but I would not want to find out.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how all of this works,</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming or greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s suppose to happen</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything beneficial for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am thirty and have very few wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t say whether it improves the look of aging.</li>
            <li> Hard to say if it is working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the product out using the dispenser</li>
            <li> You need to apply it each day/night without fail to even get minimal results, but results you will see eventually.</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t effected me in any negative way.</li>
            <li> It is a slow process and you  must have patience.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too thick</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to stop using due to nut allergy (macadamia in product)</li>
            <li> but I have not experienced any negative effects at all.</li>
            <li> If your vitamin c is not clear it means it has gone bad.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too thin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it smells a little like clay or unscented oil to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum by Herbalist.com LLC works just as well as those expensive name-brand serums out there that charge you a dollar and a leg.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying the expensive $100 ones at the department stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using an expensive Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> Sadly this gave my husband a bad reaction on his face</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing bad that I can say about this product.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin tingle a bit, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> so while I don&#x27;t hate it because I don&#x27;t think anything bad can come from putting vitamin C on my face</li>
            <li> Otherwise, when used alone/as a base layer as instructed, it feels tacky on my skin</li>
            <li> My daughter has terrible chicken pox scars and we have began to apply it to them as well.  </li>

            <li> Great for brown spots and overall great skin keeps me young!</li>
            <li> Worked wonders. I could see a difference after only 3 days.  My wrinkles are much less noticeble and my face is much softer.</li>
            <li> I like the product but I have used other similar products that seem to soak into the skin better. This one leaves your skin a little sticky.</li>
            <li> This is a must buy! Over tried a couple of different vitamin c oil and this one is among the top! I like the way it leaves my skin feeling and looking. I highly recommend this product and to keep purchasing to keep your skin looking younger and firmer!</li>
            <li> A little sticky, but does smooth out and makes hands feel great. Smells good also.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.  No odor or color. Ease dryness</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t need this. I have mixed normal to oily skin. After using this a few times my face is extremely greasy feeling and I do not like it. That being said it would be good for someone with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a  Discount for my review</li>
            <li> This serum is just what I excepted. It&#x27;s light, and my skin loves it. It is quickly absorbed by my skin without any sticky feeling. I can see the changes in my skin; it is clearer and brighter.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty good serum. i have oily/combo skin. i used during the day and night, like reccomended on the bottle. i perfer using it at night, i get smoother results in the morning. when i used it during the day, gave me a little breakout on my jaw. other then tht, it&#x27;s a pretty good serum.</li>
            <li> I always prefer to go natural but also I love all the natural benefit of essential oils. I&#x27;m so thrilled to finally found this product. I know vitamin C is a great antioxidant and helps to promote even skin tone. Do you know that it helps reduce blemishes too? That&#x27;s what makes it possible of promoting a youthful healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very in love with this..</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and she asked me to order her another bottle. She&#x27;s 53 and said she instantly noticed how her skin looked smoother and brighter/healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount and chose to review it of my own free will. All opinions expressed in this review are my own, and are unbiased and honest.</li>
            <li> Love to use this serum after a deep cleaning of my face.</li>
            <li> Great oil. My face soaks it up quickly and it leaves my face feeling very  well moisturized and soft!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! My skin is noticable improved. Non sticky, no greasy feeling, easily absorbs and makes a difference</li>
            <li> The Herbalist Vitamin C serum is light and has a fresh fragrance leaving the skin soft and refreshed. I use it on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> My pores have not looked this good in years. I&#x27;ve only used it a few days, but I can already see results. I have big pores on my nose and a few on my forehead, and they appear to be getting smaller. My skin is also smoother and softer than it has been in a long time. I used it exactly by the directions, which says to use after you shower. I don&#x27;t know the reason for that, but I would assume it is because the heat opens your pores and that would mean the serum can get down in the pores and do the most good. Whatever the reason, I can already see the difference in my skin after just a few days.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. This serum absorbs quickly into your skin, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky. I haven&#x27;t noticed a visible reduction in wrinkles or smile lines; however, I had several blemishes that this product cleared away and left looking perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this vitamin C serum, I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and my skin is looking youthful and great.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> Like the way it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> Great price for the product however the price for the shipping wasn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum by the Herbalist. I ordered this on sales promotion and it is a very nice basic Vitamin C Serum. If you have not tried Vitamin C serum as part of your facial skin care regimine I encourage you to try it.  With consistent use it leaves your skin brighter, smooth and pores are refined.  The price is good as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this serum for so many reasons. It goes on smoothly , it&#x27;s not greasy, and  I havent  broke out which is a big plus! The greatest benefit is my skin feels tighter and firmer. My face looks refreshed, I apply it at night before bed and in the morning.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C has always been so useful and healthy. Thank you for making it in a usable product for my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin felt soft after use. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin C serum, the ingredients are good and there is little scent which I like!  The formula doesnt leave my face really sticky like some serums do.  Make sure to put this on and leave it alone with no other products on top for 15-20 minutes to let the vitamin c work.  Vitamin c is ph dependent and if you toss other high ph products on top it won&#x27;t work as well!  I&#x27;ve been using vitamin C serums for months and it has gotten rid of all my post acne hyper pigmentation as well as prevented any new acne from forming!  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great seller, fast shipping! !!</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin C Serum - Goes on light and easy to apply,  Quick absorption and does not leave face feeling greasy or sticky.  Also, really like that it has a pump dispenser vs the normal dropper.  Great serum to add to daily beauty regimen</li>
            <li> I found this Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s texture to be a bit thicker than I usually enjoy. Didn&#x27;t burn like others though, I have very sensitive skin.  And would gladly trade in the thicker texture for the more gentle approach towards my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Absorbs quickly and works great with my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It helped brighten my face when it was becoming dull. Now i have a glow to my skin.I use this at night I like this product a lot. I did get this to review .</li>
            <li> This is just what I have been looking for.  My wrinkles are really starting to show, so I need this kind of product to shock it back to looking younger again.  Nice touch with the Happy New Year picture. Very thoughtful. I have already recommended this product to my friends.  Great Product. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this serum. Since I start to put this on my skin, my skin feel rejuvenated, tight , and smooth. I will definitely purchase this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price. Good product. I love it</li>
            <li> I use the face wash and a moisturizer. My face looks brighter. Very nice not heavy and light citrus smell.</li>
            <li> This is another great product from Herbalist.com.  It is an anti- aging serum that makes your skin look younger. This will help brighten your skin. It left my skin feeling and looking softer and smoother and I just started using it.  Herbalist.com has been so helpful with all needs from aging, to weight loss, very knowledgeable and terrific products.</li>
            <li> I have tried every vitamin C facial and home care formula. This Herbalist vitamin C serum is by far the only one which immediately results in my skin looking and feeling younger. People compliment my complexion every time I use it. This is an amazing difference - I am giving it to all my friends -- they will flip.</li>
            <li> I like using this product overnight. I feel like it sets into my face instead of adding my makeup in the morning since it is a little thicker. Make sure to add a moisturizer after tho, it keeps your face from staying sticky.  I like the dispenser, I&#x27;ve had similar products that have a dropper, and disliked it. The smell is great!</li>
            <li> Wife uses this religiously.&lt;br /&gt;I think it makes her face more shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I think that this product does refresh your face, I just don&#x27;t like that it makes your face feel sticky until your skin absorbs the product. I also don&#x27;t like that the directions say follow with a moisturizer, because then you don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s working, or if it&#x27;s just your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Used this product for 2 weeks. Hard to say if it is working. This product needs to be used for an extended period of time. Around my eyes definetely looks softer and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I got this cheap from elite deals. Vitamin c is very good for your skin. Makes it softer and healthier looking. This stuff is good. !</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product!  I had recently been reviewing the benefits of Vitamin C and did extensive research before purchase.  Studies show that Vitamin C is highly effective in reversing the signs of aging, so long as it has at least a 10% concentration of absorbic acid.  This particular serum has a 20% concentration, double the amount of many serums currently  on the market.  I have been using it for one week and already have seen significant results in the radiance of my skin.  It goes on light and is not greasy.  My skin is brighter and clearer, and I see additional improvement every day.  It works very well and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I didn&#x27;t tell anyone in my family that I started using this.  My daughter said to me the other day my face looks smoother and tighter. My fine lines seem less noticeable.  I definitely recommend this and would but it again.</li>
            <li> 5 ++ Stars~  I have used this product for a couple of weeks now.  I am extremely impressed.  I can tell a difference.  A must have!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. A bit different from the other one I have tried in the past .&lt;br /&gt;Results are seen within a week or 2!</li>
            <li> I use this daily makes my fave clear and soft. Love it also enjoy the smell</li>
            <li> Originally bought this for my girlfriend but decided to use it myself. Bumps and sun damage to my face which I just accepted as part of getting older are slowly disappearing. My wrinkles seem to be fading away also. Don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but don&#x27;t see the need this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> My whiteheads are nearly gone!</li>
            <li> Still testing this product but hopefully it will provide my skin the necessary nutrients it needs.</li>
            <li> Like this product, makes my face nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Does just what it says it should do.  Will definitely repurchase!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a vitamin c product for the face before and I thought this product would work similiar. I expected my face to look and feel different. It just felt sticky on my face. No apparent results after few uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok,  I bought a different brand and it has more moisturizer in it. so I have to moisturize with this one.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is amazing for your skin, and this product proves exactly that. My skin looks more luminous, and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum does make my Face/Neck feel extra clean/smooth and firm. So, I feel the product is doing a good job!  However, I have used other Vitamin C facial products that emit a somewhat intense Orange Essence that I quite like and look for in a Vitamin C facial product.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and the texture is not too oily.  It gets absorbed after a while.  I haven&#x27;t used it long to see any difference, but I feel it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this serum! Makes my skin soft, reduces dark circles, and smells very nice!</li>
            <li> After so many weeks used no improvement was seen on my face.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Product works well.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C does amazing things for the skin and I can&#x27;t believe there are people who don&#x27;t use it.  It makes a world of difference as skin ages.  I see so many women with seriously wrinkled skin and I think it could have been avoided with daily usage of vitamin C and a good moisturizer.  I live in a very dry climate and I&#x27;ve been using some type of vitamin C for years.  I&#x27;m not sure what my skin would look like if I hadn&#x27;t, but I would not want to find out.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum by Herbalist.com LLC works just as well as those expensive name-brand serums out there that charge you a dollar and a leg. It has a clear and gel-like texture and helps to prevent advanced aging. In other words, it helps to slow down your skin&#x27;s losing ability to hold its elasticity, its pliability, which leads to wrinkles, crows&#x27; feet, fine lines, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to this product is patience and consistency. You need to apply it each day/night without fail to even get minimal results, but results you will see eventually. I&#x27;ve used this for about a month, and I&#x27;ve seen some of my lines fade a bit. In addition, my skin tone has become a bit more youthful looking and smooth, with a more dewy complexion. I highly recommend this product over many of those expensive name-brand serums out there, costing only a fraction of the exorbitant prices out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for testing purposes in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I use it with my derma roller.</li>
            <li> Very cute bottle. Used it and skin feels soft. It really is the best! My skin is lighter and soft. Im asian and i like to be a little lighter and thia helps me. I finished the whole bottle in 6 weeks. Planning to purchas again. I received this super cheap in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves your skin feeling tight and fresh.  I apply it every morning and evening after washing my face.  I can already see some sun spots diminishing!</li>
            <li> It is helping the color and texture of my skin</li>
            <li> This has helped with smoothing my skin. After weight loss surgery I have so many wrinkles. Its of course not a miracle product but I have noticed a difference in softness and appearance of my skin. I did get this at discounted rate but that in no way effects my review.</li>
            <li> Excellent high quality.  Of all the serums I have used lately this one seems to be very efficient.  I also preferred the pump instead of the dropper most the other companies use</li>
            <li> Has a very nice aroma and brightens the skin. It feels so light, I may use it right before makeup.</li>
            <li> I wondered if this would be any good,  after trying many other things.  I am happy to say that I like the effects.  My skin is so soft and feels so much better.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Leaves me refreshed in the morning and leaves my skin feeling smooth.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily or shiny after application.</li>
            <li> discounted item for honest feedback didnt work</li>
            <li> Seems to be working nicely.  Has not caused any breakouts or other issues.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a more moisturized feel to my face and the serum does have a light, airy texture to it, however it don&#x27;t it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, can see the difference and added benefits in just a few applications, easy to use, love the pump so you get the right amount, not too much and not too little, I like the way it makes my face feel and makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> Great product I love that is did NOT leave a sticky residue or have a weird odor to it. It was very soft when applied. Everything its described to be definitely a product everyone should try!</li>
            <li> Awesome serum!! So lightweight and I can already see a difference!</li>
            <li> Great product makes a difference in the texture of my skin!</li>
            <li> First, I love that this came with a pump to make dispensing easier and less chances of contamination. Medicine droppers tend to be messy for me. The bottle is made of amber glass. This is good as the amber color protects the product from UV degradation better. Glass is easily recycled and does not leak harmful chemicals into the product as plastic can. The serum itself does not have the smell I associate with Vitamin C. If anything I&#x27;m assuming that it smells like hyaluronic acid. The serum is viscus. I did notice that as I got closer to the bottom of the bottle, it became more viscus. Perhaps it needs a little shake before use? The serum is absorbed easily and does not leave your skin feeling sticky. I used this for my face, neck, and chest before moisturizer as part of my anti-aging routine.</li>
            <li> Loved the consistency of this product. I use this right away after I wash my face. It&#x27;s nice and light and so far my skin is a lot smoother after using this. Great product.</li>
            <li> this has made my face softer after only 2 uses!!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product for your face and skin. It leaves my face feeling soft.  However, it can feel a bit sticky after using. That&#x27;s the reason for only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot.... It helps after I have derma rolled. It gives my skin a pretty glow.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great! I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out either. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I am just in love!!! Absolutely phenomenal, feels great, and no irritation!</li>
            <li> By far the best - the serum and the company - I have ordered a derivative of this product from many different providers and this one was far and away the best quality product.  It arrived quickly and well packaged and, of course, exceptionally well priced.  Great job Herbalist!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I really enjoy this!</li>
            <li> helped improve my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 4 days and so far I&#x27;m liking it. My skin is softer and smoother when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels when I use this  product.  I have noticed less acne and softer and smoother skin.  I am not crazy about the pump, as it squirts everywhere, but that would be my only complaint about this product.  I use it twice a day and I love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be without this for my face daily!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  Tightened my pores almost instantly and lifted my whole face! Agec spot really diminish!  I saw a glow in my skin that I haven&#x27;t seen in decades!</li>
            <li> Feels very good on the face... Not oily. And smells good too.</li>
            <li> My skin looks, and feels a lot healthier since using this product! People are complimenting me, and I&#x27;m telling them they need to try it! GREAT product will continue purchasing, I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!</li>
            <li> Some other reviews said that it&#x27;s a little drying, and I have to agree. I have very oily skin so I was surprised at how this felt when I put it on alone. I have now decided to mix it into whatever moisturizer I&#x27;m using that day, then follow with my sunscreen. Otherwise, when used alone/as a base layer as instructed, it feels tacky on my skin and I&#x27;m left feeling very tight and itchy around my mouth. For me, mixing it is the way to go. (I bought this from another online retailer at a fraction of the cost, so I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted money even if I never see a difference. I would suggest shopping around if you have the time/inclination to do so.) It also isn&#x27;t specific as to how much to use, so I&#x27;m just kind of using my judgment and doing one to one-and-a-half pumps (any more than that and it just doesn&#x27;t absorb), which will make this last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll edit my review when/if I start to see results.</li>
            <li> I like this vitamin c serum because it did not leave a residue or leave my skin feeling sticky.  Instead when I used it on my face it seemed to leave my skin feeling smooth and soft once it dried.  I do recommend washing your face with a scrub first to get the best results.  I have used this for awhile and it seems to lighten up my dark spots a bit.  It is not a drastic change but I am sure with continued use, there would be a great change.  I m very happy that I was able to purchase this item at a promotional price.  I love the bottle it came in as I mix a lot of essential oils for my hair and I plan to repurpose the bottle since a dark glass bottle is best used.  So once you finish using this really nice serum you can use the bottle for other homeopathic oils.  Once the bottle is finished, I plan to purchase more in the future as I do see a difference and I like the results.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is wonderful!  It has made my skin feel so soft - and it also has brightened up my face.  Not really sure how all of this works, but I do like what I am seeing.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I expect to continue seeing  positive results.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 weeks now and I can&#x27;t say I look younger, but I love the way my makeup goes on after I use it.  I have also noticed that my skin looks brighter so that&#x27;s a plus!  Will continue to use!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product about a month. I have been tying to get rid of dark spots after having facial moles removed from the sides of my face and neck and I am truly seeing a difference, however,  It is a slow process and you  must have patience. I have also seen a difference in the laugh lines around my mouth, which is not as deep. I do use a sun blocker, after applying Herbalist.  I would recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Just started using this week. Makes my skin feel smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and the smell is so great compared to other vitamin c products I have recently tried</li>
            <li> This serum is so refreshing, it smells like oranges and leaves your skin feeling fresh!!! I love it</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this. I was happy I could find it again here on Amazon. I was definitely impressed. It wasn&#x27;t as sudden of a transformation as I thought it would be but now I can tell a difference. Follow the instructions. They are easy to follow and apply. After this bottle I will decide wether I will buy again</li>
            <li> Feels good on the face. No bad reaction or anything and haven&#x27;t started seeing results yet but will update my review after using for a while.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend! My face feels much more healthy.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and it really has helped my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way finished with the bottle and have seen some brightness in my skin.  I have been using it every night.  I have noticed some decrease in my hyperpigmentation, but not much. The scent is pleasant, not too strong.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face feel so much better.  helps the dark spots.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my skin 😔</li>
            <li> I was asked to review/test this product. I have noticed a nice glow on my face and my skin seems so healthy. I will contiue to use this product for years to come.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. I apply it at night before bed and before foundation in the morning.  It goes on nicely and absorbs well and I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy. It also has as a pleasant very light scent that I appreciate.  I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> very good product, i love it..</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin c serum I like how it has a pump most has a dropper I use it mainly at night then a face moisturizer would recommend</li>
            <li> Love the fresh feeling it gave me made my face look bright...</li>
            <li> I am still reviewing this product for an overall opinion.  However, I can say that it absorbs in the skin immediately without leaving a sticky or residual feeling on my face.  There is no smell.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in my face and notice a brightness to my skin I didn&#x27;t have before! It&#x27;s very rejuvenating!</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency and the smooth, silky way it goes on my skin. I have only been using it for about a week but have already noticed a &#x27;brightening&#x27; of my skin. I haven&#x27;t used a vitamin c serum before and know that it takes some time to notice visible results but even in a very short time, I am pleased with how my skin is responding. I was worried that the potency of the serum (20%) would be harsh for my skin and but I have not experienced any negative effects at all. I am quite pleased with the initial results of this serum and look forward to seeing what happens with continued use.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I put about 3-4 drops of this on my finger tips and then massage onto my face and neck after i have washed my face. It is very light and feels good. No burning, no oily feeling, just refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like this vitamin C  Serum so far, I have used it on my skin. I have been using for a week or so, I notice its help keeps face moisturize. I usually use it in the morning after I have clean my face and add a little on my face, and let it dry for about 10 mins or while I finish getting dressed. Then after it dries, then I add my moisturizer. I have it notice its clearing in my skin on my face up alitle bit. But I will continue to use the product every morning to get more results.</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a nice glow</li>
            <li> Great serum! This serum is not only contains vitamin C but also Hyaluronic Acid serum and more. I&#x27;m starting to use it after I clean my face every night. About 2 to 3 drops should be enough, then, I would apply my night cream. It&#x27;s just easy and simple way to keep the skin healthy. So far I love it very much, can&#x27;t wait to see the better result  after a month. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I actually use it instead of a make up primer before I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Have used for a few days so not sure of the long term effects, but so far it seems to be good. Makes my skin feel soft &amp; smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product, looks promising but i have not used it long enough to say it works or not. I will update my review after using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It helped soften my skin and also helped clear up some rashes and acne. I like that it is natural instead of a ton of chemicals. It also doesn&#x27;t burn the skin like so many products do!</li>
            <li> I used this just a few times and can already feel the skin on my face getting firmer and &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34;.  I noticed less of the fine grooves along my laugh lines within minutes of application. Its easy to use and effective. I can&#x27;t wait to see what results with longer use will bring!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use in combination with a derma roller I recently purchased. I have read literature that indicated  Vit C can help to restore my skins texture and appearance, while attacking free radicals which come with aging. Vit C plays an important role in maintaining healthy, resilient skin, preventing wrinkles and reversing the UV damage such as age spots.&lt;br /&gt; I also had seen a segment on Dr Oz discussing the benefits of Vit C. helping with acne scars, etc. My daughter has terrible chicken pox scars and we have began to apply it to them as well.  I will update on those results, as she is not as scheduled as I am about its use(teenagers).&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit worried that applying this, along with my daily moisturizer would cause too much oil and breakouts but it has not. I apply after cleansing my face, prior to my moisturizer. It quickly absorbs and leaves me with a smooth texture. I have yet to see any solid results as they say they can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks, with optimal results met at 6 months, but I will update as I do. Made in the USA!</li>
            <li> Works fine. I was able to try this product by giving a review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the product out using the dispenser and I didn&#x27;t like the stickiness of the product leaving me with an oily face.</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin C Serum - Goes on light and easy to apply, Quick absorption and does not leave face feeling greasy or sticky. Also, really like that it has a pump dispenser vs the normal dropper. Great serum to add to daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a year and can tell a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Feeling the difference!</li>
            <li> Pretty easy and smooth to use and absorbed fast</li>
            <li> Só far the smell and texture leaves spaces for doubt of the quality of the product. Only used for two days.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Vitamin C Serum and I&#x27;ved used a couple Vitamin C Serum so far aside from this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it right after it arrived to see if my skin will react from using this Serum. It did not. No rashes or any allergic reaction right after using it for the first time until now. I like that this Herbalist Serum does not leave any greasy residue and it indeed absorbs and dry quickly. I&#x27;m only using this at night though before I apply any moisturizer. All I noticed so far is that my skin is more softer and adds radiance during the day. I like it so far so I will leave 4 stars for this Herbalist Serum. Great product that works.</li>
            <li> I loved how well it works and how it made my skin feel. It went on smoothly and I was able to use a small amount to use all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week but I haven&#x27;t experienced any break outs or reaction to the product. However, I cant say I have noticed any changes either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week and already see visible improvements. I have used many different vitamin c serums and really love this one. My skin glows and my skin tone seems to be better. I am in my sixties and know this is a must have product for older skin.</li>
            <li> This make my face feel super smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use Vitamin C serum, gives your skin a glow as it works its magic!</li>
            <li> Great when I need the boost</li>
            <li> Only been using for about a week. I&#x27;m not sure about the way it looks, but it feels better. It feels smoother. My face feels Hydrated.</li>
            <li> This type of product really need to be used a long time to give a good review. I have only been using it a week, but I am seeing great results. My pores are getting smaller and I have not found anything else to do this. Also I have a tiny scar under my eye area that is also reducing in appearance.  I like that it has no smell. All in all I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> Have been applying my vitamin c serum for about a week now and I&#x27;m starting to see a little bit of a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s softer and seems to have more elasticity. I have faithfully put it on every night and if I thought about it I would also apply it during the the day. I&#x27;m a firm believer if I continue to apply it like I have been I will see a big difference in the next couple of weeks. Also a few of my age spots are fading as well.</li>
            <li> Love this Vit C. Use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and makes me skin feel nice.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to get the full effects that other users describe.</li>
            <li> Works great for unruly curly hair!</li>
            <li> This goes on easily without being greasy. After using it I am noticing an improvement in my skin tone.  The serum is just as good as the more expensive ones you can buy at specialty stores. Even better, this costs a lot less than the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! My skin feels smooth. Its not greasy and drys fast and my face is glowing, my skin feels great!!</li>
            <li> I love this product it absorbs into my skin so fast and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling sticky or as if it has anything on it at all. I have been putting it on every night and love how smooth my skin has been feeling lately. I highly recommend it for your nightly routine. Also the fact that its odorless makes it that much better.</li>
            <li> Great new product. Thanks</li>
            <li> My face felt refreshed after using this!</li>
            <li> Really light and not too heavily scented. I&#x27;m really sensitive to anything too heavy and perfumed, but this serum was easy and light.</li>
            <li> this is a great serum. face feels fresh after every use.</li>
            <li> Ie been using this serum for about a week now.  It doesnt dry out my eyes &amp; keeps my skin firm</li>
            <li> Love this.. using it on stretch marks and seems to be making a slight difference.  absorbs well into skin without feeling sticky like some vital c products.</li>
            <li> really nice packaging, just started using it and so far so good, my skin is very sensitive and I have not had any reactions.</li>
            <li> I love the feeling of vitamin C on my skin. Smooth and refreshing.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect vitamin C serum. I had previously had a different brand vitamin C serum and couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. I can happily say that this serum has no funny odor and works great. Not greasy at all. I have oily/combo skin and this did not break me out and I feel it makes me more radiant. I would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> not super thick which i like it easy to use and not oilly</li>
            <li> My wife loved it. Nothing more needing to be said</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I have already been experiencing reduction in the wrinkles that were on my face.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 days and i see a huge improvement in the smoothness of my skin.  It goes on great!</li>
            <li> I love this, it&#x27;s a light serum and works great. I have delicate skin and I love the how my face feels after putting it on</li>
            <li> Really good for dry skin, I didn&#x27;t get it for the anti aging aspect so I can&#x27;t speak on that but I like it otherwise</li>
            <li> ,I&#x27;ve been looking around for a good vitamin C serum for my face. Everyone could benefit from a good vitamin C serum for their face. My face is looking better already! It glides on smoothly and easily and its souks and completely. My face is starting to look better already. Someone told me that I looked like I was 29 the other day in a picture on facebook lol. I&#x27;m 50 years old hahaha. I highly recommend this product and this company. They were very easy to deal with and they sent me follow up emails. What a great company!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a week it leaves my skin felling soft and glowing. I&#x27;m hoping the longer I use it the better the results I will get.</li>
            <li> In my skin care regiment I always include a serum. This serum works great with my skin care line. I have dry skin and it hasn&#x27;t effected me in any negative way. I give 4 out of 5 because I don&#x27;t know if it has affects on fine lines.</li>
            <li> This Product is a little Runny their&#x27;s hardly any Oil in it. it&#x27;s more water than Oil. As far as what it&#x27;s done for my skin it&#x27;s okay no Huge Change in a Short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I can honestly say it does what it says. I use it at night and have observed a noticeable difference in the quality of my skin. It gentle removes dead skin and gives you a bright complexion. I suggest daily use for best results. You will see the difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum as part of a promotion. I do like it a lot so far. It is not overwhelming or greasy. I will update later when I&#x27;ve given it a chance to see results like the ones advertised  from use.</li>
            <li> Actually made a difference! Evened out skin tone and plumped it up.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered the product. Works well after continual use. I can see a difference around the eyes, noticeable smoothness. The key is using twice a day and patience.</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the serum feel of this product.  It did not affect my very sensitive skin  which is a HUGE PLUS!  I Love that it has hyalouronic acid in it.</li>
            <li> i really like the vitamin c in the morning i feel it brightens my skin so i hope to continue to use</li>
            <li> Lately I have been noticed a big change in my skin. Not only did I have dry, uneven skin tone, but I also noticed the appearance of dark circles and fine lines around my eyes. I was researching for trying some new products and when I got the opportunity to Received this Excellent product in Exchange for my Honest and Unbiased Opinion I couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it! I like the fact that this awesome Serum has a pump top which can prevent contamination and is more safety to use. Very easy to use, It absorbs quickly and does not leave any greasy residue. What I like must about this Serum is the principal ingredient. Vitamin C helps the body produce collagen which makes the skin looks young and very soft. As suggested I love the idea to keep my new serum refrigerated. After the application my skin feels refresh, smooth and energize! I highly recommend this awesome product Made in USA and remember if you want to see results you need to use this product consistently in your skin care routine.</li>
            <li> This is really good. I use it as moisturizer every night.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love how it goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.  Does not leave skin greasy or oily.  I think it gives my face a nice glow!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!! I&#x27;m 45 &amp; have had so many great compliments on my skin since I started using this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Face has really improved since using this. I use it every night</li>
            <li> I like this facial serum it&#x27;s not too thick it&#x27;s not too thin it&#x27;s absorbs quite nicely and does not take long to absorb so I am able to apply my make up and go about my usual day in a few minutes after application. It also has a pleasant scent to it. I have had not had any breakouts so far as I am always worried about this due to my sensitive skin. These are my own honest opinions after having tried this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Vitamin C serum to anyone worried about her skin. It does a great job. My pores are smaller and my skin has a more even tone. The difference is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this at a reduced price with the expectation that I leave a review. I am most happy to do that and rate it five stars. After I finish this bottle, I will buy it at full price. It is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfect Serum for the skin for younger looking youthful skin, Will see results after 2 weeks but its worth it</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot as it makes your face glow and it keeps my face oil free. It is easy to apply, I pump 2 pumps into my palm rub hands together and apply to full face and neck. I feel as if it reduced my sleepy dark circles under my eyes which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;At first when applying it feels as if your skin tightens, kind of like when you apply rubbing alcohol to your face just with out the burn or extreme tightness. I will continue to purchase and recommending to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: easy to use, no scent, no burn, nice healthy glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: NONE</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to stop using due to nut allergy (macadamia in product) so I cannot accurately report on results. The serum is gel like and lightweight on skin. It feels comfortable on the skin and applies easily from bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about two weeks now and I&#x27;ve notice some change I have a few dark spots on my face that seems to be lighting up I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s suppose to happen but I like it I will continue to use this serum until the bottle is gone to give a better review but so I guess for now 4🌠....I will update again soon 😄</li>
            <li> This is a decent Vitamin C serum.  I didn&#x27;t break out from using this product and I have acne prone skin.  I did notice my skin looking more youthful and radiant.  I have actually received several compliments on how I have beautiful skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and I like it...I don&#x27;t love it simply because it haven&#x27;t noticed it making my dark spots go away.  I thought it would make the appearance of my dark spots less noticeable, but as far as the suppleness of my skin...it&#x27;s right on target.</li>
            <li> I was using another product and could see results almost immediately. But once I started using this my skin lost the glow again.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great on my face. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice drastic results, but it makes skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. makes skin soft. Only been using a couple weeks so not sure of long term</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing bad that I can say about this product.  I&#x27;ve found that it actually does help my fine lines disappear from my face.  After just a few days of using once I day I am already noticing a difference.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Gives your skin a rejuvenated look.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. Cannot tell yet how well it is working.  Too soon.</li>
            <li> Love this! makes my face soft and feels great!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, I feel like my skin looks more smooth/</li>
            <li> .. im a big fan of vitamin C .. this is one of my favorite :) it was truly absorb when u put it on your face.. and it gives you a natural glow.</li>
            <li> Good serum that will make your skin feel &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; (makes you look somewhat younger)!</li>
            <li> I have only used it about a week and already my skin is smoother and brighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Crystal</li>
            <li> Bought this for my other half as a gift as she has tried many similar products before. She absolutely loved this gift and says it is the best out of all the ones she has tried. Was looking around to find it again to buy more and found it here on Amazon for a remarkable good deal, much cheaper than I originally paid. Herbalist - think you have a customer for life in my other half.</li>
            <li> This serum is wonderful.  I feel it has really help the slight sun damage I have on my chest.  I wold definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s not oily and absorbs into my skin. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a couple of weeks now and I really like it.  It makes my skin feel great. I will keep you updated as to the results as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> feels good in my skin so far, just started using this and you can see the difference already.. dryness of my skin is decreasing and feels so smooth all day. can&#x27;t go without this in my face.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a highly discounted price for my unbiased opinion.  Perhaps my skin is a bit too sensitive as it had a drying affect on me, which is odd, I know, since the hyaluronic acid is meant to bind moisture.  Heavy vitamin C products tend to do that with me though, but I will always have high hopes and try new brands. More about this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. This product disperses itself over the skin and absorbs quite easily.  The pump is great, and though the bottle is small it will last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very light, not the kind of serum that could be used in place of a moisturizer; more of an undermoisturizer type of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m younger (28) and do not have wrinkles yet.  I live in Las Vegas, and it&#x27;s dry and hot as heck.  I need whatever moisture I can get.  I did not test this for the anti-aging benefits but for the moisture locking properties, so I cannot comment on the skin plumping benefits.  As I mentioned earlier the moisture locking didn&#x27;t work too well on me, but I could chalk it up to sensitive skin.  Who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because of the dry patches I got after testing.  That said, I think for most people this would be a wonderful addition to their skin regimen.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!  I starting using this serum on the recommendation of a friend, and I will be incorporating this into my daily routine permanently.  I noticed a difference in just a few short days - my skin is softer, smoother and brighter.  I&#x27;ve used anti-aging serums in the past, and this one is by far the best I have ever used!  I&#x27;ve even caught my husband putting it on his face - if that isn&#x27;t a ringing endorsement, I don&#x27;t know what is.</li>
            <li> This has been awesome so far! No skin irritation, and that is definitely a problem I have with some vitamin C products. It gives a slight blush to my skin but that&#x27;s it. It doesn&#x27;t have a perfume-y odor and wears well under make-up. I have only been using for a week but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Not greasy at all and leaves a nice radiant glow.</li>
            <li> Sadly this gave my husband a bad reaction on his face</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product but it is not my favorite face serum. I&#x27;ve tried a few now and in comparison I&#x27;d say this product is just ok. I like that it comes in a dark bottle with a pump and was mostly full but applying it is a little more challenging than others because it is much more liquid-y. The pump takes a couple presses to get started the first time you use it and rotates very easily but getting the serum out is easy enough. It&#x27;s just that every time you get a drop the serum runs down your finger if you are not quick to get it to your face. You could apply it with a cotton ball but that way you lose a lot in the transfer. For the price point it&#x27;s good that the serum is completely clear and gets absorbed quickly so you can put it on before makeup but I haven&#x27;t seen any real results from using this product so while I don&#x27;t hate it because I don&#x27;t think anything bad can come from putting vitamin C on my face I&#x27;m also not giving it a raving review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Product purchased at a discount for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for the price this site was selling it at</li>
            <li> Great Serum great price. I really like this serum its light and does not irritate my skin. Yes I recommend to anyone and yes I&#x27;d repurchase</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and I think that speaks for itself. Since using it I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in the discoloration in my face. Thanks for the wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I received this product at a significant discount for my honest review.  Product texture and color is similar to more expensive vitamin c serums I have purchased in the past.  It goes on my face smooth and my skin quickly absorbs it.  Vitamin c serums take a little bit of time to show results to improve skin tone.  I have been using vitamin c serums for over six months consistently once or twice a day so I would not expect to see more results than I already have.  At this point I&#x27;m looking to maintain my results.  I also use a dermaroller that was 9.95 on Amazon with a 1mm needle that had 540 total needles.  This will give you the best results.  Keep in mind as well that vitamin c oxidizes quickly if making your own.  Always store in a dark cool place ideally in a dark glass dropper or bottle.  I keep mine in the refrigerator as well to make it last.  Most produced vitamin c serum has additives to preserve the serum.  If your vitamin c is not clear it means it has gone bad.  I did enjoy the pump this brand used.  I also liked how it is very smooth.  There are many benefits of vitamin c for your skin so I highly recommend the product (this one or taking a little time each week to make your own and very inexpensive).  The price for me on this product was well worth it and I would buy this brand again if I was not looking to make my own serum or vitamin c mask.  This serum was not too potent for my skin since I have used it for over 6 months however a new user needs to ensure this potency and product are tested on a smaller part of the skin before all over the face.</li>
            <li> i am 85 years old and my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Never really used anything like this before. It was promotional product. I tried it and now I&#x27;m in love. Smells great. Does not leave any greasy feel. Makes my face feel wonderfully moisturized. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Feels great and hydrating!</li>
            <li> Loved how it made my skin feel! Quick ship and safe ship!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this. I use it twice a day. Got this at a great discount. Will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I wake up every morning with really dry skin and when I put this on my face I feel refreshed, and my skin seems to stay soft all day. This is my first time using a serum like this and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on my face! Great product!</li>
            <li> Noticed firmer ski within a couple of days!  Smells delicious!</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen much of a difference in my skin.  It takes a good four pumps to dispense enough to cover my face and neck so it&#x27;s going pretty quickly.  It also has a stickiness to it that&#x27;s not exceedingly pleasant.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again.  I&#x27;m just not seeing any visible improvements.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve not been using it long enough or if it just isn&#x27;t going to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Awesome, works really well! Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best thing for my skin. It makes my skin nice and smooth. It also has started to fade some spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Great item I saw improvement in my skin tone in a matter of days great product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice light serum, it goes on my skin easily and absorbs quickly into my skin My skin is brighter and clearer, i can see a difference from using this serum.  goes on nicely and is not sticky or to oily on the skin. luv it.  I got this to review and really like it alot.</li>
            <li> This is the best vitamin C serum for the money.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on my skin and I&#x27;m seeing a positive change in the texture of my skin all ready. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Smells good and is very light.  I like how highly absorbent it is.  My skin feels clearer and looks clearer also.  I also use for my hands.</li>
            <li> This is the best face serum I&#x27;ve ever purchased! Goes on so silky smooth. Leaves no greasy residue and my face hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was a baby.</li>
            <li> For an honest review, I will mention that I received this product at an extremely discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum for a little over a week, and I love it.  It makes my skin feel nice, both when I put it on and to the touch. It feels like my moisturizer lasts longer when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the anti-aging qualities, I can&#x27;t say. I am thirty and have very few wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t say whether it improves the look of aging. I also don&#x27;t think it would change my review if it didn&#x27;t because it feels nice regardless. My skin does feel firmer, so that&#x27;s something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because I am not particularly fond of the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it smells a little like clay or unscented oil to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions don&#x27;t say (or I don&#x27;t remember), but 3-5 pumps is more than enough for each application (I was applying more liberally at first, but it goes pretty fast when you do that). I have a roundish, mid size face and four pumps is enough for my face, neck, and upper chest when I dab on and use my finger tips to spread/rub in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again, and at full price.</li>
            <li> My skin felt very smooth after a few days of use. My complexion also cleared up. Loved that jt didnt feel oily!</li>
            <li> I like this product. No irritation. Smells good. keep my skin better moisture.</li>
            <li> I use this every evening and every morning , it makes my skin so soft and lovely. wish it came in a bigger size. Don&#x27;t bother buying the expensive $100 ones at the department stores.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this and loves it.  She says it makes her skin feel softer and clearer.  She doesn&#x27;t use a lot of facial products but really like this.</li>
            <li> love the consistency, it seems thick, but absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a difference.  My skin feels and looks amazing!  Didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but am very impressed!</li>
            <li> Was given a code to try this for a very good price. The smell isn&#x27;t the most pleasant but it feels good on the skin. Not sure if I will see results right away but I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Made my skin tingle a bit, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel. Worth the money. Still using.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as sticky as a lot of other vitamin c serums are. It goes on smoothly and keeps your face feeling tight and looking even better. Fast shipping. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Received product to test in return for a review. Great product!! Leaves my skin feeling so soft. I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate at all. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I can see a difference. I would buy this again</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling so smooth! I was really surprised on how this serum felt on my face upon application. It leaves a satin like finish, similar to using a make-up primer without the extra product. Make-up glides right on! However, it&#x27;s important to use this before you apply any kind of moisturizer so it gets absorbed first. If you can bypass the moisturizer on occasion, try this as a make-up primer, You will love it!</li>
            <li> Although I just started using it, I do see that my face is brighter and more even in tone.</li>
            <li> Too early to tll is it is effectiv but like the texture</li>
            <li> Works great! Very moisturizing for my dry skin!</li>
            <li> Just started using about 2 weeks ago so it&#x27;s still too early to notice any results BUT what I can say is that they bottled it right! I know it sounds odd to be so happy about the bottle but vitamin c deteriorates with the presence of air and/or light and this serum comes in a dark glass bottle and is dispensed via pump! Minimal air and no light! Great job herbalist! Unfortunately most makers of vitamin c serums do not bottle it correctly which means it&#x27;s shelf life is very short (if there was even any vitamin c to begin with).</li>
            <li> I can not get over how great my skin looks and feels! I have incredibly dry skin and always am very careful about trying only products that are good for sensitive yet aging skin. I have spent more money than I should have on some items and loved them but ultimately given up due to price. This Vitamin C Serum is comparable and possibly even better than ANY high end product I have tried in the past. I wish I had taken a before and after photo just to remind myself how much of a difference a few weeks has made!</li>
            <li> I have been using an expensive Vitamin C serum and I loved it, just not the price tag.  When I found Herbalist 20% Vitamin C Serum with Medical grade hyaluronic acid, I was excited to give it a try.  I have only been using it for a few days but am noticing a difference in my skin tone and firmness.  I have been pleased with the quality of the product and I particularly like that there is no strong fragrance added.  It goes on easily and is not greasy.  I am also applying to the backs of my hands and am very excited about the improvement that I am seeing in their appearance.</li>
            <li> Vitamin c serum smooth a small amount over neck and face. Use twice daily. The serum is smooth and refreshing. No greasy or sticky residue. My skin is smoother and feels healthier. This anti aging serum is not tested on animals and is paraben free. I have sensitive skin, and had no redness, or irritation from this product.</li>
            <li> Works great will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is great for your skin!</li>
            <li> I love it so much. . It has a great effect on me</li>
            <li> worked well on my facial skin. easy to apply</li>
            <li> Feels fresh on my skin! Make sure to wash your face good so it can come off otherwise it will look like you are peeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week or so. Not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything beneficial for my skin.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on silky smooth and feels very refreshing on my skin. I will need to use it longer to see the real benefits and leave a more detailed review.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife. I buy her all sorts of makeup, beauty products, perfumes, etc. I took a chance in this product, because my wife had been asking for a face serum for a while now... I must say, I&#x27;m impressed! I have personally always been skeptical of such products, but this really has softened my wife&#x27;s skin, made it smoother! She absolutely loved this product, and we will definitely purchase it again when she runs out. It&#x27;s easy to use, coming in a little pump spray bottle, and for the extra few seconds it takes before putting on your regular moisturizer before bed, it&#x27;s SO  worth the investment for fresher, younger feeling skin! We are taking the advice of the company, and we store the serum in our refrigerator, to extend it&#x27;s shelf life, and to keep it from oxidizing, which it will, because it&#x27;s citrus vitamin C.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and has kept my skin feeling fresh everyday</li>
            <li> Smooths out my fine lines and lighten up some acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have been loving this product. It gives my aging skin a good repair after long day exposure to sun. I have been using it with my new Hitachi Hada Crie moisturizer tool to aid the absorption and have noticed a brightening of my acne scars! The result is more obvious than all the expensive serums that I had been purchasing and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a week so far. It glides on smoothly and sinks into the skin right away. I like how it feels. I feel like I might need more time to see if it works really well, but so far my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> So light, non greasy and feels wonderful going on. I can see the results, after 14 days. I bought it for my mom as well, who is 87. She loves it too! I use the Vitamin C Serum all over my face!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes very well. Leaves a dewy appearance and makes my pores appear smaller. Smell is not the best and ingredients are not as natural as some others.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing it smoothes my face and makes my face shine</li>
            <li> Excellent face serum! Works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely hooked! Within 1 week of using my wrinkles have faded! I had tons of people tell me I look good &amp; younger! I even got my mom to buy some! I recommend the Vitamin C serum for everyone! My face is so smooth! I&#x27;m so glad I got to try this!!! I will definitely be a repeat customer!!! Absolutely great product!!!! I&#x27;d give more star rating if I could!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality bottle no nasty after taste.</li>
            <li> Smells great and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great</li>
            <li> I like how this makes my skin feel. No rash or redness either.</li>
