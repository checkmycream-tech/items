            <li>I am very pleased with this product and feel great about the company I bought it from as well.  </li>
            <li>I selected this company based on their exceptional customer service from the reviews I&#x27;ve read and the best warranty (1 year) offered as I don&#x27;t mind paying a bit more to get that &#x27;peace of mind&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The lights are too bright for my kids and I in our rooms is all.</li>
            <li>But why, when the Plant Therapy oils are good quality, work well, and are a lot cheaper?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Not to mention the awesome night light on it.</li>
            <li>and it was a perfect night light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely good customer</li>
            <li>I loved the soothing lights that gradually change colors.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>Loved the time feature and auto shut off.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I also love the lights!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE them!</li>
            <li>I look forward to when I can order more of them!</li>
            <li>I am 100% pleased with my purchases!</li>
            <li>I love that!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE THIS DIFFUSER!  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>This is the first Diffuser I have purchased but am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Love this diffuser!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>but great for atmosphere light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received an email from the company asking how I liked my diffuser - that&#x27;s the kind of customer service</li>
            <li>Nice diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It is probably too bright for most people to use as a nightlight, but it&#x27;s a great ambiance light.  </li>
            <li>It makes a great most that has my whole living room - where I spend most of my day - smell great!  </li>
            <li>The colors are nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>Love it love it love it!!</li>
            <li>I got this diffuser after researching many others and I have to say I am very pleased with this diffuser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light is pretty and makes a great night light for kids&#x27; rooms.really very happy with it and have recommended it to friends already!</li>
            <li>Super great customer service</li>
            <li>Very strong steam output.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good about cleaning it and so far so good!</li>
            <li>It runs for hours with a very light and pleasant soothing water sound and fills the room with aroma.</li>
            <li>That being said you will notice that some oils are stronger than others and diffuse more effectively while others are softer and will not &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; to diffuse as well.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best diffuser that I have used.  </li>
            <li>The color was a bit too bright for night light</li>
            <li>The risk-free trial (you can return it for FREE SHIPPING if you don&#x27;t like it!!!!), the 1-year warranty, the company&#x27;s outstanding customer service - all makes this diffuser well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and after ordering you receive helpful emails from the company to offer usage tips and check up on your satisfaction!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve even shared some nice tips on essential oils, their properties, and how to best use them.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy, it&#x27;s super easy to use and clean, and convenient size and shape as well.</li>
            <li>But that is a small tradeoff for a great price on an awesome diffuser and if that is what extends the life of it, so be it.</li>
            <li>It works well in large rooms and the timer is a great feature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s what I replied to the email:  &amp;#34;I love my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>My kids love the lights.</li>
            <li>customer service at Wizdom Naturals is top notch.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this diffuser to a lot of people on Facebook &amp; by word of mouth:)</li>
            <li>I use it in my favorite room with plants in it.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the Wizdom Aroma Diffuser, using it nightly to help go to sleep.</li>
            <li>There are many types of diffusers on the market</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d never tried one, but I&#x27;d glad that I got this one.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has the timer and auto shut off also.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that about this company also.</li>
            <li>:) just a thought.</li>
            <li>I like that this one holds more than most.  </li>
            <li>Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li>The company emails every so often to make sure everything is going okay and to give helpful tips on diffusing.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work once I ordered it.</li>
            <li>The diffuser is a perfect size for travelling with and is almost totally silent.</li>
            <li>Being able to scroll through colors that match your mood is an added plus.</li>
            <li>We love the Wizdom Naturals diffuser.</li>
            <li>Now... to get one for the office! :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>and you would STILL be able to reap the aromatherapy benefits from it.  </li>
            <li>This unit is OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li>It puts out a great deal of vapor and the changing lights are very relaxing.</li>
            <li>More is not always better.  </li>
            <li>Thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li>This company also checks in with you to make sure you like your product.  </li>
            <li>Love this , I transport it from my home office to my family room then bedroom every night.  </li>
            <li>It holds more water than most diffusers and stays on longer.</li>
            <li>I also like how the company continues to email tips and to make sure I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Others I have seen put much more out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying it and have already bragged on it to my Bible study group</li>
            <li>My room smells lovely now</li>
            <li>but I wanted something that would be more reliable.</li>
            <li>The lighting options are many.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is slightly more involved than just rinsing it out and drying it off.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, easy to fill.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend the purchase of this product, great price point.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Provides the perfect amount of humidification to keep from having a dry sore throat in the AM during the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please feel free to reach out to us at any time with questions, concerns or more feedback.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>works great so far.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this diffuser and use it, as I like ones that light up</li>
            <li>Other then that, it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone looking for relaxation and easy ward-off of dryness and germs in coming winter season.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Having experienced the benefits of the diffuser these last thirty days I can say that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I started to notice that the mist was not as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a year now, and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The unit did not put out a strong mist so smells were not as strong as i hoped.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li>There is no adjustable mist output setting, but that&#x27;s fine for me.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased that the product arrived so quickly.  </li>
            <li>easy fill up and easy clean up</li>
            <li>But the light (even the dimmer setting) is far too bright to use as a nightlight in a child&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li>It is really great to hear that overall</li>
            <li>The duration you get with the continuous option, works even longer when the light is off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Which is important to me because I like silence when it comes to sleep.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unusual to get this kind of product feedback</li>
            <li>We set it for 8 hours, with no light and add lavender oil for perfect night sleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>My massage clients particularly enjoy the mist rather than the scented candles I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Run settings are: 60/120/360 mins or &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; (which when filled to its max capacity of 300mls is anywhere from 8-10hrs).  </li>
            <li>:  As this is a base-fill ultrasonic diffuser (not a diffuser that has a water tank on it like a humidifier) when the water level gets lower and lower the bubbling and trickling sound (like a stream) gets a bit noisier.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the light feature while I&#x27;m reading and take advantage of the option of turning them off when I sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>It has choices of light</li>
            <li>The diffuser works great and has several settings for times and auto shut off when it runs out of water.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it still works</li>
            <li>/&gt;- 8 hour running time (for nighttime use)&lt;br /&gt;- colored light, ability to turn it off&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>far so good.  </li>
            <li>Run time is accurate, emits a steady amount of moisture, but no moisture collection on table surface and the light feature is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Love this, so easy to set up, the ability to select from 3 different time settings makes it even better!</li>
            <li>But really, easy to clean, lasts all night long, great customer service</li>
            <li>I did clean it as recommended but still seemed light to me.</li>
            <li>The LED lighting option is marvelous in the sense that you can completely turn the lights OFF, or you can choose to &amp;#34;rotate&amp;#34; through the LED light spectrum OR you can choose one solid color (and there are two settings for each color - a brighter color and a dimmer color, but</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require special water or fancy cleaning</li>
            <li>The light mode is pretty, there are three timed options available for diffuser/light use and the atomized (?) water doesn&#x27;t leave a noticeable residue on furniture.  </li>
            <li>However, I was using their citrus blend, and the people at Wizdom Naturals said that the citrus oils will not be as strong/long-lasting, so to be really fair, I should try different DoTerra oils to compare apples to apples.  </li>
            <li>As for the aroma diffuser unit itself, it puts out a good amount of mist and runs very quiet.</li>
            <li>I find running it constantly on a full reservoir</li>
            <li>I like using the 60 minute feature and coming back and seeing that the air smells good and the unit turned off.  </li>
            <li>Cust Svc sends good emails about uses of different oils.</li>
            <li>The mist that comes out is good and you can actually see it.</li>
            <li>Now it looks much simpler and relaxing :)</li>
            <li>Works well, but it&#x27;s also important to get good quality oils, and the right ones of those, if you want the scent to last awhile.</li>
            <li>I did not want my diffuser to be a cause of stress when I&#x27;m really trying to get relaxation and medicinal benefits, so getting backed by the warranty was a huge huge plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only 1 drop was enough to immediately make everything smell wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am glad to finally have the diffuser I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li>We love this and since our purchase, 2 other family members have ordered their own.  </li>
            <li>diffuser easily covers a LARGE area.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest you put something on the Amazon listing with a link to your site (http://www.wizdomnaturals.com/ ) and put something more detailed instructions for how to clean the diffuser on your site, or possibly a video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering that is the only thing I&#x27;d change, I&#x27;d say this was a pretty good unit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone!!!</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this product, it shipped quickly and everyone in the house found it ez to use, we&#x27;ve tried several different diffuser oils and they all work very well.  </li>
            <li>It seems sturdily made and my customer service contact with the company was warm and personal.  </li>
            <li>A local friend of mine got these &amp; told me &amp; others how much she loved them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a week and am putting it through its paces, and so far I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for the essential oils to get a better night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li>Diffuses my essential oils nicely.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>They sent me a new one right away!!</li>
            <li>Stephanie from Wizdom checked with me if I received it, gave me pointers on how to use it &amp; clean it, &amp; also double checked again if  everything was okay.</li>
            <li>I loved the first one so much that I bought another for a different room.  </li>
            <li>With the right oil, the scent can fill those two rooms up well without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>And it is printed right under where the stream of steam comes out.</li>
            <li>A great little machine that is well built, easy to use, and quickly diffuses essential oils into the air.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean: just use mild soap and wipe it out and let it run with water for half hour every couple of days.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong when it first starts but next to nothing the longer the machine works.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try using essential oils for more than scent and can faithfully report that the results are immediate and very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>They emailed back and forth with me about what the best scents were for longer diffusing time and educated me on a few things I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>/&gt;LED colors are rather too bright for my eyes to find them relaxing, but I fix the color when I need to at the dim soft white light which is pretty pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this great little diffuser to anyone who is looking to get into aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s EXACTLY what I was looking for in an oil diffuser/</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted that others don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;4.QUIET&lt;</li>
            <li>They work well to increase the humidity in my children&#x27;s room that I&#x27;ve been able to replace my regular humidifiers with these.</li>
            <li>This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li>We use it mostly in the bedroom, for our essential oils.</li>
            <li>I love the larger water tank</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because the fan is able to push the mist further into the air.</li>
            <li>It is SILENT and I keep it on most of the night.</li>
            <li>I did make the mistake of filling above the 300ml line and the diffuser would not steam so make sure that it is just at or below that level.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped with my sinus and allergy problems at night!</li>
            <li>I like it and use it daily, but believe it could be better.</li>
            <li>It will be easy to pack as it is not huge but more like the size of the handle of your blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this diffuser for over a month and love that it spreads through a large area (we have a very open home), and that the smell of the oils continues to stay in this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy the multi colors (lights) that this diffuser has, I also REALLY like that it diffuses nearly all the water &amp; eo that you put into it the others I&#x27;ve had haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I really like how the people I ordered it from send me tips on different oils from time to time, and always want to know if I am pleased or if i have any questions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After saying this, I am very pleased with the unit I bought and have not had one ounce of trouble.  </li>
            <li>a quick click is all it needs and once the mist is on only quick clicks to adjust the time.</li>
            <li>although I really love them both the one thing I like about this one more is that it has 4 different timed setting where the other one does not.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 3 stars because it makes too much bubbling noise for me to have next to my bed for me to sleep, other than that it works perfect puts out a large volume which I like.</li>
            <li>Large tank.</li>
            <li>Item works as described but does not put a large amount of mist.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser works fine yet, but that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars.</li>
            <li>the simple fact that reviews here said that this runs perfectly fine after a year.</li>
            <li>This is a great diffuser and a little bigger than the others I have ordered so I do not have to put water in it as often.  </li>
            <li>Be aware that just because you no longer smell it does not mean that it is not being diffused into the air and that you are not receiving the benefits from the oil.</li>
            <li>You can either set it to stay at the one color of your choice, or you can let it gently and smoothly rotate through the different lights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used the lights much.  </li>
            <li>We really appreciate your feedback.</li>
            <li>You bring up some very valid points which I agree</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Used for one month straight</li>
            <li>gentle when cleaning, the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;The container holds 300mls, which gives provides the benefit, of not having to refill frequently.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also left the light on and read in bed with my Kendall</li>
            <li>I really like how the company keeps in touch with you throughout the process and follow up with you to see how everything is going.</li>
            <li>I really like that the cover locks in place and won&#x27;t pop off as you&#x27;re carrying it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really NEED another</li>
            <li>Really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li>This diffuser really kicks out the vapors and there is never any moisture on the table where it sits.  </li>
            <li>Diffuses very well.  </li>
            <li>It has 3 timer settings and continuous &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; cycle which with 300ml water runs about 9-10 hours straight.</li>
            <li>the light has  multiple colors with varied shades and  intensities.</li>
            <li>; and it is much easier now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been with Young Living for 8 years &amp; used a variety of different diffusers this is the most economical one I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works for a long period of time before needing to refill.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to operate, I use it daily, sometimes all day long, and clean it once a week.</li>
            <li>Simple to clean -Soap,</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use that feature as much because I mainly set it on my night</li>
            <li>The only cons are: 1) you have to snap the cover into place, this can be a bit challenging when the tank is filled with water as I&#x27;m alway afraid I&#x27;m going to spill it, 2) the plug is at the bottom of the unit instead of on the side, which is kind of a pain to unplug.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how long I researched diffusers and could not find something that fit all my parameters.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It produces a fine mist, similar to a vapor, and the EO permeates the entire first level of my house.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to buy it after Christmas when it was on sale for $45; I see now the price has gone up to $60.  </li>
            <li>Steam comes out steadily and fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can keep changing color or stay with a particular one.</li>
            <li>diffuser seems to cover a decent size space.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Will buy again from this company and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The other option is to just take a glass of water over to the unit and pour it in - easy solution, but I just don&#x27;t like having to keep a spare cup in my room.  </li>
            <li>The company&#x27;s frequent check ins and tips have been very helpful.</li>
            <li>I have a 1900+ square foot home and the scent gently permeates throughout the house which surprised me.  </li>
            <li>But even at the regular price of $90 it is WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>Now this doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least; I think it&#x27;s quite nice and calming.  </li>
            <li>Wizdom also follows up with you to ensure you are delighted with the diffuser and have not experienced any problems with it.  </li>
            <li>It seems like I have to press it right in the center for it to come on, on the first try.</li>
            <li>Less concretely, but still very noticeable to me, I am sleeping easier and waking up more refreshed since I started regularly using the diffuser for an hour when I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>I was considering purchasing another unit for my daughters bedroom but not at this new price point.</li>
            <li>Additionally, they&#x27;re so much easier to clean than the typical humidifier.  </li>
            <li>so I cannot compare it to any others on the market other than to say that Wizdom is easy to operate and diffuses essential oils very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First I should say that I&#x27;ve only had my diffuser for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>The price jumped from $60 one month ago which was a stretch at that to nearly $90 now!</li>
            <li>the electrical cord, is designed is not very practical as it&#x27;s under the device,  Be creative in keeping it flat.</li>
            <li>Wow, what customer service!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my diffuser almost daily for one month and it still performs as it did the first time I turned it on.  </li>
            <li>This diffuser is simple, straight forward and VERSATILE!  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying learning about the different benefits of diffusing essential oil for my well being and look forward to using this  diffuser well into the future.</li>
            <li>It is silent, and the colors are pretty, too.  </li>
            <li>it can be really easy to spill a little water as you are trying to see or feel on the bottom where the plug is supposed to go.  </li>
            <li>hold the button down on the light or it won&#x27;t come on...</li>
            <li>I can see how some people should like it), and the light is the same on my other diffuser in that it rotates through the colors of  llights (with the option of no light), but personally I would like a softer more night light if possible.</li>
            <li>I put it in my room, which is a master bedroom that opens into a large master bath - maybe 500 sqft total?  </li>
            <li>This diffuser was recommended to me by a friend, and I will certainly recommend it to others who are trying essential oils.</li>
            <li>On a side note: We only use pure therapeutic grade oils in ours.</li>
            <li>It completely scents a room in minutes and the scent lasts for days, unlike candles.  </li>
            <li>When you take the unit over to put water in it, then have to plug it back in (we have to unplug it at the unit as it would be too much of a pain to unplug it at that wall all the time)</li>
            <li>The diffuser makes it complete.</li>
            <li>So surprised.</li>
            <li>and they have a timer and light and also an option for no light.</li>
            <li>We have 3 so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and so far I have no problem with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I nearly forgot, one of the product pictures do not have &amp;#34;Wizdom Naturals&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like staring at the logo whenever I used it as a night lamp, so I removed it with natural nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I think you have to be careful to only put high quality, pure oils in it and not to put too much at a time.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve felt like I wasted money when it came time to clean them out.</li>
            <li>We have a large master bedroom and so long as I put enough drops of pure essential oil in it, I can smell it through our room.</li>
            <li>Put it on blue or green with some relaxing oils, put it on red with some sensual oils, put it on yellow/orange for refreshing oils, etc</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m new to using essential oils</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to all the essential oils and want to buy quality if I could.</li>
            <li>Every few days (or 5-6 uses), you are supposed to wash the inside with mild soap and water then run it with just water for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have trouble falling asleep unless it&#x27;s dark, but the lights are pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>I love that it automatically shuts off and beeps - a quick triple beep that isn&#x27;t super loud or annoying- to alert you that it&#x27;s empty.  </li>
            <li>I was having a hard time finding one that I could adjust the time and leave the  light off.</li>
            <li>We will celebrate 1 year in business next month and are in the processes of getting our website professionally redesigned and will be &amp;#34;stepping up our game&amp;#34; so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this is also the only company that offers one year guarantee.  </li>
            <li>I can drop in 4-8 drops of high quality essential oils (depending on the oil I&#x27;m diffusing I use more or less), set it in my living room/kitchen common area (which is LARGE) and let this puppy run all day long!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes this is hard when you are trying to clean the unit, or even just adding water.  </li>
            <li>The only negative thing is the light button doesn&#x27;t come on all the time when it&#x27;s pressed.</li>
            <li>I think if a person is careful to remember these things,their units will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I also love that it blows the mist away into the air instead of it just falling back down and getting everything wet like the other diffuser I bought (ZAQ mirage).</li>

            <li> The lights are too bright for my kids and I in our rooms is all.</li>
            <li> But why, when the Plant Therapy oils are good quality, work well, and are a lot cheaper?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Not to mention the awesome night light on it.</li>

            <li> Does a good job.</li>

            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I also love the lights!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE them!</li>
            <li> I look forward to when I can order more of them!</li>
            <li> I am 100% pleased with my purchases!</li>
            <li> I love that!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS DIFFUSER!  </li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  </li>
            <li> This is the first Diffuser I have purchased but am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> but great for atmosphere light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I received an email from the company asking how I liked my diffuser - that&#x27;s the kind of customer service</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It is probably too bright for most people to use as a nightlight, but it&#x27;s a great ambiance light.  </li>
            <li> It makes a great most that has my whole living room - where I spend most of my day - smell great!  </li>
            <li> The colors are nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!!</li>
            <li> I got this diffuser after researching many others and I have to say I am very pleased with this diffuser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light is pretty and makes a great night light for kids&#x27; rooms.really very happy with it and have recommended it to friends already!</li>
            <li> Super great customer service</li>
            <li> Very strong steam output.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m good about cleaning it and so far so good!</li>
            <li> It runs for hours with a very light and pleasant soothing water sound and fills the room with aroma.</li>
            <li> That being said you will notice that some oils are stronger than others and diffuse more effectively while others are softer and will not &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; to diffuse as well.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best diffuser that I have used.  </li>
            <li> The color was a bit too bright for night light</li>
            <li> The risk-free trial (you can return it for FREE SHIPPING if you don&#x27;t like it!!!!), the 1-year warranty, the company&#x27;s outstanding customer service - all makes this diffuser well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and after ordering you receive helpful emails from the company to offer usage tips and check up on your satisfaction!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve even shared some nice tips on essential oils, their properties, and how to best use them.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy, it&#x27;s super easy to use and clean, and convenient size and shape as well.</li>
            <li> But that is a small tradeoff for a great price on an awesome diffuser and if that is what extends the life of it, so be it.</li>
            <li> It works well in large rooms and the timer is a great feature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I replied to the email:  &amp;#34;I love my diffuser.  </li>
            <li> My kids love the lights.</li>
            <li> customer service at Wizdom Naturals is top notch.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this diffuser to a lot of people on Facebook &amp; by word of mouth:)</li>
            <li> I use it in my favorite room with plants in it.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Wizdom Aroma Diffuser, using it nightly to help go to sleep.</li>
            <li> There are many types of diffusers on the market</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d never tried one, but I&#x27;d glad that I got this one.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has the timer and auto shut off also.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that about this company also.</li>
            <li> :) just a thought.</li>
            <li> I like that this one holds more than most.  </li>
            <li> Love this diffuser.</li>
            <li> The company emails every so often to make sure everything is going okay and to give helpful tips on diffusing.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work once I ordered it.</li>
            <li> The diffuser is a perfect size for travelling with and is almost totally silent.</li>
            <li> Being able to scroll through colors that match your mood is an added plus.</li>
            <li> We love the Wizdom Naturals diffuser.</li>
            <li> Now... to get one for the office! :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> and you would STILL be able to reap the aromatherapy benefits from it.  </li>
            <li> This unit is OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li> It puts out a great deal of vapor and the changing lights are very relaxing.</li>
            <li> More is not always better.  </li>
            <li> Thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> This company also checks in with you to make sure you like your product.  </li>
            <li> Love this , I transport it from my home office to my family room then bedroom every night.  </li>
            <li> It holds more water than most diffusers and stays on longer.</li>
            <li> I also like how the company continues to email tips and to make sure I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Others I have seen put much more out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying it and have already bragged on it to my Bible study group</li>
            <li> My room smells lovely now</li>
            <li> but I wanted something that would be more reliable.</li>
            <li> The lighting options are many.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is slightly more involved than just rinsing it out and drying it off.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend the purchase of this product, great price point.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Provides the perfect amount of humidification to keep from having a dry sore throat in the AM during the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please feel free to reach out to us at any time with questions, concerns or more feedback.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> works great so far.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this diffuser and use it, as I like ones that light up</li>
            <li> Other then that, it&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone looking for relaxation and easy ward-off of dryness and germs in coming winter season.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Having experienced the benefits of the diffuser these last thirty days I can say that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I started to notice that the mist was not as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year now, and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> The unit did not put out a strong mist so smells were not as strong as i hoped.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li> There is no adjustable mist output setting, but that&#x27;s fine for me.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased that the product arrived so quickly.  </li>
            <li> easy fill up and easy clean up</li>
            <li> But the light (even the dimmer setting) is far too bright to use as a nightlight in a child&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li> It is really great to hear that overall</li>
            <li> The duration you get with the continuous option, works even longer when the light is off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> Which is important to me because I like silence when it comes to sleep.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unusual to get this kind of product feedback</li>
            <li> We set it for 8 hours, with no light and add lavender oil for perfect night sleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> My massage clients particularly enjoy the mist rather than the scented candles I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Run settings are: 60/120/360 mins or &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; (which when filled to its max capacity of 300mls is anywhere from 8-10hrs).  </li>
            <li> :  As this is a base-fill ultrasonic diffuser (not a diffuser that has a water tank on it like a humidifier) when the water level gets lower and lower the bubbling and trickling sound (like a stream) gets a bit noisier.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the light feature while I&#x27;m reading and take advantage of the option of turning them off when I sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> It has choices of light</li>
            <li> The diffuser works great and has several settings for times and auto shut off when it runs out of water.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it still works</li>
            <li> /&gt;- 8 hour running time (for nighttime use)&lt;br /&gt;- colored light, ability to turn it off&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> far so good.  </li>
            <li> Run time is accurate, emits a steady amount of moisture, but no moisture collection on table surface and the light feature is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Love this, so easy to set up, the ability to select from 3 different time settings makes it even better!</li>
            <li> But really, easy to clean, lasts all night long, great customer service</li>
            <li> I did clean it as recommended but still seemed light to me.</li>
            <li> The LED lighting option is marvelous in the sense that you can completely turn the lights OFF, or you can choose to &amp;#34;rotate&amp;#34; through the LED light spectrum OR you can choose one solid color (and there are two settings for each color - a brighter color and a dimmer color, but</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t require special water or fancy cleaning</li>
            <li> The light mode is pretty, there are three timed options available for diffuser/light use and the atomized (?) water doesn&#x27;t leave a noticeable residue on furniture.  </li>
            <li> However, I was using their citrus blend, and the people at Wizdom Naturals said that the citrus oils will not be as strong/long-lasting, so to be really fair, I should try different DoTerra oils to compare apples to apples.  </li>
            <li> As for the aroma diffuser unit itself, it puts out a good amount of mist and runs very quiet.</li>
            <li> I find running it constantly on a full reservoir</li>
            <li> I like using the 60 minute feature and coming back and seeing that the air smells good and the unit turned off.  </li>
            <li> Cust Svc sends good emails about uses of different oils.</li>
            <li> The mist that comes out is good and you can actually see it.</li>
            <li> Now it looks much simpler and relaxing :)</li>
            <li> Works well, but it&#x27;s also important to get good quality oils, and the right ones of those, if you want the scent to last awhile.</li>
            <li> I did not want my diffuser to be a cause of stress when I&#x27;m really trying to get relaxation and medicinal benefits, so getting backed by the warranty was a huge huge plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only 1 drop was enough to immediately make everything smell wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to finally have the diffuser I absolutely love.  </li>
            <li> We love this and since our purchase, 2 other family members have ordered their own.  </li>
            <li> diffuser easily covers a LARGE area.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest you put something on the Amazon listing with a link to your site (http://www.wizdomnaturals.com/ ) and put something more detailed instructions for how to clean the diffuser on your site, or possibly a video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering that is the only thing I&#x27;d change, I&#x27;d say this was a pretty good unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product, it shipped quickly and everyone in the house found it ez to use, we&#x27;ve tried several different diffuser oils and they all work very well.  </li>
            <li> It seems sturdily made and my customer service contact with the company was warm and personal.  </li>
            <li> A local friend of mine got these &amp; told me &amp; others how much she loved them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a week and am putting it through its paces, and so far I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily for the essential oils to get a better night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li> Diffuses my essential oils nicely.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> They sent me a new one right away!!</li>
            <li> Stephanie from Wizdom checked with me if I received it, gave me pointers on how to use it &amp; clean it, &amp; also double checked again if  everything was okay.</li>
            <li> I loved the first one so much that I bought another for a different room.  </li>
            <li> With the right oil, the scent can fill those two rooms up well without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> And it is printed right under where the stream of steam comes out.</li>
            <li> A great little machine that is well built, easy to use, and quickly diffuses essential oils into the air.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean: just use mild soap and wipe it out and let it run with water for half hour every couple of days.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong when it first starts but next to nothing the longer the machine works.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try using essential oils for more than scent and can faithfully report that the results are immediate and very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> They emailed back and forth with me about what the best scents were for longer diffusing time and educated me on a few things I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> /&gt;LED colors are rather too bright for my eyes to find them relaxing, but I fix the color when I need to at the dim soft white light which is pretty pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this great little diffuser to anyone who is looking to get into aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s EXACTLY what I was looking for in an oil diffuser/</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted that others don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;4.QUIET&lt;</li>
            <li> They work well to increase the humidity in my children&#x27;s room that I&#x27;ve been able to replace my regular humidifiers with these.</li>
            <li> This is my first diffuser</li>
            <li> We use it mostly in the bedroom, for our essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love the larger water tank</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because the fan is able to push the mist further into the air.</li>
            <li> It is SILENT and I keep it on most of the night.</li>
            <li> I did make the mistake of filling above the 300ml line and the diffuser would not steam so make sure that it is just at or below that level.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped with my sinus and allergy problems at night!</li>
            <li> I like it and use it daily, but believe it could be better.</li>
            <li> It will be easy to pack as it is not huge but more like the size of the handle of your blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this diffuser for over a month and love that it spreads through a large area (we have a very open home), and that the smell of the oils continues to stay in this diffuser.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy the multi colors (lights) that this diffuser has, I also REALLY like that it diffuses nearly all the water &amp; eo that you put into it the others I&#x27;ve had haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I really like how the people I ordered it from send me tips on different oils from time to time, and always want to know if I am pleased or if i have any questions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After saying this, I am very pleased with the unit I bought and have not had one ounce of trouble.  </li>
            <li> a quick click is all it needs and once the mist is on only quick clicks to adjust the time.</li>
            <li> although I really love them both the one thing I like about this one more is that it has 4 different timed setting where the other one does not.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 3 stars because it makes too much bubbling noise for me to have next to my bed for me to sleep, other than that it works perfect puts out a large volume which I like.</li>
            <li> Large tank.</li>
            <li> Item works as described but does not put a large amount of mist.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser works fine yet, but that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> the simple fact that reviews here said that this runs perfectly fine after a year.</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser and a little bigger than the others I have ordered so I do not have to put water in it as often.  </li>
            <li> Be aware that just because you no longer smell it does not mean that it is not being diffused into the air and that you are not receiving the benefits from the oil.</li>
            <li> You can either set it to stay at the one color of your choice, or you can let it gently and smoothly rotate through the different lights.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used the lights much.  </li>
            <li> We really appreciate your feedback.</li>
            <li> You bring up some very valid points which I agree</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Used for one month straight</li>
            <li> gentle when cleaning, the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;The container holds 300mls, which gives provides the benefit, of not having to refill frequently.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also left the light on and read in bed with my Kendall</li>
            <li> I really like how the company keeps in touch with you throughout the process and follow up with you to see how everything is going.</li>
            <li> I really like that the cover locks in place and won&#x27;t pop off as you&#x27;re carrying it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really NEED another</li>
            <li> Really like this diffuser.</li>
            <li> This diffuser really kicks out the vapors and there is never any moisture on the table where it sits.  </li>
            <li> Diffuses very well.  </li>
            <li> It has 3 timer settings and continuous &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; cycle which with 300ml water runs about 9-10 hours straight.</li>
            <li> the light has  multiple colors with varied shades and  intensities.</li>
            <li> ; and it is much easier now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been with Young Living for 8 years &amp; used a variety of different diffusers this is the most economical one I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works for a long period of time before needing to refill.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to operate, I use it daily, sometimes all day long, and clean it once a week.</li>
            <li> Simple to clean -Soap,</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use that feature as much because I mainly set it on my night</li>
            <li> The only cons are: 1) you have to snap the cover into place, this can be a bit challenging when the tank is filled with water as I&#x27;m alway afraid I&#x27;m going to spill it, 2) the plug is at the bottom of the unit instead of on the side, which is kind of a pain to unplug.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how long I researched diffusers and could not find something that fit all my parameters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It produces a fine mist, similar to a vapor, and the EO permeates the entire first level of my house.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to buy it after Christmas when it was on sale for $45; I see now the price has gone up to $60.  </li>
            <li> Steam comes out steadily and fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can keep changing color or stay with a particular one.</li>
            <li> diffuser seems to cover a decent size space.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Will buy again from this company and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The other option is to just take a glass of water over to the unit and pour it in - easy solution, but I just don&#x27;t like having to keep a spare cup in my room.  </li>
            <li> The company&#x27;s frequent check ins and tips have been very helpful.</li>
            <li> I have a 1900+ square foot home and the scent gently permeates throughout the house which surprised me.  </li>
            <li> But even at the regular price of $90 it is WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li> Now this doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least; I think it&#x27;s quite nice and calming.  </li>
            <li> Wizdom also follows up with you to ensure you are delighted with the diffuser and have not experienced any problems with it.  </li>
            <li> It seems like I have to press it right in the center for it to come on, on the first try.</li>
            <li> Less concretely, but still very noticeable to me, I am sleeping easier and waking up more refreshed since I started regularly using the diffuser for an hour when I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> I was considering purchasing another unit for my daughters bedroom but not at this new price point.</li>
            <li> Additionally, they&#x27;re so much easier to clean than the typical humidifier.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot compare it to any others on the market other than to say that Wizdom is easy to operate and diffuses essential oils very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First I should say that I&#x27;ve only had my diffuser for a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> The price jumped from $60 one month ago which was a stretch at that to nearly $90 now!</li>
            <li> the electrical cord, is designed is not very practical as it&#x27;s under the device,  Be creative in keeping it flat.</li>
            <li> Wow, what customer service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my diffuser almost daily for one month and it still performs as it did the first time I turned it on.  </li>
            <li> This diffuser is simple, straight forward and VERSATILE!  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying learning about the different benefits of diffusing essential oil for my well being and look forward to using this  diffuser well into the future.</li>
            <li> It is silent, and the colors are pretty, too.  </li>
            <li> it can be really easy to spill a little water as you are trying to see or feel on the bottom where the plug is supposed to go.  </li>
            <li> hold the button down on the light or it won&#x27;t come on...</li>
            <li> I can see how some people should like it), and the light is the same on my other diffuser in that it rotates through the colors of  llights (with the option of no light), but personally I would like a softer more night light if possible.</li>
            <li> I put it in my room, which is a master bedroom that opens into a large master bath - maybe 500 sqft total?  </li>
            <li> This diffuser was recommended to me by a friend, and I will certainly recommend it to others who are trying essential oils.</li>
            <li> On a side note: We only use pure therapeutic grade oils in ours.</li>
            <li> It completely scents a room in minutes and the scent lasts for days, unlike candles.  </li>
            <li> When you take the unit over to put water in it, then have to plug it back in (we have to unplug it at the unit as it would be too much of a pain to unplug it at that wall all the time)</li>
            <li> The diffuser makes it complete.</li>
            <li> So surprised.</li>
            <li> and they have a timer and light and also an option for no light.</li>
            <li> We have 3 so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and so far I have no problem with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I nearly forgot, one of the product pictures do not have &amp;#34;Wizdom Naturals&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like staring at the logo whenever I used it as a night lamp, so I removed it with natural nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I think you have to be careful to only put high quality, pure oils in it and not to put too much at a time.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ve felt like I wasted money when it came time to clean them out.</li>
            <li> We have a large master bedroom and so long as I put enough drops of pure essential oil in it, I can smell it through our room.</li>
            <li> Put it on blue or green with some relaxing oils, put it on red with some sensual oils, put it on yellow/orange for refreshing oils, etc</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m new to using essential oils</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to all the essential oils and want to buy quality if I could.</li>
            <li> Every few days (or 5-6 uses), you are supposed to wash the inside with mild soap and water then run it with just water for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have trouble falling asleep unless it&#x27;s dark, but the lights are pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> I love that it automatically shuts off and beeps - a quick triple beep that isn&#x27;t super loud or annoying- to alert you that it&#x27;s empty.  </li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding one that I could adjust the time and leave the  light off.</li>
            <li> We will celebrate 1 year in business next month and are in the processes of getting our website professionally redesigned and will be &amp;#34;stepping up our game&amp;#34; so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is also the only company that offers one year guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I can drop in 4-8 drops of high quality essential oils (depending on the oil I&#x27;m diffusing I use more or less), set it in my living room/kitchen common area (which is LARGE) and let this puppy run all day long!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes this is hard when you are trying to clean the unit, or even just adding water.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing is the light button doesn&#x27;t come on all the time when it&#x27;s pressed.</li>
            <li> I think if a person is careful to remember these things,their units will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I also love that it blows the mist away into the air instead of it just falling back down and getting everything wet like the other diffuser I bought (ZAQ mirage).</li>
            <li> I was stunned how many other products out there according to reviews failed in under a year and were far more expensive than this one.</li>
            <li> So, long story short I contacted the company to ask some questions and let them know my feedback.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the light stopped working after one week use.</li>
            <li> I hope it runs for a long time.</li>
            <li> I spent hours and days researching different aroma diffuser brands before deciding to purchase two of these units from Wizdom Naturals.</li>
            <li> Smell goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Runs a long time without refilling</li>
            <li> but I like that there is a year long warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought previous diffusers that you constantly have to readd oils as they don&#x27;t diffuse properly.  </li>
            <li> Can be a little hard to open and close at first</li>
            <li> They have to be taken care of very carefully so as not to get water in the little motor.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted a diffuser that had a timer and could run for however long I need, it will run for eight hours, it works great with essential oils, purifies the air, a must during cold and flu season!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried four different brands over the last few years.  </li>
            <li> Or just a glow in the dark outside?</li>
            <li> I was looking for a diffuser for a long time and spent a lots of time reading reviews but could not decide.</li>
            <li> only issues are, I found this diffuser to be too expensive, for being so plain in&lt;br /&gt;Design, and the light option on it, has stopped working, inspite of me not using it, at all.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Compared to other units that people report break down after a month and only have a 90-180 day warranty,</li>
            <li> I bought 2 different kinds because every review I read for any diffuser I felt was going to break within a few months.</li>
            <li> not MUCH dimmer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really bothered by it at all.  </li>
            <li> Especially like the fact that it will run all night - not just a few hours.</li>
            <li> AND I also found out from emailing them back and fourth that they are a small family run businesses!</li>
            <li> Rest assured you could put this diffuser on the other side of your room</li>
            <li> small enough to travel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used DoTerra oils and the scent seemed to just be weak and didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> You can choose the entire spectrum slowly changing from color to color, have it stay on one color, or turn it off all together.</li>
            <li> When turning it on, you have to hold the button down until you hear a beep, then keep pushing the button until you get to the time you want it running.</li>
            <li> After a week and a half, one of my diffuser broke down and would automatically shut off even though there was still a 1/4 tank of water.  </li>
            <li> I like this diffuser, however, very surprised how the price has gone up to match the expensive other ones.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered the price was $10 less</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed that my DoTerra Aroma Lite started being less consistent in misting shortly before 6 months of owning it.</li>
            <li> that is not true.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that the light quit working after only one week.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want to waste it on products</li>
            <li> I used a &amp;#34;cold and flu&amp;#34; recipe that definitely shortened the life of my sickness, compared to several other sick family members.  </li>
            <li> Rinse and run with plain water for 30 mins .So</li>
            <li> To keep it running I take a small spray bottle with just a little dish soap and spray to keep the oil from accumulating.</li>
            <li> I find it a little hard to twist, remove and replace the cover when refilling.</li>
            <li> I usually add water and mix peppermint or lavender, as they help with allergies and to relax at bed time.</li>
            <li> I work hard for my money</li>
            <li> And, that is hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> Seriously, from my experience this company deserves 6</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Somewhat difficult to remove the lid if you place it back on the wrong way after filling it up as the bottom portion is small and difficult to grip without sloshing the water all around inside.  </li>
            <li> And this sucker runs all night!</li>
            <li> was that the instructions for cleaning it were poor.  </li>
            <li> , if you are debating this go for it you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> but my family and I have not really been sick all winter!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed about</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This diffuser is a great size and and operates up to 8 hours, which is very nice. It is very quiet. The only comment is that It is not explained in the directions how to select the time period that you want to diffuse. The button for that selection does not work all the time.</li>
            <li> First I should say that I&#x27;ve only had my diffuser for a couple of weeks.  Also, I&#x27;m new to using essential oils and I&#x27;m also the type of person who researches everything before purchasing it.  I work hard for my money so I don&#x27;t want to waste it on products which won&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received an email from the company asking how I liked my diffuser - that&#x27;s the kind of customer service I appreciate - followup with the customer!!!  I was impressed!  The email also had some suggestions for essential oils to try - give the customer something - another plus in my book in the customer service department!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I replied to the email:  &amp;#34;I love my diffuser.  I&#x27;ve used it with Lavender, Roman Chamomile, Rosemary, Tea Tree, Cinnamon Bark, &amp; Eucalyptus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I was disappointed about was that the instructions for cleaning it were poor.  Also, when I searched online for instructions online or a video about how to lean the diffuser I couldn&#x27;t find anything.  However, as I write this email I see that I searched using the word &amp;#34;wisdom&amp;#34; and not &amp;#34;wizdom&amp;#34; - so that was my error. I would suggest you put something on the Amazon listing with a link to your site (http://www.wizdomnaturals.com/ ) and put something more detailed instructions for how to clean the diffuser on your site, or possibly a video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used the lights much.  I have trouble falling asleep unless it&#x27;s dark, but the lights are pretty cool.  All in all I think the diffuser is a quality product and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I promptly received the below reply (again, impressive customer service!...I&#x27;ll update this review after I&#x27;ve had the diffuser for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reply to my email:  &amp;#34;Thank you for your email. We really appreciate your feedback. You bring up some very valid points which I agree should incorporated to improve the customer experience.  We will celebrate 1 year in business next month and are in the processes of getting our website professionally redesigned and will be &amp;#34;stepping up our game&amp;#34; so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again thank you for your feedback It is really great to hear that overall you are happy with your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please feel free to reach out to us at any time with questions, concerns or more feedback.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this diffuser.  It completely scents a room in minutes and the scent lasts for days, unlike candles.  I was excited to try using essential oils for more than scent and can faithfully report that the results are immediate and very noticeable.  I used a &amp;#34;cold and flu&amp;#34; recipe that definitely shortened the life of my sickness, compared to several other sick family members.  Less concretely, but still very noticeable to me, I am sleeping easier and waking up more refreshed since I started regularly using the diffuser for an hour when I go to bed.  The light mode is pretty, there are three timed options available for diffuser/light use and the atomized (?) water doesn&#x27;t leave a noticeable residue on furniture.  It seems sturdily made and my customer service contact with the company was warm and personal.  I am very pleased with this product and feel great about the company I bought it from as well.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Used for one month straight and it&#x27;s EXACTLY what I was looking for in an oil diffuser/humidifier.&lt;br /&gt;Here are the best features:&lt;br /&gt;1. Provides the perfect amount of humidification to keep from having a dry sore throat in the AM during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;2. Simple to clean -Soap, water, rinse, run and done.&lt;br /&gt;3. Stays running 10 hours so it lasts all night, exactly what I wanted that others don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;4.QUIET&lt;br /&gt;5. Doesn&#x27;t require special water or fancy cleaning products.&lt;br /&gt;6. ONE YEAR WARRANTY! Compared to other units that people report break down after a month and only have a 90-180 day warranty, nuff said!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Somewhat difficult to remove the lid if you place it back on the wrong way after filling it up as the bottom portion is small and difficult to grip without sloshing the water all around inside.  So it can be a struggle to open at times.&lt;br /&gt;2. The price jumped from $60 one month ago which was a stretch at that to nearly $90 now! I was considering purchasing another unit for my daughters bedroom but not at this new price point.</li>
            <li> My life has changed for the best with this product. The duration you get with the continuous option, works even longer when the light is off.&lt;br /&gt;Be gentle when cleaning, the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;The container holds 300mls, which gives provides the benefit, of not having to refill frequently.&lt;br /&gt;My only issues are, I found this diffuser to be too expensive, for being so plain in&lt;br /&gt;Design, and the light option on it, has stopped working, inspite of me not using it, at all.&lt;br /&gt;My five star review, is for water, capacity,&lt;br /&gt;The mist fills the room immediately, and customer service, the seller checks in with you regularly.&lt;br /&gt;The way the electrical cord, is designed is not very practical as it&#x27;s under the device,  Be creative in keeping it flat.</li>
            <li> Nice diffuser.  It runs continously for about eight hours.  Very strong steam output. Easy to use and clean.  I only wish that it had the intermittently on off feature.I also like the 1yr warranty.  I hope it runs for a long time.</li>
            <li> This diffuser is really quiet. Which is important to me because I like silence when it comes to sleep.  My kids love the lights. It&#x27;s perfect for a room size 12 X 12.  The only negative thing is the light button doesn&#x27;t come on all the time when it&#x27;s pressed. It seems like I have to press it right in the center for it to come on, on the first try. Other then that, it&#x27;s great!  Stephanie from Wizdom checked with me if I received it, gave me pointers on how to use it &amp; clean it, &amp; also double checked again if  everything was okay. Excellent customer service. And, that is hard to find these days. Mahalo Stephanie!</li>
            <li> Works well, but it&#x27;s also important to get good quality oils, and the right ones of those, if you want the scent to last awhile. The brand I found is on Amazon - Plant Therapy Essential Oils (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005YETQMA?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00) .  I&#x27;d used DoTerra oils and the scent seemed to just be weak and didn&#x27;t last long.  However, I was using their citrus blend, and the people at Wizdom Naturals said that the citrus oils will not be as strong/long-lasting, so to be really fair, I should try different DoTerra oils to compare apples to apples.  But why, when the Plant Therapy oils are good quality, work well, and are a lot cheaper?&lt;br /&gt;The customer service at Wizdom Naturals is top notch.  They emailed back and forth with me about what the best scents were for longer diffusing time and educated me on a few things I didn&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser starts immediately once you turn it on, and you can choose to set it to 3 different time settings or just to remain on.  When the level gets too low, it will shut itself off.  I also love the lights!  It is probably too bright for most people to use as a nightlight, but it&#x27;s a great ambiance light.  You can either set it to stay at the one color of your choice, or you can let it gently and smoothly rotate through the different lights. Put it on blue or green with some relaxing oils, put it on red with some sensual oils, put it on yellow/orange for refreshing oils, etc....  There is only one thing I would change on this, and that is to have the plug for the cord on the side rather than underneath the unit.  When you take the unit over to put water in it, then have to plug it back in (we have to unplug it at the unit as it would be too much of a pain to unplug it at that wall all the time) it can be really easy to spill a little water as you are trying to see or feel on the bottom where the plug is supposed to go.  The other option is to just take a glass of water over to the unit and pour it in - easy solution, but I just don&#x27;t like having to keep a spare cup in my room.  I don&#x27;t like clutter.  Considering that is the only thing I&#x27;d change, I&#x27;d say this was a pretty good unit.  I put it in my room, which is a master bedroom that opens into a large master bath - maybe 500 sqft total?  With the right oil, the scent can fill those two rooms up well without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Works great, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 3 stars because it makes too much bubbling noise for me to have next to my bed for me to sleep, other than that it works perfect puts out a large volume which I like.</li>
            <li> Returned item it was leaking and it did not disburse any smell to me</li>
            <li> I like this diffuser, however, very surprised how the price has gone up to match the expensive other ones.  Boo</li>
            <li> I spent hours and days researching different aroma diffuser brands before deciding to purchase two of these units from Wizdom Naturals. I selected this company based on their exceptional customer service from the reviews I&#x27;ve read and the best warranty (1 year) offered as I don&#x27;t mind paying a bit more to get that &#x27;peace of mind&#x27;. Now I see my decision has paid off. After a week and a half, one of my diffuser broke down and would automatically shut off even though there was still a 1/4 tank of water.  I contacted the seller and Stephanie immediately sent me a replacement with 2 days shipping. Wow, what customer service! I am so impressed with Wizdom Naturals service and warranty that I plan to purchase these as Xmas gifts for my family.  As for the aroma diffuser unit itself, it puts out a good amount of mist and runs very quiet. I have hygrometers in each of my bedrooms and noticed that these diffusers produce enough mist to increase the humidity by about 3-4 points. They work well to increase the humidity in my children&#x27;s room that I&#x27;ve been able to replace my regular humidifiers with these. Additionally, they&#x27;re so much easier to clean than the typical humidifier.  The only cons are: 1) you have to snap the cover into place, this can be a bit challenging when the tank is filled with water as I&#x27;m alway afraid I&#x27;m going to spill it, 2) the plug is at the bottom of the unit instead of on the side, which is kind of a pain to unplug. But none of these are deal breakers. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> A local friend of mine got these &amp; told me &amp; others how much she loved them. I ordered 2 and have had them probably just over a month. OMG! I absolutely LOVE them! I&#x27;ve had 2 defective H2EO diffusers, the company that makes them is awesome I sent one back &amp; it worked for a short time after that &amp; began getting glitchy again so I decided not to send it back again. I really enjoy the multi colors (lights) that this diffuser has, I also REALLY like that it diffuses nearly all the water &amp; eo that you put into it the others I&#x27;ve had haven&#x27;t &amp; I&#x27;ve felt like I wasted money when it came time to clean them out. I&#x27;ve been with Young Living for 8 years &amp; used a variety of different diffusers this is the most economical one I&#x27;ve found so far. I have 2 cats in the house &amp; it doesn&#x27;t bother them when it&#x27;s on. I look forward to when I can order more of them! I&#x27;ve recommended this diffuser to a lot of people on Facebook &amp; by word of mouth:) If you&#x27;re on the fence about this, don&#x27;t hesitate order as soon as you can!</li>
            <li> does not do a very big room</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best! Wish I had a larger one to use in the rest of the house. I use it in my favorite room with plants in it. It&#x27;s an oasis. The diffuser makes it complete. Not to mention the awesome night light on it.</li>
            <li> works great so far. I like the color changing feature and that I can set the timer on it. It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I am loving this diffuser!  It makes a great most that has my whole living room - where I spend most of my day - smell great!  I am looking forward to utilizing it with my dōTERRA essential oils to battle allergies and colds this fall and winter. It&#x27;s easy to use and after ordering you receive helpful emails from the company to offer usage tips and check up on your satisfaction!  I find running it constantly on a full reservoir gets me about 5 hours of mist. *Photo attempt to capture the luxurious mist emanating from the didfuser* I love that it automatically shuts off and beeps - a quick triple beep that isn&#x27;t super loud or annoying- to alert you that it&#x27;s empty.  I&#x27;ve had it a week and am putting it through its paces, and so far I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased. I will likely be purchasing another in the future for our upstairs area.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the Wizdom Aroma Diffuser, using it nightly to help go to sleep. The company&#x27;s frequent check ins and tips have been very helpful. This diffuser was recommended to me by a friend, and I will certainly recommend it to others who are trying essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my diffuser almost daily for one month and it still performs as it did the first time I turned it on.  This is my first diffuser so I cannot compare it to any others on the market other than to say that Wizdom is easy to operate and diffuses essential oils very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It produces a fine mist, similar to a vapor, and the EO permeates the entire first level of my house.  Wizdom also follows up with you to ensure you are delighted with the diffuser and have not experienced any problems with it.  They&#x27;ve even shared some nice tips on essential oils, their properties, and how to best use them.  It&#x27;s unusual to get this kind of product feedback - thank you Wizdom!</li>
            <li> Aromatherapy diffuser is perfect  for us. We use it mostly in the bedroom, for our essential oils. We set it for 8 hours, with no light and add lavender oil for perfect night sleep. I was having a hard time finding one that I could adjust the time and leave the  light off. I&#x27;ve also left the light on and read in bed with my Kendall and it was a perfect night light. Would highly recommend the purchase of this product, great price point.</li>
            <li> Great diffuser. I really like how the company keeps in touch with you throughout the process and follow up with you to see how everything is going. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this, so easy to set up, the ability to select from 3 different time settings makes it even better!</li>
            <li> great product and seller</li>
            <li> There are many types of diffusers on the market and I&#x27;d never tried one, but I&#x27;d glad that I got this one.  It&#x27;s so quiet that the only way I know that it&#x27;s on is when I see the mist.  I use it primarily for the essential oils to get a better night&#x27;s sleep.  This diffuser doesn&#x27;t interrupt my sleep at all.  It produces a very good mist and covers the room.  It&#x27;s very sturdy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews before buying a diffuser. I bought 2 different kinds because every review I read for any diffuser I felt was going to break within a few months. I&#x27;m new to all the essential oils and want to buy quality if I could. This diffuser is great!! So surprised. I love the larger water tank and I also love that it blows the mist away into the air instead of it just falling back down and getting everything wet like the other diffuser I bought (ZAQ mirage). I love that it has the timer and auto shut off also. It runs all night. I started to notice that the mist was not as strong as it used to be. I did clean it as recommended but still seemed light to me. Note that this diffuser &amp;#34;seems&amp;#34; to have a lighter must than others...that is not true. I think it&#x27;s because the fan is able to push the mist further into the air. So, long story short I contacted the company to ask some questions and let them know my feedback. They sent me a new one right away!! Super great customer service AND I also found out from emailing them back and fourth that they are a small family run businesses! I LOVE that about this company also. I will definitely be giving thes as gifts to family and friends. I&#x27;m hooked!! Plus, not to jinx this but my family and I have not really been sick all winter!! Knock on wood! But really, easy to clean, lasts all night long, great customer service and they have a timer and light and also an option for no light. If I had any suggestions, it would be not to have the beep when you turn unit on or to each setting (tho I can see how some people should like it), and the light is the same on my other diffuser in that it rotates through the colors of  llights (with the option of no light), but personally I would like a softer more night light if possible. Or just a glow in the dark outside? :) just a thought. The lights are too bright for my kids and I in our rooms is all. So we don&#x27;t use them. Seriously, from my experience this company deserves 6***. I will be buying more!! Thank you again!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!  I have tried four different brands over the last few years.  I like that this one holds more than most.  The colors are nice.  I can immediately smell the oils that I use and it fills the downstairs of my house (~1400 sq feet on this floor).</li>
            <li> I have been using this diffuser for over a month and love that it spreads through a large area (we have a very open home), and that the smell of the oils continues to stay in this diffuser.  I&#x27;ve bought previous diffusers that you constantly have to readd oils as they don&#x27;t diffuse properly.  This one does the job and they offer a one year warranty.</li>
            <li> I ordered this unit along with the one from Now Foods  although I really love them both the one thing I like about this one more is that it has 4 different timed setting where the other one does not. I intend to get this as a gift for a friend</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser. Works perfectly. Great coverage for my 11x13 bedroom.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product, it shipped quickly and everyone in the house found it ez to use, we&#x27;ve tried several different diffuser oils and they all work very well.  I like using the 60 minute feature and coming back and seeing that the air smells good and the unit turned off.  I would buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This was my second Wizdom Diffuser.  I loved the first one so much that I bought another for a different room.  It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.  The diffuser will run for over 8 hours so it is great to use for sleeping.  The company emails every so often to make sure everything is going okay and to give helpful tips on diffusing.  I am 100% pleased with my purchases!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it!  It runs for over 12 hours.  Diffuses my essential oils nicely.  Very easy to use, easy to fill. When turning it on, you have to hold the button down until you hear a beep, then keep pushing the button until you get to the time you want it running.</li>
            <li> This is the best diffuser I have. I have 3 now. It has the best water capacity of 300 ml. I have never had a problem. Cust Svc sends good emails about uses of different oils. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works for a long period of time before needing to refill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of product before so I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work once I ordered it. It arrived quickly and I absolutely LOVE it! It is SILENT and I keep it on most of the night. I&#x27;ve had amazing sleep since purchasing this item! The lights can be turned off as well or kept on! I love that! I plan to buy another one! I highly recommend this product to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> The changing colors of this diffuser set it apart from the pack.  My massage clients particularly enjoy the mist rather than the scented candles I had been using.  Really great for allergies.</li>
            <li> A great buy! We have 3 so far. I really like that the cover locks in place and won&#x27;t pop off as you&#x27;re carrying it. Light is pretty and makes a great night light for kids&#x27; rooms.really very happy with it and have recommended it to friends already! Look for sale prices around the holidays.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this diffuser!! Well worth the price, if you are debating this go for it you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> The Wizdom Naturals aromatherapy diffuser is an excellent value! A great little machine that is well built, easy to use, and quickly diffuses essential oils into the air. The diffuser is a perfect size for travelling with and is almost totally silent. Being able to scroll through colors that match your mood is an added plus. I would highly recommend this great little diffuser to anyone who is looking to get into aromatherapy. On a side note: We only use pure therapeutic grade oils in ours. These oils are the highest quality that you can find. That being said you will notice that some oils are stronger than others and diffuse more effectively while others are softer and will not &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; to diffuse as well. Be aware that just because you no longer smell it does not mean that it is not being diffused into the air and that you are not receiving the benefits from the oil. We love the Wizdom Naturals diffuser. Now... to get one for the office! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS DIFFUSER!  With the LED light(s) on it will run for a solid 8hrs (if not longer).  With the lights off it goes for close to 10hrs.  This diffuser is simple, straight forward and VERSATILE!  Run settings are: 60/120/360 mins or &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; (which when filled to its max capacity of 300mls is anywhere from 8-10hrs).  The LED lighting option is marvelous in the sense that you can completely turn the lights OFF, or you can choose to &amp;#34;rotate&amp;#34; through the LED light spectrum OR you can choose one solid color (and there are two settings for each color - a brighter color and a dimmer color, but not MUCH dimmer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This diffuser easily covers a LARGE area.  There is no adjustable mist output setting, but that&#x27;s fine for me.  I can drop in 4-8 drops of high quality essential oils (depending on the oil I&#x27;m diffusing I use more or less), set it in my living room/kitchen common area (which is LARGE) and let this puppy run all day long!  I LOVE IT.  I was lucky enough to buy it after Christmas when it was on sale for $45; I see now the price has gone up to $60.  But even at the regular price of $90 it is WORTH IT.  The risk-free trial (you can return it for FREE SHIPPING if you don&#x27;t like it!!!!), the 1-year warranty, the company&#x27;s outstanding customer service - all makes this diffuser well worth it.  I want another one but I already have four diffusers in my house....  HA!  I don&#x27;t really NEED another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  As this is a base-fill ultrasonic diffuser (not a diffuser that has a water tank on it like a humidifier) when the water level gets lower and lower the bubbling and trickling sound (like a stream) gets a bit noisier.  Now this doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least; I think it&#x27;s quite nice and calming.  Plus I have a fan in my room for white noise so I&#x27;m not really bothered by it at all.  But some folks might not like that....  Rest assured you could put this diffuser on the other side of your room and you would STILL be able to reap the aromatherapy benefits from it.  This unit is OUTSTANDING.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted a diffuser that had a timer and could run for however long I need, it will run for eight hours, it works great with essential oils, purifies the air, a must during cold and flu season!!!</li>
            <li> Really like this diffuser. Run time is accurate, emits a steady amount of moisture, but no moisture collection on table surface and the light feature is a nice touch. Bought a second one as a gift. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This diffuser really kicks out the vapors and there is never any moisture on the table where it sits.  I use it to disperse essential oils ever day.  It works well with citrus oils too.  I have a 1900+ square foot home and the scent gently permeates throughout the house which surprised me.  I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again!  So worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this diffuser!  It is by far the best diffuser that I have used.  It works well in large rooms and the timer is a great feature.</li>
            <li> Runs great...last 8+ hrs in one use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Smell goes a long way. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.  It puts out a great deal of vapor and the changing lights are very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Before ordering my diffuser, I researched for hours.  During the research I learned a lot about all the diffusers.  They have to be taken care of very carefully so as not to get water in the little motor.  Sometimes this is hard when you are trying to clean the unit, or even just adding water.  I think you have to be careful to only put high quality, pure oils in it and not to put too much at a time.  More is not always better.  I think if a person is careful to remember these things,their units will last much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After saying this, I am very pleased with the unit I bought and have not had one ounce of trouble.  I really like how the people I ordered it from send me tips on different oils from time to time, and always want to know if I am pleased or if i have any questions.  It&#x27;s extremely good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this unit and this supplier.</li>
            <li> I find it a little hard to twist, remove and replace the cover when refilling. Water accumulates in the lid, and when you remove it the water drips everywhere. Aside from those annoyances, I&#x27;m happy with the diffuser and how it operates. I like the LED colors and the fact that you have the option to turn it off. I also like the fact that it will run 8 hours. The mist that comes out is good and you can actually see it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Works Great!</li>
            <li> Wife loves essential oils and bought this to put in the kids room.  He loves it and has to have it on every night as his &amp;#34;night light&amp;#34;.  Timer feature is great.  Diffuses very well.  Large tank.</li>
            <li> I got this diffuser after researching many others and I have to say I am very pleased with this diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it says and comes with 1 year warranty, which &amp;#34;many others&amp;#34; do not provide. I did not want my diffuser to be a cause of stress when I&#x27;m really trying to get relaxation and medicinal benefits, so getting backed by the warranty was a huge huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to operate, I use it daily, sometimes all day long, and clean it once a week. It has 3 timer settings and continuous &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; cycle which with 300ml water runs about 9-10 hours straight. It has quiet, water bubbling sounds I find relaxing. Steam comes out steadily and fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LED colors are rather too bright for my eyes to find them relaxing, but I fix the color when I need to at the dim soft white light which is pretty pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and so far I have no problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only tiny complain would be the construction of the air outlet being too close to where the water from condensation could drip in as well as while cleaning. But I guess I just have to be mindful about that. Ah! I nearly forgot, one of the product pictures do not have &amp;#34;Wizdom Naturals&amp;#34; logo on, but mine came with it. And it is printed right under where the stream of steam comes out. I didn&#x27;t feel like staring at the logo whenever I used it as a night lamp, so I removed it with natural nail polish remover. Now it looks much simpler and relaxing :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great diffuser and I would recommend it to anyone looking for relaxation and easy ward-off of dryness and germs in coming winter season.</li>
            <li> We love this diffuser, and the customer service (follow up, tips, etc) is great!  I would buy one for every room if we could afford to.</li>
            <li> We love this and since our purchase, 2 other family members have ordered their own.  Looks great too!</li>
            <li> Great on picking up everything. Thoroughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Easy to clean. Works like a dream.</li>
            <li> have two use them daily in my massage studio</li>
            <li> This is a great diffuser and a little bigger than the others I have ordered so I do not have to put water in it as often.  This company also checks in with you to make sure you like your product.  I will be traveling, soon, and plan on taking this with me so I can diffuse in the hotel room.  It will be easy to pack as it is not huge but more like the size of the handle of your blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited to leave a review for this for a month.  Having experienced the benefits of the diffuser these last thirty days I can say that I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.  It arrived within the guaranteed time frame.  I keep it running in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position and it shuts off when it is out of water.  I did make the mistake of filling above the 300ml line and the diffuser would not steam so make sure that it is just at or below that level.  I enjoy the light feature while I&#x27;m reading and take advantage of the option of turning them off when I sleep at night.  I am enjoying learning about the different benefits of diffusing essential oil for my well being and look forward to using this  diffuser well into the future.</li>
            <li> Love this , I transport it from my home office to my family room then bedroom every night.  So basically I use it whenever I am in my home.&lt;br /&gt;Especially in the winter with colds and germs going around. I would recommend this product to everyone. To keep it running I take a small spray bottle with just a little dish soap and spray to keep the oil from accumulating. Rinse and run with plain water for 30 mins .So far so good.  This is the first Diffuser I have purchased but am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the light stopped working after one week use. Otherwise it works great!</li>
            <li> This is awesome.  Only 1 drop was enough to immediately make everything smell wonderful.  It is silent, and the colors are pretty, too.  I bought this for work, but I think I will be buying another one for home.  The savings in the essential oils (needing only one or two drops instead of several) will make it eventually pay for itself.  Update:  I have been using this for over a year now, and it is still going strong.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> the light has  multiple colors with varied shades and  intensities. It can keep changing color or stay with a particular one. It runs for hours with a very light and pleasant soothing water sound and fills the room with aroma. Very easy to clean: just use mild soap and wipe it out and let it run with water for half hour every couple of days. I sometimes also leave it run with only water, like a mini humidifier.  The company is great. They sent email before the thing even arrived with instructions, and they immediately offered a replacement when I ran into problem, and the replacement works wonders. I think this is also the only company that offers one year guarantee.  I was looking for a diffuser for a long time and spent a lots of time reading reviews but could not decide. I am glad to finally have the diffuser I absolutely love.  Will buy again from this company and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this diffuser! It lasts forever! It has really helped with my sinus and allergy problems at night!</li>
            <li> works perfectly!  Especially like the fact that it will run all night - not just a few hours.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that the product arrived so quickly.  It was simple to use and held enough water so I could leave it running for several hours.  I initially was unsure how often I would need to refill the tank.  I thought I would like the changing lights.  I was wrong.  I loved the soothing lights that gradually change colors.  For anyone wanting to diffuse essential oils throughout your living space;  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Works well. It holds more water than most diffusers and stays on longer.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several weeks now and have had no issues. I did have to get used to the controls-don&#x27;t hold the button down on the light or it won&#x27;t come on...a quick click is all it needs and once the mist is on only quick clicks to adjust the time. Can be a little hard to open and close at first but it seems to &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; and it is much easier now. Runs a long time without refilling and I get the aroma throughout two thirds of my house. Does a good job. When I ordered the price was $10 less so feel I received a very good deal. I also like how the company continues to email tips and to make sure I am satisfied. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Item works as described but does not put a large amount of mist.  Others I have seen put much more out.  The scent is very strong when it first starts but next to nothing the longer the machine works.  I like it and use it daily, but believe it could be better.</li>
            <li> The customer service is excellent. They have sent several emails following up seeing how I like the diffuser and if I&#x27;m having any problems, which I haven&#x27;t yet! I&#x27;m good about cleaning it and so far so good!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!  It lasts all night and works great.  The various colors of lights is an added bonus.  I&#x27;m enjoying it and have already bragged on it to my Bible study group and they all want to order it and may already have!!!</li>
            <li> My room smells lovely now I have this diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it!! I mix my oils in there,depending on what I need. I usually add water and mix peppermint or lavender, as they help with allergies and to relax at bed time. It has choices of light but I don&#x27;t use that feature as much because I mainly set it on my night stand at bed time. The diffuser works great and has several settings for times and auto shut off when it runs out of water. I am very happy, it&#x27;s super easy to use and clean, and convenient size and shape as well. It looks beautiful, like a candle when it&#x27;s lit.</li>
            <li> I like the design. The color was a bit too bright for night light but great for atmosphere light. The unit did not put out a strong mist so smells were not as strong as i hoped. Loved the time feature and auto shut off. After about a month the unit stopped working and had to be returned.  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Nice.  Not overpowering.  I like to 360 degree</li>
            <li> i love everything about this diffuser!!  the led color changing and the mist.  it brings serenity in our home!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this diffuser and use it, as I like ones that light up so I can use it at night in my room or my boy&#x27;s room. I was very disappointed that the light quit working after only one week. The diffuser works fine yet, but that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m only giving it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how long I researched diffusers and could not find something that fit all my parameters. I was also disappointed that my DoTerra Aroma Lite started being less consistent in misting shortly before 6 months of owning it. Fortunately, it still works but I wanted something that would be more reliable. So this is what won me over with the Wizdom diffuser:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- optional running time, 60 mins, 120, 360, constant&lt;br /&gt;- automatic shut off&lt;br /&gt;- 8 hour running time (for nighttime use)&lt;br /&gt;- colored light, ability to turn it off&lt;br /&gt;- easy fill up and easy clean up&lt;br /&gt;- small enough to travel&lt;br /&gt;- no saturating the surface area it rests on&lt;br /&gt;- reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the simple fact that reviews here said that this runs perfectly fine after a year. I was stunned how many other products out there according to reviews failed in under a year and were far more expensive than this one. I did appreciate the email I received from the company&#x27;s customer service, checking to see if I received it and had any questions about the diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving it I put it to the test. The lighting options are many. You can choose the entire spectrum slowly changing from color to color, have it stay on one color, or turn it off all together. But the light (even the dimmer setting) is far too bright to use as a nightlight in a child&#x27;s room. It is however, very quiet when it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser seems to cover a decent size space. We have a large master bedroom and so long as I put enough drops of pure essential oil in it, I can smell it through our room. And this sucker runs all night! It&#x27;s fantastic. Over 8 hours so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is slightly more involved than just rinsing it out and drying it off. Every few days (or 5-6 uses), you are supposed to wash the inside with mild soap and water then run it with just water for 20 minutes. But that is a small tradeoff for a great price on an awesome diffuser and if that is what extends the life of it, so be it. I will update this review after I&#x27;ve had it longer to see how the lifespan is on this but I like that there is a year long warranty. I may purchase another one!</li>
