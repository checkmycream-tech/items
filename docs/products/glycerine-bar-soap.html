            <li>I use bar soap even though I know that it&#x27;s better for skin to use body wash.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture.</li>
            <li>No lather, better off using a smooth rock !</li>
            <li>Reminds me, I need to order more.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s unscented.  </li>
            <li>I should have done more research.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even used 1 of my bars yet it must be almost a month, most soaps just dissolve quickly but this one holds true to being of great quality.</li>

            <li>Chemical filled soaps</li>

            <li>Great Unscented soap without all the smelly scents and harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I love the glycerin in it because it leaves your skin soft and is a must in the winter.</li>
            <li>great will only again in the future.</li>
            <li>Pros: Very mild Genuinely unscented Leaves minimal residue  </li>
            <li>It is even better than Dial soap for feeling clean and not having harsh chemicals on the skin.</li>
            <li>Lucky stopped stocking Clearly Natural</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle.</li>
            <li>I just prefer using a bar, so I&#x27;m always looking for gentle soaps.</li>
            <li>Really like this soap.</li>
            <li>Expected more for amount I paid.</li>
            <li>the old version, circa 2009 or so, was much more fragile and prone to crumbling.</li>
            <li>more so than other bar soaps</li>
            <li>Liked that these bars were unscented, but the soap left my skin feeling very dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap for that reason.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>The product was as described, but cost was high.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I have been able to use with my extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it say\\&quot;s \\&quot;New and Improved!\\</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would certainly have given it 4 stars, but in looking for a product that would overcome my allergic reaction, this product fell short of.</li>
            <li>One bar lasts even with frequent use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this soap because I seem to have developed a soap allergy.  </li>
            <li>Acne for years as an adult.</li>
            <li>It is completely unscented and shouldn&#x27;t bother anyone with allergies or skin conditions, which I have and did not react to this soap.</li>
            <li>I bought the soaps hoping they would be totally unscented and with no additives; because I intended them as gifts to some friends who are highly allergic to scents.  </li>
            <li>: Doesn&#x27;t lather well Very slippery when wet--</li>
            <li>versions contain a blend of natural aromas and essential oils-</li>
            <li>From my trials of soaps and cleansing bars helpful for relieving itching discomfiture from old dry skin, this product seems to work very well…at the head of a long list of candidates.</li>

            <li> Lucky stopped stocking Clearly Natural so I came here when they ran out.  I admired the soap&#x27;s ability to clean well without cheap fragrance or itchy skin.  Now I know why the store dropped the product line - The new formula is no good.  The water turns syrupy but it beads up and drips off your skin without cleaning anything.  Imagine trying to bathe with a jawbreaker rock candy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father who insists on using only glycerine soap, which has become impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> A wonderful cleansing bar.</li>
            <li> great will only again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I have been able to use with my extra sensitive skin. Now that it say\\&quot;s \\&quot;New and Improved!\\&quot; it makes my skin feel itchy and prickly. I wish they would have left it the way it was.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this soap. I am allergic to most soaps because of the sulfate and fragrance that is in many of them. This soap is gentle. One bar lasts even with frequent use. The soap rinses off with ease.  This soap works for me even though I recently found out there is sulfur in my tap water.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap because I seem to have developed a soap allergy.  Unfortunately, they did not work out as I had expected them to.  I cannot say it is because of the product.  The product is definitely what they say it is, lather well and is unscented.  I would certainly have given it 4 stars, but in looking for a product that would overcome my allergic reaction, this product fell short of.</li>
            <li> I use bar soap even though I know that it&#x27;s better for skin to use body wash. I just prefer using a bar, so I&#x27;m always looking for gentle soaps. This one is probably the gentlest I&#x27;ve tried. I love that it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture.</li>
            <li> This soap was perfect for my sister.  She is very ill and needs unscented products.  This product was as advertised, virtually no scent!  I highly recommend this soap for that reason.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a few bars of this soap on Amazon since my local Safeway stopped stocking it. I have noticed a change in the formula over the years--the old version, circa 2009 or so, was much more fragile and prone to crumbling. It also smelled sweeter (the glycerine scent).  Pros: Very mild Genuinely unscented Leaves minimal residue  Cons: Doesn&#x27;t lather well Very slippery when wet--more so than other bar soaps</li>
            <li> I only use Glycerine soap and this is great quality soap.</li>
            <li> I use the soap before I shave and after I shave to ensure my skin is clean. This soap is part of my face care routine every day.</li>
            <li> Really like this soap.I have very sensitive skin and it has helped me a lot.I would recommend it to anyone with skin problems</li>
            <li> From my trials of soaps and cleansing bars helpful for relieving itching discomfiture from old dry skin, this product seems to work very well…at the head of a long list of candidates.</li>
            <li> Horrible, for not having a scent, smells like chemical. No lather, better off using a smooth rock !</li>
            <li> Great Unscented soap without all the smelly scents and harsh chemicals.  Last longer than any other natural soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  Work even for rinsing contacts..and dh is fussy!  Highly recommend.  Reminds me, I need to order more.</li>
            <li> I love glycerin soaps as they are gentle on the skin.  They lather well too, and clean too. these were a good value and well packaged and delivered promptly. I will reorder when my supply gets low.</li>
            <li> Nice soap, and I love that it&#x27;s unscented.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect!  I&#x27;ll order this item again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Some previous reviewers have complained that Glycerin soap does not produce suds - well, so what.  It cleans and makes my skin feel smooth and supple.  What do I need suds for?  I will never use regular soaps again!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even used 1 of my bars yet it must be almost a month, most soaps just dissolve quickly but this one holds true to being of great quality.</li>
            <li> I bought the soaps hoping they would be totally unscented and with no additives; because I intended them as gifts to some friends who are highly allergic to scents.  The soap is as advertised; there is no scent at all.  Although I am not allergic,  I like using it myself.  It seems pure and not too &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; - not needing excessive rinsing.</li>
            <li> Best soap you will ever wash your face with. Acne for years as an adult. Chemical filled soaps either did no good or made it worse. Started using this several years ago: problem solved. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Was anoying to wasch with.</li>
            <li> I like this soap, especially in the winter. It is completely unscented and shouldn&#x27;t bother anyone with allergies or skin conditions, which I have and did not react to this soap. I love the glycerin in it because it leaves your skin soft and is a must in the winter. The pricemakes it an excellent value that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intention that my son would use it, since it&#x27;s unscented &amp; chemical free.  I should have done more research.  It may contain coconut, &amp; he&#x27;s allergic to coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Glycerine, sodium stearate and sodium oleate (saponified coconut, palm and/or palm kernel), decyl glucoside (vegetable-derived surfactants), propanediol and sorbital (humectants), and sodium citrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Fragranced versions contain a blend of natural aromas and essential oils-</li>
            <li> The product was as described, but cost was high. Quantity was not clear to me. Expected more for amount I paid.</li>
            <li> Liked that these bars were unscented, but the soap left my skin feeling very dry.</li>
            <li> Glycerine soap is great for the skin. It is even better than Dial soap for feeling clean and not having harsh chemicals on the skin.</li>
