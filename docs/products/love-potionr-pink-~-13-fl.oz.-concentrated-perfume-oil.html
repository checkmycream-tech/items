            <li>There used to be this drugstore version of cotton candy body spray/perfume that my girlfriend LOVED to death, and I would borrow sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>I put this on and immediately liked it.</li>
            <li>what kind of flowers, but</li>
            <li>I agree that I probably put too much on, because it was AWESOME!</li>
            <li>The website said the blend contains patchouli, vanilla, Amber, apricot, rose and verbena.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell people that name when they ask what kind of perfume I am wearing!!).difference of how scented powder smells to oil.</li>
            <li>Then, let me say vanilla (warm without cloying foodie scent).</li>
            <li>Just like the description, it&#x27;s kind of a candy floss scent but also rounded</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!!</li>
            <li>The sweet, girly pinkness casts the spell, and the sexy undertones reel them in!!  </li>
            <li>Vanilla and sugars and berries create this lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Make sure to let it morph on your skin before jumping to conclusions.</li>
            <li>It also gets better as it ages, the berry sugars mellow out.</li>
            <li>On my skin, I get mostly vanilla, berries, apricot, and a hint of patchoulli.</li>
            <li>It is the berries and vanilla that jump out most on me most  though.</li>
            <li>: as soon as I put it on the sugary sweetness was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It has a exotic beach scent to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for patchouli, but I couldn&#x27;t smell it, so I was ok with it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>It is bright and fresh, outdoorsy, yet feminine and sensual.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the powderyness of it.</li>
            <li>I am off to get more Moist (</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the powderyness of it.</li>
            <li>I am off to get more Moist (</li>
            <li>I love this one in the summer</li>
            <li>The longer I wear it, the more I love it.</li>
            <li>Sun-warmed fruit in a bowl with sweetened vanilla cream on top.</li>
            <li>It gets better with age.</li>
            <li>I will be buying some more of this.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why this is such an awesome perfume!</li>
            <li>Just sexy grownup pinkness.</li>
            <li>but this has a lot more depth.</li>
            <li>the love potion perfume form has reviews, which is why there are so many reviews for this company because we all come over</li>
            <li>what, for many of us, becomes a hobby)</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite LP variants.</li>
            <li>LP Red is for my sexy best.  </li>
            <li>They both liked it, but said it was really sweet.</li>
            <li>This is a &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; fruity scent with just a hint of patchouli, which then changes over to more of a vanilla/patchouli that isn&#x27;t overpowering or too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of the Signature Love Potion line of fragrances...</li>
            <li>This a delicious pink sugar perfume.</li>
            <li>There is a LOT of yummy vanilla in this, and when combined with the pink berries and sugar notes - it is a perfect, wear anywhere, go to scent.</li>
            <li>But it has that sexy undercurrent that the original LP has.</li>
            <li>On me, I thought it smelled like vanilla, lightly of berries, and Amber ( I know Amber has a patchouli scent in it, but it is more rich vanilla and incense to me than flooded basement).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I think this will be a good one to wear often, and I also think this will be a good layering perfume to layer with other perfumes.</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh, or warm and sift is my thing.</li>
            <li>After half an hour, every note is detectable, but perfectly blended.  </li>
            <li>More like rainy fresh earthy garden.</li>
            <li>If LP Original is great when my mood is romantic....</li>
            <li>No artificial notes in this one!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s got more going on that just her sweet, pretty face.</li>
            <li>A beautiful floral aspect beneath the sugar provides the sophistication lacking in other pinky fragrances.</li>
            <li>I will say that I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that I liked it at all.</li>
            <li>My husband said it smelled like sweet vanilla powder.</li>
            <li>mom tried it on and it was not as sweet on her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and juicy with a luscious berry flavor.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light and sweet enough for warm weather.</li>
            <li>berries and apricot (fresh and clean without any sharpness).</li>
            <li>Update - if you find the berries too forward, let it age a bit as it mellows out for a less tart and more smooth warm scent.</li>
            <li>Buttery vanilla and berries are prominent, but the amber and verbena take it out of the \\&quot;little girl\\&quot; realm and into a still ultra feminine but more sophisticated arena.</li>
            <li>Love Potion Pink is one of my favorite&#x27;s in the Love Potion collection, it&#x27;s both youthful and sophisticated at the same time.</li>
            <li>I think I used to reach for this a lot more when I first bought it, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t use it all up over the last 5 years that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>She wants to put it on the light bulbs in the living room so the house smells like this.</li>
            <li>She said it was a mix between fresh flowers, grass and men&#x27;s soap.</li>
            <li>This is fun, flirtatious and femininity in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Love Potion scents are very complex and you won&#x27;t regret adding this one to your collection, and like a fine wine these beauty&#x27;s just get better with age!</li>
            <li>My Mom asked what it was right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely pink scent, goes great with OCCO Pink too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much cotton candy</li>
            <li>I can smell the first three</li>
            <li>Let me first say..</li>
            <li>I love a sweet, pink scent, but I&#x27;m in my 30s.</li>
            <li>It combines the girly pinkness from my younger days with the sexy Grownup</li>
            <li>This is a great scent for summer but is also timeless, if you want a scent that is subtly candy based this is for you.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty fragrance for those who love PINK!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost out of my delicious, creamy pink Love Potion variant &amp; that makes me feel sad.</li>
            <li>It is jasmine and something fresh and green, and maybe a clean, light musk scent.</li>
            <li>It was deep, strong, and earthy.</li>
            <li>One of my favorites I was glad to see moved from a limited edition to their permanent collection.</li>
            <li>The Love Potion website says this is a limited time fragrance.</li>
            <li>but they manage to capture the idea of certain scents.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what I will ever use it for, but it made the product seem more special.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However it is much more than just pink or sugar.  </li>
            <li>It has some more, well, gravitas than I expect from a pink potion.</li>
            <li>I received the Pink perfume oil, and 3 oil samples: Love Potion (I am guessing the signature brand), caressful  breeze, and Moist.</li>
            <li>It was really buttery vanilla.</li>
            <li>I googled it), and delphinium ( It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>Like I said before, I don&#x27;t like patchouli, but I know some people really do.</li>
            <li>Having an abundance of dark resinous scents, I&#x27;ve been trying to pick those light scents that are summery, fun and lighter to wear when the weather gets hot.  </li>
            <li>I really like this scent</li>
            <li>I must confess that I tried this on a whim as I am not really a pink sort of person, so it never expected to love this one.</li>
            <li>First off, this came in a cute little beaded pouch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and feminine but more complex.  </li>
            <li>but int he two years since I&#x27;ve been using LP products I&#x27;ve come to understand fragrance in a whole new way.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s womanly and girlish at the same time, and just a smidge sexy too.</li>
            <li>he said it was a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I can smell the vanilla and Amber the most and a little bit of berries.</li>
            <li>I can smell the vanilla and Amber the most and a little bit of berries.</li>
            <li>LP Pink is my third favorite (after to LP Original and LP Red)</li>
            <li>My go for everyday Love Potion.</li>
            <li>Sweet but not overpowering, long</li>
            <li>Love Potion Pink is the opposite of that.</li>
            <li>I am not usually a sweet-smelling gal.</li>
            <li>Very feminine, very pretty, and very pink!</li>
            <li>The very sweet and pink sugared berries that I encountered on application calmed down after about 15 minutes and settled in with the patchouli and verbena for a more grown-up take on pink.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty and not as girly as I expected.</li>
            <li>This is so much more complex and balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is feminine, soft and girly all in one.</li>
            <li>But I know that perfume oils have to soak in and &#x27;mature&#x27; with your skin and body chemistry to settle, so this didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I will definitely wear this, but it is really sweet.&lt;br /&gt;*my</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feminine, soft, and there&#x27;s just a hint of edge to it to make it grown up.  </li>
            <li>Ms LP Pink is fun and youthful but she&#x27;s no dizzy chit of a girl.</li>
            <li>I once had a small circle of admirers right in the dog food aisle!!</li>
            <li>It smells very pinky, sweet, glittery and last a long long time.</li>
            <li>He said it smelled a lot like the first one (Pink), but less sweet.</li>
            <li>He said it smelled a lot like the first one (Pink), but less sweet.</li>
            <li>Of course most of those perfumes smell too sweet or artificial to my nose now.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, this is indeed sweet and pink, but definitely grown up.</li>
            <li>Once it completely dries down, the blend is soft and fluffy, the berry is less sugar sweet and more sun ripened.  </li>
            <li>but then I spray a little on,and not only is it sickeningly sweet</li>
            <li>really like this one and can already tell that it \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; and will be long lasting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing the same thing my 16 year old would wear.</li>
            <li>Pink sugars dance around with vanilla making this every pink girl&#x27;s dream come true.</li>
            <li>This is superficially similar to Pink Sugar, but much more complex and grown up.</li>
            <li>It was mossy green and really pretty.</li>
            <li>The LP base is amazing anyway, and all the extras just take it a level higher.</li>

            <li> I can smell the first three</li>
            <li> Let me first say..</li>
            <li> I love a sweet, pink scent, but I&#x27;m in my 30s.</li>
            <li> It combines the girly pinkness from my younger days with the sexy Grownup</li>
            <li> This is a great scent for summer but is also timeless, if you want a scent that is subtly candy based this is for you.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty fragrance for those who love PINK!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out of my delicious, creamy pink Love Potion variant &amp; that makes me feel sad.</li>
            <li> It is jasmine and something fresh and green, and maybe a clean, light musk scent.</li>
            <li> It was deep, strong, and earthy.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites I was glad to see moved from a limited edition to their permanent collection.</li>
            <li> The Love Potion website says this is a limited time fragrance.</li>
            <li> but they manage to capture the idea of certain scents.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I will ever use it for, but it made the product seem more special.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However it is much more than just pink or sugar.  </li>
            <li> It has some more, well, gravitas than I expect from a pink potion.</li>
            <li> I received the Pink perfume oil, and 3 oil samples: Love Potion (I am guessing the signature brand), caressful  breeze, and Moist.</li>
            <li> It was really buttery vanilla.</li>
            <li> I googled it), and delphinium ( It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> Like I said before, I don&#x27;t like patchouli, but I know some people really do.</li>
            <li> Having an abundance of dark resinous scents, I&#x27;ve been trying to pick those light scents that are summery, fun and lighter to wear when the weather gets hot.  </li>
            <li> I really like this scent</li>
            <li> I must confess that I tried this on a whim as I am not really a pink sort of person, so it never expected to love this one.</li>
            <li> First off, this came in a cute little beaded pouch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet and feminine but more complex.  </li>
            <li> but int he two years since I&#x27;ve been using LP products I&#x27;ve come to understand fragrance in a whole new way.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s womanly and girlish at the same time, and just a smidge sexy too.</li>
            <li> he said it was a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I can smell the vanilla and Amber the most and a little bit of berries.</li>
            <li> I can smell the vanilla and Amber the most and a little bit of berries.</li>
            <li> LP Pink is my third favorite (after to LP Original and LP Red)</li>
            <li> My go for everyday Love Potion.</li>
            <li> Sweet but not overpowering, long</li>
            <li> Love Potion Pink is the opposite of that.</li>
            <li> I am not usually a sweet-smelling gal.</li>
            <li> Very feminine, very pretty, and very pink!</li>
            <li> The very sweet and pink sugared berries that I encountered on application calmed down after about 15 minutes and settled in with the patchouli and verbena for a more grown-up take on pink.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty and not as girly as I expected.</li>
            <li> This is so much more complex and balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is feminine, soft and girly all in one.</li>
            <li> But I know that perfume oils have to soak in and &#x27;mature&#x27; with your skin and body chemistry to settle, so this didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I will definitely wear this, but it is really sweet.&lt;br /&gt;*my</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feminine, soft, and there&#x27;s just a hint of edge to it to make it grown up.  </li>
            <li> Ms LP Pink is fun and youthful but she&#x27;s no dizzy chit of a girl.</li>
            <li> I once had a small circle of admirers right in the dog food aisle!!</li>
            <li> It smells very pinky, sweet, glittery and last a long long time.</li>
            <li> He said it smelled a lot like the first one (Pink), but less sweet.</li>
            <li> He said it smelled a lot like the first one (Pink), but less sweet.</li>
            <li> Of course most of those perfumes smell too sweet or artificial to my nose now.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, this is indeed sweet and pink, but definitely grown up.</li>
            <li> Once it completely dries down, the blend is soft and fluffy, the berry is less sugar sweet and more sun ripened.  </li>
            <li> but then I spray a little on,and not only is it sickeningly sweet</li>
            <li> really like this one and can already tell that it \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; and will be long lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing the same thing my 16 year old would wear.</li>
            <li> Pink sugars dance around with vanilla making this every pink girl&#x27;s dream come true.</li>
            <li> This is superficially similar to Pink Sugar, but much more complex and grown up.</li>
            <li> It was mossy green and really pretty.</li>
            <li> The LP base is amazing anyway, and all the extras just take it a level higher.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m not a little girl anymore, I still crave the pink girly scents from my youth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more of this one in the future but really, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the LP variations!!</li>
            <li> LP Pink is really an all round go-to fragrance for just that.  </li>
            <li> Just a touch too pink for me to wear regularly</li>
            <li> This scent will still be with you long hours after you apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pink, cotton candy fragrance, but this has multiple layers of scent.</li>
            <li> And lasts a long time throughout the day</li>
            <li> and I almost want to say that there&#x27;s some ruby red grapefruit or some fruity aspect along with the pink sugar and coconut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink goodness is very present.</li>
            <li> If you like &#x27;pink&#x27; genre scents, this one is definitely for you!  </li>
            <li> ,it doesn&#x27;t last long (thank goodness!).That&#x27;s where LP Pink comes in.</li>
            <li> I cannot typically wear patchouli, but this is faint and distant, more like a scented candy than a perfume note.</li>
            <li> In this case LP Pink to me, embodies everything womanly about pink.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting pink cotton candy heaven galore!!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t your teen scent or little girl scent.  </li>
            <li> It has a wet earth musky scent and a herbal scent ( think marajuana).</li>
            <li> As it dries, the vanilla warms up and takes center stage, masking the patchouli as it enters on a sugary cloud.</li>
            <li> Sounds weird, right?</li>
            <li> You can wear it solo or layer with another scent to &#x27;pink&#x27; that other scent up a bit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s PINK!</li>
            <li> LP Pink is what I wear when I feel flirty!</li>
            <li> It also lasts very long on my skin!!!</li>
            <li> It is odd.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure (if it is marshmallow) but it almost has a soft coconut smell hiding behind the cotton candy and providing a depth to it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hate smelling like I should be over at a junior high school when I wear the commercial pink scents.  </li>
            <li> On me, none of us could smell berries, apricot, or verbena (green citrus).</li>
            <li> which is an Hawaiian plant, that sort of has a green, vanilla, almond scent, I guess.</li>
            <li> but it has a fluffy marshmallow or powdered sugar aspect</li>
            <li> My husband by know was tired of sniffing me everyday.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My title says it all. This is superficially similar to Pink Sugar, but much more complex and grown up. Buttery vanilla and berries are prominent, but the amber and verbena take it out of the \\&quot;little girl\\&quot; realm and into a still ultra feminine but more sophisticated arena. One of my favorites I was glad to see moved from a limited edition to their permanent collection.</li>
            <li> My go for everyday Love Potion. Always amazing, always receiving compliments on it. Sweet but not overpowering, long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely addicted to these oils!</li>
            <li> Do you like mass market pinky sugary type scents?  If so you must try this.  This is so much more complex and balanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it is much more than just pink or sugar.  I get an edible yummy feminine vibe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a very very sexy scent!  I get compliments from both men and women with this.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample of this on lovepotion&#x27;s website for my sister. It smells very pinky, sweet, glittery and last a long long time. She wears it to work and everyone gives her a lot of compliments. She love pairing it with Heart and Soul pheromone blend!</li>
            <li> This one is feminine, soft and girly all in one. Vanilla and sugars and berries create this lovely scent. The LP base is amazing anyway, and all the extras just take it a level higher. It&#x27;s a lovely pink scent, goes great with OCCO Pink too.</li>
            <li> I must confess that I tried this on a whim as I am not really a pink sort of person, so it never expected to love this one. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised at the fact that I liked it at all. It is very pretty and not as girly as I expected. It has some more, well, gravitas than I expect from a pink potion. The very sweet and pink sugared berries that I encountered on application calmed down after about 15 minutes and settled in with the patchouli and verbena for a more grown-up take on pink. Ms LP Pink is fun and youthful but she&#x27;s no dizzy chit of a girl. She&#x27;s got more going on that just her sweet, pretty face.</li>
            <li> This a delicious pink sugar perfume. Make sure to let it morph on your skin before jumping to conclusions. It also lasts very long on my skin!!! I love it! It also gets better as it ages, the berry sugars mellow out.</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty fragrance for those who love PINK! On my skin, I get mostly vanilla, berries, apricot, and a hint of patchoulli. It is the berries and vanilla that jump out most on me most  though. Just a touch too pink for me to wear regularly, I wear this one when I am in the mood for a vanilla berry scent. Very feminine, very pretty, and very pink!</li>
            <li> First off, this came in a cute little beaded pouch. It was mossy green and really pretty. Not sure what I will ever use it for, but it made the product seem more special. I received the Pink perfume oil, and 3 oil samples: Love Potion (I am guessing the signature brand), caressful  breeze, and Moist. So I will tell you what I thought of each one and what others said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink: as soon as I put it on the sugary sweetness was overwhelming. But I know that perfume oils have to soak in and &#x27;mature&#x27; with your skin and body chemistry to settle, so this didn&#x27;t bother me. I am in my 30s, so I did not want to scent like a tween. After about 20 minutes the sugary scent mellowed and the vanilla and Amber started coming through. I liked it. Think deep vanilla sugar. I then had my husband and Mom smell me. My mom said it smelled like macaroons. She smelled vanilla, sugar, butter and coconut. I don&#x27;t think there is any coconut in the blend, but I think it was the Amber she smelled. It has a exotic beach scent to it. My husband said it smelled like sweet vanilla powder. He thought that it had a baby powder smell in it. I think he was smelling the patchouli. I don&#x27;t care for patchouli, but I couldn&#x27;t smell it, so I was ok with it. They both liked it, but said it was really sweet. On me, none of us could smell berries, apricot, or verbena (green citrus). I will definitely wear this, but it is really sweet.&lt;br /&gt;*my mom tried it on and it was not as sweet on her. It was really buttery vanilla. It smelled similar, but way different. It smelled good on me, but great on her. Still no fruity scents though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moist: this was one of the samples I recieved and the name is horrible. I put this on and immediately liked it. It is jasmine and something fresh and green, and maybe a clean, light musk scent. I LOVE this. It is bright and fresh, outdoorsy, yet feminine and sensual. Sounds weird, right? But it is amazing. My Mom asked what it was right away. She said it was great. She wants to put it on the light bulbs in the living room so the house smells like this. She said it was a mix between fresh flowers, grass and men&#x27;s soap. I am guessing the men&#x27;s soap scent is the musk. I looked up what is in it and it is night blooming jasmine, musk, sugar, maile (which is an Hawaiian plant, that sort of has a green, vanilla, almond scent, I guess. I googled it), and delphinium ( It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. More like rainy fresh earthy garden. I also Google this, because I knew the flower but didn&#x27;t know the smell). My husband said it smelled like walking through a flower garden. Not like floral perfumes, but like real flowers and green stuff. He had no idea what kind of flowers, but he said it was a little overwhelming. I agree that I probably put too much on, because it was AWESOME! The Love Potion website says this is a limited time fragrance. I am ordering this. Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Potion: so I think this is their signature scent. When I put this on all I could smell was patchouli. It was deep, strong, and earthy. Like I said before, I don&#x27;t like patchouli, but I know some people really do. To me it smells like spoke smoking pot in a dank basement. It has a wet earth musky scent and a herbal scent ( think marajuana). I did not like it. At all. But I had my Mom smell me. She said I smelled like hippies and vanilla candles. She didn&#x27;t like it either. She thought it was too dirty smelling. The website said the blend contains patchouli, vanilla, Amber, apricot, rose and verbena. I can smell the first three but none of the others. My husband said I smelled like a pothead. He said it smelled like marajuana and unwashed bodies. Hmmm...never wearing this one again. Lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caressful Breeze: this one smells good. On me, I thought it smelled like vanilla, lightly of berries, and Amber ( I know Amber has a patchouli scent in it, but it is more rich vanilla and incense to me than flooded basement). It smells powdery. That sounds weird butI don&#x27;t know how else to say it. Think of the difference of how scented powder smells to oil. This one smells like powder. The website says this one contains raspberry, currant, blackberry, fig, sugar, vanilla, Amber and white patchouli. I can smell the vanilla and Amber the most and a little bit of berries. My mom said it smelled like vanilla baby powder and a hint of berries. Like I had used berry shampoo. She also said it was powdery. My husband by know was tired of sniffing me everyday. He said it smelled a lot like the first one (Pink), but less sweet. He said it was vanilla. I like this, but I probably won&#x27;t wear it a lot. I don&#x27;t love the powderyness of it. It is odd.&lt;br /&gt;Well I did learn that my body chemistry pulls the vanilla out of any perfume and puts it to the front. That is good to know. I hoped this helped someone. I am off to get more Moist (why, oh why, does it have to be named that? I cannot tell people that name when they ask what kind of perfume I am wearing!!).difference of how scented powder smells to oil. This one smells like powder.

            <li> This is a &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; fruity scent with just a hint of patchouli, which then changes over to more of a vanilla/patchouli that isn&#x27;t overpowering or too strong.</li>
            <li> Love Potion Pink is one of my favorite&#x27;s in the Love Potion collection, it&#x27;s both youthful and sophisticated at the same time. Love Potion scents are very complex and you won&#x27;t regret adding this one to your collection, and like a fine wine these beauty&#x27;s just get better with age! This is a great scent for summer but is also timeless, if you want a scent that is subtly candy based this is for you.</li>
            <li> I love it and it smells great!</li>
            <li> This is stealthy sex!!  The sweet, girly pinkness casts the spell, and the sexy undertones reel them in!!  I love this one in the summer, it&#x27;s light and sweet enough for warm weather.</li>
            <li> Imagine the creamiest of vanillas, the sweetest of sugars, and the pinkest of berries all mixed into one glittery concoction! This is it! Pink sugars dance around with vanilla making this every pink girl&#x27;s dream come true. Long lasting pink cotton candy heaven galore!! You will not be disappointed. The aroma is daydream inducing and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Having an abundance of dark resinous scents, I&#x27;ve been trying to pick those light scents that are summery, fun and lighter to wear when the weather gets hot.  LP Pink is really an all round go-to fragrance for just that.  Rolling on, it reminds me of bubble gum.  It&#x27;s sweet and juicy with a luscious berry flavor. Once it completely dries down, the blend is soft and fluffy, the berry is less sugar sweet and more sun ripened.  I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing the same thing my 16 year old would wear. It&#x27;s sweet and feminine but more complex.  I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more of this one in the future but really, you can&#x27;t go wrong with any of the LP variations!! They all are beautiful!!</li>
            <li> Every once in a while,I crave one of my daughter&#x27;s uber-sweet,cotton candy,bubble gum,sugar coated perfumes...but then I spray a little on,and not only is it sickeningly sweet,it doesn&#x27;t last long (thank goodness!).That&#x27;s where LP Pink comes in. It fills my craving for the cotton candy,berry sweetness;but it&#x27;s tempered with a creamy vanilla and a touch of patchouli to elevate it into \\&quot;grownup\\&quot; territory. And it lasts and lasts! This scent will still be with you long hours after you apply. It&#x27;s a definite winner!</li>
            <li> I am not usually a sweet-smelling gal. Clean and fresh, or warm and sift is my thing. This scent somehow manages to encapsulate both feelings in a way I have never experienced. Let me first say..berries and apricot (fresh and clean without any sharpness). Then, let me say vanilla (warm without cloying foodie scent). Finally, let me say sugars and the faintest hint of patchouli. I cannot typically wear patchouli, but this is faint and distant, more like a scented candy than a perfume note. There is resin, but it is another layer of warmth, rather than hitting another note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet, this is fruit forward. As it dries, the vanilla warms up and takes center stage, masking the patchouli as it enters on a sugary cloud. After half an hour, every note is detectable, but perfectly blended.  I don&#x27;t know how Mara manages to blend these notes into something harmonious, when on my skin they should be shrill discord. The longer I wear it, the more I love it. Sun-warmed fruit in a bowl with sweetened vanilla cream on top. It drapes across the skin like silk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out of my delicious, creamy pink Love Potion variant &amp; that makes me feel sad. I think I used to reach for this a lot more when I first bought it, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t use it all up over the last 5 years that I&#x27;ve owned. It gets better with age. I will be buying some more of this.</li>
            <li> I love a sweet, pink scent, but I&#x27;m in my 30s. I hate smelling like I should be over at a junior high school when I wear the commercial pink scents.  Love Potion Pink is the opposite of that. It&#x27;s a pink, cotton candy fragrance, but this has multiple layers of scent. The patchouli and amber give it a deepness that adds maturity. I always, always, always get compliments when I wear this. I once had a small circle of admirers right in the dog food aisle!!</li>
            <li> I really like this scent and si does my husband! Smells fantastic! And lasts a long time throughout the day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they do it at LP but they manage to capture the idea of certain scents.  Sometimes they can even blend a memory or experience.  In this case LP Pink to me, embodies everything womanly about pink.  This isn&#x27;t your teen scent or little girl scent.  It&#x27;s feminine, soft, and there&#x27;s just a hint of edge to it to make it grown up.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about  this one as it is not what I think about when I think \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; but int he two years since I&#x27;ve been using LP products I&#x27;ve come to understand fragrance in a whole new way.  This isn&#x27;t like anything you&#x27;ve ever smelled before:  it&#x27;s womanly and girlish at the same time, and just a smidge sexy too.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m not a little girl anymore, I still crave the pink girly scents from my youth. Of course most of those perfumes smell too sweet or artificial to my nose now. That&#x27;s why this is such an awesome perfume! It combines the girly pinkness from my younger days with the sexy Grownup I am now! No artificial notes in this one! Just sexy grownup pinkness. Love, love, love this!!</li>
            <li> As others have noted, this is indeed sweet and pink, but definitely grown up. A beautiful floral aspect beneath the sugar provides the sophistication lacking in other pinky fragrances.</li>
            <li> There used to be this drugstore version of cotton candy body spray/perfume that my girlfriend LOVED to death, and I would borrow sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;This reminds me of that but this has a lot more depth. It&#x27;s very much cotton candy but it has a fluffy marshmallow or powdered sugar aspect&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m not sure (if it is marshmallow) but it almost has a soft coconut smell hiding behind the cotton candy and providing a depth to it.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this one and can already tell that it \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; and will be long lasting. I haven&#x27;t read the reviews on this (I&#x27;m not talking&lt;br /&gt;about Amazon-- the love potion perfume form has reviews, which is why there are so many reviews for this company because we all come over&lt;br /&gt;here to help \\&quot;support\\&quot; what, for many of us, becomes a hobby) but I have seen it mentioned on the forum board. I&#x27;m huffing myself occasionally&lt;br /&gt;while writing this and I almost want to say that there&#x27;s some ruby red grapefruit or some fruity aspect along with the pink sugar and coconut.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I think this will be a good one to wear often, and I also think this will be a good layering perfume to layer with other perfumes.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite LP variants. It&#x27;s PINK! It&#x27;s bright, youthful and girly... But it has that sexy undercurrent that the original LP has. I need a bottle of this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of the Signature Love Potion line of fragrances... LP Pink is my third favorite (after to LP Original and LP Red) It&#x27;s a sweeter, fruitier take on that original incredible perfume.  If LP Original is great when my mood is romantic....LP Red is for my sexy best.  LP Pink is what I wear when I feel flirty!</li>
            <li> This scent is one of my all favorites. It&#x27;s pink goodness is very present. Just like the description, it&#x27;s kind of a candy floss scent but also rounded so it&#x27;s not pointy. There is a LOT of yummy vanilla in this, and when combined with the pink berries and sugar notes - it is a perfect, wear anywhere, go to scent. You can wear it solo or layer with another scent to &#x27;pink&#x27; that other scent up a bit.  This is fun, flirtatious and femininity in a bottle. Staying power is for hours. If you like &#x27;pink&#x27; genre scents, this one is definitely for you!  Update - if you find the berries too forward, let it age a bit as it mellows out for a less tart and more smooth warm scent. One of my favorites!</li>
