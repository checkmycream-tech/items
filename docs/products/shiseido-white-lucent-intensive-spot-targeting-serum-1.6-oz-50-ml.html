            <li>Which brings me to Amazon today since I need more of this product and did not want to pay full retail price of (GASP) $170.</li>
            <li>My original order arrived defective</li>

            <li>Wife enjoys this very much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 years old and have light sunspots on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using softener.</li>
            <li>Therefore you have to try it first.</li>
            <li>I have clear and lovely skin now thanks to the complete Shiseido skin care line</li>
            <li>But this product really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>the size of a dime on the right side of my cheek had almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>Although Shiseido is an excellent beauty brand, this White Lucent for some reason caused me a terrible allergic reaction, so if you want to try it perhaps it is a good idea to read the label and see what ingredients it has, because I know that  I am allergic to the alcohol in some beauty products, also to the vitamin D in  creams and in  pills.</li>
            <li>This product removed my acne scars and brought my skin back to smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>So when I found it, I am going to keep using particularly for my skin type.  </li>
            <li>I like it,I have used 3 bottles so far, in conjuction with facial wash, so far has lightened my skin tone but sun spots has yet see significant fading.</li>
            <li>I was not very happy when I first got it, because it wasn&#x27;t very clean inside the package.</li>
            <li>Bought this product for my wife, placed an order as a new product as advertised online, but received as an old one.</li>
            <li>, I tried a sample.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to work in 10-days, so I was given enough to last the full 10-days applying it 2x</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for 4 months without any positive result.</li>
            <li>The darker spots really turning white.</li>
            <li>I know a male skin care consultant  who also uses this product and it has worked very well for him as well.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should have waited until I completely finished the bottle before rating this product.  </li>
            <li>So far I like the way it makes my skin look and by the time I&#x27;m finished with the bottle</li>
            <li>, I expect my skin to look fabulous because this product was not cheap</li>
            <li>This brand is very reliable one, a few of my friends use Shiseido products, they all like it very much.</li>
            <li>It has erased years of old scars from adult onset low grade acne.</li>
            <li>Im a 22 yr old African American woman.</li>
            <li>She really likes this cream to minimize the dark spots on her face/neck from being in the sun and gardening all day.</li>

            <li> price is cheap but it is fake</li>
            <li> I used for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I usually write long descriptions, but I&#x27;ll agree that for adult acne scars it helps, and for someone like me who has stayed out of the sun and tries to be as pale as possible, even 3 days of using it... /bikkuri shita/!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> So I sampled that as well because I didn&#x27;t want to give any excuse as to why the dark spots weren&#x27;t gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on other reviews I seen online.  </li>
            <li> both products, morning and night for 10-days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still have the dark spots.</li>
            <li> 5/5, its the cost that brings it down.</li>
            <li> Between using both, I am making a little progress.</li>
            <li> With this and the green makeup stuff you will be the palest musume at the matsuri.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite a few years and it has worked well for my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;They reduced SLIGHTLY!</li>
            <li> After trying other brightening products, I was skeptical to buy another especially since this one costs over</li>
            <li> I tried other product, but not effective.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it but not sure if it works as well as noted.  </li>
            <li> Was thinking about expensive laser treatments but wanted to give this product a try as a last stitch effort before laser.</li>
            <li> expensive.</li>
            <li> fake SHIseido.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but the reviews were encouraging.  </li>
            <li> very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Before it was visible even with makeup, but now with just a dab of concealer the nasty brown spot is invisible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I will continue to use it but not sure if it works as well as noted.  I am using it along with the corrective serum since the spots are still there.  Between using both, I am making a little progress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and have light sunspots on my cheeks. Before they get darker, I decided to give this entire line (not only the serum) a try. I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for 4 months without any positive result. very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using softener. It is good to use before moisturizer lotion. It feels good on face.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife, placed an order as a new product as advertised online, but received as an old one. Didn&#x27;t like it. Returned, but money was delayed for a period of time until I contacted the seller many times.&lt;br /&gt;Not a good seller to me!&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended!</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice product. I use it and love it. it is useful and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Rx all in a safe pack in blister form.</li>
            <li> Wife, likes it! What ever works, I guess.</li>
            <li> I like it,I have used 3 bottles so far, in conjuction with facial wash, so far has lightened my skin tone but sun spots has yet see significant fading.</li>
            <li> I usually write long descriptions, but I&#x27;ll agree that for adult acne scars it helps, and for someone like me who has stayed out of the sun and tries to be as pale as possible, even 3 days of using it... /bikkuri shita/! It actually works! If you&#x27;re trying to go pale and not just for the reasonable things everyone else seems to want, don&#x27;t worry-- this does that too. With this and the green makeup stuff you will be the palest musume at the matsuri.</li>
            <li> It make my skin brighter as time goes by. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This product removed my acne scars and brought my skin back to smooth and clear. It combined with Shiseido&#x27;s White Lucent Cleanser and Softener saved my skin!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. Was thinking about expensive laser treatments but wanted to give this product a try as a last stitch effort before laser. I only had a sample bottle and used it in conjunction with the brightening softener also by Shiseido. When I was finished with the sample bottle I absolutely noticed not only brighter skin, but a dark brown spot the size of a dime on the right side of my cheek had almost completely disappeared. Before it was visible even with makeup, but now with just a dab of concealer the nasty brown spot is invisible! Which brings me to Amazon today since I need more of this product and did not want to pay full retail price of (GASP) $170. At under $70 this is a great deal. I still wish it was cheaper -  why it gets 4/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If solely based on product&#x27;s effectiveness I would say 5/5, its the cost that brings it down. The trial bottle has made me a believer!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Great seller. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I like it is a very good</li>
            <li> tried. expensive. did not work for me too. saw no different. just another regular moisturizer it feels like.  moving onto another product.</li>
            <li> great product! my skin looks evener and softer and smoother and ...... still need more time to see the real results...</li>
            <li> fake SHIseido. if you look closely you will see how the bottle is different. price is cheap but it is fake</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all for me and I used two 1.6 oz tubes of it consecutively. It didn&#x27;t fade red marks on my arms at all. In my opinion, save your money and look into an alternative solution.</li>
            <li> Although Shiseido is an excellent beauty brand, this White Lucent for some reason caused me a terrible allergic reaction, so if you want to try it perhaps it is a good idea to read the label and see what ingredients it has, because I know that  I am allergic to the alcohol in some beauty products, also to the vitamin D in  creams and in  pills.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and night with a cream. This keeps my skin soft and white, my dark spot is getting lighter. I see the result, and confident. a Larger bottle with better price will help create more repeaters, price make us think twice before purchase, but no regrets!</li>
            <li> I was not very happy when I first got it, because it wasn&#x27;t very clean inside the package. But this product really works. The darker spots really turning white. So I am here again, and changing my comment.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for for my daughter, who in my opinion didn&#x27;t need it, and she says that she has noticed a difference.  Spots are fading.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  The spots on my skin are fading away yet, the product is gentle and it does a magical work.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin.  I have used this product for quite a few years and it has worked well for my skin</li>
            <li> I used for a long time.  It worked on my skin type.  I tried other product, but not effective.  So when I found it, I am going to keep using particularly for my skin type.  I would recommend only if it works on your skin type.  Therefore you have to try it first.</li>
            <li> My original order arrived defective but I replaced it and wow do I love this product. It has erased years of old scars from adult onset low grade acne. I have clear and lovely skin now thanks to the complete Shiseido skin care line and I could not be happier.I would happily recommend this product to any user ...even men. I know a male skin care consultant  who also uses this product and it has worked very well for him as well. Between this and the Shiseido sunless tanning gel I look healthy, hydrated and well groomed.</li>
            <li> I love it! It works for my skin.  It was gradual but it works.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but the reviews were encouraging.  Used for a few small age spots on the face and after 2-3 weeks noticed significant improvement.  After 4-6 weeks skin is perfect.  It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Wife enjoys this very much.  She uses the product on a regular basis and will be purchasing it again soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on other reviews I seen online.  I wanted my skin to look more youthful, bright and not so dull.  This product appears to work very gradual, which is ok, and that is why I rate it as a 4 and not a 5.  Maybe I should have waited until I completely finished the bottle before rating this product.  So far I like the way it makes my skin look and by the time I&#x27;m finished with the bottle, I expect my skin to look fabulous because this product was not cheap and I do see a difference since using it for the last 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom since she is picky at the products she uses. She really likes this cream to minimize the dark spots on her face/neck from being in the sun and gardening all day. Quick shipment. Great product! Thanks.</li>
            <li> This brand is very reliable one, a few of my friends use Shiseido products, they all like it very much.</li>
            <li> Worked on my face. I also like mask too, and special massage cream! And sunscreen 35! Also  Milky cleancer it wonderful,</li>
            <li> Im a 22 yr old African American woman. I found this product in Sephora. After trying other brightening products, I was skeptical to buy another especially since this one costs over $80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried a sample.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s supposed to work in 10-days, so I was given enough to last the full 10-days applying it 2x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read on the product to use this after using the softening toner. So I sampled that as well because I didn&#x27;t want to give any excuse as to why the dark spots weren&#x27;t gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used both products, morning and night for 10-days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still have the dark spots. (post-breakout spots)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They reduced SLIGHTLY! not much, still visible, but I wont completely discredit it.&lt;br /&gt;If they are going to charge 80 something bucks for it and say it works in 10-days I think they need to come up with a better product for all skin types or lower the price.</li>
            <li> For a month, I still did not get it, money also didn&#x27;t give me!but it return to me!For a month, I still did not get it, money also didn&#x27;t give me!but it return to me!</li>
