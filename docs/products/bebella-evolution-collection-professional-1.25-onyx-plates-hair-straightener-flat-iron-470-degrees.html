            <li>but it still works nicely.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and comes in a beautiful box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great straightener when it worked, but the plates broke, both of them, within the first week.</li>

            <li>Perfect for international travel.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the texture of the straightener.</li>
            <li>Gives CHI and babybliss a run for their money :)</li>
            <li>so much I love it</li>
            <li>Definitely the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li>I had one that I had bought at the mall for $100, but this one leaves my hair more smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Needed something to help smooth it out.</li>
            <li>My daughters and I enjoy using the hair straightener.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what makes this straightener unique when I saw it at the mall</li>
            <li>I saw this at a stand and the women was telling me it was almost $300, but I could get a special 50% offer.</li>
            <li>Takes forever to heat up and can&#x27;t handle more than I tiny section of hair at a time and my hair is very fine.</li>
            <li>The blue is quite lovely, and the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many straighteners, this one, by far takes the cake.</li>
            <li>Gets hot quick.</li>
            <li>It gets your hair straight, but it&#x27;ll burn your hair if you don&#x27;t use a protectant (which is true of all heat products).</li>
            <li>I can curl and straight my hair love the soft texture in my opinion</li>
            <li>but I think this wasn&#x27;t exactly the model I was supposed to get.</li>
            <li>But it gets hot and seems well built otherwise.</li>
            <li>It goes up to 460 degrees, and that is more than enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Bebella pro if you have thicker or curly hair because it goes up to a much higher temp.</li>
            <li>It straightens and curls my hair really well!</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair, but I was amazed at how great it worked.</li>
            <li>Makes her hair very soft and full</li>
            <li>I declined and went online to find the same straightener for ~$30, which is probably the most reasonable price for this product.</li>
            <li>Works good, but heavier than regular flat irons</li>
            <li>I dont&#x27; really like it; a friend told me to buy this</li>
            <li>I am convinced this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>I give this one star because the company charges way too much for this product in the mall.</li>
            <li>so if your hair is very curly that could be a problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, i have extremely curly hair, def gets it straight.</li>
            <li>These are nice flat iron but the plate was chip when i open them</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t see how it was any better than any other hair straightener I&#x27;ve tried....</li>
            <li>Love this straightener especially since it is blue.</li>
            <li>ill maybe give more stars after I use it more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with Ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>My first impression was a banged up box, I can&#x27;t even keep the box its that crappy...and its a pretty box to keep the flat iron in and out of the way.</li>
            <li>It keeps it very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin, blond hair, so it is important that I have a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s professional quality!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave you hair smelling burned, and also keeps it soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>Its a bit heavier than the other ones Ive used bit it has better[more] heat and a large heated suface.</li>
            <li>Then I carefully examined the flat iron and it was the missing foam circle at the end to prevent damage, and im sure there is a hairline crack in the plate</li>
            <li>It heats up and cools down extremely fast, and it only takes 2 or 3 passes to completely straighten my hair.</li>

            <li> Must be false advertising.</li>
            <li> If I had to complain it would be that it is difficult to gauge the temperature settings.</li>

It has the floating plates but aside from that it doesn&#x27;t even straighten my hair that good. Plus I still get that burning smell. I thought the plates were ceramic? Must be false advertising. Or maybe I got a defected one? It takes forever to heat up too...</li>

            <li> Takes forever to heat up and can&#x27;t handle more than I tiny section of hair at a time and my hair is very fine. Would not buy anything from this company again</li>

            <li> meh. It&#x27;s comparable to a revlon straightener that I had. It gets your hair straight, but it&#x27;ll burn your hair if you don&#x27;t use a protectant (which is true of all heat products). I give this one star because the company charges way too much for this product in the mall. I saw this at a stand and the women was telling me it was almost $300, but I could get a special 50% offer. I declined and went online to find the same straightener for ~$30, which is probably the most reasonable price for this product. Don&#x27;t be scammed, people.</li>
            <li> The depth of the flat iron makes it hard to get close to your roots so if your hair is very curly that could be a problem. But it gets hot and seems well built otherwise.</li>
            <li> Great color! Perfect for a gift.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this flat iron. If I had to complain it would be that it is difficult to gauge the temperature settings. It is a dial feature on the inner part of the iron and can be mistakenly adjusted.</li>
            <li> Straightner works really great! I loved it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have very fine, thin, blond hair, so it is important that I have a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t pull out my hair.

            <li> This straightener works amazing I can curl and straight my hair love the soft texture in my opinion that&#x27;s what makes this straightener unique when I saw it at the mall I like it but not the price so I decide to look it up online and I found it here for an affordable price thank u so much I love it</li>
            <li> I dont know how I feel about this flat iron yet. My first impression was a banged up box, I can&#x27;t even keep the box its that crappy...and its a pretty box to keep the flat iron in and out of the way.

            <li> Granddaughter loves it. Makes her hair very soft and full</li>
            <li> My daughters and I enjoy using the hair straightener. We are currently trying to also use it as a curling iron too!</li>
            <li> It straightens and curls my hair really well! I have thick, coarse hair but it still works nicely. The only part I was disappointed was that the iron part on the side was scarred(faded/peeled off?).</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant buying a smaller iron surface than my last straightener had. I have pretty thick hair, but I was amazed at how great it worked. It heats up and cools down extremely fast, and it only takes 2 or 3 passes to completely straighten my hair. It also doesn&#x27;t leave you hair smelling burned, and also keeps it soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned! Great price and great quality! I love how it works! I&#x27;ve received so many compliments since I started straightening and curling my hair with this product, I love it!!</li>
