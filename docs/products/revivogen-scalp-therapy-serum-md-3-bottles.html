            <li>and this is quite impressive nowadays.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>wish all of you the best of loss in your hair loss battle.</li>
            <li>I wish all of you the best of loss in your hair loss battle.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what is does and does it best.</li>
            <li>this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Where are the good reviews?</li>
            <li>It is amazing stuff for me.   </li>
            <li>putting on the product, I do find that it is a bit greasy and kind of smelly (though the smell is tolerable).  </li>
            <li>Works very nicely when you use it for a longer time with patience.&lt;br /&gt;Natural oils in it calm the scalp nicely, you feel stronger hair in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Some people think that revivogen will magically reverse you hair on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Received product quickly and in good shape, but not for me anymore.</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>But she was so confident it would help that I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Topical Absorption - Yes, Revivogen does have an impressive ingredient list.</li>
            <li>Most of these products have been shown in a lab to have some anti-androgen properties.</li>
            <li>I have scoured the net and at best have come up with people saying they \\&quot;think it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think.</li>
            <li>2 more things -</li>
            <li>However, I lost more hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are products that work for some but not others.  </li>
            <li>No noticeable difference either way, but I agree with most everyone who says it smells and makes the hair oily.</li>
            <li>I find the light smell to be fine, and my partner thinks it spells nice.  </li>
            <li>and if it is as effective as they claim there should be lots of internet success reviews backing this up.</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo to and is more accessible the price 25 Dollars.</li>
            <li>But I find that after spraying on, massaging in, and combing my hair... the product is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t work, I would&#x27;ve been fine as I&#x27;m not looking for a miracle cure.</li>
            <li>This can be seen in many vitamins as well as spirinolactone which is an extremely powerful anti-androgen.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I can see someone who is single, and lives alone using this, because anyone within 10 feet of you will be able to smell it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as useful as I originally thought.</li>
            <li>The negatives are it of course doesn&#x27;t smell good, and then also that it takes a long time to work.</li>
            <li>but now he uses it every single day and his hair is thicker and looks good.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fuller and so much body, I have Volume!!</li>
            <li>Product does as advertised and is useful.  </li>
            <li>I should note that I did experience success using brand name Avodart.</li>
            <li>But more importantly what I found on the net is discouraging.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re losing your hair.</li>
            <li>Okay, like many other men out there</li>
            <li>I just put it on right before bed and wash it off in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I also discovered the Revivogen Pro Dry Shampoo, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>These next to points are more speculation but are worth noting.</li>
            <li>But I hope this review will help you to move on to more effective/proven solutions rather than waste your money and precious time.</li>
            <li>Sooner is better than later!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also one who is willing to try anything to prevent hair loss.</li>
            <li>Let me state first</li>
            <li>, I will admit the biggest problem I had with it was that it made my hair greasy at first.  </li>
            <li>There are many things that have systemic effects when taken orally but have no efficacy at all when used topically.</li>
            <li>However, as many hair loss sufferers have discovered it has no effect used topically.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tricky point is you can only buy scalp therapy for 3 months and they want to have 90 days later at the latest !</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT... if your hair is really falling out, save your pennies ($11K) and have hair transplant surgery.  </li>
            <li>you gotta wash it away every morning, which is very damagable for hairs and time</li>
            <li>So I had previously used Propecia to help keep old hair; while I had no side-effects for the first year and more, I eventually found that that the side effects were not conducive to my..</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>I could never get my hair to it&#x27;s normal style, but I decided to use it nights.</li>
            <li>But I hope this review will help you to move on to more effective/proven solutions rather than waste your money and</li>
            <li>precious time.are losing hair all they need to do is convince you to buy their product once or a few times.</li>
            <li>I was experiencing hair loss around my hairline and now I have all new hair.  </li>
            <li>A quick search on the Bald Truth&#x27;s website finds a response to this by the host saying a very long time ago</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been so long that I really don&#x27;t remember what normal</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t stop it completely, but I see it&#x27;s helping to keep the hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using a natural product is more important to me than getting lots of results with artificial products.</li>
            <li>but now he does not believe this at all and that he does not endorse their product and that he is surprised they would say so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the revivogen scalp therapy is a good product which a expensive price.</li>
            <li>I have heard personally of other success stories using this product even for those who had propecia.</li>
            <li>most important here is whether to believe in a natural product that will, at least, help to keep your current situation or go with an artificial product that might give you much more results.</li>
            <li>the key is... how much grows back!  </li>
            <li>Okay here is what I hate most about this product.</li>
            <li>I have used it, it is working exactly as stated in the other reviews by the users.</li>
            <li>I did use this product as indicated on the box and like every other young man that is losing his hair I am willing to spend any type of money to keep my hair, but his product is definitely not the solution.</li>
            <li>So, even with apparently under applying it</li>
            <li>he thought natural topical DHT inhibitors might have some effect</li>
            <li>I spent several thousand dollars at the first doctor on steroid shots and pharmaceutical gels before he shrugged and told me to suck it up</li>
            <li>Of course, the more you use (amount), the worse it gets.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t say that I have had ZERO hair loss while I&#x27;ve been on it, but it has been minor enough to cause a debate in my head about whether this amount of shedding is just normal.  </li>
            <li>That was never a huge noticeable problem though, so the more obvious improvement has been at the front where the hair line appears to be widening laterally (filling in the widow&#x27;s peak to a small degree), and then just a general improvement in the coverage.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Jamaican Black Castor Bean Oil, I have had regrowth.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve taken multivitamins inconsistently over the same period, but that&#x27;s about it as far as other types of supplement.</li>
            <li> I was getting quite thin up front with a wicked widow&#x27;s peak, and was starting to notice significant thinning on my crown.</li>
            <li> People either are very enthusiastic about this product and encourage people to keep using it because it takes time, or they hate it and call it a scam.</li>
            <li> But due to extremely high cost and sexual side effects I was desperate to seek out a topical alternative.</li>
            <li> I doubt it&#x27;s a customer who loves their product so much they decided to fake a bunch of positive reviews for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off the product DID NOT do anything to slow or regrow hair for me.</li>
            <li> What I mean by this is there were 4 reviews with identical reviewer names and locations but that each had very different positive reviews.</li>
            <li> claims only mild results like slow down shedding, maybe regrowth, if not in 6 months maybe in one year, or not...</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s difficult to tell transplanted hair from my fine hair, I will say that my hair seems thicker.  </li>
            <li> People will be wondering how long its been since you&#x27;ve washed your hair.  </li>
            <li> so it took him a long time to see results</li>
            <li> Think about it, with all the men everyday for the first time noticing they are losing hair all they need to do is convince you to buy their product once or a few times.</li>
            <li> This CLEARLY shows someone is trying to boost the amount of positive reviews Revivogen has on the website by using fake reviews.</li>
            <li> I have tried other ones such as Nioxin and Elsierra and those did not work for me at all.  </li>
            <li> He only used it every other day</li>
            <li> It does not seem to dry.</li>
            <li> After milking you for several hundred dollars before you give up there is a whole new customer base ready to throw out a few hundred in cash.</li>
            <li> After milking you for several hundred dollars before you give up there is a whole new customer base ready to throw out a few hundred in cash.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t do anything for your hair the only result I obtained was less money in my pocket and a very dry scalp.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars in tring to save my hair line from receding.</li>
            <li> you gotta keep the empty bottles and stuff ...</li>
            <li> You hair will look wet all morning</li>
            <li> quit using the spray for a month, due to a hectic and stressful move across country.  </li>
            <li> Let me first say I was skeptical of this product before ordering it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an endless cycle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an endless cycle.  </li>
            <li> So use revivogen with other products.</li>
            <li> When I did come across positive reviews they appeared to be fake and scripted.</li>
            <li> My previous gains might have been due to some confounding variable.</li>
            <li> I think I average about five days a week.  </li>
            <li> There is a dark line at my hairline where the hair is THICKER than the rest of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is something difficult to measure without very rigid scientific control, but I noticed that my hair not falling as it used to</li>
            <li> Since this is the only one I could find, I&#x27;ll stay with it because my hair is, at least, not getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This website has 60+ reviews for the product with an average of 3.5 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I broke down and went to buy a hair piece.  </li>
            <li> It makes you hair look extremely oily and heavy</li>
            <li> So I used less.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> My humble request to people out there who are thinking or willing to buy this dirty product revivogen please change your minds.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money; you are going to regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep giving it a try here for a few months now that I&#x27;ve gotten the irritation under control.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Yet they still sucked a few hundred dollars out of you</li>
            <li> hair sort of stabilized after a couple of years, with periodic bouts of heavy loss until about a year ago when I found myself clogging the shower drain again every day.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning, I was using it everyday.</li>
            <li> so I have to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> If you still want to use it I would use it at night because your hair will look greasy, smelly and plain awaful during the day.  </li>

            <li> but you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a lil&#x27; better or a lil&#x27; worse, so you wait and wait, with your hairline slowly receding wondering how worst would it be without reivogen.&lt;br</li>

            <li> One of the worst useless worthless...product out there in the market  to loot money of people who are already devastated by their receding hairlines.This dirty fellow Alex khadvi  the creator of revivogen, looks like an affiliate of Al-qaeda is hell bent on ruining lives and money of people.My humble request to people out there who are thinking or willing to buy this dirty product revivogen please change your minds.</li>
            <li> I did use this product as indicated on the box and like every other young man that is losing his hair I am willing to spend any type of money to keep my hair, but his product is definitely not the solution. It just doesn&#x27;t do anything for your hair the only result I obtained was less money in my pocket and a very dry scalp. Don&#x27;t waste your money; you are going to regret it.</li>
            <li> Excelente no complains.</li>
            <li> the revivogen scalp therapy is a good product which a expensive price. I use the shampoo to and is more accessible the price 25 Dollars. The scalp therapy i use it in night and (don&#x27;t have a bad smell }</li>
            <li> I started using it about 8 months ago.  I&#x27;ve used it just about every night (missed probably ~5 times) seemingly as directed, but still have some of the 6 month supply remaining.  So, even with apparently under applying it I&#x27;ve noticed a benefit from it. I was getting quite thin up front with a wicked widow&#x27;s peak, and was starting to notice significant thinning on my crown. I&#x27;d say net loss via shedding stopped somewhere around the 3 month mark or so. Over the past couple of months I&#x27;ve seen that the top/crown area is no longer looking on the verge of developing a bald spot. That was never a huge noticeable problem though, so the more obvious improvement has been at the front where the hair line appears to be widening laterally (filling in the widow&#x27;s peak to a small degree), and then just a general improvement in the coverage. Basically I&#x27;ve lost a lot of the guy on the verge of going bald look, so I&#x27;m quite pleased with this product.  The negatives are it of course doesn&#x27;t smell good, and then also that it takes a long time to work. I&#x27;ve had no adverse/side effects from using this. I&#x27;ve taken multivitamins inconsistently over the same period, but that&#x27;s about it as far as other types of supplement. Clearly it&#x27;s not effective for everyone, so there is no guarantee. This is just the account from someone it seemed to work for.  Update: It started causing some scalp irritation, so I&#x27;ve had to cut back on using this product. It&#x27;s not as useful as I originally thought. Snake oil? Hard to say. My previous gains might have been due to some confounding variable. I&#x27;m going to keep giving it a try here for a few months now that I&#x27;ve gotten the irritation under control.</li>
            <li> So to start off... I&#x27;m not 20, over 50... and I&#x27;ve had hair transplant in the past.  But even after hair transplant, your &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair is still going to fall out.  So I had previously used Propecia to help keep old hair; while I had no side-effects for the first year and more, I eventually found that that the side effects were not conducive to my.. how shall I say this... sex life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My transplant doctor suggested Revivogen Scalp Therapy product, stating that he&#x27;d been using if for a while and it seemed to work for him.  So I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year, and I would say that I like the results.  While it&#x27;s difficult to tell transplanted hair from my fine hair, I will say that my hair seems thicker.  Hair falls out, the key is... how much grows back!  So far I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product at night before bedtime, unless I sense there&#x27;s &amp;#34;music in the air&amp;#34;... and then I don&#x27;t.  But I find that after spraying on, massaging in, and combing my hair... the product is easy to use.  I find the light smell to be fine, and my partner thinks it spells nice.  And I have never found my pillowcases to be discolored from it&#x27;s use.  BUT, I probably would not use the product in the morning if I&#x27;m going out to work or to a meeting.  Nighttime is best for my schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... if your hair is really falling out, save your pennies ($11K) and have hair transplant surgery.  It works and you&#x27;ll like the result.  Sooner is better than later!!!!</li>
            <li> Okay, like many other men out there I&#x27;m also one who is willing to try anything to prevent hair loss. I&#x27;m 25 and I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars in tring to save my hair line from receding. So, I tried this product and here is what I think about it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S TOO EXPENSIVE. It&#x27;s almost impossible to make one small bottle last a month. $90- $100 every three months is quite a hefty price to pay. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL : wow ;... it&#x27;s plain awful. It&#x27;s not something you should wear or use during the day because the smell is quite noticeable. People will be wondering how long its been since you&#x27;ve washed your hair.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;THE WAY IT MAKES YOU HAIR LOOK: Okay here is what I hate most about this product. It does not seem to dry. If you have hair that your normanly combe or style this product will not allow you to do so. It makes you hair look extremely oily and heavy so it&#x27;s makes your hair look horrible. I could never get my hair to it&#x27;s normal style, but I decided to use it nights. Well, even after applying it 3-4 hour before going to bed my pillow would turn brown from the product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;this is a horrible product. I hate it completly. Does it work? It didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it for over 6 months and it&#x27;s a waste of money.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The way you hair will look while wearing this product will surprise you. If you still want to use it I would use it at night because your hair will look greasy, smelly and plain awaful during the day.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Good luck!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been using it for like 7/8 months and the least I can say is that it didn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s promises, at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only brillant thing about Revivogen is the marketing campaign.&lt;br /&gt;It claims only mild results like slow down shedding, maybe regrowth, if not in 6 months maybe in one year, or not...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you just go with it, your hair keep falling but you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a lil&#x27; better or a lil&#x27; worse, so you wait and wait, with your hairline slowly receding wondering how worst would it be without reivogen.&lt;br /&gt;It claims no side effects, yet the product smells terrible, it makes your hair looks terrible (very greasy, like you have been drowning in your sweat for days), it facilitates dry, tichy scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Plus you gotta wash it away every morning, which is very damagable for hairs and time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was supposed to stop shedding 6 months after I started using it and it didn&#x27;t, it didn&#x27;t regrow anything of course.&lt;br /&gt;And when they say \\&quot;you give you your money back if your aren&#x27;t satisfied\\&quot; they mean \\&quot;we refund you your last order if you manage to ship it to us in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tricky point is you can only buy scalp therapy for 3 months and they want to have 90 days later at the latest !&lt;br /&gt;Plus you gotta keep the empty bottles and stuff ... But since they tell you to use it for at least 5/9 months you will still have 2 packs unrefundable.&lt;br /&gt;So the garantee works only if you are in the middle of your 3rd/4th pack and you manage to send it back to them on time. Yet they still sucked a few hundred dollars out of you you ll never see again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR : Congratulations for your marketing/manipulations techniques revivogen. You keep into business selling a useless, pricy product and this is quite impressive nowadays.</li>
            <li> This product does NOT work and they will NOT refund you despite the refund &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three of these boxes, and all of the spray heads were defective, making the product difficult to use. Since it wouldn&#x27;t spray, I ended up pouring the serum into another spray bottle to use, but I should not need to do this. Please address this issue as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Product does as advertised and is useful.  And the price cannot be beaten.  Will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I was experiencing hair loss around my hairline and now I have all new hair.  Finally I can grow bangs again. Thank you so much!!!  I also discovered the Revivogen Pro Dry Shampoo, this product is amazing. My hair feels fuller and so much body, I have Volume!!</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for about 1 month with Minoxidil foam and Nizoral shampoo. No improvements yet, but we&#x27;ll wait and see.</li>
            <li> Let me state first that I am a woman.  I have been losing my hair for ten years, and despite multiple doctors, I don&#x27;t know why because I&#x27;ve had two different diagnoses.  I spent several thousand dollars at the first doctor on steroid shots and pharmaceutical gels before he shrugged and told me to suck it up, I was going to lose it.  The second doctor gave me another shrug and told me it was genetic and I should get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair sort of stabilized after a couple of years, with periodic bouts of heavy loss until about a year ago when I found myself clogging the shower drain again every day.  I broke down and went to buy a hair piece.  The lady who sold it recommended I try this stuff.  I almost didn&#x27;t, because I didn&#x27;t think my problem was related to DHT, because my doctors hadn&#x27;t thought so.  But she was so confident it would help that I tried it.  Within three days my shower drain was empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I will admit the biggest problem I had with it was that it made my hair greasy at first.  So I used less.  10 squirts, all over my head, and no more.  Admittedly, some days I just don&#x27;t use it.  I think I average about five days a week.  The three bottle 90 day supply lasted me six months.  Nevertheless, my hair loss has stopped.  Thanks to Jamaican Black Castor Bean Oil, I have had regrowth.  There is a dark line at my hairline where the hair is THICKER than the rest of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quit using the spray for a month, due to a hectic and stressful move across country.  I didn&#x27;t notice a change for a couple of weeks, so I didn&#x27;t worry about it.  Then it started falling out, as badly as before.  I started back on the Revivogen and voile, it stopped falling out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t say that I have had ZERO hair loss while I&#x27;ve been on it, but it has been minor enough to cause a debate in my head about whether this amount of shedding is just normal.  It&#x27;s been so long that I really don&#x27;t remember what normal is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever iscausing my hair loss, this stuff worked when the pharmaceutical intervention my doctors tried didn&#x27;t have any affect at all.</li>
            <li> I just completed a year using this product. In the beginning, I was using it everyday. Now 3 times a week, skipping weekends.&lt;br /&gt;This is something difficult to measure without very rigid scientific control, but I noticed that my hair not falling as it used to sometime ago.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t stop it completely, but I see it&#x27;s helping to keep the hair I still have.&lt;br /&gt;Yes: it&#x27;s oily. You hair will look wet all morning and if somebody touches it, hands will become oily. I don&#x27;t use the product if I have, for example, dentist of the same day - you&#x27;ll leave oil on your dentist&#x27;s bed! But it&#x27;s something you can deal with. Of course, the more you use (amount), the worse it gets. So I just use some sprays, massage the scalp with it and use a comb.&lt;br /&gt;Using a natural product is more important to me than getting lots of results with artificial products. Since this is the only one I could find, I&#x27;ll stay with it because my hair is, at least, not getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;The most important here is whether to believe in a natural product that will, at least, help to keep your current situation or go with an artificial product that might give you much more results.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells SOOOO bad that I only used it once.  Honestly, I can see someone who is single, and lives alone using this, because anyone within 10 feet of you will be able to smell it.  I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> Let me first say I was skeptical of this product before ordering it. I have been battling hair loss for 5 years and have tried various different things. I should note that I did experience success using brand name Avodart. But due to extremely high cost and sexual side effects I was desperate to seek out a topical alternative. Which lead me to Revivogen. After using for 3 months and doing lots of internet research I have come to the conclusion that this product is useless and bordering on a scam. First off the product DID NOT do anything to slow or regrow hair for me. But more importantly what I found on the net is discouraging. I will list out my reasons for this below...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Topical Absorption - Yes, Revivogen does have an impressive ingredient list. Most of these products have been shown in a lab to have some anti-androgen properties. The key thing to understand here is \\&quot;in a lab\\&quot;. There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that these ingredients will lower DHT in a human body, LET ALONE if they are applied topically. There are many things that have systemic effects when taken orally but have no efficacy at all when used topically. This can be seen in many vitamins as well as spirinolactone which is an extremely powerful anti-androgen. However, as many hair loss sufferers have discovered it has no effect used topically. Moving on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Where are the good reviews? - Revivogen has been around for some time and if it is as effective as they claim there should be lots of internet success reviews backing this up. I have scoured the net and at best have come up with people saying they \\&quot;think it works\\&quot; or it \\&quot;should work\\&quot; based on it&#x27;s ingredients. You&#x27;d think on sites like Amazon there would be lots of people backing this product. When I did come across positive reviews they appeared to be fake and scripted. Which is something I will address next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Duplicate reviews - In searching the net for reviews on Revivogen I found one website that had an abundance of them. I won&#x27;t name the site but it sounds very similar to \\&quot;Follicle\\&quot;. This website has 60+ reviews for the product with an average of 3.5 out of 5 stars. I read every one. People either are very enthusiastic about this product and encourage people to keep using it because it takes time, or they hate it and call it a scam. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think. Then I noticed that there were 4 duplicate reviews. What I mean by this is there were 4 reviews with identical reviewer names and locations but that each had very different positive reviews. Oops Revivogen, you messed up either by human error or by programming your bot incorrectly. This CLEARLY shows someone is trying to boost the amount of positive reviews Revivogen has on the website by using fake reviews. Who do you think is doing it? I doubt it&#x27;s a customer who loves their product so much they decided to fake a bunch of positive reviews for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. 2 more things - These next to points are more speculation but are worth noting. It has been said (though I haven&#x27;t found it) that Revivogen has made claims on their website that their product is endorsed by the talk show host of the Bald Truth. A quick search on the Bald Truth&#x27;s website finds a response to this by the host saying a very long time ago he thought natural topical DHT inhibitors might have some effect but now he does not believe this at all and that he does not endorse their product and that he is surprised they would say so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly I located a website which reviewed Revivogen and addressed the issue of topical absorption not likely working. Now when you go to the article it is a greyed out with a note saying the article has been removed because they received pressure to remove it. Who would pressure them to remove it? And why? I think the answer is obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing I want to address that some of you will say that if the product doesn&#x27;t work then they would have gone out of business. Think about it, with all the men everyday for the first time noticing they are losing hair all they need to do is convince you to buy their product once or a few times. After milking you for several hundred dollars before you give up there is a whole new customer base ready to throw out a few hundred in cash. It&#x27;s an endless cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish all of you the best of loss in your hair loss battle. But I hope this review will help you to move on to more effective/proven solutions rather than waste your money and precious time.are losing hair all they need to do is convince you to buy their product once or a few times.

            <li> I&#x27;m onto my third bottle. It is greasy so I have to wash my hair everyday. If it didn&#x27;t work, I would&#x27;ve been fine as I&#x27;m not looking for a miracle cure. However, I lost more hair. Now, I have obvious bald patches. I would definitely not recommend Revivogen Scalp Therapy.</li>
            <li> Although I am a women, I actually found a product that works for me!  I have tried other ones such as Nioxin and Elsierra and those did not work for me at all.  My hair actually got thicker using this product.  I have used it for a year and a half.  The only mistake that I made was that I had slacked off in using it for a period and my hair thinned out again.  So I had to start over and my hair is growing back out again.  It is amazing stuff for me.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When putting on the product, I do find that it is a bit greasy and kind of smelly (though the smell is tolerable).  I just put it on right before bed and wash it off in the morning.  No problem. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For me this is a great product.  I&#x27;m sure there are products that work for some but not others.  I have heard personally of other success stories using this product even for those who had propecia. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> March 2014: Will try to update as I go along. Been using this product for about a month every night. No noticeable difference either way, but I agree with most everyone who says it smells and makes the hair oily. I use it before I go to bed, so it&#x27;s not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> I used to think this product help me, but having stopped using, my hair improved.  Received product quickly and in good shape, but not for me anymore.</li>
            <li> This stuff is legit. I bought it for my boyfriend bc its sold in the doctors office that I used to work at. He only used it every other day so it took him a long time to see results but now he uses it every single day and his hair is thicker and looks good. I get it on amazon for him now bc of prime shipping i get. it&#x27;s not for everyone as some people are complaining about the smell. I sleep next to his head and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad at all. it&#x27;s a mint smell. it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re losing your hair.</li>
            <li> I have used it, it is working exactly as stated in the other reviews by the users. if you use it your hair fall will increase and no way to control it. do not buy.</li>
            <li> Works very nicely when you use it for a longer time with patience.&lt;br /&gt;Natural oils in it calm the scalp nicely, you feel stronger hair in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this almost a year now and all I can say is that it works. Some people think that revivogen will magically reverse you hair on it&#x27;s own. You are wrong. What this product does is that it keeps your hair from getting any worse. It will gain a little bit so if you have thin hair, using revivogen alone will keep your hair gain a little but you will not go to a much worse state. That&#x27;s what is does and does it best. So use revivogen with other products. That is the secret. Minoxidil grows thicker hair but like revivogen it will not work by itself bec of DHT. Same thing with revivogen. It reacts with DHT but doesnt make hair thicker faster. So use minox with revivogen and nizoral shampoo to get results.</li>
