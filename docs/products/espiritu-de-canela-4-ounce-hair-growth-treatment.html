            <li> Before starting this product I had thin edges due to tension from braids and while using this product, My edges fell out and was left with a bald edges. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. This is my personal experience. It might have worked magic for others, but definitely did not work at all for me and it also burns the scalp.</li>
            <li> It does work!!!! Must be patient to see results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me,and I think my hair is falling off more than before using this,so I will not recommend it  because doesn&#x27;t work.. BURN YOUR SCALP..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it came super super quick in the mailI&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again&lt;br /&gt;Smooches</li>
            <li> The item was what I expect and it was received timely.</li>
            <li> I like this product does have a tingle on the scalp after about 2minutes. But it&#x27;s pretty good I used for 2weeks and I think it woke up my edges. I stopped using only because im expecting and don&#x27;t know how safe it is as of right now. But overall pretty good product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and seeing results already. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It is a good product would buy it again</li>
            <li> Super Quick Delivery....Product received as described in posting. Product works great. My hair has become so much healthier since I started using this product years ago. Every person I recommend it to, has also seen great results.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a month on my thin edges and it truly works. Life-saver for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is actually made in my country. I am Dominican, and I have been using this product for years. It is good for hair and nail fungus. It also helps your hair grow. It is very strong, so I recommend you use it with a cotton ball by applying it only on the thinning areas. You can also mix it with your shampoo or clear nail polish. The instructions say to rinse it out after ten minutes, I usually leave it on over night. Its an inexpensive product with great benefits.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with very scarse eye brows I have been applying it on eyebrows for at leat 4 wks and they are now full Wow! and I apply it to the root of my hair under my braids and I see a lot of growth and it has actually lighten the collor of my hair. This product  is awsome  and fresh smelling  and I love the tinkling sensation will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I recently brought this product and have used it once so I actually cannot rate the product at this time. However, I was wondering whether it is supposed to be put in before or after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Just purchased. I have hair past my bra strap but poor edges. Hoping this will help to stimulate my growth. I will write another review a month from now.</li>
            <li> works as advertised, helps strengthening hair</li>
            <li> Great product. Would order again.</li>
