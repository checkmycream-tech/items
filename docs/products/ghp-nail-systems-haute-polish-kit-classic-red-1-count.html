            <li>Everyone is happy here</li>
            <li>I thought &amp;#34;wow what a great idea&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with my shiney perfect nails!  </li>
            <li>It was a gift and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The not so good part is the polish.  </li>
            <li>SOUNDS TO GOOD</li>
            <li>it is much more than advertised!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I invested in this!</li>
            <li>AMAZING THAT THE COMPANY CAN GET AWAY WITH MAKING</li>
            <li>do my own and if I must say so  myself</li>
            <li>I did 3 coats and still did not get a nice color.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Haute Gel Nail system through Amazon and am extremely happy with the product and the quick delivery of this item from Amazon.</li>
            <li>After a 25 minute wait on hold, a very pleasant young woman assured me that she would &amp;#34;remove me as a member of the club&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>lol ;-).</li>
            <li>I liked it because it made my nails strong while I was wearing it</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments today.  </li>
            <li>While I agree that it does take longer to set than they claim I still love the results.</li>
            <li>Like it, but wish it had more polish in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not giving them one more dime.</li>
            <li>Color selection could be much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought off of Amazon instead of being tied into a monthly subscription off the website.</li>
            <li>I Love Love</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want them to discontinue the brand or stop making and creating more colors.</li>
            <li>I also then finish off with Scvech (sp) top coat that is also UV cured.</li>
            <li>I  looked into purchasing this item on the Haute web sit, it was about  $40 dollars more then on Amazon.</li>
            <li>this product caused to my healthy nails.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure that you let it cure for 1 minute or</li>
            <li>The color is sheer at best.</li>
            <li>I will agree with the reviewer before me, sheer, at best.</li>
            <li>I also purchased this item from another site but came here as there is more for sale and options, I&#x27;m Christmas shopping for my sister and niece.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to purchase this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>I getting pretty good at it</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions carefully and had excellent results.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need the removal packs because polish peels off ever so easily...</li>
            <li>No chemical smells easy for her to use .</li>
            <li>This polish DOES come off as easy as stated IF you follow directions.</li>
            <li>It dries more quickly than SensatioNail, which required about five minutes to cure even after applying the LED light and finishing wipe.  </li>
            <li>I find the light to work fine.</li>
            <li>what that means is, no ridge fillers needed, your nails are smooth, smooth, smooth.</li>
            <li>And the UV light hurts your finger nails.</li>
            <li>It dries the polish in the time the light allows and turns itself off.  </li>
            <li>Cheap product.</li>
            <li>the light does not turn on.  </li>
            <li>: Cure under the light for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe substitute another brand of polish but still use the light??</li>
            <li>I got very nervous reading so many negetive reviews, but glad I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>If you apply 2-3 thin coats without cleaning in between and then clean on final coat you will get perfect results AND perfect color every time.</li>
            <li>This product gives BETTER than salon results when done right.</li>
            <li>love how everything comes with it and for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fairly easy and so much quicker drying with the led light and no smudges!</li>
            <li>I hope to be happy with Haute Polish for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>BUT, I didnt do step #3 which is to clean the nails of the tacky residue.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been able to get 5 days even with using OPI bond aid to help it stick better.  </li>
            <li>Clean nails with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol and a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>Everyone is right!</li>
            <li>I have received compliments on all of them and all after 3 coats have been true to color.</li>
            <li>TO BE TRUE</li>
            <li>If you like the shellac gel polish, I would recommend just buying a powerful UV lamp and trying not to go the cheap route.</li>
            <li>I also washed my hands really well using a nail brush making sure I got around the cuticle area and followed instructions from there.</li>
            <li>Oh one other great thing about gels</li>
            <li>The red Haute Polish is just as shiny as the SensatioNail with the top coat over the polish and also makes my nails strong while it&#x27;s on.  </li>
            <li>Great intentions on her part trying to save me time of having to repaint my nails every few days with your every day nail polish........</li>
            <li>I hope to have continued success with Haute Polish.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t even worth</li>
            <li>Do business with the Haute Polish company at your own financial risk.</li>
            <li>well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1</li>
            <li>Buff to crack shine soak for 10 min, it then literally lifts right off your nails.</li>
            <li>I am trying to do my daughter&#x27;s nails right now</li>
            <li>Polish is really sheer, chips and peels off very easily after couple days.</li>
            <li>Wish I would&#x27;ve had a better experience or just never spent my money on it.</li>
            <li>I have painted my own nails for a long time and have also gone to the salon on occassion.</li>
            <li>The nail dryer light is totally satisfactory because it is an LED light not UV which could cause cancer.  </li>
            <li>It is very shiny and pretty!</li>
            <li>I spoke to a representative who related that I was finished paying the money I owned on their three month payment plan and they would not sent my wife any more products.</li>
            <li>I discovered the extra charges and I was able to cancel the order.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product and tried it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; twenty bucks a month; that is why I ordered this in the first place...</li>
            <li>3: Shake polish well and apply your first coat.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>This particular system has the polish color that does not paint on bold at all.</li>
            <li>Glad to hear that you can apply up to four coats, I only did two.</li>
            <li>The finished polish is shiny and hard so if they provide better colors and make them more opaque, this could be a winner&lt;</li>
            <li>Ordered this online after seeing the infomercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see the fine print -- which doesn&#x27;t show up until the very last part of check-out on the invoice -- that the $14.95 &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; is only the first part of 3 additional monthly payments of $33 each, along with a MONTHLY charge of $19.95 for more shipments of replacement polish.</li>
            <li>A relative purchased the kit for me as a Christmas present since I take good care of my nails.  </li>
            <li>Just remember that all colors are not the same, I have found that the red and pink work the best and are the brightest.  </li>
            <li>The nail polish is comes off way too easy, not like the regular gel polish which lasts for days, even weeks.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that they claim to have a 30 day guarantee, apparently if you purchase it with a coupon or voucher of any kind, that warranty is voided and all sales are final.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;auto ship whether you want it or not club?&amp;#34; I had my credit card decline any future charges and get a strong arm email saying they will ruin my credit rating if I don&#x27;t pay up.</li>
            <li>Use pure acetone polish remover and soak for 15 minutes and it will come off no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you either need more coats or live with the sheer</li>
            <li>It is sheer, but if you do 2 or 3 coats it is just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the other reviews, but I had great results with this product!</li>
            <li>The light is only on for a minute or so, much quicker than a UV light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But since the whole point of buying the kit is to have everything together, there is no point in buying this item at all.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this polish, it also has no offensive odor,</li>
            <li>The blues take another coat or 2 and the light colors are very sheer</li>
            <li>you get ready to take the polish off, don&#x27;t peel it or it will damage your nails.  </li>
            <li>I really like the shine.</li>
            <li>I would suggest saving your money and purchasing the other kits i mentioned, as those are much better quality.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it, then come to find out I did not get the same results as I seen  on TV.  </li>
            <li>It is very cheap, streaky, and just just not worth the money.</li>
            <li>am NOT a professional manicurist, but I sure do like how long a professional manicure lasts and how smooth and neat it looks.  </li>
            <li>I had to apply three coats to get adequate coverage, but the third coat did dry as quickly as the first.  </li>
            <li>If you follow directions it does what it says it does and looks decent.</li>
            <li>YOU WANT THE SALON LOOK, HIGH GLOSS, POLISHED TO PERFECTION</li>
            <li>highly recommend Haute Polish!&lt;br</li>
            <li>at :60 per coat that is only a 15-20 min manicure ;-).I wish it was longer because I just like doing my nails!</li>
            <li>POLISH DOES NOT DRY EASILY, NEEDS SEVERAL COATS</li>
            <li>have even used a different UV light because I was impatient and did not want to do my thumb separately, and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>, I am so pleased with this product, I just pray the bad reviews doesn&#x27;t stop people from trying for themselves and following directions to see how great it is.</li>
            <li>My nails were still wet after drying under the light twice.</li>
            <li>even added to the greatness of this healthy alternative to harsh acetone and chemical nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I mostly like the haute polish system, it did not last as long as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t take 4 coats to get a good color since it is so thin</li>
            <li>and so far I have run her nails through the light five times and her nails still aren&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li>The product  is exactly what I expected and I highly recommend if you are interested in purchasing it, you do so through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Sue</li>
            <li>Then I get the new shipment and see the additional charges on my Visa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LIVE AND LEARN.....</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know why this is getting so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li>Stay away-very far away!</li>
            <li>First of all, I did not purchase this product from Amazon.com, but another retailer at the same price.  </li>
            <li>The pretty purple in the bottle looks a sheer brown</li>
            <li>I will be returning the whole thing and starting over with a decent company.</li>
            <li>The only way I could get it off was to peel it off, which damaged my natural nails a little more each time.  </li>
            <li>I did, however use the Nude color, which is clear.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I didn&#x27;t order from Amazon, rather directly through the company.</li>
            <li>I frequently get shellac manicures and know it&#x27;s something I could do</li>
            <li>After using it for a year, my natural nails were all torn up.  </li>
            <li>My seven year old daughter said, &amp;#34;maybe they should test these things before they sell them.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I received the classic red polish with the kit.  </li>
            <li>The cost of the bottles are very very comparable to other gels I was buying.</li>
            <li>, my nails were shiny, and it dried quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had a professional manicure prior to my &#x27;home&#x27; gel application</li>
            <li>After letting my natural nails heal,  I just got the Haute Polish starter kit, which came with red polish.  </li>
            <li>I was an idiot &amp; didn&#x27;t read the fine print, never thinking I was going to be charged more money.</li>
            <li>I bought the whole kit and spent about $70!</li>
            <li>I have other gel kits and they require so much time and my nails became so brittle they cracked</li>
            <li>The light is very small</li>
            <li>Thanks but no thanks!</li>
            <li>and I cook, clean, work (lots of typing), shower, exercise and all kinds of hard on a manicure activities</li>
            <li>I purchased the system through Living Social</li>
            <li>so much I threw out ALL my other polishes and gels and will only be using this from now on.</li>
            <li>It was quicker to apply than SensatioNail, since there&#x27;s only one step, lasted about as long (10 days), but came off just like it was supposed to without damaging my natural nails!  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, the polish peeled off in sheets within a few days.</li>
            <li>The coat is very sheer and the LED light is not good.</li>
            <li>It did take two coats for full coverage, but that&#x27;s still fewer steps than the SensatioNail system, which requires a base coat and a top coat, besides the polish coat(s) itself.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great intentions on her part trying to save me time of having to repaint my nails every few days with your every day nail polish........</li>
            <li> I hope to have continued success with Haute Polish.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t even worth</li>
            <li> Do business with the Haute Polish company at your own financial risk.</li>
            <li> well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1</li>
            <li> Buff to crack shine soak for 10 min, it then literally lifts right off your nails.</li>
            <li> I am trying to do my daughter&#x27;s nails right now</li>
            <li> Polish is really sheer, chips and peels off very easily after couple days.</li>
            <li> Wish I would&#x27;ve had a better experience or just never spent my money on it.</li>
            <li> I have painted my own nails for a long time and have also gone to the salon on occassion.</li>
            <li> The nail dryer light is totally satisfactory because it is an LED light not UV which could cause cancer.  </li>
            <li> It is very shiny and pretty!</li>
            <li> I spoke to a representative who related that I was finished paying the money I owned on their three month payment plan and they would not sent my wife any more products.</li>
            <li> I discovered the extra charges and I was able to cancel the order.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product and tried it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; twenty bucks a month; that is why I ordered this in the first place...</li>
            <li> 3: Shake polish well and apply your first coat.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> This particular system has the polish color that does not paint on bold at all.</li>
            <li> Glad to hear that you can apply up to four coats, I only did two.</li>
            <li> The finished polish is shiny and hard so if they provide better colors and make them more opaque, this could be a winner&lt;</li>
            <li> Ordered this online after seeing the infomercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see the fine print -- which doesn&#x27;t show up until the very last part of check-out on the invoice -- that the $14.95 &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; is only the first part of 3 additional monthly payments of $33 each, along with a MONTHLY charge of $19.95 for more shipments of replacement polish.</li>
            <li> A relative purchased the kit for me as a Christmas present since I take good care of my nails.  </li>
            <li> Just remember that all colors are not the same, I have found that the red and pink work the best and are the brightest.  </li>
            <li> The nail polish is comes off way too easy, not like the regular gel polish which lasts for days, even weeks.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that they claim to have a 30 day guarantee, apparently if you purchase it with a coupon or voucher of any kind, that warranty is voided and all sales are final.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;auto ship whether you want it or not club?&amp;#34; I had my credit card decline any future charges and get a strong arm email saying they will ruin my credit rating if I don&#x27;t pay up.</li>
            <li> Use pure acetone polish remover and soak for 15 minutes and it will come off no problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you either need more coats or live with the sheer</li>
            <li> It is sheer, but if you do 2 or 3 coats it is just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the other reviews, but I had great results with this product!</li>
            <li> The light is only on for a minute or so, much quicker than a UV light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But since the whole point of buying the kit is to have everything together, there is no point in buying this item at all.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this polish, it also has no offensive odor,</li>
            <li> The blues take another coat or 2 and the light colors are very sheer</li>
            <li> you get ready to take the polish off, don&#x27;t peel it or it will damage your nails.  </li>
            <li> I really like the shine.</li>
            <li> I would suggest saving your money and purchasing the other kits i mentioned, as those are much better quality.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it, then come to find out I did not get the same results as I seen  on TV.  </li>
            <li> It is very cheap, streaky, and just just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> am NOT a professional manicurist, but I sure do like how long a professional manicure lasts and how smooth and neat it looks.  </li>
            <li> I had to apply three coats to get adequate coverage, but the third coat did dry as quickly as the first.  </li>
            <li> If you follow directions it does what it says it does and looks decent.</li>
            <li> YOU WANT THE SALON LOOK, HIGH GLOSS, POLISHED TO PERFECTION</li>
            <li> highly recommend Haute Polish!&lt;br</li>
            <li> at :60 per coat that is only a 15-20 min manicure ;-).I wish it was longer because I just like doing my nails!</li>
            <li> POLISH DOES NOT DRY EASILY, NEEDS SEVERAL COATS</li>
            <li> have even used a different UV light because I was impatient and did not want to do my thumb separately, and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> , I am so pleased with this product, I just pray the bad reviews doesn&#x27;t stop people from trying for themselves and following directions to see how great it is.</li>
            <li> My nails were still wet after drying under the light twice.</li>
            <li> even added to the greatness of this healthy alternative to harsh acetone and chemical nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I mostly like the haute polish system, it did not last as long as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t take 4 coats to get a good color since it is so thin</li>
            <li> and so far I have run her nails through the light five times and her nails still aren&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> The product  is exactly what I expected and I highly recommend if you are interested in purchasing it, you do so through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Sue</li>
            <li> Then I get the new shipment and see the additional charges on my Visa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LIVE AND LEARN.....</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why this is getting so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Stay away-very far away!</li>
            <li> First of all, I did not purchase this product from Amazon.com, but another retailer at the same price.  </li>
            <li> The pretty purple in the bottle looks a sheer brown</li>
            <li> I will be returning the whole thing and starting over with a decent company.</li>
            <li> The only way I could get it off was to peel it off, which damaged my natural nails a little more each time.  </li>
            <li> I did, however use the Nude color, which is clear.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I didn&#x27;t order from Amazon, rather directly through the company.</li>
            <li> I frequently get shellac manicures and know it&#x27;s something I could do</li>
            <li> After using it for a year, my natural nails were all torn up.  </li>
            <li> My seven year old daughter said, &amp;#34;maybe they should test these things before they sell them.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received the classic red polish with the kit.  </li>
            <li> The cost of the bottles are very very comparable to other gels I was buying.</li>
            <li> , my nails were shiny, and it dried quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had a professional manicure prior to my &#x27;home&#x27; gel application</li>
            <li> After letting my natural nails heal,  I just got the Haute Polish starter kit, which came with red polish.  </li>
            <li> I was an idiot &amp; didn&#x27;t read the fine print, never thinking I was going to be charged more money.</li>
            <li> I bought the whole kit and spent about $70!</li>
            <li> I have other gel kits and they require so much time and my nails became so brittle they cracked</li>
            <li> The light is very small</li>
            <li> Thanks but no thanks!</li>
            <li> and I cook, clean, work (lots of typing), shower, exercise and all kinds of hard on a manicure activities</li>
            <li> I purchased the system through Living Social</li>
            <li> so much I threw out ALL my other polishes and gels and will only be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> It was quicker to apply than SensatioNail, since there&#x27;s only one step, lasted about as long (10 days), but came off just like it was supposed to without damaging my natural nails!  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, the polish peeled off in sheets within a few days.</li>
            <li> The coat is very sheer and the LED light is not good.</li>
            <li> It did take two coats for full coverage, but that&#x27;s still fewer steps than the SensatioNail system, which requires a base coat and a top coat, besides the polish coat(s) itself.  </li>
            <li> The UV light that comes in the kits is small, which is fine for me, but it is very very very weak!</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying all the colors, so far I have tried, Shy, Punch, Merlot, Tangerine, and True</li>
            <li> minutes, not 5-10 like the instructions say; to get the coating loose enough to &amp;#34;peel away&amp;#34; from the nail.  </li>
            <li> : Apply another coat of polish and repeat steps 4 &amp; 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 or 4 coats the color is very vibrant and you should not have a problem with the polish staying on for at least 1 &amp; 1/2  to 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> That stupid little light does not work and the polish runs off your nail before you even get it to the lil light.  </li>
            <li> AND THERE IS NO PROFESSIONAL LOOK ABOUT THE APPEARANCE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buff all of the shine off your nails, NO clear coat needed for this polish.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> I was going to give this a FAIL, because I thought it didnt dry, after using the light 2-3 times, and read that someone else had that issue.  </li>
            <li> Each coat needs a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> Some users claimed their polish didn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> I needed to put my fingers on the LED a lot of time to get my nails dry.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t dry in one setting like promised.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not excellent, but certainly not bad.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT LIVE UP TO ANY OF ITS CLAIMS!</li>
            <li> I was attracted to the fact that the kit had everything from the base / color / top coat and even lamp!</li>
            <li> I chose a lighter shade and did use two coats and spend hardly any time getting professional nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It took a few days longer, but it chipped within the week and by day ten all the nails were losing the polish in sheets.</li>
            <li> So, the company has absolutely no accountability here.</li>
            <li> The $14.95 &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; turned out to be a ruse to get your purchase then to charge you an additional $33 per month until you have spent $150+.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just spent another 30 min.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time doesn&#x27;t work and when I tried sending it back</li>
            <li> Regular nail polish requires a base coat, one or two polish coats and one or two top coats.  </li>
            <li> On average it takes me a few hours to apply and dry regular polish.  </li>
            <li> PLAIN AND SIMPLE  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I purchased this kit through Groupon.</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !&lt;</li>
            <li> I wrote them again to say that I was unhappy with the product and wanted a full refund, as listed on their website.</li>
            <li> Other gels still have to be scraped and buffed off causing nail damage sometimes.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews, my polish dried with a single session</li>
            <li> I watched the video and read the instructions carefully, and tried it again being careful to use only thin layers.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other gel kits out there, don&#x27;t waste your money with this one.</li>
            <li> I have read so many bad reveiws from people not following directions that it makes me sad.</li>
            <li> I disputed the credit card charge &amp; thought this mess was over.</li>
            <li> Yes, I did have to cure my nails a little longer than the one minute......big deal.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The polish chips off after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Haute polish takes a few minutes to apply three coats.  </li>
            <li> The polish stays on for maybe a few hours and then peels off.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a tee, and it just plain does not do what the company says it</li>
            <li> The problem with that is the end coat becomes so thick that after a few hrs it begins to lift.</li>
            <li> Shy and Sugar White</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed, but I read the instructions again</li>
            <li> Mine usually lasts about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> The colors are extremely dull, not shiny</li>
            <li> This product sucks do not order.  </li>
            <li> hold for 15 minutes and talked with a rude customer service agent who said &amp;#34;the information is on your invoice</li>
            <li> I hate this so much.</li>
            <li> Annoyed by the talking while my nails dried, would not cut off.</li>
            <li> the damage from just the short time it was on my nails was so horrible that I had to leave my nails bare for a week, treating them with Vitamin E oil every day to heal them from the damage.  </li>
            <li> this product is no good.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible and not even worth a penny.</li>
            <li> I have tried other at home gel kits, such as SensationNail and Sally Hensen, compared to those, this kit is HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Colors are not attractive at all.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have tried it over and over again, thinking maybe I am doing it wrong, but no, this product really sucks.</li>
            <li> The fact that my wife was not happy with the product is an understatement, but when they continue to charge my credit card for products I did not order brings it to another level.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off.</li>
            <li> but I did return the kit based on the poor color coverage.</li>
            <li> Nail polish color is thin.</li>
            <li> It gets worse.....</li>
            <li> THESE FALSE CLAIMS!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wrote to the company to ask them if I was doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> &quot; You will hate this kit, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The products arrived in deplorable condition-several broken polish bottles.</li>
            <li> But it was difficult to remove, as it didn&#x27;t come off with nail polish remover like it said it would.  </li>
            <li> , I explained I was unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> They almost look fake!</li>
            <li> , COLOURS ARE VERY FAINT, YOUR NAILS WILL START TO PEEL</li>
            <li> What didn&#x27;t fall or peel off was almost impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> I am beyond frustrated.  </li>
            <li> These people are awful!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a TERRIBLE company.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> The polish quality is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> oh now this was the best buy I&#x27;ve already saved over $100 dollars it costs about $20 for a gel manicure plus they charge to take off .I do my own and if I must say so  myself I getting pretty good at it</li>
            <li> Polish is really sheer, chips and peels off very easily after couple days. Tried several times with three of them. Doesn&#x27;t matter. Chipped, peeled. Colors are not attractive at all.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she loved it.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I got very nervous reading so many negetive reviews, but glad I gave it a try.  I did, however use the Nude color, which is clear.  So being shear is not a problem.  I will try a color next.  I was going to give this a FAIL, because I thought it didnt dry, after using the light 2-3 times, and read that someone else had that issue.  BUT, I didnt do step #3 which is to clean the nails of the tacky residue.  I was so pleased with my shiney perfect nails!  I have gotten many compliments today.  I hope to have continued success with Haute Polish.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I purchased this kit through Groupon. I have tried other at home gel kits, such as SensationNail and Sally Hensen, compared to those, this kit is HORRIBLE! It is very cheap, streaky, and just just not worth the money. The nail polish is comes off way too easy, not like the regular gel polish which lasts for days, even weeks. I would suggest saving your money and purchasing the other kits i mentioned, as those are much better quality.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! I bought this from the actual website. It is a waste of money. The polish DOES NOT last 14 days, it comes off in about 2 days. The colors are extremely dull, not shiny like they advertise. I have tried it over and over again, thinking maybe I am doing it wrong, but no, this product really sucks. And the UV light hurts your finger nails. Oh and beware that you will be billed 19.99$ a month and will receive polish every 3 months. So you are paying about 20$ per polish. If you actually like this piece of junk and want to buy polish, you can buy if for 12$.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but just feel the need to with this product.  I bought the whole kit and spent about $70! I was so excited to get it, then come to find out I did not get the same results as I seen  on TV.  Everyone is right! The colors are extremely sheer, you need 3-4 coats to get some color. The problem with that is the end coat becomes so thick that after a few hrs it begins to lift. You don&#x27;t even need the removal packs because polish peels off ever so easily... I just wish I would have listened to the reviews.  But i told myself that perhaps they just had a &amp;#34;bad one,&amp;#34;  but NO... this product is no good. Wish I would&#x27;ve had a better experience or just never spent my money on it.</li>
            <li> This product sucks do not order.  That stupid little light does not work and the polish runs off your nail before you even get it to the lil light.  I would never order this again it wasn&#x27;t even worth me shipping back I just threw it in the trash</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT LIVE UP TO ANY OF ITS CLAIMS! TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY !&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU WANT THE SALON LOOK, HIGH GLOSS, POLISHED TO PERFECTION YOU WILL NOT GET IT WITH THIS PRODUCT. POLISH DOES NOT DRY EASILY, NEEDS SEVERAL COATS , COLOURS ARE VERY FAINT, YOUR NAILS WILL START TO PEEL ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND THERE IS NO PROFESSIONAL LOOK ABOUT THE APPEARANCE.&lt;br /&gt;ITS AMAZING THAT THE COMPANY CAN GET AWAY WITH MAKING THESE FALSE CLAIMS!&lt;br /&gt;STICK WITH YOUR SALON, THIS SYSTEM IS NOT THE ANSWER.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to purchase this product and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The first time I tried it, the polish peeled off in sheets within a few days. I watched the video and read the instructions carefully, and tried it again being careful to use only thin layers. It took a few days longer, but it chipped within the week and by day ten all the nails were losing the polish in sheets. I wrote to the company to ask them if I was doing something wrong. They ignored me. I wrote them again to say that I was unhappy with the product and wanted a full refund, as listed on their website. Despite the fact that they claim to have a 30 day guarantee, apparently if you purchase it with a coupon or voucher of any kind, that warranty is voided and all sales are final. I called to speak to customer service and after a 20 minute wait on the phone, I explained I was unhappy with the product. The CS rep told me to watch the video, I told her I had. She asked me to watch it again. She repeated this three times. She said all sales are final. So, the company has absolutely no accountability here. They sell a defective product that does not work as advertised and then say \\&quot;all sales final.\\&quot; You will hate this kit, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> While I agree that it does take longer to set than they claim I still love the results. Is it salon quality? Of course not. Why, because I AM NOT. A salon quality nail technician.</li>
            <li> They say you can get 2 weeks of wear out of this polish.  So far I have been able to get 5 days even with using OPI bond aid to help it stick better.  I like it a lot.  I wish it didn&#x27;t take 4 coats to get a good color since it is so thin and I wish it lasted longer than 5 days.</li>
            <li> Like it, but wish it had more polish in the bottle.  I have to use three to four coats to get the color I want.</li>
            <li> I had cancelled this company&#x27;s services and requested that they not sent my wife any products. In March 2014 I seen that I was charged again by the Haute Polish company so I contacted them by phone. I spoke to a representative who related that I was finished paying the money I owned on their three month payment plan and they would not sent my wife any more products. I was left with the impression that I was to receive a refund. Yet when I checked my account information the following month (April 2014) I found that I have an additional charge on my account. I will never do business with this company again.The fact that my wife was not happy with the product is an understatement, but when they continue to charge my credit card for products I did not order brings it to another level. Do business with the Haute Polish company at your own financial risk. My wife said she would not recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it would give me the beautiful nails I&#x27;ve always wanted. Nope! The polish chips off after a few hours. I read and then reread the directions and tried it several times again. Same result. This product is horrible and not even worth a penny.</li>
            <li> I never got to try the product, which was ordered through their website.  They use deceptive advertising in their infomercial and on their website.  The $14.95 &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; turned out to be a ruse to get your purchase then to charge you an additional $33 per month until you have spent $150+.  In addition, when I looked at my sales receipt, it said they would send me a 90-day supply of polish AUTOMATICALLY, to the tune of $19.95 PER MONTH.  Thankfully, they are so inefficient, they had not shipped the kit out at the point I discovered the extra charges and I was able to cancel the order.  These people are awful!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift. Even with the polishes from the system, that are supposed to be &amp;#34;specially formulated&amp;#34; to work with this lamp, the polishes either did not cure at all or cured, but then peeled off within a day or two. I tried those same polishes from the system with a different lamp and had no problems. But since the whole point of buying the kit is to have everything together, there is no point in buying this item at all. There are plenty of other gel kits out there, don&#x27;t waste your money with this one.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off. I have to say, I didn&#x27;t order from Amazon, rather directly through the company. The products arrived in deplorable condition-several broken polish bottles. The quality was extremely poor, the curing light was a joke. In no way did this polish last a week, let alone 10 days. What didn&#x27;t fall or peel off was almost impossible to remove. I followed the instructions to a tee, and it just plain does not do what the company says it will.&lt;br /&gt;Follow up with customer no-service was also a joke. After a 25 minute wait on hold, a very pleasant young woman assured me that she would &amp;#34;remove me as a member of the club&amp;#34;. What club?  The &amp;#34;auto ship whether you want it or not club?&amp;#34; I had my credit card decline any future charges and get a strong arm email saying they will ruin my credit rating if I don&#x27;t pay up. I&#x27;m not giving them one more dime. This is a total rip off, and I wish I had done my research before ordering. Stay away-very far away!</li>
            <li> Bought this product and tried it for the first time today.  The nail dryer light is totally satisfactory because it is an LED light not UV which could cause cancer.  It dries the polish in the time the light allows and turns itself off.  Some users claimed their polish didn&#x27;t dry but I don&#x27;t think they removed the tacky film with the finisher provided.  The light is only on for a minute or so, much quicker than a UV light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not so good part is the polish.  The colors I tried were shiny but very sheer.  I had to apply three coats to get adequate coverage, but the third coat did dry as quickly as the first.  Color selection could be much better.  My kit did not include any base/top coat, just the polish which is why they say &amp;#34;one step&amp;#34;.  Regular nail polish requires a base coat, one or two polish coats and one or two top coats.  Each coat needs a long time to dry.  On average it takes me a few hours to apply and dry regular polish.  Haute polish takes a few minutes to apply three coats.  For me it&#x27;s a no brainer.  The finished polish is shiny and hard so if they provide better colors and make them more opaque, this could be a winner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> The infomercial was so alluring but when it arrived I was unsure but tried it.  I have other gel kits and they require so much time and my nails became so brittle they cracked so I purchased Haute polish and it is much more than advertised! I chose a lighter shade and did use two coats and spend hardly any time getting professional nails.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Haute Polish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The complements I received even added to the greatness of this healthy alternative to harsh acetone and chemical nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this system however the polish went on very very sheer and streaky. I did 3 coats and still did not get a nice color. Unlike other reviews, my polish dried with a single session but you definitely need to do step 3 to remove sticky residue.  The light is very small and I had to do my thumbs separately which wasn&#x27;t a big issue but I did return the kit based on the poor color coverage.</li>
            <li> I was an idiot &amp; didn&#x27;t read the fine print, never thinking I was going to be charged more money. I disputed the credit card charge &amp; thought this mess was over. It wasn&#x27;t. They charged my card again. This is a TERRIBLE company. I&#x27;ve just spent another 30 min. on the phone w/them &amp; my credit card co. Don&#x27;t get caught in their trap. They have no compunction about charging your card!</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why this is getting so many bad reviews. I love it! It&#x27;s not excellent, but certainly not bad. If you follow directions it does what it says it does and looks decent. It is sheer, but if you do 2 or 3 coats it is just fine. I would recommend this product no problem. It is fairly easy and so much quicker drying with the led light and no smudges! It is very shiny and pretty! I&#x27;m glad I bought off of Amazon instead of being tied into a monthly subscription off the website. I also bought 2 extra colors from Amazon. Shy and Sugar White so I can attempt a french manicure.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife, her nails look and feel great .She is very happy I got this for her. She loves it. No chemical smells easy for her to use . Everyone is happy here</li>
            <li> Horrible. My nails were still wet after drying under the light twice. Nail polish color is thin. Cheap product. Please save your money.</li>
            <li> I Love Love Love this nail polish so much I threw out ALL my other polishes and gels and will only be using this from now on. The cost of the bottles are very very comparable to other gels I was buying. I have painted my own nails for a long time and have also gone to the salon on occassion. This product gives BETTER than salon results when done right. I have read so many bad reveiws from people not following directions that it makes me sad. I don&#x27;t want them to discontinue the brand or stop making and creating more colors. If you apply 2-3 thin coats without cleaning in between and then clean on final coat you will get perfect results AND perfect color every time. I also then finish off with Scvech (sp) top coat that is also UV cured. Just added protection. The results are shine and polish that last for 10-14 days unless I opt to change. This polish DOES come off as easy as stated IF you follow directions. Buff to crack shine soak for 10 min, it then literally lifts right off your nails. Other gels still have to be scraped and buffed off causing nail damage sometimes. I really, really like this polish, it also has no offensive odor, something my husband noticed, lol ;-). Oh one other great thing about gels, it&#x27;s self leveling and what that means is, no ridge fillers needed, your nails are smooth, smooth, smooth. They almost look fake! Well I could go on forever, I am so pleased with this product, I just pray the bad reviews doesn&#x27;t stop people from trying for themselves and following directions to see how great it is. I look forward to trying all the colors, so far I have tried, Shy, Punch, Merlot, Tangerine, and True I have received compliments on all of them and all after 3 coats have been true to color. at :60 per coat that is only a 15-20 min manicure ;-).I wish it was longer because I just like doing my nails!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Haute Gel Nail system through Amazon and am extremely happy with the product and the quick delivery of this item from Amazon. I  looked into purchasing this item on the Haute web sit, it was about  $40 dollars more then on Amazon. The product  is exactly what I expected and I highly recommend if you are interested in purchasing it, you do so through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Sue Ryan</li>
            <li> I find the light to work fine. The polish and the way they want to sneak and steal from you with that auto enroll for the polish is so horrid. This is the last thing I will ever order from an infomercial. I hate this so much. I don&#x27;t have an &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; twenty bucks a month; that is why I ordered this in the first place...I just hope I can cancel.</li>
            <li> A relative purchased the kit for me as a Christmas present since I take good care of my nails.  Great intentions on her part trying to save me time of having to repaint my nails every few days with your every day nail polish........I thought &amp;#34;wow what a great idea&amp;#34;....well ha, the colors come out sheer or transparent, even after applying three coats.  I did one hand just to try it out.  It gets worse.....not liking how the colors were only sheer I decided to remove the product; following the instructions for removal, it was painstaking to sit for &amp;#34;20&amp;#34; minutes, not 5-10 like the instructions say; to get the coating loose enough to &amp;#34;peel away&amp;#34; from the nail.  I had to scrape the product off my nails and the damage from just the short time it was on my nails was so horrible that I had to leave my nails bare for a week, treating them with Vitamin E oil every day to heal them from the damage.  I would rather go back to buying my $5-10 nail polishes and spend 15-20 minutes removing simple nail polish every couple of days than the pain-stake process and damage this product caused to my healthy nails.  Thanks but no thanks!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time doesn&#x27;t work and when I tried sending it back they refused to give my money back. Through dealer.</li>
            <li> The polish stays on for maybe a few hours and then peels off.  This product also charges over and over and over to your credit card. I have fought with them to cancel it and finally had to call my credit card to not allow charges to go through</li>
            <li> Ordered this online after seeing the infomercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see the fine print -- which doesn&#x27;t show up until the very last part of check-out on the invoice -- that the $14.95 &amp;#34;special&amp;#34; is only the first part of 3 additional monthly payments of $33 each, along with a MONTHLY charge of $19.95 for more shipments of replacement polish. (Who in the world uses that much?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it yet, since it was ordered just before the holidays. Hadn&#x27;t even opened the box. Then I get the new shipment and see the additional charges on my Visa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately tried to call their customer service number on the website -- it&#x27;s not functional. Sent an email. They responded with a different number: 1-888-793-7474&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On hold for 15 minutes and talked with a rude customer service agent who said &amp;#34;the information is on your invoice, we cannot stop the charges or take the product back.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total scam.</li>
            <li> I am beyond frustrated.  I purchased the system through Living Social and it took TWO MONTHS to be delivered.  I finally just got at it and the light does not turn on.  I will be returning the whole thing and starting over with a decent company.</li>
            <li> First of all, I did not purchase this product from Amazon.com, but another retailer at the same price.  I received the classic red polish with the kit.  At first I was disappointed, but I read the instructions again and it said you could apply multiple coats.  The kit is time consuming, but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Wash hands thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Buff all of the shine off your nails, NO clear coat needed for this polish.&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Shake polish well and apply your first coat.&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: Cure under the light for 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;Step 5: Clean nails with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol and a cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;Step 6: Apply another coat of polish and repeat steps 4 &amp; 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 or 4 coats the color is very vibrant and you should not have a problem with the polish staying on for at least 1 &amp; 1/2  to 2 weeks.  Mine usually lasts about 2 weeks and I cook, clean, work (lots of typing), shower, exercise and all kinds of hard on a manicure activities and it stays on strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take me a couple of times to get the hang of getting the polish on even.  Just remember that all colors are not the same, I have found that the red and pink work the best and are the brightest.  The blues take another coat or 2 and the light colors are very sheer and you either need more coats or live with the sheer look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even used a different UV light because I was impatient and did not want to do my thumb separately, and it worked just fine. Just make sure that you let it cure for 1 minute or it won&#x27;t set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get ready to take the polish off, don&#x27;t peel it or it will damage your nails.  Use pure acetone polish remover and soak for 15 minutes and it will come off no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am NOT a professional manicurist, but I sure do like how long a professional manicure lasts and how smooth and neat it looks.  I also like to be frugal when I can and using this kit has saved me lots of time and money.</li>
            <li> The coat is very sheer and the LED light is not good. I needed to put my fingers on the LED a lot of time to get my nails dry.</li>
            <li> I mostly like the haute polish system, it did not last as long as advertised.  It is longer than regular nail polish.  I really like the shine. Annoyed by the talking while my nails dried, would not cut off.</li>
            <li> PLAIN AND SIMPLE  WHAT A RIP OFF.  LIVE AND LEARN.....SOUNDS TO GOOD TO BE TRUE IT IS.</li>
            <li> I bought the GHP Nail Systems Shellac kit on a Groupon for thirty bucks. I always get shellac in the salon and now see the kits at the store. I was attracted to the fact that the kit had everything from the base / color / top coat and even lamp! This particular system has the polish color that does not paint on bold at all. The color is sheer at best. The UV light that comes in the kits is small, which is fine for me, but it is very very very weak! I had to leave my nails in it three times the recommended time and it took me about an hour to get all the coats on. If you like the shellac gel polish, I would recommend just buying a powerful UV lamp and trying not to go the cheap route.</li>
            <li> I also bought this with a Groupon for $30. I frequently get shellac manicures and know it&#x27;s something I could do myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how everything comes with it and for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as directed I did thin coats and only needed to put them under the light for 2 minutes as directed. I will agree with the reviewer before me, sheer, at best. The polish quality is horrible. The pretty purple in the bottle looks a sheer brown almost with 2+ coats and now I&#x27;m stuck with it for 3 weeks. Fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe substitute another brand of polish but still use the light??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the other reviews, but I had great results with this product! Looks just like how my nails look after I visit the salon. I am so glad I invested in this!</li>
            <li> I also purchased this item from another site but came here as there is more for sale and options, I&#x27;m Christmas shopping for my sister and niece. I followed the instructions carefully and had excellent results. Yes, I did have to cure my nails a little longer than the one minute......big deal. I am in the comfort of my home and and saving lots of money while I watch TV. I&#x27;ve had my gels now for five days and NO PEELING. For those whose gels are peeling I can only say you are NOT followlng the instructions. Glad to hear that you can apply up to four coats, I only did two. What I did is I had a professional manicure prior to my &#x27;home&#x27; gel application, I cannot remove the cuticle like they do. I also washed my hands really well using a nail brush making sure I got around the cuticle area and followed instructions from there.</li>
            <li> I was using the SensatioNail gel polish system before.  I liked it because it made my nails strong while I was wearing it, my nails were shiny, and it dried quickly.  But it was difficult to remove, as it didn&#x27;t come off with nail polish remover like it said it would.  The only way I could get it off was to peel it off, which damaged my natural nails a little more each time.  After using it for a year, my natural nails were all torn up.  After letting my natural nails heal,  I just got the Haute Polish starter kit, which came with red polish.  It was quicker to apply than SensatioNail, since there&#x27;s only one step, lasted about as long (10 days), but came off just like it was supposed to without damaging my natural nails!  It did take two coats for full coverage, but that&#x27;s still fewer steps than the SensatioNail system, which requires a base coat and a top coat, besides the polish coat(s) itself.  The red Haute Polish is just as shiny as the SensatioNail with the top coat over the polish and also makes my nails strong while it&#x27;s on.  It dries more quickly than SensatioNail, which required about five minutes to cure even after applying the LED light and finishing wipe.  I hope to be happy with Haute Polish for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a kit along with several additional polish colors.  The product doesn&#x27;t dry in one setting like promised.  I am trying to do my daughter&#x27;s nails right now and so far I have run her nails through the light five times and her nails still aren&#x27;t dry.  The color is VERY sheer although I&#x27;ve only done one coat.  I won&#x27;t have the patience for another coat.  My seven year old daughter said, &amp;#34;maybe they should test these things before they sell them.&amp;#34;</li>
