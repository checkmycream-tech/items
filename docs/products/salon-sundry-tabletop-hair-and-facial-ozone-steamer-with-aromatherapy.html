            <li>The product works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It steamed VERY good and shut off once the water reached the min line and sounded a alarm.</li>
            <li>The product seemed like a great buy, but i noticed that the hood was cracked when I opened the box.</li>

            <li>I love my hydration machine..</li>
            <li>Love Love Love my steamer</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok I can manage with what it does do.  </li>
            <li>but the owner is in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to follow the directions step by step.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, my curls were more defined after the steaming.  </li>
            <li>I wish before I purchased this item that more reviews were posted</li>
            <li>Hopefully w/ many uses it corrects my problems - danduff and dryness.</li>
            <li>But I love it</li>
            <li>so I think the steamer has really done my hair some good.  </li>
            <li>I originally was going to say it was okay.</li>
            <li>it is easy to assemble however</li>
            <li>Please save your self time and money and do not purchase this cheap product.</li>
            <li>This place are selling products that are cheap and they are a scam.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the facial part is just as great.</li>
            <li>Everything about this product was cheap.  </li>
            <li>even cheaper made than the cheap price.</li>
            <li>would love a more durable water cup as I really wanted to steam my hair, but don&#x27;t want boiling water leaking everywhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my new hair steamer it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased w/ what i have seen so far.</li>
            <li>Would have given it 5 stars if there were instructions on how to use and what to use to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>was pretty easy to set up and use.  </li>
            <li>Also, the company who sells this product shipped it out to me quickly.  </li>
            <li>They were quick in getting one out to me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>Quick shipping from seller.  </li>
            <li>As happened to me the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This was worth the purchase it does give off a burst of steam that maybe to hot</li>
            <li>Overall i am very pleased and love it my hair, which im a naturlista, wasnt as dry as it had been before using this.</li>
            <li>I was noticing some good changes in my hair (4A/B) and felt the product was decent but with the major complaint that though the product didn&#x27;t come with good set up instructions, as everyone else had pointed out, it needed to come with warnings and cautions and maintenance directions.</li>
            <li>steam was not too hot, I was very comfortable the entire time I was steaming my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After about 20 minutes the machine started to beep,</li>
            <li>would like for it to hit MORE of the back of my hair</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE the facial part of the steamer.  </li>
            <li>Well sure enough today it did!!!!!  </li>
            <li>SPEND YOUR MONEY ON SOMETHING BETTER THAT WILL LAST.  </li>
            <li>It gets pretty hot</li>
            <li>and I think it probably works just as good as one of the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>Particularly warning and cautions along the lines of how one could GET BURNT!</li>
            <li>Both features work very well.</li>
            <li>Material is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>As I was sitting under the steamer, I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting as much steam as I should have been.</li>
            <li>I have used it only twice-but thus, far I am pleased with</li>
            <li>I highly suggest anyone to try out this steamer; it&#x27;s the cheapest one I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s top heavy and tips over...</li>
            <li>I washed my hair the next day because I had applied to much product and my curls were still very defined,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone withh natural hair.</li>
            <li>There needs to be indicators of what to watch out for and how one can protect him/herself, especially if they are entirely new to the concept of this product!&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased as well, initially, at the speed with which the company responded when I had informed them that the steamer arrived without the facial attachment.</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever using or owning a hair and facial steamer.  </li>
            <li>Funny enough</li>
            <li>was instead dripping directly onto the Power button!</li>
            <li>And now it is entirely dead!!&lt;br /&gt;After the first couple uses, I would see water pooling on my counter in front of the buttons and wondered if this couldn&#x27;t pose a problem at some point.</li>
            <li>Plastic cup that holds water cracked after the first use as facial steamer.</li>
            <li>I especially, like the protective cover over the cup that holds the hot water.</li>
            <li>It works great the first couple of uses but by the 8th use it leaks really bad.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>so it seemed minor at first.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it will completely shatter.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>The owners manual says that you only need to steam for 5-15 minutes, but I wanted to see how long it would go without running out of water.&lt;br /&gt;Clean up was pretty easy, just be careful taking the water reservoir off to empty it</li>
            <li>There was no O&amp;M manual just a piece of paper with very general directions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>No excuse me</li>
    </ol>

            <li> No excuse me</li>
            <li> so you may want to open the vent holes on the first use, something i had to learn the hard way.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a few of my thoughts on this particular appliance and how I used it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very course, 4b/4c natural hair that sometimes can look very dry and dull</li>
            <li> for now I tilt the entire steamer empty the remaining water...</li>
            <li> I would have given it the total 5 stars but trying to empty the water container</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE TO TILTE the entire steamer if anyone knows how to empty</li>
            <li> The instructions for set up was pretty simple but a little hard to see</li>
            <li> They suggested to take this to a repair shop and that it may be a loose wire.</li>
            <li> Please use a towel to catch any excess that my run down your forehead and back of your neck.</li>
            <li> It had shifted out of place, which I&#x27;ve been having trouble with from day one due to poor fit.</li>
            <li> I was coming to finally write my review today after using this product for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t fold and store like my regular dryer.</li>
            <li> , I am still trying to figure out how to empty the water cup once I&#x27;ve completed my treatment???</li>
            <li> but, it was a big waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even come with all of the parts, the facial ozone steamer was missing</li>
            <li> I never liked buying anything online because I want to see and touch the product prior to purchase.  </li>
            <li> so not cool.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve afraid to even get an exchange because this is not suppose to happen on a purchase within the first month...</li>
            <li> So now Ijust wasted money on this produdct that no longer works.</li>
            <li> The Product is defective the sprout that connects to the hood is to heavy</li>
            <li> How hard is it to make a product that boils water and produces steam?  </li>
            <li> Apparently for this manufacturer it is very difficult.</li>
            <li> I mean, I have it in my hallway closet so that it doesn&#x27;t get damage or mishandle</li>
            <li> This is beyond ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The plastic the product is made of is flimsy and not good quality.</li>
            <li> Never got to try this out, as it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> I hate that I purchased this steamer only to have it die on me.</li>
            <li> It was used around 10 times before it failed.</li>
            <li> Poor product!</li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and really hate spending money unnecessarily....</li>
            <li> I suffered a bad scalp burn that hurt for days.</li>
            <li> This was a bad purchase.  </li>
            <li> It did however arrived very dirty and had to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m annoyed by this product!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> This item is horrible...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This lasted just under 3 months.  It was used around 10 times before it failed. How hard is it to make a product that boils water and produces steam?  Apparently for this manufacturer it is very difficult.</li>
            <li> I love my hydration machine.. it&#x27;s truly the best..so glad I chose this one!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was worth the purchase it does give off a burst of steam that maybe to hot</li>
            <li> Love Love Love my steamer</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loved it.  It came promptly and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I received the steamer within a very short period of time after placing my order, it actually came on the day that I was to treat my hair.  I have used it only twice-but thus, far I am pleased with it&#x27;s performance- it is easy to assemble however, I am still trying to figure out how to empty the water cup once I&#x27;ve completed my treatment??? for now I tilt the entire steamer empty the remaining water...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like for it to hit MORE of the back of my hair but it&#x27;s ok I can manage with what it does do.  Again, so far so good it is working great and I absolutely LOVE the facial part of the steamer.  I would have given it the total 5 stars but trying to empty the water container is NONE EXISTING YOU HAVE TO TILTE the entire steamer if anyone knows how to empty please post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Never got to try this out, as it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Disappointed! I never got to use the hair streamer.  The hair steamer was delivered in an undamaged box.  However when I opened the box the hair streamer was cracked.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t for me but the owner is in love with it.  It did however arrived very dirty and had to be cleaned.</li>
            <li> Both features work very well. Very satisfied  with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever using or owning a hair and facial steamer.  I used it as soon as it showed up on my door.  Here&#x27;s a few of my thoughts on this particular appliance and how I used it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair and then applied my deep conditioner before sitting under the steamer.&lt;br /&gt;The steamer was pretty easy to set up and use.  I was able to follow the directions step by step.&lt;br /&gt;It took about 5 minutes for the water to start to boil and once I pressed the Ozone button the steam started to come out.&lt;br /&gt;The steam was not too hot, I was very comfortable the entire time I was steaming my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After about 20 minutes the machine started to beep, which I figured was a sign that it was time to stop.  The owners manual says that you only need to steam for 5-15 minutes, but I wanted to see how long it would go without running out of water.&lt;br /&gt;Clean up was pretty easy, just be careful taking the water reservoir off to empty it so you don&#x27;t spill water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really loved using this steamer.  My hair felt so moisturized and looked extra shiny.  I have very course, 4b/4c natural hair that sometimes can look very dry and dull so I loved the added shine.  Also, my curls were more defined after the steaming.  I washed my hair the next day because I had applied to much product and my curls were still very defined, so I think the steamer has really done my hair some good.  I highly suggest anyone to try out this steamer; it&#x27;s the cheapest one I&#x27;ve found and I think it probably works just as good as one of the more expensive ones.  Also, the company who sells this product shipped it out to me quickly.  I ordered it on Monday and by Thursday I was using it.</li>
            <li> Material is very flimsy. It would be nice to have a convenient way to store the steamer.</li>
            <li> Ok...so I haven&#x27;t had this for even a month yet and the second time I go to use this, IT DOESN&#x27;T EVEN WORK?!?  I mean, I have it in my hallway closet so that it doesn&#x27;t get damage or mishandle, however, it&#x27;s not even working and this is only my SECOND TIME...I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and really hate spending money unnecessarily....so not cool.  I hope the company responds...I&#x27;ve afraid to even get an exchange because this is not suppose to happen on a purchase within the first month...wow.</li>
            <li> Very nice, gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m annoyed by this product!!! Funny enough I was coming to finally write my review today after using this product for a little over a month. I originally was going to say it was okay. I was noticing some good changes in my hair (4A/B) and felt the product was decent but with the major complaint that though the product didn&#x27;t come with good set up instructions, as everyone else had pointed out, it needed to come with warnings and cautions and maintenance directions. Particularly warning and cautions along the lines of how one could GET BURNT! As happened to me the very first time I used it. I suffered a bad scalp burn that hurt for days. And while I didn&#x27;t suffer lasting effects, the burn alone would be enough for someone to undertake this company in a lawsuit. There needs to be indicators of what to watch out for and how one can protect him/herself, especially if they are entirely new to the concept of this product!&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased as well, initially, at the speed with which the company responded when I had informed them that the steamer arrived without the facial attachment. They were quick in getting one out to me.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I felt that the steamer was doing it&#x27;s job.  But that officially changed as of 5 minutes ago! Literally.  As I was sitting under the steamer, I noticed that I wasn&#x27;t getting as much steam as I should have been. When I got out from underneath it and took a look at it, I realized that the hood was not fully attached. It had shifted out of place, which I&#x27;ve been having trouble with from day one due to poor fit. It didn&#x27;t seem to interfere with the flow of steam to the hood so it seemed minor at first. But today, water condensation from the steam coming up from the water reservoir attachment that should have been directed toward the hood was instead dripping directly onto the Power button! I got out from under the steamer in time to see the entire unit malfunction and short out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And now it is entirely dead!!&lt;br /&gt;After the first couple uses, I would see water pooling on my counter in front of the buttons and wondered if this couldn&#x27;t pose a problem at some point. Well sure enough today it did!!!!!  Poor design. Poor product! Not impressed! And now Inconvenienced!!</li>
            <li> update*** Sent email to the seller and they will not replace this steamer. Please save your self time and money and do not purchase this cheap product. They suggested to take this to a repair shop and that it may be a loose wire. No excuse me the product does not steam. So now Ijust wasted money on this produdct that no longer works. I don&#x27;t suggest this to anyone. This place are selling products that are cheap and they are a scam. This should not happen in only four months. *DO NOT BUY DO BUY*****        This was a bad purchase.  I&#x27;ve only used my steamer four times and now it doesn&#x27;t work.  I hate that I purchased this steamer only to have it die on me. I would not recommend this steamer to anyone. I thought I was buying something that I would like  but, it was a big waste of money.  I only had it since Sept of 2014 and dies after four uses. DONT BUY. SPEND YOUR MONEY ON SOMETHING BETTER THAT WILL LAST.  THIS IS A HONEST REVIEW. I wish before I purchased this item that more reviews were posted and I noticed that others are having the same issues.*****</li>
            <li> The product seemed like a great buy, but i noticed that the hood was cracked when I opened the box. So I haven&#x27;t used the product</li>
            <li> the item arrived on time but damamged!!</li>
            <li> I received my steamer on Monday and i just used it today, Sunday. I would have loved to have more instructions about using the product. The instructions for set up was pretty simple but a little hard to see yet i figured it out by viewing similar products online. Since there were no instruction on how to use it i didnt know what to expect. I fulled the cup almost to max line and had at it. It steamed VERY good and shut off once the water reached the min line and sounded a alarm. Please use a towel to catch any excess that my run down your forehead and back of your neck. It gets pretty hot so you may want to open the vent holes on the first use, something i had to learn the hard way. I am very pleased w/ what i have seen so far. Hopefully the facial part is just as great. Would have given it 5 stars if there were instructions on how to use and what to use to keep it clean.  Overall i am very pleased and love it my hair, which im a naturlista, wasnt as dry as it had been before using this. Hopefully w/ many uses it corrects my problems - danduff and dryness.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used it for my face and hair already. I used to stand over the stove with a towel to steam my face , now I can sit and relax. The only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t fold and store like my regular dryer.</li>
            <li> great product does the job</li>
            <li> The second time I used it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I never liked buying anything online because I want to see and touch the product prior to purchase.  Purchasing this product helped to reinforce my notion.  Everything about this product was cheap.  It didn&#x27;t even come with all of the parts, the facial ozone steamer was missing and I am still waiting on it.  There was no O&amp;M manual just a piece of paper with very general directions.  I will never order items such as this one online, ever!</li>
            <li> Great hair steamer.  Quick shipping from seller.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Plastic cup that holds water cracked after the first use as facial steamer. would love a more durable water cup as I really wanted to steam my hair, but don&#x27;t want boiling water leaking everywhere</li>
            <li> The plastic the product is made of is flimsy and not good quality. I did return the steamer.</li>
            <li> The Product is defective the sprout that connects to the hood is to heavy and it was sitting on my desk and broke off from the actual steamer and they would not honor me as a customer and would not refund..  if product is purchased you must keep it disassembled until its time for you to steam hair.  Otherwise it will completely shatter.</li>
            <li> Water drop scatters . But I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my new hair steamer it is so easy to use. I especially, like the protective cover over the cup that holds the hot water. I highly recommend this product for anyone withh natural hair. It leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> This is beyond ridiculous. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> This item is horrible...even cheaper made than the cheap price. It&#x27;s top heavy and tips over...warning you can get burned</li>
            <li> It works great the first couple of uses but by the 8th use it leaks really bad.</li>
            <li> Item came without instructions on how to put together but I figured it out. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but it did the trick!</li>
            <li> The order came ahead of the scheduled time, which was a plus. The product works perfectly.</li>
