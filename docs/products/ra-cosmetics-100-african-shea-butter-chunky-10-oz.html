            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love my RA cosmetics.....</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Made so solid hand lotion with Shea Butter as one ingredient was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am left with beautifully silky hands, elbows, and feet</li>
            <li>Shea butter has been fantastic for my skin.</li>
            <li>I like to mix it with some of the lotion to smooth it out...</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and it smells good.  </li>
            <li>idk if its refined or unrefined , it might be filled with pesticides , needs more info containing how its processed , it really didnt work on my skin</li>
            <li>I am trying to become more natural in my approach to a healthy body.</li>
            <li>Has a nice natural scent that my clients like as well!</li>
            <li>While this is shea butter; you don&#x27;t get a full 10 ounces because it is literally packed in chunks.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Super</li>
            <li>but so worth it.</li>
            <li>Works so good on the whole family we use it daily</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it, so I look at it as if it is a blank slate for you to work with to create your own type of body butter.</li>
            <li>I get it directly from the company and right now, today, they are having a &amp;#34;no shipping&amp;#34; special going on.  </li>
            <li>So even though I&#x27;m about to just deal with it, I really don&#x27;t know if the Shea butter has been effected by the exposure or if I have lost some of the product through the crack.</li>
            <li>My daughters skin gets a little itchy most nights.</li>
            <li>I started using this Shea butter last year and really have nothing but positive feedback.</li>
            <li>I live in Maine,</li>
            <li>and this is all I use to keep my skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I also use this for my natural hair to give it moisture and my skin to keep it from cracking.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so soft, faded blemishes I&#x27;ve had for years and has helped my stretch marks fade as well.</li>
            <li>My Mother made this into a natural body butter for me, she whipped this up with some coconut oil, and essential oils.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft, especially my face and has faded my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>My three month old suffered from baby acne and this was the only product that my husband and I used to combat the problem.</li>
            <li>Not only does it caters to the acne, it makes my daughter&#x27;s skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin which is exacerbated in the winter season (I live in the mountains)  -</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have very dry skin which is exacerbated in the winter season (I live in the mountains)  - and this is all I use to keep my skin soft and moisturized.  This Shea butter is heavenly. Instead of buying very expensive lotions with Shea Butter in the ingredients - my skin is much more moisturized using this 100% natural product. Only one application a day is needed. Works wonders!</li>
            <li> The African Shea Butter should recommended to everyone that works outdoors and that has dry skin. Shea butter has been fantastic for my skin.</li>
            <li> I FINALLY found something that would take away  dry, scaly, ugly skin!!! I am left with beautifully silky hands, elbows, and feet After I use this product! I live in Maine, The Winter&#x27;s are harsh and it takes a toll on my skin. I get excema every winter, and after using this for a few times a day for a week, It has actually gone away! I can not rave enough about this shea butter!  My Mother made this into a natural body butter for me, she whipped this up with some coconut oil, and essential oils. It doesn&#x27;t really have a smell to it, so I look at it as if it is a blank slate for you to work with to create your own type of body butter.</li>
            <li> Great product...I love it! It arrived timely from seller.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd tub I have bought!  I love this product!  Its great to use if you are giving a massage! Has a nice natural scent that my clients like as well!</li>
            <li> My daughters skin gets a little itchy most nights. We apply this stuff and it&#x27;s great.  I also use it to moisturize my own skin.</li>
            <li> idk if its refined or unrefined , it might be filled with pesticides , needs more info containing how its processed , it really didnt work on my skin</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this product. Makes my skin soft, especially my face and has faded my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I am trying to become more natural in my approach to a healthy body. I have been using black soap for a month and some change and I needed something to moisturize, that did not contain chemicals. I have found it!! Shea Butter is the best. It is long lasting and I like it because when applying it to your skin its almost like giving yourself a massage. It moisturizes without getting you greasy and its great. I will also be using this for rest of my life along with black soap.</li>
            <li> Where do I start? My three month old suffered from baby acne and this was the only product that my husband and I used to combat the problem. Not only does it caters to the acne, it makes my daughter&#x27;s skin soft. My husband also uses this on his skin. I also use this for my natural hair to give it moisture and my skin to keep it from cracking. This product is awesome and I can never go back to regular to lotions or hair care products.</li>
            <li> While this is shea butter; you don&#x27;t get a full 10 ounces because it is literally packed in chunks. I had to melt it in the microwave, stir it and let it re-harden to use it. I will not buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I started using this Shea butter last year and really have nothing but positive feedback. It has made my skin so soft, faded blemishes I&#x27;ve had for years and has helped my stretch marks fade as well. Would recommend this.</li>
            <li> the product arrived on time and its was everithing it show. i uset it everyday and i spect to purchse more items from this buyer</li>
            <li> This product has so much uses there a thin line in what you can not use it for whether skin hair etc... Recommended to try and see results.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Super butter,\\&quot; as the hubby calls it. Whats not to love about a product in its purest form? I use on and fore everything.</li>
            <li> I love it!... I cannot go back to using any other bodywash or lotion.  It makes my skin so soft and it smells good.  It&#x27;s refreshing.  I use the hair products as well.  I get it directly from the company and right now, today, they are having a &amp;#34;no shipping&amp;#34; special going on.  To the folks having a problem with the chunky shea butter...just let it sit out.  It will soften.  You don&#x27;t have to microwave it.  I like to mix it with some of the lotion to smooth it out...now that is wonderful.  I wish they had candles, etc. Love, love, love my RA cosmetics.....It&#x27;s a little pricey but so worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It has cleared blemishes and scars and softened the look of stretch marks.  A great moisturizer also.  Can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> Made so solid hand lotion with Shea Butter as one ingredient was wonderful.  Look forward to making it again. Feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> I just got it today and the entire bottom of the container is cracked in half! If I didn&#x27;t need it to make something that I need this weekend I would be returning it. So even though I&#x27;m about to just deal with it, I really don&#x27;t know if the Shea butter has been effected by the exposure or if I have lost some of the product through the crack. I&#x27;m very disappointed :( hopefully I can find a local store that carries it so I don&#x27;t have to go through this again</li>
            <li> Works so good on the whole family we use it daily</li>
