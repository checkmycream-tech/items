            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I am also developing a cold/cough and this is better than vicks and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a change in my diet or the Breathe again, but this is the best summer I&#x27;ve  had with my allergies.  </li>
            <li>It really worked!&amp;#34;  I love converting people</li>

            <li>She finds it very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I have not used this product too much</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m currently pregnant, and have two little ones who have an allergy each (ragweed and pine) but both of them have trouble sleeping when they take any kind of allergy medicine.</li>
            <li>I have suffered allergies my entire adult life (25 years).  </li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s a quality Young Living essential oil blend</li>
            <li>I think these bottles last much longer than a conventional essential oil dropper style.</li>

            <li> great scent and opens up my sinus</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any great relief by using this product. In addition, the smell was overpowering. Not for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Bought it for my Mother-In-Law.  She finds it very helpful.  Arrived on time - pleased with overall experience.</li>
            <li> Hi - my parents received the deep relief roll on and she uses it for her knee - she had knee replacement surgery and is still in a lot of pain.  I also received the breathe again for my dad and he uses it quite regularly.  very happy with my purchases - thank you!!</li>
            <li> Works great. Use on neck and chest. Nice smell. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> I would recommended Breathe Again Roll-On because every time that I get a  cold or a cough, Breathe Again really help.  I would rate this as a number 5.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I have horrible sinuses and allergies and when I put this on at night I can actually breathe easier. I will buy this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - reduces need for sinus meds by 90 %. Used to be on sinus meds daily now only occasionally. Recommend it to friends a lot.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product too much but it did I noticed a difference it my breathing. I recommend anyone who has issues breathing and can not afford to see a doctor to try this.</li>
            <li> This roll on is so wonderfully scented and seems to clear the head very quickly.  Just breathing it makes you feel better. This company better stock up.</li>
            <li> BREATHE AGAIN IS A WONDERFUL BLEND THAT REALLY HELPS ME BREATHE CLEARLY.&lt;br /&gt;ONCE YOU USE IT YOU WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN WITHOUT IT!</li>
            <li> LOVE it. Great product</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I have suffered allergies my entire adult life (25 years).  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a change in my diet or the Breathe again, but this is the best summer I&#x27;ve  had with my allergies.  No side effects...  Expensive but worth it.</li>

            <li> Great for colds love it it&#x27;s in my purse always on hand</li>
            <li> Love this product, really helps clear my nose!</li>
            <li> My husband called me after I rubbed him down and said &amp;#34;I can breathe! It really worked!&amp;#34;  I love converting people</li>

            <li> The one and only thing to make us feel better during allergy season!

I&#x27;d much rather use a natural remedy anyway, but I didn&#x27;t find much that helped in the weeks of their allergy season- until I found this Breathe Again roll-on!

            <li> I used this product before a race to help with my breathing. It did not help, and after the race my nose was running non stop.</li>
            <li> It does NOT clear sinuses at all!!! The seller and Amazon will refuse a refund. Buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> Tried prescription meds, but nothing works better than this!! Love this!</li>
