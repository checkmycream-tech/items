            <li> Great product, great service, quick response. Thanks</li>
            <li> The package is a good value, it made a great gift for my mother who has used this fragrance forever</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom as a gift. She&#x27;s being wearing this perfume for over 20 years. I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> I recently bought two of the 3.4 oz bottles of L&#x27;air du Temps cologne from two different sellers. It&#x27;s not the same fragrance, and I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance exclusively for decades. It&#x27;s very disappointing, and I&#x27;m wondering if others have had the same problem with this product</li>
            <li> I love Nina Ricci L&#x27;air du Temps. I have been wearing this scent since 1976 when a friends shared some with me.  I would suggest this  scent to anyone looking for a light romantic fragrance.  I have tried other perfums over the years and I always go back to Nina Ricci&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I did not understand why the L&#x27;air du temps did not have the lalique doves on it as my previous purchases&lt;br /&gt;in department stores did. These were clear glass, the first  I have seen. Both bottles had clear glass tops.</li>
            <li> i bought this product but it made a mistake because i though it was a fresh aroma but is not</li>
            <li> This light floral scent: iris &amp; gardenia, is my favorite summer fragrance. I usually layer it starting with the gel in the shower, then soft lotion or powder, then the lasting spray fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wife likes this scent and the presentation.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance. This gift set was perfect for a Valentines Day Gift. I can never go wrong buying my wife&#x27;s favorites!</li>
            <li> My Mom was very happy with this gift</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing, scent holds all day, good for day or night, very alluring and sexy, mine came as a set w/lotion and shower gel.</li>
            <li> This is colored water.  The fragrance is so weak, it only lasts one hour.  I have been wearing this perfume for 25 years and this is not it.  Do not buy this!!!!</li>
            <li> I do not know; ME AND NEVER CAME THE LOST</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and finally I could enjoy using it. Love it! the price is excellent too. Higly recommended</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;air du Temp, but this set is just the toilette water, no parfume in the little bottle. Very light fragrance version.</li>
            <li> I have worn L&#x27;air di Temps for 40 years. It&#x27;s my favorite. I love Christmas time when they bring out the gift sets. This set was perfect this time because I had just run low on body lotion. It came in a gift box set (as shown) and in a well packed box. It also came in the forecasted time.</li>
            <li> This set is a super value in a classic scent.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a beautiful, light fragrance.  This set included the spray and the cream.  It is nice.  I have already received several comments and I have only worn it twice.  I will be wearing it all season, spring &amp; summer.  The seller was fast and I was happy.  The pricing was the best I found for what I received.</li>
