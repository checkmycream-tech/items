    <ol>
            <li>that make my face look to bright and radiant.</li>
            <li>I saw good results on mi spots.</li>
            <li>IF it was a particularly nice feeling or pleasant scent hand cream</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think I was duped into buying this.</li>
            <li>Nice creamy texture that blends into my hands easily at night.  </li>
            <li>Cream absorbs nicely and feels fine....</li>
            <li>will try another brand, it does smell better than some of the others</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Since it hasn&#x27;t been even one week using it,  I believe it needs more time to work.  </li>
            <li>maybe it needs more time...</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not oily and it smoothes out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>My lactic acid peels on the backs of my hands are doing a much better job of peeling off the age spots over time.</li>
            <li>Skin is healthy and smooth, easy to apply and most of all it didn&#x27;t cost that</li>
            <li>fragrance is reminiscent of a rose petal, but very mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>My brown spots are really brown patches over many years of prescription meds that increase melenin in the skin.  </li>
            <li>We tried so many products amongst them the high rated bio oil, which for her did not work.</li>
            <li>The product was very inexpensive and  it went on smoothly with no discomfort.</li>
            <li>I love this product it makes me feel young again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like a nice facial lotion.</li>
            <li>I would say try it if the price is right.</li>
            <li>Delivery was great but the product did not work at all after using the whole jar on two areas that were less than 2 1/2&amp;#34; X 1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>hmmmm&lt;br /&gt;Worked better to even out overall tone of skin at the neck line.</li>
            <li>Just like any old cheap cream</li>
            <li>I recently started to use it on my arms for sunspots and will see how that works, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than just a night cream.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell, not messy, not greasy, goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t peel off, leaves no residue...</li>
            <li>but most and he likes how it moisturizes because he also has really dry skin.</li>
            <li>did not see a real change on skin</li>
            <li>aggregate\\&quot; how much are people getting from all the products they are consuming and applying?</li>
            <li>Later I plan on purchasing the Light Skin Peel.  </li>
            <li>This product really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Well, I applied the Reviva Labs Brown Spot Night Cream faithfully at night for quite some time, but did not see much improvement at all.</li>
            <li>Seems to work better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>(Soda &amp; many other foods contain SB...</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, but requires rubbing  in for a long time to dissapear.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even bought him the Clinique new brown spot corrector he didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>The main brown spot was not removed.</li>
            <li>This product makes your skin look radiant and clear!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear up my spots nor did it make my skin brighter.</li>
            <li>My dermotologist recommends applying the highest number  sunscreen available and use it everyday even in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I am turning back to the light brown color I had when I was a little girl!</li>
            <li>Gentle and not greasy, it prevents dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t expect to get much in this little jar</li>

    <ol>
            <li> sorry it does not work well at all. It takes way to long to show even slight results  will try another brand, it does smell better than some of the others</li>
            <li> Delivery was great but the product did not work at all after using the whole jar on two areas that were less than 2 1/2&amp;#34; X 1/2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product works without the harsh effects of harsh chemicals.  Gentle and not greasy, it prevents dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> This product gradually reduces dark spots on the skin.  Seems to work better than other products I&#x27;ve tried. Works even for those of us who are darker complected.</li>
            <li> Recommended on Dr. Oz, and I am beginning to see results.  Nice creamy texture that blends into my hands easily at night.  There is one for daytime use, but I&#x27;ve not bought that, since I wash my hands so frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is reminiscent of a rose petal, but very mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> After six weeks the brown spots are still there, but all the skin around them is lighter...hmmmm&lt;br /&gt;Worked better to even out overall tone of skin at the neck line.</li>
            <li> So far, this works very slowly.  If you need to lighten faster, don&#x27;t buy this. I use it in the morning too.</li>
            <li> I have one dark spot on my face, not super dark that I noticed last April. I used this product every night for 7 weeks and saw no change whatsoever!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product for my daughter, who had a few acne scars that were much darker then her skin color. We tried so many products amongst them the high rated bio oil, which for her did not work.I use the Reviva firming serum and saw this brown spot treatment at a local beauty store and decided to try it .&lt;br /&gt;Within just a couple days we already see a difference, Finally a product for an affordable price that works.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> Can see no difference after 4 weeks of use and I am using the day cream also.  Wish I could give a rave review like some of the other reviewers, but can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am turning back to the light brown color I had when I was a little girl! I initially wanted this cream for dark acne spots but now Iuse it all over! Love it!</li>
            <li> Use it but didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> did not see a real change on skin</li>
            <li> this cream doesn&#x27;t do what it says ....&lt;br /&gt;well the price says it all. Will not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;will keep looking.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything.  Just like any old cheap cream</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t  remove brown spots as we hoped for.  It did lighten some. But, overall, we won&#x27;t order this again.  The main brown spot was not removed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on my face for 4 weeks and have not noticed any change. I recently started to use it on my arms for sunspots and will see how that works, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything more than just a night cream.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this as long as a month, which is what it suggests. I can&#x27;t see that it will do anything for brown spots that must penetrate through several layers of your skin. IF it was a particularly nice feeling or pleasant scent hand cream I would say try it if the price is right. But, it is neither so I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to apply it since I have it and will update this review if my findings are any different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Reviva products for years - until recently - when I noticed Sodium Benzoate is now among the ingredients.  This is a known carcinogen that converts to Benzene in the presence of Ascorbic Acid (Vit. C), something that is also found in skin care products.  I contacted the company and learned that, Yes, they changed the formulation but the preservatives represent a very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The FDA has standards for the amount allowed in food and other products.  Problem for me is \\&quot;in aggregate\\&quot; how much are people getting from all the products they are consuming and applying? (Soda &amp; many other foods contain SB... And then there is the issue of combining such a skin care product with Sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes me feel young again. Skin is healthy and smooth, easy to apply and most of all it didn&#x27;t cost that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely want to recommend this product to my friend, for them to have same experience</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin look radiant and clear! My friends will ask sometimes what I did that make my face look to bright and radiant. I love it and you don&#x27;t expect to get much in this little jar but you definetely do! It doesn&#x27;t smell, not messy, not greasy, goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t peel off, leaves no residue... It&#x27;s just like a nice facial lotion. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I suffer from melasma.  Since it hasn&#x27;t been even one week using it,  I believe it needs more time to work.  Goes on smooth, but requires rubbing  in for a long time to dissapear.  I also purchased the Brown Spot Night Gel.  Directions say to alternate the two creams every two weeks.  Later I plan on purchasing the Light Skin Peel.  My brown spots are really brown patches over many years of prescription meds that increase melenin in the skin.  It&#x27;s a constant battle using fade creams, concealers and heavy makeup.  My dermotologist recommends applying the highest number  sunscreen available and use it everyday even in the winter months.</li>
            <li> The product was very inexpensive and  it went on smoothly with no discomfort. i used this product for four months with no discernible improvement.</li>
            <li> Cream absorbs nicely and feels fine....but I have noticed very little difference in my brown spots.  It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks...maybe it needs more time...we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> I gave ths 2 starts bc i am feeling generous. I used ths in conjunction with the day cream and no change after 3the weeks of use not even slightly.  Will not buy again</li>
            <li> it literally burned my face. its red and damaged now, it dried my skin. if you have pale skin, its not for you. worst experience ever.</li>
            <li> I Get this for my husband. He works outside in the sun and gets sun spots on his cheeks. This product really makes a difference. Does it remove them all- no, but most and he likes how it moisturizes because he also has really dry skin. I&#x27;ve even bought him the Clinique new brown spot corrector he didn&#x27;t like it as much. so get this and the Reviva lightning day face cream which he uses together with this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this works or not after I finished this cream.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not oily and it smoothes out my skin tone. It corrects hyperpigmentation over time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cream because  I had read kojic acid was recommended for skin lightening.  YES(!), I have some age spots on my hands I wanted to get rid of.  Well, I applied the Reviva Labs Brown Spot Night Cream faithfully at night for quite some time, but did not see much improvement at all. I pitched what was left and will not be ordering it again.  My lactic acid peels on the backs of my hands are doing a much better job of peeling off the age spots over time.</li>
            <li> I saw good results on mi spots.</li>
            <li> This was something that Dr. Oz had talked about on his show, so I ordered it and I can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think I was duped into buying this. It didn&#x27;t clear up my spots nor did it make my skin brighter. I think I would try another product if I were you.</li>
