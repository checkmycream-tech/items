    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent products with immediate results!</li>
            <li>And I forgot to mention, please don&#x27;t let the garlic picture on the conditioner fool you, these products smell wonderful, nothing like garlic.</li>
            <li>Once Botanikare corrects this, it will have an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>My husband said this was the best investment I made in terms of hair products are concerned.</li>
            <li>I especially love the fact that each item came with the factory seal and were not knockoffs.</li>
            <li>It is the best for any type of hair.</li>
            <li>Great seller!!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome products</li>
            <li>I love this product!!!</li>
            <li>The conditioner is great.  </li>
            <li>experience using this product is great.</li>
            <li>Great bargain.</li>
            <li>Over all I&#x27;m so happy with the results</li>
            <li>I see great change.</li>
            <li>This is a great system.  </li>
            <li>However, the shampoo felt great when I applied it</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great</li>
            <li>Again, great shipping.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Your content is excellent, I love it because my revitalizes damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner have a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I LOVET IT GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li>But if you can tolerate that, then you are good to go.     </li>
            <li>and so is the conditioner (which I have used on and off for about 10 years now) and the drops tingle and smells good, but</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>It has an awesome smell, but a sweet scent is not all that I am looking for in a shampoo or treatment.</li>
            <li>I gave the Alter Ego set 4 stars because while I love the conditioner and the drops, the shampoo did not give me great results as I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
            <li>I think this is amazing trio to have.. if you don&#x27;t know what to get from this brand, I think this is as good as it gets..</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing treatment for shedding hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice and am loving the results.</li>
            <li>Make sure to used it the right way for best results.</li>
            <li>My hair felt strong, looked shiny and very healthy.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner will last you for months (if you have shoulder or bra length hair) therefore, consider this as good investment to healthy and beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>the edges of my hair would have been refused at a thrift shop.. :-)     </li>
            <li>After rinsing off this conditioner, I was able to comb my hair with ease and retain length.</li>
            <li>I love the drops ..</li>
            <li>I love the tingle from both the shampoo and the drops.</li>
            <li>it is more conditioner like.</li>
            <li>Love all my alter ego products.</li>
            <li>I leave the conditioner in for 15-30 mins and my hair is softer and more managable.</li>
            <li>I find the longer you leave the conditioner in the better it works.</li>
            <li>the conditioning mask is ok.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite mask</li>
            <li>Maybe as a shampoo in a co wash, i&#x27;ll use it folloving a moisturizing conditioner on top of the treatment after it is rinsed out.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my hair so healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo it gives you like a tingly sensation when you use it, and the conditioner makes your hair very soft, the drops are great to.</li>
            <li>The best shampoos are the ones that actually say Sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is a good cleanser strong natural organic scent which is nice to some.</li>
            <li>the best and they are super big</li>
            <li>but it comes in a huge tub.</li>
            <li>when applying the mask, it helps it makes the hair absorbed the nutrients better.</li>
            <li>Truly, these are amazing products that guarantee results right after the first use, my hair stop falling.  </li>
            <li>it will look a lot better from the first time You try it.</li>
            <li>I have found to be excellent even after using only once so far.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does clean hair</li>
            <li>it seems pretty good but to new to tell about it..</li>
            <li>I love the large sizes.</li>
            <li>but this shampoo need to but check to make sure it&#x27;s not  outdated.</li>
            <li>Full my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a good solid product and you can tell from the first use that your hair is being well nourished by the conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>I would like to say that this product is well worth getting, a cheaper alternative is the replenishing pak</li>
            <li>Worth every lira, dollar, pound, yen or franc</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I tried cheaper products, whether they were natural or not and had fantastic results!</li>
            <li>I tried the treatment on another that has natural hair more coarser than mine</li>
            <li>I have an abundant amount of debris in my hair somehow, as this seems to possibly remove it.</li>
            <li>Without these products i dont know how my hair would be right now...</li>
            <li>The drops were not bad and didnt tingle that much to me.  </li>
            <li>Well instead of hot steaming this product, I decided to wash with the shampoo and use conditioner, plastic bag and scarf and sleep with product in hair overnight.</li>
            <li>until I started using Alter EGO, its formula revitalized my hair from the first wash.</li>
            <li>I have been using the hot oil treatment with garlic.</li>
            <li>First, it is not an oil-</li>
            <li>After the first use, I saw a noticable difference in the amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li>I used the hot oil treatment for alter ego not the one that came with this package as yet</li>
            <li>This product will let You see results the first time You use it, your hair just gets softer and manageable</li>
            <li>and I dont feel my hair different but clean and fresh in any case</li>
            <li>had nice long hair but was damaged years ago and could not find the right product to help it to grow back</li>
            <li>These products are high end if your looking to really take care of your locks!</li>
            <li>The shampoo was very drying to my hair.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Alter Ego Hair Loss combination set and noticed that my hair was not falling out as much afew washes.</li>
            <li>The product costs too much to be as ineffective in its claims.  </li>
            <li>Mostly the oil &amp; deep conditioner, its great for weak damaged hair grew my edges back and my hair is getting stronger.</li>
            <li>keeps this deal available through Amazon for a long time.</li>
            <li>and I have visibly more hair growing out of my scalp and less breakage.</li>
            <li>I should have done it a while back but today after recommending them once more to a friend, I finally decided to write the review.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I alternate between KUZ and Alter Ego products, just because I love them both especially the scent of KUZ products.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s healthier and I see new hair growth already.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like garlic at all and leaves my hair feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>it leaves it very soft and manageable</li>
            <li>She had recently started using it, beacuse her was becoming very dry.</li>
            <li>i only tried it once and have seen a positive change already ,hope it continues to work as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this combo except for the shampoo, it makes my hair hard.</li>
            <li>I have colored natural hair.</li>
            <li>turn it red and very itch.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have a mannequin with european like hair and it was very drying for it&#x27;s hair as well.</li>
            <li>Permanent color is the only chemical I use on my hair to get rid of the gray, however, I color my hair very often due to the fact that my grays (new growth) come back so fast.</li>
            <li>but when I rinse it out it was very drying for my 4b African American hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product in my hair before and I will always refer it to someone especially if they have gone natural or in the process of going natural.</li>
            <li>I usually leave the conditioner for a long period of time (1 or 2 hr max because I don&#x27;t like to sit under the dryer to deep condition my hair), or wash my hair the night before and sleep with the condition and rinse it the day after (I like this even better for faster results).</li>
            <li>Use several natural products and treatments but did not see results.</li>
            <li>But package was carefully wrapped and shipping was ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li>But so far, I am not a big fan of it.</li>
            <li>Even though its my first use, I think the amount of shedding is less when through blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>From previous experience, this is very hard to make gray hair look good with only one product, Trust and believe.      </li>
            <li>I have been natural without relaxer for about 5 years and this product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and brittle</li>

            <li> Like other reviewers mentioned, there is less hair sheading after using the conditioner; especially after leaving it in as one soaps up, shaves and rinses it out at the very end.  </li>
            <li> I am a long time user and fan of the Alter Ego line of products and I use the garlic conditioner and drops on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This review is long overdue.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to the long term results.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely kinky and therefore fragile to manipulate   3)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the best and they are super big</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item it seems pretty good but to new to tell about it..I&#x27;ll update with the 30 day results.</li>
            <li> Excellent products with immediate results!</li>
            <li> So I ordered the Alter EGO Hair Loss Combo Set a week ago today.  I received the product on this past Thursday.  I tend to suffer from, in my opinion, extreme hair shedding.  So when I read the reviews of each of the products in the set, I decided to order the set.  I just finished washing and blow drying my hair.  From the start, I can tell the difference already.  There was much less hair in the drain and sooo much less in the comb as I combed the conditioner through my hair.  Although the jar says to leave the garlic mask on the hair for 15 minutes, I left on for about 50 minutes as a deep conditioner.  The drops were not bad and didnt tingle that much to me.  Even though its my first use, I think the amount of shedding is less when through blow drying my hair. I put the drops in after putting on the Alter Ego leave-in conditioner (not included in set), then I blow dried my hair dry.  Even you are tired of seeing your hair on the floor, and in your comb and brush why not give it a try???</li>
            <li> I LOVET IT GOOD PRODUCT</li>
            <li> This review is long overdue.  I should have done it a while back but today after recommending them once more to a friend, I finally decided to write the review. The Alter EGO Hair Loss Combination set works without a fault. A while back my hairdresser recommended it to me and I used it since and every time my hair goes to the falling, thinning and shedding stage.  I have colored natural hair. Permanent color is the only chemical I use on my hair to get rid of the gray, however, I color my hair very often due to the fact that my grays (new growth) come back so fast. I have to admit that I alternate between KUZ and Alter Ego products, just because I love them both especially the scent of KUZ products.  But, when my hair start shedding, I know it is time to switch to ALTER EGO. Truly, these are amazing products that guarantee results right after the first use, my hair stop falling.  I will comb my hair and there wouldn&#x27;t be a strand of hair coming out. I would shampoo my hair and use the conditioner and when I rinsed it out there would be no hair in the shower. I usually leave the conditioner for a long period of time (1 or 2 hr max because I don&#x27;t like to sit under the dryer to deep condition my hair), or wash my hair the night before and sleep with the condition and rinse it the day after (I like this even better for faster results). The you get when you order the products is salon size and are quite bigger than the regular size you find in the retail store.  The shampoo and conditioner will last you for months (if you have shoulder or bra length hair) therefore, consider this as good investment to healthy and beautiful hair.  And I forgot to mention, please don&#x27;t let the garlic picture on the conditioner fool you, these products smell wonderful, nothing like garlic.</li>
            <li> I am an African american woman. My hair is 4B. But I prefer to tell people that myself and steel wool have similar genes!!!. Well instead of hot steaming this product, I decided to wash with the shampoo and use conditioner, plastic bag and scarf and sleep with product in hair overnight. Now the crux of the matter is that my hair breaks off when I comb it, for a number of reasons:     1) I have gray/black and white hair which is coarse and brittle   2) My hair is extremely kinky and therefore fragile to manipulate   3) I am iron-deficient   4) the edges of my hair would have been refused at a thrift shop.. :-)     After rinsing off this conditioner, I was able to comb my hair with ease and retain length. There was very little shedding of hair. My hair felt strong, looked shiny and very healthy. From previous experience, this is very hard to make gray hair look good with only one product, Trust and believe.      The hair growth drops that you put in your hair are extremely stimulating, it tingles a lot. But if you can tolerate that, then you are good to go.     If you are on the fence about this product, because of cost, I would suggest that you forgo the lattes&#x27; or shoes etc and fork out the money. It is a good solid product and you can tell from the first use that your hair is being well nourished by the conditioning treatment. I would like to say that this product is well worth getting, a cheaper alternative is the replenishing pak, however the garlic conditioner will have you hooked. Go on, make the plunge and get this.. Worth every lira, dollar, pound, yen or franc if you know what I mean. I will post an update in about 6 months to let you know if I actually got any hair growth from the drops.</li>
            <li> Hello the shampoo left my hair dull and lifeless</li>
            <li> Without these products i dont know how my hair would be right now... i was shedding like a doggy in the summer! it was ridiculous and scary... especially after giving birth my hair was falling out at every brush... with these products within a week my problems have vanished!.. I love the drops .. my hair dresser always used these on me so i had to get a bottle for my home.. my husband even uses them for his receding hair line..!</li>
            <li> I gave the Alter Ego set 4 stars because while I love the conditioner and the drops, the shampoo did not give me great results as I&#x27;d hoped for. The shampoo was very drying to my hair. I am a long time user and fan of the Alter Ego line of products and I use the garlic conditioner and drops on a regular basis. I will probably always use those 2 products because they are staples in my hair care regiment. The shampoo is not an item I will use again once I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set because the serum was recommended to me by a hair stylist as the front of my hair is thinning.  The conditioner is great.  It does not smell like garlic at all and leaves my hair feeling very soft.  Like other reviewers mentioned, there is less hair sheading after using the conditioner; especially after leaving it in as one soaps up, shaves and rinses it out at the very end.  The only product that I have a dislike for is the shampoo.  It contains Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate which is just another name for Sodium Sulfate.  This is what makes shampoos lather up and is the oil stripper.  All shampoos with Sulfate leave your hair extremely rough because it removes all of the natural oils.  As a person with curly hair, this is the worst enemy as curly hair already has very little natural oils and always needs heavy moisturizers.  The best shampoos are the ones that actually say Sulfate free.  Considering that this is supposed to be a nourishing shampoo, it SHOULD NOT contain any fancy variation of Sodium Sulfate.  Once Botanikare corrects this, it will have an excellent product.  They also need to add a pump to the bottle for added convenience.</li>
            <li> Full my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;My experience using this product is great. Your content is excellent, I love it because my revitalizes damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;After giving birth, my hair is weakened and kept falling. Use several natural products and treatments but did not see results. until I started using Alter EGO, its formula revitalized my hair from the first wash. My husband said this was the best investment I made in terms of hair products are concerned. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great bargain. Individually these items would be way too expensive to purchase at the same time together. I love the large sizes. I especially love the fact that each item came with the factory seal and were not knockoffs. The products themselves I have found to be excellent even after using only once so far. I am transitioning and may a mistake in mixing products. As a result, I have a lot of breakage and shedding. After using I felt that my hair was moisturized and saw less shedding and breakage. I hope &amp;#34;beauticonic&amp;#34; keeps this deal available through Amazon for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this combo except for the shampoo, it makes my hair hard. I would not recommend the shampoo to anyone.</li>
            <li> My hair was so visibly thin before I invested in this product. I have been using it for 3 months and I have visibly more hair growing out of my scalp and less breakage.And growth!!! My hair is 2 inches longer and stronger than ever. I love the tingle from both the shampoo and the drops. I&#x27;m mixed race with a relaxer and a 3a curl pattern to give you some background on my hair. I have to share the results with all the other women in the world who are looking for a solution; I hope this product line works for you too. Over all I&#x27;m so happy with the results and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> i only tried it once and have seen a positive change already ,hope it continues to work as described.&lt;br /&gt;I had nice long hair but was damaged years ago and could not find the right product to help it to grow back but wit this one I have hope after one application I see great change.</li>
            <li> This is a great system.  However, the shampoo felt great when I applied it but when I rinse it out it was very drying for my 4b African American hair.  Still using the garlic mask and serum</li>
            <li> I will never buy this product again especially the shampoo it burn my scalp turn it red and very itch. I&#x27;ve use different shampoo in past and never had this bad reaction be for. I&#x27;ve use alter ego products for  several years and truly like it but this shampoo need to but check to make sure it&#x27;s not  outdated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trio for about a month now. The shampoo is great and so is the conditioner (which I have used on and off for about 10 years now) and the drops tingle and smells good, but I have not seen a difference in breakage. Every night when I wrap my hair there is still a lot of hair in my sink and when I unwrap it in the morning I see the same amount of broken hair on my shoulders and floors. I&#x27;ll use it until it finishes but I really don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t actually tried all the products yet. But package was carefully wrapped and shipping was ridiculously fast. Will definitely re order. I have been using the hot oil treatment with garlic. First, it is not an oil- it is more conditioner like. However, I was loosing tons of hair int he front of my scalp, used this for the last 4 months and my hair has been growing back immensely. Definitely would reco that product. Will update as soon as I use the others. Again, great shipping.</li>
            <li> My hair used to fall out in bunches. After the first use, I saw a noticable difference in the amount of hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have always used Alter Ego products. These products are high end if your looking to really take care of your locks!</li>
            <li> Love all my alter ego products.</li>
            <li> I was commenting to a friend that my hair was falling out alot lately.She suggested I try Alter Ego. She had recently started using it, beacuse her was becoming very dry. Her sister had told her about it. I ordered the Alter Ego Hair Loss combination set and noticed that my hair was not falling out as much afew washes. I leave the conditioner in for 15-30 mins and my hair is softer and more managable. I find the longer you leave the conditioner in the better it works. This is a garlic shampoo and it doenot smell like garlic. The shampoo and conditioner have a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in my hair before and I will always refer it to someone especially if they have gone natural or in the process of going natural. I have been natural without relaxer for about 5 years and this product doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry and brittle it leaves it very soft and manageable I can even air dry and not break a comb...lol</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a good cleanser strong natural organic scent which is nice to some. The drops were not the correct ones i wanted to get Herbagrow. the conditioning mask is ok. Not my favorite mask but it comes in a huge tub.</li>
            <li> Smells good and I dont feel my hair different but clean and fresh in any case&lt;br /&gt;I dont like to use always the same product , come on time</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I&#x27;ve used it twice and am loving the results. My hair is soft and shiny. Looking forward to the long term results.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been using these products for one month now and I see a big difference in my hair, it&#x27;s healthier and I see new hair growth already. I would highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I think this is amazing trio to have.. if you don&#x27;t know what to get from this brand, I think this is as good as it gets.. It works wonder for processed, dry and hair that gets straighten. Make sure to used it the right way for best results. I always were a shower cop for 5-10 minutes when applying the mask, it helps it makes the hair absorbed the nutrients better.</li>
            <li> Mostly the oil &amp; deep conditioner, its great for weak damaged hair grew my edges back and my hair is getting stronger. Use it every two weeks.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is drying to hair! I used the hot oil treatment for alter ego not the one that came with this package as yet but the one that is in the picture shown and it is not very moisturizing for the hair. I tried cheaper products, whether they were natural or not and had fantastic results! This is just blah! It has an awesome smell, but a sweet scent is not all that I am looking for in a shampoo or treatment. I have african hair. I tried the treatment on another that has natural hair more coarser than mine and she didnt care for the results either. I have a mannequin with european like hair and it was very drying for it&#x27;s hair as well. Neither product gives enough moisture to me by what I saw and felt.The shampoo does clean hair but it strips all the oils from your hair. I used it once on my hair and once on the mannequins. I used the treatment only in a females head. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be using the shampoo in my hair again nless I have an abundant amount of debris in my hair somehow, as this seems to possibly remove it. The treatment? Maybe as a shampoo in a co wash, i&#x27;ll use it folloving a moisturizing conditioner on top of the treatment after it is rinsed out. I&#x27;ll give a next rview soon when I see how everything goes. But so far, I am not a big fan of it.</li>
            <li> All 3 work well together. recommened to me by my Dominican hairdresser. the Nequal helps bring thinning hair (close to bald spot) back. the green one, the Cren helps with growth.</li>
            <li> Its just a conditioner.  This title says oil but what I received was just the Alter ego conditioner.  Don&#x27;t know if I got the wrong product or if its mislabeled but oil it was not.</li>
            <li> This product will let You see results the first time You use it, your hair just gets softer and manageable it will look a lot better from the first time You try it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo it gives you like a tingly sensation when you use it, and the conditioner makes your hair very soft, the drops are great to.</li>
            <li> It is the best for any type of hair. Love how it makes my hair so healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bad, just making me lose more hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair is falling out or if it thinning get this product. If you want to strengthen your hair and make it grow this is the product especially for African Americans</li>
            <li> Great seller!!!! Awesome products</li>
            <li> Amazing treatment for shedding hair.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any improvement in hair loss.  The product costs too much to be as ineffective in its claims.  The conditioner does leave my hair very soft, but perhaps that little quality is what is keeping the hair from strengthening!!! I don&#x27;t know. But it doesn&#x27;t do the extreme of hair growth.</li>
