            <li>My dental health has never been better and our dentist is impressed.  </li>
            <li>Good value for a great product--</li>
            <li>Between this gadget, my dental floss, and a couple of tartar scaling dental tools, I have all I need to give myself a thorough teeth cleaning, which is good because I can&#x27;t afford to go to the dentist</li>
            <li>Good price, good product.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush cleans fairly thoroughly and massages my teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li>they are a good buy, but not for me.</li>
            <li>so batteries are not getting good contact.</li>
            <li>made the brush as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even my dentist approves of the job this brush achieves, so I got a good report card there.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so good.</li>
            <li>never had an electric toothbrush, is good, and I feel my teeth well polished, leaves me a good feeling, but I have to warn you that it is a bit noisy.</li>
            <li>Seems to work good after about a month.</li>
            <li>Good buy for $5</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SpinBrush does a surprisingly good job at cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>Six months after using the SpinBrush, my dental checkup continues to be good - no dental caries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Used them before with good results.</li>
            <li>me take this opportunity to provide a &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; about good dental health:</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>But after a couple of years, he doesnt tell me that any more because this toothbrush is THAT good!</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no need to spend a lot of money on a nice toothbrush that&#x27;s effective!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad for having ordered this one as it works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>

            <li>Got my product quickly, it works great,  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>These clean VERY good in comparison.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clean feel to them :) I would recommend!</li>
            <li>So glad that I did!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>This is not my first battery powered toothbrush but it is the best one ever.  </li>
            <li>I would recomend this to friends and family--I love it and will buy it again !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I like this kind and the stores were always out after I had bought a dud.  </li>
            <li>I have used this kind for about 3 or 4 years.  </li>
            <li>I like just this kind of eletric brush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has more than met my expectations and I would recommend it to any who are looking for a good quality battery operated toothbrush that does the job.</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s my own fault</li>
            <li>Very impressed with this and can highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It was at a great price for my budget (that of a college student) and I am more than pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing one of my own.</li>
            <li>Both are quite effective.  </li>
            <li>I wondered why I would need this kind of brush.  </li>
            <li>With that kind of power supply, it lasts about a year without changing the batteries, brushing two minutes twice per day.  </li>
            <li>it cleans nice</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with being able to purchase these at a really great price.</li>
            <li>for the toothbrush itself, it seems to be very good quality, exactly what is described.</li>
            <li>Good value for a powered toothbrush and replacement heads are plentiful and easy to get.</li>
            <li>A person should though smear a very light coat of Vaseline over the sealing ring on these brushes to keep them nice and water proof...</li>
            <li>excellent value--- Soft brissels--</li>
            <li>It works great and was priced right.</li>
            <li>They really good quality and brushes their teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>Since I have used this type of brush I don&#x27;t get as many cleaning complaints when I see my dentist.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this tooth brush for my wife, She likes it much better that the Oral B brush she has with the removable head.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can just buy replacement heads as well.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd SpinBrush that I have hd and even though the manufacturer has changed, the product is stioll excellent</li>
            <li>Maybe one day I will get a step up from this, but this, to me, works better than my moms $150 water pick.</li>
            <li>Maybe one day I will get a step up from this, but this, to me, works better than my moms $150 water pick.</li>
            <li>I love the way it cleans my teeth so well.  </li>
            <li>Love This Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchases of the Spin brush.</li>
            <li>Ended up ordering two more (for myself and my dad), because the vibration helps with healthy gums.</li>
            <li>My daughter who doesn&#x27;t love to brush, likes to use this as it does alot of the work for you.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>They brush longer and do a better job, which is what I had hopedfor.</li>
            <li>I really liked the toothbrush as it made my teeth look and feel cleaner, but there is a huge design flaw...</li>
            <li>should have known better than to buy an Arm And Hammer product.</li>
            <li>Daughter loves it and brushes her teeth better.</li>
            <li>The brush is okay.</li>
            <li>I got gray, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Cant get any better for the price.  </li>
            <li>It works much better than a manual brush ever will.</li>
            <li>Actually, we use rechargeables, and it&#x27;s worked great!  </li>
            <li>I like this Spinbrush better because of the dual-action feature.</li>
            <li>It makes my boys enjoy teeth-brushing time!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works a lot better than my hand held toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is cheap!  </li>
            <li>It is cheap!  </li>
            <li>My favorite part is the circular top.  </li>
            <li>The inside of my mouth and teeth love the just-right pressure &amp; energy.  </li>
            <li>Love these things.</li>
            <li>Packaging was OK.</li>
            <li>never thought i would ever want an electric toothbrush, but i absolutely love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>For the cost you cannot get anything better.</li>
            <li>and they love them.</li>
            <li>Anyway, love Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>Sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy a better system.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using it after a week.</li>
            <li>My teeth look better, feel cleaner.  </li>
            <li>A good toothbrush at the right price.</li>
            <li>But my teeth feel very clean when I brush</li>
            <li>The Spinbrush worked pretty good while it lasted.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m still using the original batteries!i like the brush cover that is included with it!</li>
            <li>I am truly happy with my new Spinbrush electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the good reviews and love it so much</li>
            <li>I use mine to clean my dentures!</li>
            <li>It scrubs those choppers clean!  </li>
            <li>This is a very good deal, especially for traveling since the Sonicare does not hold a charge for me any longer.  </li>
            <li>For a battery powered tooth brush I must tell you that this Spin Brush by Arm &amp; Hammer is one of the better ones available at this time.  </li>
            <li>so it goes over more tooth surface which is awesome for me, but it&#x27;s harder to clean around a tooth with a gap in between.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li>Makes your teeth feel polished, smooth, and very clean.  </li>
            <li>Some people get food stuck between their teeth easily, others do not.</li>
            <li>yet it fits easily into my travel cosmetic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus they aren&#x27;t always easy to find (the replacements) which is why I looked on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>The Spinbrush helps them work their teeth clean better.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush makes my mouth feel clean every time I use it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t brush for 2 minutes, I brush longer for a better clean and I use my toothbrush with flossing actions</li>
            <li>I like this spinbrush much better than my old one which I thought was good until I got this one</li>
            <li>I would included it works better with a full charge.</li>
            <li>This knocked down a perfect score for the seller.</li>
            <li>Toothbrush is just fine...</li>
            <li>does an excellent job, teeth will be cleaner, smoother in half the time.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super smooth!</li>
            <li>(We are lucky and fanatical brushers), but I most certainly don&#x27;t see why this thing would not be effective in this area.  </li>
            <li>These new battery powered teeth polishers are super effective and easy to use and much better than trying to brush by hand.</li>
            <li>Cheap, but very well made and effective.</li>
            <li>It is far better than a regular toothbrush and the price is just excellent</li>
            <li>Works well enough, not as fancy as some high-end models, but great for the price.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads and batteries are cheap too.</li>
            <li>(an maybe it was the light, but they looked whiter as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an effective devise that works really well in combination with [[ASIN:B001E77OCU Arm &amp; Hammer PeroxiCare, Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide Toothpaste with Tartar Control]].</li>
            <li>The brushes of course need to be changed periodically and they aren&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>but it available cheaper in walmart.</li>
            <li>I guess if you get it at a good price its still better than a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>After every brushing, my teeth feel clean and smooth when I run my tongue over them (no grit).</li>
            <li>It is very great at cleaning every tooth completely and yet inexpensive enough that if you forget it while traveling you can easily replace it.</li>
            <li>It becomes very easy for the water to get inside the battery case, causing the batteries to get wet--and that&#x27;s REALLY bad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We tried many new pairs of batteries from many sources, and none worked.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone that is looking for some nice clean teeth that feels like they just got polished.</li>
            <li>But this toothbrush, paired with flossing daily, will give you almost impeccable dental check ups</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to help my tomato plants pollinate (the vibration).</li>
            <li>Still on original batteries from Dec..</li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this toothbrush since the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>The SpinBrush may be economically priced, but you get a lot for what you pay!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed in this powered brush.  </li>
            <li>Love my toothbrush does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>On the first use I could tell I was getting a more thorough clean than with my manual brush.</li>
            <li>My dentist has complimented me on how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close to a dentist clean.</li>
            <li>Have been using the Oral-B Cross Action for years and was very happy with the purchase, and have even replaced the brush heads probably three times.  </li>
            <li>I keep them clean</li>
            <li>clean couple months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t feel any special.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-A special head that cleans better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral</li>
            <li>Not only will you save money, but I am of the opinion that you will get a better, and more comfortable, clean.</li>
            <li>so I really need to stay on top of my dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>It is very basic, but does a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>True, you can get a 100$ toothbrush and buy $20 replacement heads, but</li>
            <li>As to the results after brushing, the battery ones are just as good as the rechargeable ones and when they finally go belly-up, as all mechanical things to eventually, it does not cost an arm and a leg to replace the things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference in the product and the equivalent Oral-B</li>
            <li>B0045K006K Brush Head Replacements]] are reasonably priced too), and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not like the full brush head.</li>
            <li>good product and brand only wish that the battery had lasted longer</li>
            <li>and we are both more or less delighted with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>do get a better clean than using regular toothbrushes, but it&#x27;s no &amp;#34;Sonicare 31000 brush strokes per minute&amp;#34;, it feels more like 500 brush strokes per minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I had to replace the head after just over a month of use; I don&#x27;t recall changing my toothbrush that quickly before.</li>
            <li>It has helped tremendously in my dental care.</li>
            <li>So overall I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything great, but hey it does brush fast.</li>
            <li>but like this one much more...it seems to rotate much quicker and stands up on its own</li>
            <li>QUICK ARRIVEL</li>
            <li>It seems to be more high powered.</li>
            <li>just the right amount that gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable choice over electric toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li>my whole family is jealous of how cool and cheap this thing was.</li>
            <li>I bought another brush exactly 13 days ago and now this one quit!</li>
            <li>The first spinbrush that makes my mouth/gums/teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the little things in life that bring me joy.  </li>
            <li>but I use mine everyday and it works great.</li>
            <li>my old brush that I was replacing had more speed than this.</li>
            <li>The Oral B version is significantly more powerful and the battery life is a whole lot better than this one and the Oral B only takes 1 AA as opposed to the 2 AA batteries this one takes, how does that make any sense?</li>
            <li>As for me (don&#x27;t laugh)</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>i have really nice, white teeth, but know i wasn&#x27;t spending the two minutes standing there brushing.  </li>
            <li>it worth the $8, yes!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>your money and upgrade, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>Been looking for the right electric toothbrush and this little guy fills the bill very nicely.  </li>
            <li>A spinbrush will always clean your teeth and mouth much better than a traditional brush, but expect to invest in batteries if you want to keep using this product.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is what I was needing, high enough power and does a good job getting stuck food from between teeth and cleaning up the plaque.</li>
            <li>Noticed right away that my teeth looked cleaner</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t quite right after that.  </li>
            <li>It works right out of the package, so there is no need to buy batteries</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>(cheap as the day is long) and then put some toothpaste on top.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re still quite happy with this little eight buck purchase!</li>
            <li>First bought one for my mom and she commented on how it was working well and made her teeth feel more squeaky clean, compared to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It takes a  bit to get used to (buzzing tickles my nose) but it does a great job of getting to every surface with very little effort on my part.  </li>
            <li>So, some jerk 2 blocks from my Dad&#x27;s house has really clean teeth and apparently sleeps just fine at night.  </li>
            <li>at first, i thought maybe it was just the batteries, but after putting in fresh batteries and the speed still not changing-</li>
            <li>This soft version is easy on gums and enamel.</li>
            <li>the Oral-B Brush is actually just as good as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li>They are not too powerful so its perfect for them and the replacement heads are not that expensive either.</li>
            <li>I honestly felt like my fillings were coming loose.  </li>
            <li>We weren&#x27;t too sure that we wanted to be paying $50+ for an electric toothbrush for an 11 year old, but saw this and the decent reviews and gave it a go.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite powerful and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Also the first one that I bought lasted 2 months and then stopped working.</li>
            <li>first off:  i got a bum brush.</li>
            <li>For example, my first brush quit after changing the heads twice.</li>
            <li>This worked great as long as the initial batteries lasted.  </li>
            <li>First time with one of these.</li>
            <li>but my wife thinks it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li>Spend the money and get a higher quality version like a Braun.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll probably get more of this item for her five younger siblings as the opportunities</li>
            <li>at first i thought the batteries are out but 2 to 3 days after replaced the batteries</li>
            <li>The top portion has a circular set of bristles that spins back and forth.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fast and powerful.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>it really gives the fresh from the dentist feel and my teeth feel super-smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li>Not too worried, as it still brushes pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have problems with tartar buildup which accumulates as a thick, cement like crust on the bottom of my teeth, and this brush has greatly slowed the production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it&#x27;s described as.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that I ordered this toothbrush two days ago, and it already got in, which is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>You have to balance effective brushing pressure with the time spent keeping the brush in one area.</li>
            <li>They brush better and last much longer than this cheapo that will just end up in the landfill.</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel extra clean!</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m not recommending that you give up going to the dentist, but this toothbrush goes a long way toward keeping your teeth in a condition in which you don&#x27;t NEED a dentist.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll probably need to be getting some replacement heads soon, but they&#x27;re pretty reasonable as well.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, though, the brush is effective and makes brushing our teeth much easier.</li>
            <li>It is, of course, heavier than a normal toothbrush, but packs a powerful punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too big as my kids (8 &amp; 10) use it just fine.</li>
            <li>Very high quality product.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to be in pretty good shape still, other than the fact that the blue band on the 2mm or so at the end of the bristles has worn away, indicating time for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed at how much cleaner my mouth feels and looks.  </li>
            <li>We really like the battery operated toothbrushes......</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve no idea toothbrush alone could really whiten teeth without whitening toothpaste or anything else.......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to keep my old one and order fresh heads.</li>
            <li>Really makes my teeth feel cleaner when I am done brushing.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really the color that mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like going to the dentist every time you want for cleaning your teeth without paying that much.</li>
            <li>It really did get my teeth cleaner than when I use a manual brush.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes really help.</li>
            <li>Two heads, by the way, cost as much as the brush.</li>
            <li>The brush fit into the crevices in my mouth and reached even my back molar teeth</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable and quality is superb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Gets my whole mouth feeling scoured cleaned.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT A VERY INEXPENSIVE SPIN BRUSH.</li>
            <li>although for the price I think the product was very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just replace those parts instead of the whole toothbrush</li>
            <li>Not broken.</li>
            <li>This is a very convenient compact way to travel and at home.</li>
            <li>Very affordable for a battery powered brush.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>own a few, some in the bathrooms and some for travel and my gym bag.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feels shinier and cleaner when I use this spinbrush, way better than my last professional dental</li>
            <li>good product, slow shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li>brush is an absolute bang for your buck, for eight bucks plus the cost of batteries your mouth is ten times as clean as when you brush manually.</li>
            <li>, I remember vividly the first time I tried a spinbrush.</li>
            <li>You have to use a forceful bending motion (with one hand clutching the top of the brush and the other on the battery cap), like you&#x27;re breaking a branch or something.</li>
            <li>My dentist always comments on how clean my teeth are and the only thing I use is this brush.</li>
            <li>I began using this toothbrush six months ago and my dentist actually accused me of seeing another dentist - because my teeth were so clean between cleanings</li>
            <li>Push the bottom down as the instructed arrow on the toothbrush is very important.</li>
            <li>it is it&#x27;s pretty loud</li>
            <li>and I love the way it stands up rather than lying down on my counter.</li>
            <li>I do wish they offered a product more similar to the smaller rotating tool at the dentists&#x27; office, but I love the way that it feels along my gum line and easily reached the spaces behind my snaggle-teeth.</li>
            <li>The brush head was a little large to fit easily into the back of my mouth, but I did like the brush configuration and thought it cleaned well.</li>
            <li>The brush handle is a little on the bigger side which is not overly surprising</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t brush right apparently.</li>
            <li>Costs only slightly more than the replacement heads for some of the big name electric toothbrushes out there.</li>
            <li>Neither of us has ever had a particular problem with stained teeth</li>
            <li>I had been scoping them out at grocery stores for a while now, but none of them quite seemed to cut it until I happened upon this particular line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular spinbrush (prowhitening) does whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>Nice soft brush and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The handle is nice to hold compared to a thin manual brush handle and batteries are included so you can start using it right away.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the arm and hammer brand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I finally stuck the body in the freezer over night and was then able to open it to try the new batteries (which didn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinsing it under the running water it has gotten all wet and it still works fine, so I recomend it.</li>
            <li>Had been looking to replace our original spinbrush and found this that cost as much as I would have spent to replace the brush head.</li>
            <li>The battery dies very quickly and upon replacing it, I discovered that was due to the water damage it had.</li>
            <li>The soft brush head really do make a difference.</li>
            <li>and i can&#x27;t choose the color its not very impprtant but for some people it&#x27;s important</li>
            <li>I received the Spinbrush about a week or so ago and I am very pleased so far with the product; however apparently the batteries that were preinstalled in it were almost completely dead.</li>
            <li>Just does not seem as powerful as the last unit.</li>
            <li>I never wanted to waste the money on a toothbrush more than $2</li>
            <li>It is powerful (albeit a little loud, but who cares) and is not too strong (I got the soft version).  </li>
            <li>I have progressive MS and this helps me clean my teeth with limited strength in my arms.  </li>
            <li>The soft one is adequate enough.</li>
            <li>But after my mom had a stroke and lost her right arm and got this for easier brushing with her left, she convinced me.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the brush lacked power, but after I used it a few more times, I realized it was a battery related issue and had to replace them.</li>
            <li>go, brush wears out, buy a new one at this price.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.  </li>
            <li>Freezer method worked again and the new batteries are working for now.</li>
            <li>The cost of two replacement heads is almost the cost of a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>You probably need a new brushhead by then anyway.</li>
            <li>Brand new.  </li>
            <li>too loud due to strong vibration.&lt;br /&gt;-Strong vibration makes me feel it might shatter my teeth every time I use</li>
            <li>But it is very loud and clanky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The changing of the head is really easy, you have to twist it a little bit and pull the head so you can attache the new replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that it is more noisy than my other product.</li>
            <li>but my dentist actually told me that I can skip 6 months and only go once a year because my teeth are so clean.</li>
            <li>When I go on vacation and use a regular toothbrush, my mouth definitely doesnt feel as clean.</li>
            <li>You only get one set of permanent teeth so anything to help is a positive right?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found better quality powered toothbrushes at the local discount store for less.  </li>
            <li>She has used it daily since Christmas 2012, and it is still going strong, although we&#x27;ve had to replace the batteries, which is to be expected.  </li>
            <li>This unit has a handle that is large enough to let it stand up by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently paid a little more for an oral-b which is all sealed and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to have any problems like these did.</li>
            <li>You cant brush too hard because it stops, which is great for those with a heavy hand.  </li>
            <li>if at all, and always complements me on my complete lack of tartar and/or plaque.</li>
            <li>I Tried to Change batteries, thinking maybe the batteries were old, but to no avail...very upsetting.</li>
            <li>but they sent me the soft one instead.</li>
            <li>I ordered soft brush but it is medium</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for each of my grandchildren &amp; they are wild about brushiing now.</li>
            <li>For me, I am very picky when it comes to a toothbrush and like the battery powered kinds over the regular manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>i bought this to replace another one I had, just because it was getting old.</li>
            <li>I would rather buy a toothbrush that is on the cheaper end and then replace it when it gets old.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to brush for as long or as intensely and I finish feeling like I came from the dentist!</li>
            <li>My husband says his teeth always feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned, and that&#x27;s quite an endorsement.</li>
            <li>AND HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE.</li>
            <li>She chose the soft bristle and I chose the medium.  </li>
            <li>Ozarksgood as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li>I totally recommend it for anyone who wants to try a spinbrush without paying a lot of money.</li>
            <li>It really reaches to back to the popular cavity hangout behind your molars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for the sling dual action</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised by</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s getting my teeth cleaner than my old toothbrush, but either way, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Twist the cap off to the left and then GENTLY pull it off.  </li>
            <li>Bought these to try out for the whole family before spending bigger $.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Brush head for my old Sonicare toothbrush- $15.00.  </li>
            <li>Bought 2 of these, one for each of my kids 5 and 7 years old</li>
            <li>Lets see how much they last.</li>
            <li>loud, wow had to leave it for guest children.</li>
            <li>As far as electric toothbrush go:&lt;br /&gt;Pro</li>
            <li>Bought a brush with softer, natural bristles</li>
            <li>works very well and the price was terrific.</li>
            <li>Does a much better job than just the regular old fashioned brushes especially if you tend to get rather lazy about covering all the areas and brushing a certain direction.  </li>
            <li>After having the slightly older model for over a year, the rubber protecting the batteries finally broke, and the batteries got soaked, causing it to die.</li>
            <li>both have had several of the rechargeable kind of electronic tooth brushes over the years and while they did a good job they were, alas, rather expensive and truth</li>
            <li>teenage son uses one of these as well and his gums look a little healthier and he gets a better brush than with regular manual toothbrush use.</li>
            <li>Now I have a new brush and replacements to last quite a while.  </li>
            <li>My other Spinbrush was ready for the garbage as the on/off switch slipped to the off position frequently while using it.</li>
            <li>every time I go for a dental cleaning, the hygienist barely has to do anything..</li>
            <li>My advice to you, and I am a medical professional, use this instead of a sonic.  </li>
            <li>This happened to me last time I had the brush as well, and I don&#x27;t remember if it was an old battery</li>
            <li>I own the Oral B version of this toothbrush and I was looking for some alternatives because the replacement brush&#x27;s are so dang expensive for that one</li>
            <li>I got tired of forking out eight dollars or more per shot over and over again</li>
            <li>Then last week while shopping in a local store near my home, I decided to give the Spinbrush a try.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft enough for my braces but &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; enough to give a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get the same or near same quality out of this brush, but found the bristles on this one to be a bit stiffer than the typical &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush and as I noted, this one was actually a bit more than I typically pay at a local discount store for a different branded toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Hand saving, fast and fits the average mouth&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Figured I&#x27;d try something other than the standard Oral B but not quite ready to throw a bunch of money at something to start.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just keep buying these, I&#x27;ll chuck &#x27;em when the first batteries go dead.  </li>
            <li>: The brush can sometimes cause slight irritation from the head whirling even if you are fast.</li>
            <li>The unit itself is long lasting as near as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>I really appreciated getting these because of liking to have extra toothbrushes on hand in case one breaks, which is what happened to one I had previously.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble getting the battery cover off, the reason is that the gasket provides a tight fit to keep the water/moistrue away from the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li>Again, I don&#x27;t see that they bristles are in too bad of condition, but we&#x27;ll be keeping an eye out for a good deal on replacements.  </li>

            <li> My dental health has never been better and our dentist is impressed.  </li>
            <li> Good value for a great product--</li>
            <li> Between this gadget, my dental floss, and a couple of tartar scaling dental tools, I have all I need to give myself a thorough teeth cleaning, which is good because I can&#x27;t afford to go to the dentist</li>
            <li> Good price, good product.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush cleans fairly thoroughly and massages my teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li> they are a good buy, but not for me.</li>
            <li> so batteries are not getting good contact.</li>
            <li> made the brush as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even my dentist approves of the job this brush achieves, so I got a good report card there.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so good.</li>
            <li> never had an electric toothbrush, is good, and I feel my teeth well polished, leaves me a good feeling, but I have to warn you that it is a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> Seems to work good after about a month.</li>
            <li> Good buy for $5</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SpinBrush does a surprisingly good job at cleaning my teeth.</li>

            <li> Good tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Used them before with good results.</li>
            <li> me take this opportunity to provide a &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; about good dental health:</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> But after a couple of years, he doesnt tell me that any more because this toothbrush is THAT good!</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no need to spend a lot of money on a nice toothbrush that&#x27;s effective!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad for having ordered this one as it works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> kind because of the superior cleaning and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Got my product quickly, it works great,  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> These clean VERY good in comparison.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clean feel to them :) I would recommend!</li>
            <li> So glad that I did!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is not my first battery powered toothbrush but it is the best one ever.  </li>
            <li> I would recomend this to friends and family--I love it and will buy it again !</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this kind and the stores were always out after I had bought a dud.  </li>
            <li> I have used this kind for about 3 or 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I like just this kind of eletric brush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has more than met my expectations and I would recommend it to any who are looking for a good quality battery operated toothbrush that does the job.</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s my own fault</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this and can highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It was at a great price for my budget (that of a college student) and I am more than pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing one of my own.</li>
            <li> Both are quite effective.  </li>
            <li> I wondered why I would need this kind of brush.  </li>
            <li> With that kind of power supply, it lasts about a year without changing the batteries, brushing two minutes twice per day.  </li>
            <li> it cleans nice</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with being able to purchase these at a really great price.</li>
            <li> for the toothbrush itself, it seems to be very good quality, exactly what is described.</li>
            <li> Good value for a powered toothbrush and replacement heads are plentiful and easy to get.</li>
            <li> A person should though smear a very light coat of Vaseline over the sealing ring on these brushes to keep them nice and water proof...</li>
            <li> excellent value--- Soft brissels--</li>
            <li> It works great and was priced right.</li>
            <li> They really good quality and brushes their teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> Since I have used this type of brush I don&#x27;t get as many cleaning complaints when I see my dentist.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this tooth brush for my wife, She likes it much better that the Oral B brush she has with the removable head.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can just buy replacement heads as well.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd SpinBrush that I have hd and even though the manufacturer has changed, the product is stioll excellent</li>
            <li> Maybe one day I will get a step up from this, but this, to me, works better than my moms $150 water pick.</li>
            <li> Maybe one day I will get a step up from this, but this, to me, works better than my moms $150 water pick.</li>
            <li> I love the way it cleans my teeth so well.  </li>
            <li> Love This Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchases of the Spin brush.</li>
            <li> Ended up ordering two more (for myself and my dad), because the vibration helps with healthy gums.</li>
            <li> My daughter who doesn&#x27;t love to brush, likes to use this as it does alot of the work for you.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> They brush longer and do a better job, which is what I had hopedfor.</li>
            <li> I really liked the toothbrush as it made my teeth look and feel cleaner, but there is a huge design flaw...</li>
            <li> should have known better than to buy an Arm And Hammer product.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it and brushes her teeth better.</li>
            <li> The brush is okay.</li>
            <li> I got gray, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Cant get any better for the price.  </li>
            <li> It works much better than a manual brush ever will.</li>
            <li> Actually, we use rechargeables, and it&#x27;s worked great!  </li>
            <li> I like this Spinbrush better because of the dual-action feature.</li>
            <li> It makes my boys enjoy teeth-brushing time!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works a lot better than my hand held toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is cheap!  </li>
            <li> It is cheap!  </li>
            <li> My favorite part is the circular top.  </li>
            <li> The inside of my mouth and teeth love the just-right pressure &amp; energy.  </li>
            <li> Love these things.</li>
            <li> Packaging was OK.</li>
            <li> never thought i would ever want an electric toothbrush, but i absolutely love this thing.  </li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> For the cost you cannot get anything better.</li>
            <li> and they love them.</li>
            <li> Anyway, love Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> Sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy a better system.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using it after a week.</li>
            <li> My teeth look better, feel cleaner.  </li>
            <li> A good toothbrush at the right price.</li>
            <li> But my teeth feel very clean when I brush</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush worked pretty good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m still using the original batteries!i like the brush cover that is included with it!</li>
            <li> I am truly happy with my new Spinbrush electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the good reviews and love it so much</li>
            <li> I use mine to clean my dentures!</li>
            <li> It scrubs those choppers clean!  </li>
            <li> This is a very good deal, especially for traveling since the Sonicare does not hold a charge for me any longer.  </li>
            <li> For a battery powered tooth brush I must tell you that this Spin Brush by Arm &amp; Hammer is one of the better ones available at this time.  </li>
            <li> so it goes over more tooth surface which is awesome for me, but it&#x27;s harder to clean around a tooth with a gap in between.&lt;br /&gt;Is</li>
            <li> Makes your teeth feel polished, smooth, and very clean.  </li>
            <li> Some people get food stuck between their teeth easily, others do not.</li>
            <li> yet it fits easily into my travel cosmetic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus they aren&#x27;t always easy to find (the replacements) which is why I looked on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> The Spinbrush helps them work their teeth clean better.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush makes my mouth feel clean every time I use it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t brush for 2 minutes, I brush longer for a better clean and I use my toothbrush with flossing actions</li>
            <li> I like this spinbrush much better than my old one which I thought was good until I got this one</li>
            <li> I would included it works better with a full charge.</li>
            <li> This knocked down a perfect score for the seller.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is just fine...</li>
            <li> does an excellent job, teeth will be cleaner, smoother in half the time.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super smooth!</li>
            <li> (We are lucky and fanatical brushers), but I most certainly don&#x27;t see why this thing would not be effective in this area.  </li>
            <li> These new battery powered teeth polishers are super effective and easy to use and much better than trying to brush by hand.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but very well made and effective.</li>
            <li> It is far better than a regular toothbrush and the price is just excellent</li>
            <li> Works well enough, not as fancy as some high-end models, but great for the price.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads and batteries are cheap too.</li>
            <li> (an maybe it was the light, but they looked whiter as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an effective devise that works really well in combination with [[ASIN:B001E77OCU Arm &amp; Hammer PeroxiCare, Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide Toothpaste with Tartar Control]].</li>
            <li> The brushes of course need to be changed periodically and they aren&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> but it available cheaper in walmart.</li>
            <li> I guess if you get it at a good price its still better than a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> After every brushing, my teeth feel clean and smooth when I run my tongue over them (no grit).</li>
            <li> It is very great at cleaning every tooth completely and yet inexpensive enough that if you forget it while traveling you can easily replace it.</li>
            <li> It becomes very easy for the water to get inside the battery case, causing the batteries to get wet--and that&#x27;s REALLY bad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We tried many new pairs of batteries from many sources, and none worked.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone that is looking for some nice clean teeth that feels like they just got polished.</li>
            <li> But this toothbrush, paired with flossing daily, will give you almost impeccable dental check ups</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to help my tomato plants pollinate (the vibration).</li>
            <li> Still on original batteries from Dec..</li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this toothbrush since the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The SpinBrush may be economically priced, but you get a lot for what you pay!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed in this powered brush.  </li>
            <li> Love my toothbrush does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> On the first use I could tell I was getting a more thorough clean than with my manual brush.</li>
            <li> My dentist has complimented me on how clean my teeth are.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close to a dentist clean.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Oral-B Cross Action for years and was very happy with the purchase, and have even replaced the brush heads probably three times.  </li>
            <li> I keep them clean</li>
            <li> clean couple months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t feel any special.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A special head that cleans better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral</li>
            <li> Not only will you save money, but I am of the opinion that you will get a better, and more comfortable, clean.</li>
            <li> so I really need to stay on top of my dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> It is very basic, but does a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> True, you can get a 100$ toothbrush and buy $20 replacement heads, but</li>
            <li> As to the results after brushing, the battery ones are just as good as the rechargeable ones and when they finally go belly-up, as all mechanical things to eventually, it does not cost an arm and a leg to replace the things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference in the product and the equivalent Oral-B</li>
            <li> B0045K006K Brush Head Replacements]] are reasonably priced too), and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not like the full brush head.</li>
            <li> good product and brand only wish that the battery had lasted longer</li>
            <li> and we are both more or less delighted with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> do get a better clean than using regular toothbrushes, but it&#x27;s no &amp;#34;Sonicare 31000 brush strokes per minute&amp;#34;, it feels more like 500 brush strokes per minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I had to replace the head after just over a month of use; I don&#x27;t recall changing my toothbrush that quickly before.</li>
            <li> It has helped tremendously in my dental care.</li>
            <li> So overall I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything great, but hey it does brush fast.</li>
            <li> but like this one much more...it seems to rotate much quicker and stands up on its own</li>
            <li> QUICK ARRIVEL</li>
            <li> It seems to be more high powered.</li>
            <li> just the right amount that gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable choice over electric toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li> my whole family is jealous of how cool and cheap this thing was.</li>
            <li> I bought another brush exactly 13 days ago and now this one quit!</li>
            <li> The first spinbrush that makes my mouth/gums/teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the little things in life that bring me joy.  </li>
            <li> but I use mine everyday and it works great.</li>
            <li> my old brush that I was replacing had more speed than this.</li>
            <li> The Oral B version is significantly more powerful and the battery life is a whole lot better than this one and the Oral B only takes 1 AA as opposed to the 2 AA batteries this one takes, how does that make any sense?</li>
            <li> As for me (don&#x27;t laugh)</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> i have really nice, white teeth, but know i wasn&#x27;t spending the two minutes standing there brushing.  </li>
            <li> it worth the $8, yes!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> your money and upgrade, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Been looking for the right electric toothbrush and this little guy fills the bill very nicely.  </li>
            <li> A spinbrush will always clean your teeth and mouth much better than a traditional brush, but expect to invest in batteries if you want to keep using this product.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is what I was needing, high enough power and does a good job getting stuck food from between teeth and cleaning up the plaque.</li>
            <li> Noticed right away that my teeth looked cleaner</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t quite right after that.  </li>
            <li> It works right out of the package, so there is no need to buy batteries</li>
            <li> The price is right.  </li>
            <li> (cheap as the day is long) and then put some toothpaste on top.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re still quite happy with this little eight buck purchase!</li>
            <li> First bought one for my mom and she commented on how it was working well and made her teeth feel more squeaky clean, compared to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It takes a  bit to get used to (buzzing tickles my nose) but it does a great job of getting to every surface with very little effort on my part.  </li>
            <li> So, some jerk 2 blocks from my Dad&#x27;s house has really clean teeth and apparently sleeps just fine at night.  </li>
            <li> at first, i thought maybe it was just the batteries, but after putting in fresh batteries and the speed still not changing-</li>
            <li> This soft version is easy on gums and enamel.</li>
            <li> the Oral-B Brush is actually just as good as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li> They are not too powerful so its perfect for them and the replacement heads are not that expensive either.</li>
            <li> I honestly felt like my fillings were coming loose.  </li>
            <li> We weren&#x27;t too sure that we wanted to be paying $50+ for an electric toothbrush for an 11 year old, but saw this and the decent reviews and gave it a go.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite powerful and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Also the first one that I bought lasted 2 months and then stopped working.</li>
            <li> first off:  i got a bum brush.</li>
            <li> For example, my first brush quit after changing the heads twice.</li>
            <li> This worked great as long as the initial batteries lasted.  </li>
            <li> First time with one of these.</li>
            <li> but my wife thinks it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> Spend the money and get a higher quality version like a Braun.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll probably get more of this item for her five younger siblings as the opportunities</li>
            <li> at first i thought the batteries are out but 2 to 3 days after replaced the batteries</li>
            <li> The top portion has a circular set of bristles that spins back and forth.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fast and powerful.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> it really gives the fresh from the dentist feel and my teeth feel super-smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li> Not too worried, as it still brushes pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have problems with tartar buildup which accumulates as a thick, cement like crust on the bottom of my teeth, and this brush has greatly slowed the production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it&#x27;s described as.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I ordered this toothbrush two days ago, and it already got in, which is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> You have to balance effective brushing pressure with the time spent keeping the brush in one area.</li>
            <li> They brush better and last much longer than this cheapo that will just end up in the landfill.</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel extra clean!</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not recommending that you give up going to the dentist, but this toothbrush goes a long way toward keeping your teeth in a condition in which you don&#x27;t NEED a dentist.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll probably need to be getting some replacement heads soon, but they&#x27;re pretty reasonable as well.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, though, the brush is effective and makes brushing our teeth much easier.</li>
            <li> It is, of course, heavier than a normal toothbrush, but packs a powerful punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too big as my kids (8 &amp; 10) use it just fine.</li>
            <li> Very high quality product.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to be in pretty good shape still, other than the fact that the blue band on the 2mm or so at the end of the bristles has worn away, indicating time for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at how much cleaner my mouth feels and looks.  </li>
            <li> We really like the battery operated toothbrushes......</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve no idea toothbrush alone could really whiten teeth without whitening toothpaste or anything else.......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very affordable electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to keep my old one and order fresh heads.</li>
            <li> Really makes my teeth feel cleaner when I am done brushing.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really the color that mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like going to the dentist every time you want for cleaning your teeth without paying that much.</li>
            <li> It really did get my teeth cleaner than when I use a manual brush.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes really help.</li>
            <li> Two heads, by the way, cost as much as the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush fit into the crevices in my mouth and reached even my back molar teeth</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable and quality is superb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Gets my whole mouth feeling scoured cleaned.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT A VERY INEXPENSIVE SPIN BRUSH.</li>
            <li> although for the price I think the product was very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just replace those parts instead of the whole toothbrush</li>
            <li> Not broken.</li>
            <li> This is a very convenient compact way to travel and at home.</li>
            <li> Very affordable for a battery powered brush.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> own a few, some in the bathrooms and some for travel and my gym bag.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feels shinier and cleaner when I use this spinbrush, way better than my last professional dental</li>
            <li> good product, slow shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> brush is an absolute bang for your buck, for eight bucks plus the cost of batteries your mouth is ten times as clean as when you brush manually.</li>
            <li> , I remember vividly the first time I tried a spinbrush.</li>
            <li> You have to use a forceful bending motion (with one hand clutching the top of the brush and the other on the battery cap), like you&#x27;re breaking a branch or something.</li>
            <li> My dentist always comments on how clean my teeth are and the only thing I use is this brush.</li>
            <li> I began using this toothbrush six months ago and my dentist actually accused me of seeing another dentist - because my teeth were so clean between cleanings</li>
            <li> Push the bottom down as the instructed arrow on the toothbrush is very important.</li>
            <li> it is it&#x27;s pretty loud</li>
            <li> and I love the way it stands up rather than lying down on my counter.</li>
            <li> I do wish they offered a product more similar to the smaller rotating tool at the dentists&#x27; office, but I love the way that it feels along my gum line and easily reached the spaces behind my snaggle-teeth.</li>
            <li> The brush head was a little large to fit easily into the back of my mouth, but I did like the brush configuration and thought it cleaned well.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is a little on the bigger side which is not overly surprising</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t brush right apparently.</li>
            <li> Costs only slightly more than the replacement heads for some of the big name electric toothbrushes out there.</li>
            <li> Neither of us has ever had a particular problem with stained teeth</li>
            <li> I had been scoping them out at grocery stores for a while now, but none of them quite seemed to cut it until I happened upon this particular line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular spinbrush (prowhitening) does whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> Nice soft brush and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The handle is nice to hold compared to a thin manual brush handle and batteries are included so you can start using it right away.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the arm and hammer brand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I finally stuck the body in the freezer over night and was then able to open it to try the new batteries (which didn&#x27;t work).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rinsing it under the running water it has gotten all wet and it still works fine, so I recomend it.</li>
            <li> Had been looking to replace our original spinbrush and found this that cost as much as I would have spent to replace the brush head.</li>
            <li> The battery dies very quickly and upon replacing it, I discovered that was due to the water damage it had.</li>
            <li> The soft brush head really do make a difference.</li>
            <li> and i can&#x27;t choose the color its not very impprtant but for some people it&#x27;s important</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush about a week or so ago and I am very pleased so far with the product; however apparently the batteries that were preinstalled in it were almost completely dead.</li>
            <li> Just does not seem as powerful as the last unit.</li>
            <li> I never wanted to waste the money on a toothbrush more than $2</li>
            <li> It is powerful (albeit a little loud, but who cares) and is not too strong (I got the soft version).  </li>
            <li> I have progressive MS and this helps me clean my teeth with limited strength in my arms.  </li>
            <li> The soft one is adequate enough.</li>
            <li> But after my mom had a stroke and lost her right arm and got this for easier brushing with her left, she convinced me.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the brush lacked power, but after I used it a few more times, I realized it was a battery related issue and had to replace them.</li>
            <li> go, brush wears out, buy a new one at this price.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.  </li>
            <li> Freezer method worked again and the new batteries are working for now.</li>
            <li> The cost of two replacement heads is almost the cost of a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> You probably need a new brushhead by then anyway.</li>
            <li> Brand new.  </li>
            <li> too loud due to strong vibration.&lt;br /&gt;-Strong vibration makes me feel it might shatter my teeth every time I use</li>
            <li> But it is very loud and clanky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The changing of the head is really easy, you have to twist it a little bit and pull the head so you can attache the new replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it is more noisy than my other product.</li>
            <li> but my dentist actually told me that I can skip 6 months and only go once a year because my teeth are so clean.</li>
            <li> When I go on vacation and use a regular toothbrush, my mouth definitely doesnt feel as clean.</li>
            <li> You only get one set of permanent teeth so anything to help is a positive right?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found better quality powered toothbrushes at the local discount store for less.  </li>
            <li> She has used it daily since Christmas 2012, and it is still going strong, although we&#x27;ve had to replace the batteries, which is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> This unit has a handle that is large enough to let it stand up by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently paid a little more for an oral-b which is all sealed and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to have any problems like these did.</li>
            <li> You cant brush too hard because it stops, which is great for those with a heavy hand.  </li>
            <li> if at all, and always complements me on my complete lack of tartar and/or plaque.</li>
            <li> I Tried to Change batteries, thinking maybe the batteries were old, but to no avail...very upsetting.</li>
            <li> but they sent me the soft one instead.</li>
            <li> I ordered soft brush but it is medium</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for each of my grandchildren &amp; they are wild about brushiing now.</li>
            <li> For me, I am very picky when it comes to a toothbrush and like the battery powered kinds over the regular manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> i bought this to replace another one I had, just because it was getting old.</li>
            <li> I would rather buy a toothbrush that is on the cheaper end and then replace it when it gets old.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to brush for as long or as intensely and I finish feeling like I came from the dentist!</li>
            <li> My husband says his teeth always feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned, and that&#x27;s quite an endorsement.</li>
            <li> AND HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE.</li>
            <li> She chose the soft bristle and I chose the medium.  </li>
            <li> Ozarksgood as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li> I totally recommend it for anyone who wants to try a spinbrush without paying a lot of money.</li>
            <li> It really reaches to back to the popular cavity hangout behind your molars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the sling dual action</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised by</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s getting my teeth cleaner than my old toothbrush, but either way, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Twist the cap off to the left and then GENTLY pull it off.  </li>
            <li> Bought these to try out for the whole family before spending bigger $.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brush head for my old Sonicare toothbrush- $15.00.  </li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these, one for each of my kids 5 and 7 years old</li>
            <li> Lets see how much they last.</li>
            <li> loud, wow had to leave it for guest children.</li>
            <li> As far as electric toothbrush go:&lt;br /&gt;Pro</li>
            <li> Bought a brush with softer, natural bristles</li>
            <li> works very well and the price was terrific.</li>
            <li> Does a much better job than just the regular old fashioned brushes especially if you tend to get rather lazy about covering all the areas and brushing a certain direction.  </li>
            <li> After having the slightly older model for over a year, the rubber protecting the batteries finally broke, and the batteries got soaked, causing it to die.</li>
            <li> both have had several of the rechargeable kind of electronic tooth brushes over the years and while they did a good job they were, alas, rather expensive and truth</li>
            <li> teenage son uses one of these as well and his gums look a little healthier and he gets a better brush than with regular manual toothbrush use.</li>
            <li> Now I have a new brush and replacements to last quite a while.  </li>
            <li> My other Spinbrush was ready for the garbage as the on/off switch slipped to the off position frequently while using it.</li>
            <li> every time I go for a dental cleaning, the hygienist barely has to do anything..</li>
            <li> My advice to you, and I am a medical professional, use this instead of a sonic.  </li>
            <li> This happened to me last time I had the brush as well, and I don&#x27;t remember if it was an old battery</li>
            <li> I own the Oral B version of this toothbrush and I was looking for some alternatives because the replacement brush&#x27;s are so dang expensive for that one</li>
            <li> I got tired of forking out eight dollars or more per shot over and over again</li>
            <li> Then last week while shopping in a local store near my home, I decided to give the Spinbrush a try.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft enough for my braces but &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; enough to give a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get the same or near same quality out of this brush, but found the bristles on this one to be a bit stiffer than the typical &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush and as I noted, this one was actually a bit more than I typically pay at a local discount store for a different branded toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Hand saving, fast and fits the average mouth&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d try something other than the standard Oral B but not quite ready to throw a bunch of money at something to start.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just keep buying these, I&#x27;ll chuck &#x27;em when the first batteries go dead.  </li>
            <li> : The brush can sometimes cause slight irritation from the head whirling even if you are fast.</li>
            <li> The unit itself is long lasting as near as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> I really appreciated getting these because of liking to have extra toothbrushes on hand in case one breaks, which is what happened to one I had previously.</li>
            <li> If you have trouble getting the battery cover off, the reason is that the gasket provides a tight fit to keep the water/moistrue away from the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> Again, I don&#x27;t see that they bristles are in too bad of condition, but we&#x27;ll be keeping an eye out for a good deal on replacements.  </li>
            <li> We bought this for our 11 year old daughter who wanted an \\&quot;electric toothbrush\\&quot; for Christmas, among other things.  </li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush for quite awhile, but when it was time to change the batteries it was just DIFFICULT!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 8/24/13: My daughter is still using this every day, and for the last couple of months has been reminding me that the little \\&quot;wear indicator\\&quot; build into the brush fibers indicates that she needs a new replacement head.  </li>
            <li> If you have a small mouth, this toothbrush may be too large for you</li>
            <li> so hopefully this one will last just as long or longer.</li>
            <li> be told all of them did not last that long.  </li>
            <li> (low discharge batteries known for their ability to retain their charge for long periods) and my trusty [[ASIN:B001DL9WDG Sony Charger]].</li>
            <li> My one complaint would be that the slide switch to turn it on isn&#x27;t built up enough to give much leverage with your finger and</li>
            <li> Luckily the motor wasn&#x27;t broken and replacing the batteries</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush strokes have slowed down, not sure if the batteries are going dead already, but I&#x27;m not getting that strong spin like i did initially.</li>
            <li> Not very easy to reach the far back of the mouth due to the head size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some people say this doesn&#x27;t work for long</li>
            <li> It is not too soft nor too firm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to brush as long</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for a long time, but wanted to try this one.  </li>
            <li> This is a personal bonus for me, but its head is not large.  </li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s reasonable Prime price also makes it difficult to argue against buying a new replacement spinbrush every 6 months to a year.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one after having used the previous one for several years.</li>
            <li> in all, this is an electric toothbrush that gets the job done, but I feel that it could have been much smaller, and much less vibration and still gets the same performance.</li>
            <li> I bought a spinbrush about a year ago, and when it was time for a new one i scored this one for half the price i paid for the other one!</li>
            <li> It is a little bit bigger than I thought it would be...not a big deal.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not entirely sure of the potential money I would be saving by using a more expensive brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll brush our teeth next to each other and he says it tickles his gums.</li>
            <li> This without applying any petroleum jelly or other such product to repel water.  </li>
            <li> I was a little shocked that Amazon, whose customers mostly received their Christmas packages late, was willing to refund my money for something I didn&#x27;t ask for (a battery charger) but wouldn&#x27;t touch this with a ten foot pole.  </li>
            <li> Last about 6 months, It&#x27;s average.</li>
            <li> Could have gotten the same brush in the dollar store or even my supermarket for about three dollars less.  </li>
            <li> It was 12 years ago, and I remember a few of my friends told me &amp;#34;it makes you feel like you just left the dentist&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I am also a relatively heavy smoker, and I still get compliments on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> Today I regret that decision as I am having issues with the battery compartment not staying closed</li>
            <li> Thought about a plug in type but don&#x27;t like the idea of electrical cords and sinks.</li>
            <li> Of course I got the pink one, just like in the photo.</li>
            <li> After a few days I decided they were unusable and reverted to a regular brush for the rest of the trip.</li>
            <li> Never would have expected an inexpensive item like this to work so well.</li>
            <li> I just starting using my spinbrush a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I just dip the wet brush head in baking soda</li>
            <li> After about a month of using it, the brush has a harder time turning.</li>
            <li> It was just not what I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t seen any whitening effects, but that&#x27;s not really why I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I liked the cleaning ability but am very unhappy with other features.</li>
            <li> They are also very large to hold and awkward for smaller hands.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand my husband does not.  </li>
            <li> Bought this after my other electric toothbrush went out.  </li>
            <li> My other one wore out after 4 years.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> There was red rusty corrosion all inside the battery case :-/</li>
            <li> but I had to replace battery quickly, so I was surprised by that &amp; a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> This brush works very well, sits upright fine and isn&#x27;t terribly noisy.</li>
            <li> works as expected.  not special</li>
            <li> For those of us thrifty types, it is less costly than other high-speed rotary toothbrush systems.</li>
            <li> This is not suggestible to others, head of this brush is so hard and you can get the similar one from 99 cents store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and you don&#x27;t feel bad if you need to throw it away.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than that stupid $100</li>
            <li> I said &#x27;good-bye&#x27; to the over priced sonic toothbrush that was all the rage and that I never liked, and went back to the Spin Brush.  </li>
            <li> Probably not worth buying here.</li>
            <li> and I certainly didn&#x27;t expect these to compare, but I didn&#x27;t count on how loud they were or how violently they would vibrate.  </li>
            <li> Update - I downgraded one star because once the batteries run down I found them difficult to replace especially putting it back together/</li>
            <li> I am 30, and I&#x27;ve been using the spinbrush almost half my life.</li>
            <li> They only problem I had was that I initially found it difficult to open the battery compartment on account of the fact that I have weak hands due to carpel tunnel syndrome.</li>
            <li> I think the previous [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This time, I slightly swapped it.</li>
            <li> teeth are not even a half a shade whiter...</li>
            <li> If so, they are hidden and I&#x27;ve yet to get those benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I go because I hate it when my mouth doesnt feel clean!</li>
            <li> However, this is a minor complaint.</li>
            <li> There is no way that I could manually perform all the maneuvers that this little toothbrush does.  </li>
            <li> Always have, since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> Always have, since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit to get used to my toothbrush basically vibrating in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement brush for one that broke, but I had it for a little while</li>
            <li> Also I was disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean between the teeth as well.</li>
            <li> Spinbrush Prowhitening Battery Powered Toothbrush, Soft]] failed because I didn&#x27;t put that little swap of vaseline around the o-ring to keep the moisture out of where it doesn&#x27;t belong.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use and rough on your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Really gives your teeth and gums the workout they desperately need.</li>
            <li> However, I tried several kinds of battery type of toothbrushes and they were just so so, but not great.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t sell a product with dead batteries.</li>
            <li> its moving every week or not moving at all, have to hit a few time from the bottom to get it moving and stop again..</li>
            <li> Save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> Prevent plastic waste (I&#x27;m a hippy), and get a cleaner mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this one because it has a replacement heads for it and batteries so once it&#x27;s dead or time to change</li>
            <li> or if there was some dried toothpaste in the turning mechanism.</li>
            <li> It is not easy.</li>
            <li> only complaint is when it comes time to replace the batteries, the battery cover can be really tough to remove.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m too lazy.</li>
            <li> After only 4 months the power switch failed to work any longer.</li>
            <li> It hurts my gums too brush with this toothbrush I got sum small cuts from it</li>
            <li> Not the first time they&#x27;ve disappointed.</li>
            <li> That means that this electric toothbrush lasts a shorter time than the ordinary disposable toothbrushes that are supposed to be replaced monthly.  </li>
            <li> I also notice that some batteries are not fitting well into the battery compartment for some reason.</li>
            <li> Now no more complaining, whining, or fear.</li>
            <li> You should pay no more than $6.99.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, even for a woman, and I passed up a lot of powered brushes because I didn&#x27;t think the brush would maneuver easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and of course no more cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will replace brushes of the past.</li>
            <li> brush head is big, I kinda like it and hate it at the same time.</li>
            <li> Like I said, after using this, a normal standard toothbrush is just like a cruel joke.</li>
            <li> i think little bit tough for me</li>
            <li> Again, getting the batteries changed was HARD.</li>
            <li> It does not falter when I press it hard against my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am amazed at how much cleaner my mouth feels and looks.  I should have bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> For a battery operated toothbrush it&#x27;s GREAT. Would highly recommend...</li>
            <li> I like this kind and the stores were always out after I had bought a dud.  I have used this kind for about 3 or 4 years.  My daughter also likes it.  On the other hand my husband does not.  He doesn&#x27;t care for the vibration.  Since I have used this type of brush I don&#x27;t get as many cleaning complaints when I see my dentist.  I like just this kind of eletric brush.</li>
            <li> Just does not seem as powerful as the last unit. On-off switch does not always stay in the on position thus having to hold finger on switch when using at times.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit bigger than I thought it would be...not a big deal. It is far better than a regular toothbrush and the price is just excellent</li>
            <li> I purchased this tooth brush for my wife, She likes it much better that the Oral B brush she has with the removable head. So for it has been satisfactory, the the company shipped it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> We really like the battery operated toothbrushes......you never have to be concerned if it may need recharged while you are on vacation!</li>
            <li> For the price, why get a manual?&lt;br /&gt;This is a great disposable toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries go, brush wears out, buy a new one at this price.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great, I have them at home and at the office.</li>
            <li> Bought this after my other electric toothbrush went out.  This has worked just as well and have no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not recommending that you give up going to the dentist, but this toothbrush goes a long way toward keeping your teeth in a condition in which you don&#x27;t NEED a dentist.  There is no way that I could manually perform all the maneuvers that this little toothbrush does.  It gets into all the nooks and crannies and just brushes the heck out of them.  Between this gadget, my dental floss, and a couple of tartar scaling dental tools, I have all I need to give myself a thorough teeth cleaning, which is good because I can&#x27;t afford to go to the dentist so I really need to stay on top of my dental hygiene.  if you use it correctly, this little machine can save you a lot of grief.  Buy one.  You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> These new battery powered teeth polishers are super effective and easy to use and much better than trying to brush by hand.</li>
            <li> Some people say this doesn&#x27;t work for long but I use mine everyday and it works great. I have had for a month and counting.</li>
            <li> My dentist always comments on how clean my teeth are and the only thing I use is this brush. Of course they tell me to brush daily.. yada yada yada but I&#x27;m too lazy. But after a couple of years, he doesnt tell me that any more because this toothbrush is THAT good! I used to go for cleanings every 6 months but my dentist actually told me that I can skip 6 months and only go once a year because my teeth are so clean. I love the fact that I can just buy replacement heads as well. When I go on vacation and use a regular toothbrush, my mouth definitely doesnt feel as clean. So Ive decided to take this brush everywhere I go because I hate it when my mouth doesnt feel clean! there&#x27;s no need to spend a lot of money on a nice toothbrush that&#x27;s effective!</li>
            <li> works as expected.  not special</li>
            <li> Good price, good product.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve no idea toothbrush alone could really whiten teeth without whitening toothpaste or anything else.......Yet I think this toothbrush works for cleaning teeth. It&#x27;s quite powerful and cleans very well. Combined with whitening toothpaste, it strengthens whitening effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs 2 AA batteries to work. I found that regular batteries hold about 3 months on daily usage. Now I&#x27;ve placed rechargeable batteries. It could be a little difficult to replace the batteries. Push the bottom down as the instructed arrow on the toothbrush is very important. Also the first one that I bought lasted 2 months and then stopped working. Then I bought second one about 6 months ago and it&#x27;s working well now. It&#x27;s very affordable electronic toothbrush. I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good value for a powered toothbrush and replacement heads are plentiful and easy to get. The toothbrush cleans fairly thoroughly and massages my teeth and gums well. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I had to replace the head after just over a month of use; I don&#x27;t recall changing my toothbrush that quickly before.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd SpinBrush that I have hd and even though the manufacturer has changed, the product is stioll excellent</li>
            <li> My other one wore out after 4 years.  A good toothbrush at the right price.</li>
            <li> first off:  i got a bum brush. at first, i thought maybe it was just the batteries, but after putting in fresh batteries and the speed still not changing- I knew it was the brush itself. my old brush that I was replacing had more speed than this. so I returned it. I&#x27;m just going to keep my old one and order fresh heads. but like I said, it was just a bad brush.  probably would not happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, I remember vividly the first time I tried a spinbrush. It was 12 years ago, and I remember a few of my friends told me &amp;#34;it makes you feel like you just left the dentist&amp;#34;.  so, I tried it. that was 12 years ago â€“ I have not gone back to a regular toothbrush since then. I just can&#x27;t. Sometimes I have no choice but to use my boyfriends extra toothbrush, which is just standard, and I feel like I have not even brushed my teeth!!  I can still feel plaque around the gumline. also, I know it has a lot to do with genes, but I&#x27;ve only had one cavity my entire life.  A cavity that I got before I started using the spinbrush.  I am 30, and I&#x27;ve been using the spinbrush almost half my life. every time I go for a dental cleaning, the hygienist barely has to do anything.. if at all, and always complements me on my complete lack of tartar and/or plaque. I floss, but I did not always. The spinbrush has a way of getting in between your teeth and almost flossing for you. Everyone&#x27;s mouth is different. Some people get food stuck between their teeth easily, others do not. But this toothbrush, paired with flossing daily, will give you almost impeccable dental check ups (unless, perhaps, you have poor teeth genetically). Like I said, after using this, a normal standard toothbrush is just like a cruel joke. I am also a relatively heavy smoker, and I still get compliments on how white my teeth are. Granted, I use whitening strips one or twice a year, but I am still impressed. I will admit though, I am somewhat neurotic about teeth brushing (and I am so scared of getting yellow smokers teeth), so I brush about five times a day.  Always have, since I was a little girl. It&#x27;s just something I do. I brush my teeth A LOT. anyway, I will never go back to a regular toothbrush. Maybe one day I will get a step up from this, but this, to me, works better than my moms $150 water pick. ðŸ˜ƒrs teeth), so I brush about five times a day.  Always have, since I was a little girl.

            <li> I was advised by my dentist to start using a mechanical toothbrush.  I went to Amazon and found this product at a very good price and satisfactory reviews.  I am very pleased with this toothbrush.  It is very basic, but does a good job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> I said &#x27;good-bye&#x27; to the over priced sonic toothbrush that was all the rage and that I never liked, and went back to the Spin Brush.  I love the way it cleans my teeth so well.  The vibrations are tolerable, and the sounds against my teeth don&#x27;t hurt my ears.  Or my head.  Save your money, folks.  My advice to you, and I am a medical professional, use this instead of a sonic.  Not only will you save money, but I am of the opinion that you will get a better, and more comfortable, clean.</li>
            <li> Really makes my teeth feel cleaner when I am done brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush Stopped working after one use. I Tried to Change batteries, thinking maybe the batteries were old, but to no avail...very upsetting.</li>
            <li> Great product. I bought two and even though I couldn&#x27;t pick their colors It wasn&#x27;t really the color that mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean feel to them :) I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim.  Figured I&#x27;d try something other than the standard Oral B but not quite ready to throw a bunch of money at something to start.&lt;br /&gt;I Love This Toothbrush.  Reminds me of a dental cleaning.  I highly recommend it.  You can&#x27;t go wrong for this price.</li>
            <li> This powered toothbrush it&#x27;s like going to the dentist every time you want for cleaning your teeth without paying that much.</li>
            <li> When I use it at night, it wakes my dog and cat.  But my teeth feel very clean when I brush and I love the way it stands up rather than lying down on my counter.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchases of the Spin brush. It is not too soft nor too firm. It vibrates  just the right amount that gets my teeth really clean.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush. It took a little bit to get used to my toothbrush basically vibrating in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The Spinbrush worked pretty good while it lasted. After only 4 months the power switch failed to work any longer. I could not get the brush to power on any longer. The brush head was a little large to fit easily into the back of my mouth, but I did like the brush configuration and thought it cleaned well. Overall it was a disappointment although I would have rated it 3 to 4 stars if it had lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, not as fancy as some high-end models, but great for the price.  Costs only slightly more than the replacement heads for some of the big name electric toothbrushes out there.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has more than met my expectations and I would recommend it to any who are looking for a good quality battery operated toothbrush that does the job.</li>
            <li> First bought one for my mom and she commented on how it was working well and made her teeth feel more squeaky clean, compared to a regular toothbrush. Ended up ordering two more (for myself and my dad), because the vibration helps with healthy gums. Definitely feel an improvement in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! My daughter who doesn&#x27;t love to brush, likes to use this as it does alot of the work for you. Nice soft brush and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I always thought I didn&#x27;t need a product like this. I originally bought it to help my tomato plants pollinate (the vibration). I figured I may as well try it though. It really did get my teeth cleaner than when I use a manual brush. I haven&#x27;t needed to change the batteries yet.</li>
            <li> I own the Oral B version of this toothbrush and I was looking for some alternatives because the replacement brush&#x27;s are so dang expensive for that one so I picked this up for the price of a replacement brush to give it a try. Not impressed! The Oral B version is significantly more powerful and the battery life is a whole lot better than this one and the Oral B only takes 1 AA as opposed to the 2 AA batteries this one takes, how does that make any sense?</li>
            <li> It hurts my gums too brush with this toothbrush I got sum small cuts from it so I bought a different brand spin toothbrush and didn&#x27;t have this same problem with it.</li>
            <li> I love these.  They last forever.  Very high quality product.  Repeat customer.  I highly recommend the arm and hammer brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mechanical brushes before but I like this one the best. The soft brush head really do make a difference. You&#x27;ll feel it in your teeth (or not feel it). You will know when you are brushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this. If you are considering it, go for it.</li>
            <li> I feel my teeth cleaner in a shorter time.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it to my mom and she like it too.&lt;br /&gt;soon I will probably buy one for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;The changing of the head is really easy, you have to twist it a little bit and pull the head so you can attache the new replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing it under the running water it has gotten all wet and it still works fine, so I recomend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush for the cost.  It gets the job done.  But it is very loud and clanky.  If you have a small mouth, this toothbrush may be too large for you and I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Had been looking to replace our original spinbrush and found this that cost as much as I would have spent to replace the brush head.</li>
            <li> I think that, considering the price, this is a very good toothbrush. They only problem I had was that I initially found it difficult to open the battery compartment on account of the fact that I have weak hands due to carpel tunnel syndrome. I also ordered the medium brush head but they sent me the soft one instead. However, this is a minor complaint. The soft one is adequate enough.</li>
            <li> I ordered soft brush but it is medium i think little bit tough for me and i can&#x27;t choose the color its not very impprtant but for some people it&#x27;s important i think</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for each of my grandchildren &amp; they are wild about brushiing now. I also purchased a pre-brush rinse &amp; they make a game of brushing now. They brush longer and do a better job, which is what I had hopedfor.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t brush right apparently. I&#x27;m going to have to go to Peru with my wife (where she&#x27;s from) to get dental work done there where it&#x27;s a tenth of the cost it is here for the same work. These toothbrushes really help.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the best battery operated toothbrush on the market.</li>
            <li> I really liked the toothbrush as it made my teeth look and feel cleaner, but there is a huge design flaw... The part at the bottom that connects the battery case with the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t properly stay connected/sealed. This causes 2 problems: 1) during random times you are brushing, the case will pop off just enough for the batteries to lose contact with the top part of the toothbrush and will stop working. 2) It becomes very easy for the water to get inside the battery case, causing the batteries to get wet--and that&#x27;s REALLY bad.&lt;br /&gt;I should have known better than to buy an Arm And Hammer product. Not the first time they&#x27;ve disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 of these and 6 packages of replacement heads for my brothers and sisters who would be home for Christmas when I had to remain out of state.  I had them delivered to the wrong address down the street.  Instead of the person returning them to Amazon, they kept them.  Amazon said they couldn&#x27;t help.  The police dept could not help.  So, some jerk 2 blocks from my Dad&#x27;s house has really clean teeth and apparently sleeps just fine at night.  I was a little shocked that Amazon, whose customers mostly received their Christmas packages late, was willing to refund my money for something I didn&#x27;t ask for (a battery charger) but wouldn&#x27;t touch this with a ten foot pole.  Live and learn.  Do not order on Amazon when you have the flu.</li>
            <li> True, you can get a 100$ toothbrush and buy $20 replacement heads, but why if this one does the same thing?  My dentist has complimented me on how clean my teeth are.  It&#x27;s cheap, and you don&#x27;t feel bad if you need to throw it away.  The replacement heads and batteries are cheap too.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my grandkids to use when they spend the night.  Very good tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I liked the cleaning ability but am very unhappy with other features. For example, my first brush quit after changing the heads twice. Two heads, by the way, cost as much as the brush. Anyway it would not work with any batteries after that. Which brings me to second, unhappy feature. Getting the batter compartment open was almost impossible. I finally stuck the body in the freezer over night and was then able to open it to try the new batteries (which didn&#x27;t work). I bought another brush exactly 13 days ago and now this one quit! Again, getting the batteries changed was HARD. Three people in my house could not open it. Freezer method worked again and the new batteries are working for now. I won&#x27;t buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Works great. It has 2 different motions.</li>
            <li> For me, I am very picky when it comes to a toothbrush and like the battery powered kinds over the regular manual toothbrush kind because of the superior cleaning and ease of use. However, I tried several kinds of battery type of toothbrushes and they were just so so, but not great. Then last week while shopping in a local store near my home, I decided to give the Spinbrush a try. So glad that I did! If you are looking for the best and easiest to use battery toothbrush, here is why I found this one superior to the rest of them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It seems to be more high powered. Noticed right away that my teeth looked cleaner (an maybe it was the light, but they looked whiter as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Design and usability - The brush fit into the crevices in my mouth and reached even my back molar teeth effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Size is compact, could be smaller yet it fits easily into my travel cosmetic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Price is reasonable and quality is superb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are searching for the best battery toothbrush, give this one a try as I think that you will love it.</li>
            <li> I received the Spinbrush about a week or so ago and I am very pleased so far with the product; however apparently the batteries that were preinstalled in it were almost completely dead. At first I thought the brush lacked power, but after I used it a few more times, I realized it was a battery related issue and had to replace them. This knocked down a perfect score for the seller. You don&#x27;t sell a product with dead batteries.</li>
            <li> I was trying to replace my Oral B with the Spinbrush.  They don&#x27;t compare.  They are cheaper made and for the price they are a good buy, but not for me.</li>
            <li> This worked great as long as the initial batteries lasted.  Then it died, and would never work again, not with any batteries.  That means that this electric toothbrush lasts a shorter time than the ordinary disposable toothbrushes that are supposed to be replaced monthly.  We tried many new pairs of batteries from many sources, and none worked.  I think that what happened is that it is so badly designed as far as opening (which is extremely difficult, and impossible to do without not only chipping the bottom cap but also nearly ripping off the battery end, destroying three expensive rechargeable batteries before I realized what was happening), that it is designed to fail.</li>
            <li> i bought this to replace another one I had, just because it was getting old. Today I regret that decision as I am having issues with the battery compartment not staying closed so batteries are not getting good contact. I also notice that some batteries are not fitting well into the battery compartment for some reason. I like this product, just not this last one i got...........</li>
            <li> Great seller. Got my product quickly, it works great,  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> A spinbrush will always clean your teeth and mouth much better than a traditional brush, but expect to invest in batteries if you want to keep using this product.  It comes with batteries and that pair lasted me about 15 days before the motor wasn&#x27;t getting enough juice.  Luckily the motor wasn&#x27;t broken and replacing the batteries made the brush as good as new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the motor is shot, I think I might invest in one of the more expensive rechargeable spinbrushes, but there&#x27;s always that risk of electricity and droplets of water mixing.  So I&#x27;m not entirely sure of the potential money I would be saving by using a more expensive brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product&#x27;s reasonable Prime price also makes it difficult to argue against buying a new replacement spinbrush every 6 months to a year.  It does its job well and I believe I only paid $5 via Amazon prime.  Might be a couple dollars cheaper at a store.</li>
            <li> It cracked one of my teeth so I threw it out.  The FDA recalled this item because it was cracking teeth.  I wished I&#x27;d known this.  Here&#x27;s where I read about the recall:    [...]</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it and brushes her teeth better. Just wish it had a timer for 2 minutes. Still on original batteries from Dec..</li>
            <li> JUst what my dentost wanted me to use. Thanks</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, I&#x27;ve burned through a couple of these though in the years. I suppose it&#x27;s my own fault but I use toothbrush in the shower and over time the seal gets broke to the batteries and needs replaced. I recently paid a little more for an oral-b which is all sealed and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s going to have any problems like these did.</li>
            <li> First time with one of these. Does an excellent job of cleaning. Wish I had bought it sooner. Would recommend to my friends and family. Thought about a plug in type but don&#x27;t like the idea of electrical cords and sinks. This unit has a handle that is large enough to let it stand up by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t choose what color you get. Of course I got the pink one, just like in the photo. It doesn&#x27;t match anything I have but my wife thinks it&#x27;s pretty.</li>
            <li> My kid used to hate to brush his teeth until I got him this. Now no more complaining, whining, or fear. We&#x27;ll brush our teeth next to each other and he says it tickles his gums.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever bought! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my family to take on a trip to Europe.  We use Sonicare at home and I certainly didn&#x27;t expect these to compare, but I didn&#x27;t count on how loud they were or how violently they would vibrate.  I honestly felt like my fillings were coming loose.  They are also very large to hold and awkward for smaller hands.  After a few days I decided they were unusable and reverted to a regular brush for the rest of the trip.</li>
            <li> This is an effective devise that works really well in combination with [[ASIN:B001E77OCU Arm &amp; Hammer PeroxiCare, Baking Soda &amp; Peroxide Toothpaste with Tartar Control]]. For those of us thrifty types, it is less costly than other high-speed rotary toothbrush systems. This soft version is easy on gums and enamel. Even my dentist approves of the job this brush achieves, so I got a good report card there. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Practical stocking stuffer. Go Dad!</li>
            <li> I purchased the brush based on reviews that I heard. The brush is okay. However, the&lt;br /&gt;on-off slider is very hard to move.</li>
            <li> My toothbrush for now on. want use anything else. Battery life last for up to 4 months. U do need to change brushhead every 4 months.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush is just fine...but I had to replace battery quickly, so I was surprised by that &amp; a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wish I could have picked a color.  I got gray, but that&#x27;s ok.  It works great and was priced right.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. I would rather buy a toothbrush that is on the cheaper end and then replace it when it gets old. Works well and my teeth feel extra clean!</li>
            <li> Does a much better job than just the regular old fashioned brushes especially if you tend to get rather lazy about covering all the areas and brushing a certain direction.  its hard to go wrong with this.  The brushes of course need to be changed periodically and they aren&#x27;t cheap so that&#x27;s a downside.  Plus they aren&#x27;t always easy to find (the replacements) which is why I looked on Amazon.com.  I had one of these brushes before but couldn&#x27;t find replacements.  Now I have a new brush and replacements to last quite a while.  The unit itself is long lasting as near as I can tell.  My one complaint would be that the slide switch to turn it on isn&#x27;t built up enough to give much leverage with your finger and so sometimes it takes some extra effort to get it to actually slide and turn on.  Other than that I think its a great product and I plan on buying a couple for my kids as well.  You only get one set of permanent teeth so anything to help is a positive right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update - I downgraded one star because once the batteries run down I found them difficult to replace especially putting it back together/closing after I put in the batteries and it wasn&#x27;t quite right after that.  I guess if you get it at a good price its still better than a regular toothbrush but don&#x27;t count on it lasting by replacing the heads and/or batteries.</li>
            <li> Great product Great seller</li>
            <li> This is my second one after having used the previous one for several years. I think the previous [[ASIN:B000QS59ZM Spinbrush Prowhitening Battery Powered Toothbrush, Soft]] failed because I didn&#x27;t put that little swap of vaseline around the o-ring to keep the moisture out of where it doesn&#x27;t belong.  This time, I slightly swapped it. I gave this one another chance because of the price and the results.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference in results I got from using an standard toothbrush versus this mechanical one.  I instantly felt like I had left the dentist&#x27;s office.  It is powerful (albeit a little loud, but who cares) and is not too strong (I got the soft version).  Very impressed with this and can highly recommend it! I got the standard, non-timed version.  Nothing fancy but well worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it.  My teeth feel so good.</li>
            <li> Spend the money and get a higher quality version like a Braun.  They brush better and last much longer than this cheapo that will just end up in the landfill.</li>
            <li> I cant wait until these companies get sued for false or misleading advertisements. Spin? Stretch of the imagination. Closer to oscillate.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I bought it for myself but my daughter adopted it so now I am buying another one.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement brush for one that broke, but I had it for a little while so hopefully this one will last just as long or longer.</li>
            <li> Cant get any better for the price.  I fell in love with this toothbrush since the first time I used it.  You cant brush too hard because it stops, which is great for those with a heavy hand.  My dentist commented on how great my teeth are looking!</li>
            <li> I am truly happy with my new Spinbrush electric toothbrush. It was at a great price for my budget (that of a college student) and I am more than pleased with it&#x27;s performance. On the first use I could tell I was getting a more thorough clean than with my manual brush. I don&#x27;t need to brush for as long or as intensely and I finish feeling like I came from the dentist!</li>
            <li> good product, slow shipping from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no sonicare but it does the trick when you&#x27;re travelling and don&#x27;t want to bring a more expensive brush along.</li>
            <li> Never would have expected an inexpensive item like this to work so well. I bought it for the good reviews and love it so much I&#x27;m writing one of my own. Really gives your teeth and gums the workout they desperately need. My husband says his teeth always feel like they&#x27;ve been professionally cleaned, and that&#x27;s quite an endorsement. As for me (don&#x27;t laugh) I use mine to clean my dentures!</li>
            <li> My other Spinbrush was ready for the garbage as the on/off switch slipped to the off position frequently while using it. It must be a defect in the brush. I am so glad for having ordered this one as it works great and I don&#x27;t have any problems with the on/off switch. It came with the batteries installed in it. It works much better than a manual brush ever will. I highly recommend this product for anyone that is looking for some nice clean teeth that feels like they just got polished.</li>
            <li> never had an electric toothbrush, is good, and I feel my teeth well polished, leaves me a good feeling, but I have to warn you that it is a bit noisy.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush for the price!</li>
            <li> This brush works very well, sits upright fine and isn&#x27;t terribly noisy. Gets my whole mouth feeling scoured cleaned. Very good.</li>
            <li> I have progressive MS and this helps me clean my teeth with limited strength in my arms.  I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I never wanted to waste the money on a toothbrush more than $2 haha. But after my mom had a stroke and lost her right arm and got this for easier brushing with her left, she convinced me. It&#x27;s close to a dentist clean. My teeth feel great</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 11 year old daughter who wanted an \\&quot;electric toothbrush\\&quot; for Christmas, among other things.  We weren&#x27;t too sure that we wanted to be paying $50+ for an electric toothbrush for an 11 year old, but saw this and the decent reviews and gave it a go.  She has used it daily since Christmas 2012, and it is still going strong, although we&#x27;ve had to replace the batteries, which is to be expected.  Actually, we use rechargeables, and it&#x27;s worked great!  I can&#x27;t see how a person could go wrong with this one.  We&#x27;ll probably need to be getting some replacement heads soon, but they&#x27;re pretty reasonable as well.  We&#x27;ll probably get more of this item for her five younger siblings as the opportunities arise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/24/13: My daughter is still using this every day, and for the last couple of months has been reminding me that the little \\&quot;wear indicator\\&quot; build into the brush fibers indicates that she needs a new replacement head.  I look at it and it seems to be in pretty good shape still, other than the fact that the blue band on the 2mm or so at the end of the bristles has worn away, indicating time for a replacement.  Again, I don&#x27;t see that they bristles are in too bad of condition, but we&#x27;ll be keeping an eye out for a good deal on replacements.  The cost of two replacement heads is almost the cost of a new toothbrush.  But you do get two head replacements for that.  We&#x27;re still quite happy with this little eight buck purchase!</li>
            <li> Seems to work good after about a month. Batteries it came with still work. My teeth feel super smooth! Good buy for $5</li>
            <li> I just switched to a battery operated toothbrush from 26 years with a manual toothbrush.  It takes a  bit to get used to (buzzing tickles my nose) but it does a great job of getting to every surface with very little effort on my part.  The handle is nice to hold compared to a thin manual brush handle and batteries are included so you can start using it right away.  Mine was the blue that is shown in the picture but my husband got a tan color when we ordered one for him a month or so ago.</li>
            <li> I was told by my hygenist to purchase one of these.  I had never heard of this product, so I contacted Amazon.com and they had what I was look for, they seem to always have what I want.  Thank you Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT A VERY INEXPENSIVE SPIN BRUSH. IT WORKS WELL AND HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE. I WOULD BUY ONE AGAIN, SO I CAN SAY BUY IT IF YOU WANT A BATTERY OPERATED SPIN BRUSH.&lt;br /&gt;ALOHA, FRANK ARMSTRONG</li>
            <li> I had a few of these Spinbrush already but this time i got a bad one.. after a month of use electrical got bad. at first i thought the batteries are out but 2 to 3 days after replaced the batteries its does it again its moving every week or not moving at all, have to hit a few time from the bottom to get it moving and stop again..</li>
            <li> For a battery powered tooth brush I must tell you that this Spin Brush by Arm &amp; Hammer is one of the better ones available at this time.  I have been using the Oral-B version of this brush for quite some time now and have been completely happy with it.  Just to be different both my wife and I picked-up this A&amp;H model just to give it a try and we are both more or less delighted with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both have had several of the rechargeable kind of electronic tooth brushes over the years and while they did a good job they were, alas, rather expensive and truth be told all of them did not last that long.  I got tired of forking out eight dollars or more per shot over and over again so we made the switch to these battery operated ones.  As to the results after brushing, the battery ones are just as good as the rechargeable ones and when they finally go belly-up, as all mechanical things to eventually, it does not cost an arm and a leg to replace the things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference in the product and the equivalent Oral-B is the size...I am talking both the head and especially the handle.  I personally like the larger handle but it took my wife some getting use to.  She chose the soft bristle and I chose the medium.  Both are quite effective.  As to the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; factor, I cannot say.  Neither of us has ever had a particular problem with stained teeth (We are lucky and fanatical brushers), but I most certainly don&#x27;t see why this thing would not be effective in this area.  Of course a lot depends upon the toothpaste you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries last quite a while and we have had no problem in this area.  A person should though smear a very light coat of Vaseline over the sealing ring on these brushes to keep them nice and water proof...i.e. follow the directions that come with the brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very happy with this product and will continue using it until something better comes along. Now don&#x27;t take me wrong...the Oral-B Brush is actually just as good as far as I am concerned and I would not hesitate using that brand again.  The price quoted here on Amazon is quite competitive with what we are finding here in the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarksgood as far as I am concerned and I would not hesitate using that brand again.  The price quoted here on Amazon is quite competitive with what we are finding here in the local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush for quite awhile, but when it was time to change the batteries it was just DIFFICULT! I had to get help from men to get it open and they STRUGGLED! You have to use a forceful bending motion (with one hand clutching the top of the brush and the other on the battery cap), like you&#x27;re breaking a branch or something. It is not easy. I purchased it again to see if it would be the same thing and it was. Do not buy it. Save yourself the trouble.</li>
            <li> I was a longtime user of Sonicare (over a decade) until my [[ASIN:B000EHNDD0 Philip Sonicare Elite]] conked out on me a year after I bought it. I decided to give SpinBrush a try because of the low price ([[ASIN:B0045K006K Brush Head Replacements]] are reasonably priced too), and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SpinBrush does a surprisingly good job at cleaning my teeth. After every brushing, my teeth feel clean and smooth when I run my tongue over them (no grit). Six months after using the SpinBrush, my dental checkup continues to be good - no dental caries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life on the SpinBrush is about 3 weeks to a month. I use [[ASIN:B004UG41XW Eneloop]] (low discharge batteries known for their ability to retain their charge for long periods) and my trusty [[ASIN:B001DL9WDG Sony Charger]]. However, the brush head seems to spin faster on alkaline batteries. At any rate, the brush head performance on rechargeable batteries is sufficient to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is when it comes time to replace the batteries, the battery cover can be really tough to remove. I struggle with it every time. But since I have to replace the batteries relatively infrequently, the drawback is tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give the SpinBrush 4-1/2 stars (-1/2 star for hard-to-remove battery cover). The SpinBrush may be economically priced, but you get a lot for what you pay! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought theses for my kids. They really good quality and brushes their teeth really clean. My kids loves them</li>
            <li> This item  has greatly improved my dental care routine. The only problem for me it getting the replacement heads and the battery pack. It has helped tremendously in my dental care.</li>
            <li> I ask my kids to brush for two minutes each night.  The Spinbrush helps them work their teeth clean better.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Oral-B Cross Action for years and was very happy with the purchase, and have even replaced the brush heads probably three times.  I like this Spinbrush better because of the dual-action feature.</li>
            <li> This product is really great for the price! It makes my boys enjoy teeth-brushing time! I totally recommend it for anyone who wants to try a spinbrush without paying a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works a lot better than my hand held toothbrush. Though I&#x27;ve never owned a battery powerd toothbrush I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> My dentist advised getting this.  I wondered why I would need this kind of brush.  Now that I have one, I use it regularly and am just used to it.  I don&#x27;t have to brush as long and I feel cleaner after I use this.</li>
            <li> Just what I hoped for. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Could have gotten the same brush in the dollar store or even my supermarket for about three dollars less.  You should pay no more than $6.99.</li>
            <li> I like this spinbrush much better than my old one which I thought was good until I got this one</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite give this 5 stars - although for the price I think the product was very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The life of this product was subpar.  I have found better quality powered toothbrushes at the local discount store for less.  I was hoping to get the same or near same quality out of this brush, but found the bristles on this one to be a bit stiffer than the typical &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brush and as I noted, this one was actually a bit more than I typically pay at a local discount store for a different branded toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed in this powered brush.  I had been scoping them out at grocery stores for a while now, but none of them quite seemed to cut it until I happened upon this particular line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  It is, of course, heavier than a normal toothbrush, but packs a powerful punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  It works right out of the package, so there is no need to buy batteries immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  The top portion has a circular set of bristles that spins back and forth.  The bottom portion has a regular set of bristles that go up and down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  This toothbrush is fast and powerful.  It does not falter when I press it hard against my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  This is a personal bonus for me, but its head is not large.  I have a small mouth, even for a woman, and I passed up a lot of powered brushes because I didn&#x27;t think the brush would maneuver easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  It is refillable.  I switched to powered for two reasons: Prevent plastic waste (I&#x27;m a hippy), and get a cleaner mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  It is cheap!  Need I say it again?  It is cheap!  I saw a ton of powered brushes than ran $100+.  That is an entire electricity bill, plus another $25 - 30 for refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  My favorite part is the circular top.  It really reaches to back to the popular cavity hangout behind your molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the little things in life that bring me joy.  Like this toothbrush.  Cheap, but very well made and effective.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It is very great at cleaning every tooth completely and yet inexpensive enough that if you forget it while traveling you can easily replace it. I buy the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; for the kids &amp; &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> This is not my first battery powered toothbrush but it is the best one ever.  The price is right.  The inside of my mouth and teeth love the just-right pressure &amp; energy.  Try it.</li>
            <li> I prefer these battery operated brushes to the ones with chargers.  Essentially eliminates some clutter in the bathroom for the periodic price of some AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some, I have had zero issues with water seeping into the battery compartment.  This without applying any petroleum jelly or other such product to repel water.  I keep them clean (no toothpaste residue on the handle) and only put the actual brush part into water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a few, some in the bathrooms and some for travel and my gym bag.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love these things. I bought about 50 heads years back and have to replace the toothbrush motor about every 10-12 months. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the sling dual action</li>
            <li> I just starting using my spinbrush a few weeks ago and I am very pleased. It actually feels like getting your teeth polished at the dentist. This particular spinbrush (prowhitening) does whiten teeth. I was actually surprised by how well. Maybe it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s getting my teeth cleaner than my old toothbrush, but either way, I recommend this product. I&#x27;m now a battery-powered toothbrush convert!</li>
            <li> Quality and low price! And I&#x27;m still using the original batteries!i like the brush cover that is included with it!</li>
            <li> Love my toothbrush does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Bought this one because it has a replacement heads for it and batteries so once it&#x27;s dead or time to change just replace those parts instead of the whole toothbrush</li>
            <li> Good tooth brush. Last about 6 months, It&#x27;s average. Used them before with good results. The deal for them was here at Amazon. Bought 2.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time. Packaging was OK. Both worked. Not broken. A very good deal.</li>
            <li> This is a very convenient compact way to travel and at home. Battery operated so no extra cords or parts to clutter.</li>
            <li> This was on sale for like four bucks.  My wife has had one for years and the dentist noted her improved dental condition.  I have had a Sonicare for a long time, but wanted to try this one.  The Sonicare is like seventy bucks and the replacement heads about eight.  Here is an advantage to this unit that is not provided in the product description: it runs on TWO DOUBLE A BATTERIES!  With that kind of power supply, it lasts about a year without changing the batteries, brushing two minutes twice per day.  And the unit comes with TWO DURACELL BATTERIES already installed in the package.  This is a very good deal, especially for traveling since the Sonicare does not hold a charge for me any longer.  If you have trouble getting the battery cover off, the reason is that the gasket provides a tight fit to keep the water/moistrue away from the battery compartment.  Twist the cap off to the left and then GENTLY pull it off.  This is a very nice unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me take this opportunity to provide a &amp;#34;secret&amp;#34; about good dental health: cavities are caused by an acidic ph imbalance in the mouth.  Sugars are acidic and that is why they promote tooth decay.  It is necessary to change the ph balance in your mouth to neutral, just like you change/monitor the ph balance in your pool.  If it is out of balance, algae will grow in your pool.  The way to keep your mouth with the proper ph balance is to use baking soda along with toothpaste when you brush.  I just dip the wet brush head in baking soda (cheap as the day is long) and then put some toothpaste on top.  My dental health has never been better and our dentist is impressed.  My bi-annual cleaning is now done in no time at all because I have no plaque build-up, and of course no more cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
            <li> Bought these to try out for the whole family before spending bigger $. We are definitely converters from manual. These clean VERY good in comparison. The brush handle is a little on the bigger side which is not overly surprising considering it is battery operated. Not too big as my kids (8 &amp; 10) use it just fine. They like the tickle sensation it gives them. Mom &amp; Dad are still getting used to it. ;)</li>
            <li> never thought i would ever want an electric toothbrush, but i absolutely love this thing.  i have really nice, white teeth, but know i wasn&#x27;t spending the two minutes standing there brushing.  this does it for you, you just hang onto it and move it around your mouth.  it really gives the fresh from the dentist feel and my teeth feel super-smooth afterward.  i&#x27;ll never go back to a regular brush!</li>
            <li> After about a month of using it, the brush has a harder time turning. This happened to me last time I had the brush as well, and I don&#x27;t remember if it was an old battery or if there was some dried toothpaste in the turning mechanism. Not too worried, as it still brushes pretty well.</li>
            <li> After having the slightly older model for over a year, the rubber protecting the batteries finally broke, and the batteries got soaked, causing it to die. (I am not gentle with my toothbrush, nor do I take too much care with how wet it gets; mom and I got same brush at same time, and hers still works great)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great replacement, at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;It shipped fast!&lt;br /&gt;I will probably never in my life switch back to a manual toothbrush, or trade from this brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I began using this toothbrush six months ago and my dentist actually accused me of seeing another dentist - because my teeth were so clean between cleanings (I get my teeth cleaned once a year instead of every six months). I have problems with tartar buildup which accumulates as a thick, cement like crust on the bottom of my teeth, and this brush has greatly slowed the production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is an absolute bang for your buck, for eight bucks plus the cost of batteries your mouth is ten times as clean as when you brush manually. Worth it!</li>
            <li> Brushing your teeth with this toothbrush is like brushing your teeth with a baseball bat but I kinda like that! I gotta give it to &#x27;em...It scrubs those choppers clean!  It&#x27;s much better than that stupid $100 Sonicare toothbrush my dentist screwed me on.  I&#x27;ll just keep buying these, I&#x27;ll chuck &#x27;em when the first batteries go dead.  You probably need a new brushhead by then anyway. You can&#x27;t beat it for five bucks....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush head for my old Sonicare toothbrush- $15.00.  Nope.  No way.  Not anymore...Those days are over....</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I have ever used. I really love this.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best I have ever used. I do wish they offered a product more similar to the smaller rotating tool at the dentists&#x27; office, but I love the way that it feels along my gum line and easily reached the spaces behind my snaggle-teeth. I have used the same one for over 3 years now! I have only NEEDED to replace the head twice. Durable bristles. I do run through a lot of batteries though.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush makes my mouth feel clean every time I use it. I would recommend this brand of toothbrush to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used the electric (battery operated) toothbrush at night and a hand held in the morning.  This is the 2nd or 3rd I have bought over the years.  For the cost you cannot get anything better.</li>
            <li> excellent value--- Soft brissels--Good value for a great product-- I would recomend this to friends and family--I love it and will buy it again !</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these, one for each of my kids 5 and 7 years old and they love them. They are not too powerful so its perfect for them and the replacement heads are not that expensive either. Lets see how much they last.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Brand new.  It was just not what I expected it to be.  I do not like the full brush head.</li>
            <li> I really do like this toothbrush - it was what we have been using in our home over the last few years. Sometimes, though, the battery connections are not great. Other than that, though, the brush is effective and makes brushing our teeth much easier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for 5 weeks now, and guess what?&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are not even a half a shade whiter...false advertising Arm &amp; Hammer for saying &amp;#34;whiter teeth in 7 days&amp;#34;. Maybe they should retract that statement as there are no whitening agents in this toothbrush. If so, they are hidden and I&#x27;ve yet to get those benefits.&lt;br /&gt;I subtracted stars for the lack of whitening, which was the reason for buying this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 star rating can improve if they fix the things I&#x27;ve mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I do get a better clean than using regular toothbrushes, but it&#x27;s no &amp;#34;Sonicare 31000 brush strokes per minute&amp;#34;, it feels more like 500 brush strokes per minute.&lt;br /&gt;The brush strokes have slowed down, not sure if the batteries are going dead already, but I&#x27;m not getting that strong spin like i did initially. I&#x27;ll change batteries to see if the speed improves.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t brush for 2 minutes, I brush longer for a better clean and I use my toothbrush with flossing actions so I can feel the air go through my teeth when I&#x27;m done. My teeth feels shinier and cleaner when I use this spinbrush, way better than my last professional dental clean couple months ago.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is big, I kinda like it and hate it at the same time. It&#x27;s big so it goes over more tooth surface which is awesome for me, but it&#x27;s harder to clean around a tooth with a gap in between.&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth the $8, yes!!&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this? Yes!!!&lt;br /&gt;My teenage son uses one of these as well and his gums look a little healthier and he gets a better brush than with regular manual toothbrush use. His breath is even better ðŸ˜¬, hahahaaaa!!</li>
            <li> This brush is soft enough for my braces but &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; enough to give a thorough cleaning. The first spinbrush that makes my mouth/gums/teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> They sent me silver-gold and thought I was getting purple o r blue. Anyway, love Spinbrush. Very affordable for a battery powered brush.</li>
            <li> Works great, only recommendation is that they try to use batteries that last longer than a week.That would have saved me the extra expense etc.</li>
            <li> works as advertised. came with an extra brush head as an added bonus. have been using it for several days now without a problem. Walmart has these for about the same price.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of this toothbrush. May be I am not used to using motorized toothbrush. May be it is for you but it available cheaper in walmart. Probably not worth buying here.</li>
            <li> This product works well. The only issue I have is that it is more noisy than my other product. Good value.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it&#x27;s described as. This toothbrush is what I was needing, high enough power and does a good job getting stuck food from between teeth and cleaning up the plaque. However, I haven&#x27;t seen any whitening effects, but that&#x27;s not really why I ordered it. Lower price than anywhere else is a bonus!</li>
            <li> loud, wow had to leave it for guest children. Won&#x27;t buy it again&lt;br /&gt;save your money and upgrade, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s an electric tooth brush, it&#x27;s got a custom head etc. Sure it cleans nice but it doesn&#x27;t feel any special. I didn&#x27;t notice that drastic a change in tooth whitening in 7 days tbh. Also I was disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean between the teeth as well. I still needed to floss. So overall I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything great, but hey it does brush fast.</li>
            <li> my whole family is jealous of how cool and cheap this thing was. they are all going to get one because of me. you guys owe me one!!</li>
            <li> As far as electric toothbrush go:&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;-Clean teeth nicely&lt;br /&gt;-The handle is big enough to stand on its own.&lt;br /&gt;-A special head that cleans better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral&lt;br /&gt;-The handle is BIG, as in you can put in two AA batteries big! Personally I do not like it, but others might feel different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;-Way too loud due to strong vibration.&lt;br /&gt;-Strong vibration makes me feel it might shatter my teeth every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is an electric toothbrush that gets the job done, but I feel that it could have been much smaller, and much less vibration and still gets the same performance.</li>
            <li> Hard to use and rough on your teeth and gums. I&#x27;d buy a better system.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using it after a week. Bought a brush with softer, natural bristles</li>
            <li> I bought a spinbrush about a year ago, and when it was time for a new one i scored this one for half the price i paid for the other one!</li>
            <li> Very reasonable choice over electric toothbrushes!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I had the Oral-B but like this one much more...it seems to rotate much quicker and stands up on its own</li>
            <li> My husband and I use these toothbrushes regularly, so when I saw them on sale on Amazon, I jumped on purchasing them because I got 2 toothbrushes for the price of one! I really appreciated getting these because of liking to have extra toothbrushes on hand in case one breaks, which is what happened to one I had previously. So this was a very great buy and I was pleased with being able to purchase these at a really great price.</li>
            <li> Makes your teeth feel polished, smooth, and very clean.  It feels like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist and had a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.  It takes two double A&#x27;s; not a biggie.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is it&#x27;s pretty loud and you can hear it going in any room your in.</li>
            <li> works very well and the price was terrific. no complaints at all. I would definitely get another one. thats it.</li>
            <li> good product and brand only wish that the battery had lasted longer so I gave 4 out of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Been looking for the right electric toothbrush and this little guy fills the bill very nicely.  My teeth look better, feel cleaner.  I would HIGHLY recommend this.  Great price, does a great job.</li>
            <li> awful product! The battery dies very quickly and upon replacing it, I discovered that was due to the water damage it had. There was red rusty corrosion all inside the battery case :-/ you would think a product meant to be used with water wouldn&#x27;t have that problem. We got a week use out of these and had to throw them away. All three of them did the same thing.</li>
            <li> GREAT TOOTH BRUSH !!! WILL NOT GO BACK TO MANUAL ...TEETH FEEL VERY CLEAN!!!! QUICK ARRIVEL</li>
            <li> Will never go back to a reg toothbrush</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. She says her teeth feel cleaner than when she used her regular brush.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I ordered this toothbrush two days ago, and it already got in, which is outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;As for the toothbrush itself, it seems to be very good quality, exactly what is described.</li>
            <li> I GOT IT FOR A GRANDCHILD FOR CHRISTMAS AND I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY.  IF IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK, I WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED.</li>
            <li> I works and my teeths feel cleaner after each use of this product. I would included it works better with a full charge.</li>
            <li> This is not suggestible to others, head of this brush is so hard and you can get the similar one from 99 cents store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful to not require extra pressure using this toothbrush. Like any item there are pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Hand saving, fast and fits the average mouth&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The brush can sometimes cause slight irritation from the head whirling even if you are fast. You have to balance effective brushing pressure with the time spent keeping the brush in one area. Not very easy to reach the far back of the mouth due to the head size.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the purchase.</li>
            <li> does an excellent job, teeth will be cleaner, smoother in half the time. Would be great if it came with a cover to travel with or when leaving in medince cabinet. This will replace brushes of the past.</li>
