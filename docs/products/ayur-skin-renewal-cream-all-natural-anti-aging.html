    <ol>
            <li>Great scam artists!</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any thing real great about this cream.</li>
            <li>Companies purposely do this when they don&#x27;t even stand for their own product!</li>
            <li>A wonderful and pleasant smelling cream which goes a long way....could not be more happier with the incredible results in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>Feels very light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>The hype was better than the results.</li>
            <li>Save your money and get better results with any drug store product at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>I looked it up because I am breastfeeding, and I am so glad I did before I even tried it.  </li>
            <li>That on top of all the money it cost for a so called free trail in which it was not</li>
            <li>I would never recommend the Ayur Renewal skin cream or any of their products even if they were free.</li>
            <li>while the box was secure the product looked used and the pump did not work</li>
            <li>Do not believe it when their ad promises a free 2 week trial.</li>
            <li>This is a scam...not a free trial at all.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Luckily my credit card company alerted me and I cancelled my card.</li>
            <li>Not quite worth the price.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t even worth a 1 star!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>this did nothing more for my face than any other cheap face cream has done.</li>
            <li>I think instead of spending the money on a fancy package  get a fancy product first.</li>
            <li>Funny smell, not moisturizing.</li>
            <li>A real ripoff!</li>
            <li>Deceptive advertising from the company in so much as DR OZ  </li>
            <li>They really did their homework of how to extract as much money out of us as they can.</li>
            <li>Much deception.</li>
            <li>The only thing it&#x27;s worth is throwing in the trash, because you can&#x27;t even give it away!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product because it will cost you more than you bargained for.</li>
            <li>Live and learn...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try something new, but it does seem a bit pricey for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel as creamy during application as I expected it to - more a dry feeling - but it made my skin feel quite soft.  </li>
            <li>I think this works very well on younger people.  </li>
            <li>The area around my eyes developed a rash that I have been trying to heal since then.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a very expensive cream that doesn&#x27;t do anything more than any cheap drugstore cream.</li>
            <li>There is not one single positive comment on this stream.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Ayur Skin Renewal Cream in conjunction with the Wrinkless Cream for a little over a week, and I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvements regarding the wrinkles on my neck area.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It is working very well on the small wrinkles and lifting my eye brows.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s nice, very expensive cream, but nothing as miraculous as it claims to be!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, would give this a zero if I could.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I started using it too late to get the professed refund, but there are so many restrictions on refunding the item that it was impossible to get my money back.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Feels very light and non greasy. But didn&#x27;t do what it said - no change in appearance of skin.  Bought to work with Beaute MD Aging Solution Moisturizer.  Won&#x27;t buy either again.</li>
            <li> Deceptive advertising from the company in so much as DR OZ  has he ever endorsed this product. As a skincareperson, this cream is cheap and nasty and does not work. I think instead of spending the money on a fancy package  get a fancy product first. I bought this product to test for a client and all it did was give me zits and a rash all over my face and neck. That on top of all the money it cost for a so called free trail in which it was not</li>
            <li> The hype was better than the results. Not quite worth the price.</li>
            <li> expensive and deceptive.  Did nothing and it was a  terrible experience.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, would give this a zero if I could.  Save your money and get better results with any drug store product at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  haven&#x27;t used it long enough to offer an opinion.  however, will continue to use it for another month.</li>
            <li> This product is JUNK! After applying, it turns to a clay, chalk, powder like substance leaving your skin flaky as if you have terrible dry skin! It shouldn&#x27;t have even made it to the market! The only thing it&#x27;s worth is throwing in the trash, because you can&#x27;t even give it away! This isn&#x27;t even worth a 1 star!&lt;br /&gt;If you go to their website, you will see that you can&#x27;t even write a review! Companies purposely do this when they don&#x27;t even stand for their own product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, very expensive cream, but nothing as miraculous as it claims to be!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your $$!!! This is just another bad face lotion &amp; EXTREMELY expensive! Does NOT live up to any promises. RUN away from this product now!</li>
            <li> expensive, deceptive and definitely not worth the money.  Unfortunately I started using it too late to get the professed refund, but there are so many restrictions on refunding the item that it was impossible to get my money back.  The reception I got from their customer service line reinforced the impression I had of the company.  They use the image of Dr. Oz, who DOES NOT endorse this product, to increase sales of duped customers like me. BEWARE and don&#x27;t buy it.  It did nothing for my skin and it is doubtful it will for others.  There is not one single positive comment on this stream.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as well as I expected it to do.</li>
            <li> The company is the worst company I have ever dealt with.  Their products are all inferior and do not stand up to their advertising.  Customer service sucks and I would never recommend the Ayur Renewal skin cream or any of their products even if they were free.</li>
            <li> I think this works very well on younger people.  I have some deep set wrinkles that is doesn&#x27;t faze, However having said that,&lt;br /&gt;It is working very well on the small wrinkles and lifting my eye brows.  V. Carpenter</li>
            <li> A wonderful and pleasant smelling cream which goes a long way....could not be more happier with the incredible results in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I would not repurchase this item. while the box was secure the product looked used and the pump did not work and when I tried to fix it the pump broke off. IT&#x27;S not returnable so I am out the miney. Very bad experience!</li>
            <li> Funny smell, not moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Ayur Skin Renewal Cream in conjunction with the Wrinkless Cream for a little over a week, and I haven&#x27;t noticed much improvements regarding the wrinkles on my neck area.</li>
            <li> Great scam artists! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product because it will cost you more than you bargained for.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE...DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.....</li>
            <li> I started using this cream in conjunction with aloe Vella cream about two months ago. The area around my eyes developed a rash that I have been trying to heal since then. One lesson learned from this is to ignore the hype associated with these miracle creams advertised on the Internet. I&#x27;ve gone back to Clarins and am starting to heal the rash. I&#x27;d give this zero stars.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any thing real great about this cream. It was very expensive.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  Will continue using  with hopes that it will help my skin.</li>
            <li> If there was a Zero Stars rating, I&#x27;d give it that.  It did nothing for me and the price was crazy expensive.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I wish I had read reviews on this product before I purchased it.  Live and learn...</li>
            <li> this did nothing more for my face than any other cheap face cream has done. I wish there was a zero rating for this. I felt I wasted my hard earned money. the only expensive thing I see in the cream is the marketing around it. They really did their homework of how to extract as much money out of us as they can. Much deception. I would not buy anything from this company as they were not going to return my money. Do not believe it when their ad promises a free 2 week trial.</li>
            <li> Sticky, stinky, smelly.  A real ripoff!</li>
            <li> I did like this cream .  It didn&#x27;t feel as creamy during application as I expected it to - more a dry feeling - but it made my skin feel quite soft.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try something new, but it does seem a bit pricey for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> it just seems to work...</li>
            <li> I wish I could give zero stars! This is a scam...not a free trial at all. And it&#x27;s a very expensive cream that doesn&#x27;t do anything more than any cheap drugstore cream.</li>
            <li> really high price with  useless product, terrible service and support, Folks, DONT DONT DONT waste your hard money with this garbage!!!</li>
            <li> This cream contains an ingredient called indian madder, which is considered UNSAFE per webmd, it is known to cause CANCER, do not use, it can cause birth defects as well.  I looked it up because I am breastfeeding, and I am so glad I did before I even tried it.  Also the company just charged my card $139  without my consent.  Luckily my credit card company alerted me and I cancelled my card.</li>
            <li> They tell you to put the two creams together but do not say if it should be equal amounts or what</li>
