            <li>So, results are best when shampoo, conditioner, serum and hairspray are used together.</li>
            <li>Very good product &amp; gives my hair the volume I need!</li>
            <li>I really am impressed and realize buying all three products is probably what did it.  </li>

            <li>It might be a good conditioner for anyone of any age with break-outs.)    </li>

            <li>My hair looked amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product; it really does make my hair appear thicker.</li>
            <li>Amazing I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>But, I love my cut.</li>
            <li>It looked as if I had grown more hair overnight.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of conditioners and there isn&#x27;t anything better at any price point.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it, too, and his hair is thinning on top.</li>
            <li>and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years and just love it.</li>
            <li>My hair seems fuller and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look very full &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I have stress hair loss so there are times when nothing helps that too much; but this is a good product over-all.</li>
            <li>My paddle brush and comb ran easily through my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was so full, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a fine conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to result in thicker or fuller hair for me and neither does the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I also use the shampoo on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I forgot to research if the products were sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll try RegenePure products that are sulfate free and also claim to stimulate hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I found much more success with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have very, very baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>They just leave my hair smelling clean and fresh.   </li>
            <li>After even a quick wash, my hair feels too squeaky and crispy.</li>
            <li>I have always had fine hair and after chemo and radiation it really thinned out.</li>
            <li>I liked this conditioner at first, i had bought the shampoo in another store so i though i give it a try, at first it made my hair nice and soft, but the longer i used it, it did not give me the same result.</li>
            <li>(shoulder length, color treated/gray/coarse), doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like heavier conditions do, and has a nice, clean \\&quot;generic\\&quot; herbal type scent that doesn&#x27;t linger after rinsing.     </li>
            <li>My hair wasnt soft or easy to brush through.  </li>
            <li>I then applied a small amount of Enjoy smooth and shine to add more sheen.</li>
            <li>It was also smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the matching conditioner anywhere in any local stores (Walgreens and Kroger carry the shampoo), so I was glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Gives hair thicker appearance, and more importantly doesn&#x27;t weight it down.</li>
            <li>The first week, I saw nothing, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and definitely notice my hair looks full!  </li>
            <li>I brushed out the curl, added a little more Enjoy smooth and shine and the hairspray.</li>
            <li>It may work better on fine hair, not sure.  </li>
            <li>My thinning area really shows now.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li>This product de-tangles my hair VERY well</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need too much either.  </li>
            <li>Please change the scent back to the original.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this conditioner a couple of times and so far i have seen a change within my hair less breakage  and more thickness/bounce. :)</li>
            <li>He likes the body it gives his hair, i.e., it doesn&#x27;t weigh down his hair on top like heavier conditions will.     </li>
            <li>I love that the products have little to no scent.</li>
            <li>Make sure and use something else here and there too, otherwise TFH will gum up your hair a little</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see my scalp yet, but it is getting there and in places my hair wants to naturally part</li>
            <li>I have normal hair but not a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed that this product&#x27;s scent was recently changed to having a very pungent, \\&quot;chemically-strong\\&quot; smell that is unwelcomed, certainly in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before so it wasn&#x27;t anything new.  </li>
            <li>I highly  recommend this for fine, limp hair and for guys who may not have the amount of hair they did in their youth.</li>
            <li>However, that only happened for the first week.</li>
            <li>does not work well on fine, limp</li>
            <li>Too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Sometimes hard to find in stores, it is available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Was I surprised.  </li>
            <li>This product won&#x27;t make your feel soft and silky but it will make it stronger and thicker.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CANNOT see my scalp even on the areas that want to part naturally, it&#x27;s covered.  </li>
            <li>I would reccomend this product to any one who has thin  hair or just wants more fullness</li>
            <li>It took a while for my hair to get back to normal softness.  </li>
            <li>Other strengthening products don&#x27;t do very much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Instantly Thick, Thickening Serum, which seems to add some fullness and texture to my fine and thinning hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good, basic conditioner and works well on my dry, aging hair (I&#x27;m 55 and used to have oily thin hair</li>
            <li>A lot of conditioners have tallow in them, apparently.</li>
            <li>When I first started using them it looked like I was losing less hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried other such products and either they felt like vasoline, had too much fragrance or just didn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li> If you have very thin hair like me, go easy on the conditioner - I put a tiny drop on the ends of my hair only.</li>
            <li> I then flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for a friend with fine, thin hair due to meds</li>
            <li> I am African American with relaxed hair that is thinning in the crown area, due to medications.   </li>
            <li> Left my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> you do end up with thicker fuller hair, as long as you don&#x27;t expect miracles.  </li>
            <li> I will stay with this product as long as I still have hair.</li>
            <li> After allowing my hair to air dry, I applied DermMatch to the thinning areas in the crown.</li>
            <li> I combed the DermMatch through my hair until my hair was completely dry.</li>
            <li> I had rolled my hair dry and got curl and body.</li>
            <li> When I dry my hair it looks too lifeless and just sticks up because it lacks any weight...</li>
            <li> Although my hair felt a little stiff from the spray, it really wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product not only makes fuller thicker hair,but also seems healthier than previously.</li>
            <li> A few days later, I decided to wash my hair and try the other products.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it feels like it washes off all the oils that my scalp needs.</li>
            <li> ; this product detangles without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> I had to use about half the bottle to ensure that all my hair was covered.</li>
            <li> Before bedtime, I put a few of the foam rollers that are wrapped with satin in the crown area.</li>
            <li> I blew dried my hair and shall put some curls in it with a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it and it just made my hair dried out after taking a shower.  </li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner with the shampoo because I&#x27;ve been losing hair in the shower everyday for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s dry thin hair).</li>
            <li> My hair is normally hard to curl even when I use setting lotion.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s what has worked, at least for me, using all three products.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive salon conditioners that don&#x27;t work half as well</li>
            <li> A few years ago I purchased the shampoo and was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also discontinued the use of DermMatch, because I am tired of it getting under my fingernails each time I massage my scalp.</li>
            <li> and I think it has made a difference because my thin hair does feel thicker.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was doing something wrong??</li>
            <li> Am disappointed it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My bad!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has a terrible chemical smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Somehow works on me because I ve used it for one year. It just prevents hair loss, not recover my hair</li>
            <li> I am African American with relaxed hair that is thinning in the crown area, due to medications.   I recently cut my shoulder length hair to about 2\\&quot; (Halle Berry cut). My thinning area really shows now. But, I love my cut. So, I went online looking for a solution. I  felt encouraged after reading the reviews on this line of products.    I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, serum and hair spray.   Upon arrival, I used the hair spray. I saw no difference in my thinning hair. A few days later, I decided to wash my hair and try the other products. My expectations were low, after seeing no results from the hairspray. Boy! Was I surprised.  After shampooing, conditioning, and using the serum, my hair felt thicker. It was also smooth, soft and shiny. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. After allowing my hair to air dry, I applied DermMatch to the thinning areas in the crown. I combed the DermMatch through my hair until my hair was completely dry. Using a paddle brush, I brushed my hair thoroughly to remove any excess DermMatch. I then flat ironed my hair. I finished with the hairspray. My hair looked amazing. It looked like I had just stepped out of a salon. It was so full, shiny and healthy looking. I then applied a small amount of Enjoy smooth and shine to add more sheen. Although my hair felt a little stiff from the spray, it really wasn&#x27;t. My paddle brush and comb ran easily through my hair.  Before bedtime, I put a few of the foam rollers that are wrapped with satin in the crown area. When I removed them the next morning, I could not believe how my hair had curled. My hair is normally hard to curl even when I use setting lotion. I had rolled my hair dry and got curl and body. I brushed out the curl, added a little more Enjoy smooth and shine and the hairspray. Voila! I couldn&#x27;t believe the results. It looked as if I had grown more hair overnight.   This line of products seem to work in synergy. So, results are best when shampoo, conditioner, serum and hairspray are used together.I love that the products have little to no scent. They just leave my hair smelling clean and fresh.   I am very very pleased with this product line.  ***UPDATE***  I must revise my review of this product line. I forgot to research if the products were sulfate free. My bad! They are not. I have a keratin treatment in my hair and sulfates would strip it. Thankfully, I only used the products once.   I have seen a great improvement in the condition of my hair since discontinuing the use of shampoos containing sulfates. My hair stopped shedding.   So, I will no longer use any of these products, since they work in synergy.  I think I&#x27;ll try RegenePure products that are sulfate free and also claim to stimulate hair growth.  I&#x27;ve also discontinued the use of DermMatch, because I am tired of it getting under my fingernails each time I massage my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of conditioners and there isn&#x27;t anything better at any price point. Gives hair thicker appearance, and more importantly doesn&#x27;t weight it down. I have tried expensive salon conditioners that don&#x27;t work half as well that cost over $30. For $3 its a steal.</li>
            <li> Left my hair very dry. Thankfully it didn&#x27;t cost too much. Am disappointed it didn&#x27;t work. I also used the shampoo and serum.</li>
            <li> I like that this is a plant-based product.     A lot of conditioners have tallow in them, apparently. My dermatologist told me to find a product like this one that doesn&#x27;t have animal fats (like tallow) in them, which keeps oils off my face, pillow, etc. (I am pushing retirement, but still have occasional skin problems. It might be a good conditioner for anyone of any age with break-outs.)    This product de-tangles my hair VERY well (shoulder length, color treated/gray/coarse), doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair like heavier conditions do, and has a nice, clean \\&quot;generic\\&quot; herbal type scent that doesn&#x27;t linger after rinsing.     My husband uses it, too, and his hair is thinning on top. He likes the body it gives his hair, i.e., it doesn&#x27;t weigh down his hair on top like heavier conditions will.     ARL (manufacturer) does not engage in animal testing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thicker Fuller Hair Conditioner for over 10 years and have been happy with the product.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed that this product&#x27;s scent was recently changed to having a very pungent, \\&quot;chemically-strong\\&quot; smell that is unwelcomed, certainly in the morning.  Please change the scent back to the original.</li>
            <li> I buy the shampoo from this company as well and like both products.  If you have very thin hair like me, go easy on the conditioner - I put a tiny drop on the ends of my hair only.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have been losing thinning hair for a while now; this product detangles without weighing hair down. Don&#x27;t need too much either.  a quarter size is enough for should length hair.</li>
            <li> I notice that it takes a lot of this product to actually see a difference. I had to use about half the bottle to ensure that all my hair was covered. When I let it sit for a couple of minutes and rinse my hair, it felt like silk.</li>
            <li> Very good product &amp; gives my hair the volume I need!</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t make your feel soft and silky but it will make it stronger and thicker.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works.  I have very, very baby fine hair.  And now that I&#x27;m almost 50, just brushing makes it fall out.  Other strengthening products don&#x27;t do very much for my hair.  But this is the only conditioner and leave-in product where I can actually see that my hair isn&#x27;t breaking and falling out.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a fine conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to result in thicker or fuller hair for me and neither does the shampoo. I won&#x27;t bother buying this product again. However, I do like and recommend the Thicker Fuller Hair Instantly Thick, Thickening Serum, which seems to add some fullness and texture to my fine and thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I buy this over and over and over again. I want to subscribe to it! It is ABSOLUTELY essential and totally works!</li>
            <li> It sometimes helps my hair to stay in and not fall out. I have stress hair loss so there are times when nothing helps that too much; but this is a good product over-all.</li>
            <li> Amazing I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> After even a quick wash, my hair feels too squeaky and crispy. On one hand it can be an indication of the shampoo doing a good job cleansing the hair. On the other hand, it feels like it washes off all the oils that my scalp needs. When I dry my hair it looks too lifeless and just sticks up because it lacks any weight... I&#x27;ve never had my hair thinner. And yes, I use the conditioner of the same brand after every wash, but it doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, and the shampoo rocks too. Make sure and use something else here and there too, otherwise TFH will gum up your hair a little</li>
            <li> For me, this conditioner works against the Thicker Fuller Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my hair retained the softness, it was no longer fuller and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item does not work well on fine, limp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a terrible chemical smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not use.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for fine hair.</li>
            <li> It worked as described! I got this for a friend with fine, thin hair due to meds and she&#x27;s said this has worked wonders for her!</li>
            <li> I have normal hair but not a lot of it.  It did nothing for my hair.  It may work better on fine hair, not sure.  I found much more success with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special shampoo &amp; conditioner.  It makes my hair look very full &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 and my hair is thinning.  You can&#x27;t see my scalp yet, but it is getting there and in places my hair wants to naturally part, yes, you can see my scalp.  A few years ago I purchased the shampoo and was not impressed.  This time I went all out and purchased the shampoo, the conditioner and the root spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You CANNOT see my scalp even on the areas that want to part naturally, it&#x27;s covered.  I really am impressed and realize buying all three products is probably what did it.  I blew dried my hair and shall put some curls in it with a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using these three products.  I&#x27;m just an Amazon customer and rely on the reviews.  Please know that this may not work for you, but it did for me and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m leaving the same review on all three products.  I think that&#x27;s what has worked, at least for me, using all three products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this conditioner a couple of times and so far i have seen a change within my hair less breakage  and more thickness/bounce. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product; it really does make my hair appear thicker. I will buy it again, and will recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> All these Schwarzkopf products do what they say...you do end up with thicker fuller hair, as long as you don&#x27;t expect miracles.  My husband uses the serum and shampoo.  I love this conditioner.  Even after a windstorm recently, my hair still had body.  I highly  recommend this for fine, limp hair and for guys who may not have the amount of hair they did in their youth. Also, MADE IN THE USA!!</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner with the shampoo because I&#x27;ve been losing hair in the shower everyday for the past 3 months. When I first started using them it looked like I was losing less hair. However, that only happened for the first week. Now I&#x27;m back to losing a lot of hair every time I shower.</li>
            <li> This is a reorder of a very effective conditioner.  I have always had fine hair and after chemo and radiation it really thinned out. This product not only makes fuller thicker hair,but also seems healthier than previously. I have tried other such products and either they felt like vasoline, had too much fragrance or just didn&#x27;t work. I will stay with this product as long as I still have hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and just love it. I also use the shampoo on my fine hair. It definitely thickens it.</li>
            <li> Help to thicken thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before so it wasn&#x27;t anything new.  Good product!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for anyone with thinning hair, and really does a good job.  Sometimes hard to find in stores, it is available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I liked this conditioner at first, i had bought the shampoo in another store so i though i give it a try, at first it made my hair nice and soft, but the longer i used it, it did not give me the same result.</li>
            <li> I wish this product workee on my hair like others did.  I tried it and it just made my hair dried out after taking a shower.  My hair wasnt soft or easy to brush through.  It took a while for my hair to get back to normal softness.  Maybe I was doing something wrong??</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted a plant based shampoo that would add volume.  The first week, I saw nothing, but I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and definitely notice my hair looks full!  So, just give it time.  I just wish I could find it in a store.</li>
            <li> Helps with the fullness along with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Thicker Fuller Hair shampoo for a while and I think it has made a difference because my thin hair does feel thicker. I couldn&#x27;t find the matching conditioner anywhere in any local stores (Walgreens and Kroger carry the shampoo), so I was glad to find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s a good, basic conditioner and works well on my dry, aging hair (I&#x27;m 55 and used to have oily thin hair and now it&#x27;s dry thin hair). It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it helps, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have thining hair and this product is a great buy.  My hair seems fuller and healthy.  I would reccomend this product to any one who has thin  hair or just wants more fullness</li>
