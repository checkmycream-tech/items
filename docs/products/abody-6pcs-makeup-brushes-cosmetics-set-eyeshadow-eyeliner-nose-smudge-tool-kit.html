            <li>I absolutely love these for the price</li>

            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>They are soft, they clean easily and the ones I do use work flawlessly with my makeup.</li>
            <li>So I set out for the search and found some pretty good ones here.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as soft as I thought they would be but over all work great!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were just what I needed because I wanted to define my eyebrows and make it a more &amp;#34;crisp&amp;#34; clean look.</li>
            <li>pretty good and super cheap</li>
            <li>Super glad I bought these.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m ready to order more!</li>
            <li>I do makeup, and this kit certainly came in handy</li>
            <li>I really enjoy them every day</li>
            <li>I own five Real Techniques eyeshadow brushes and four e.l.f.</li>
            <li>stick/gloss smoothly.</li>
            <li>Substantial, they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>These work quite well and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>However, their bristles are stiff so these are best for brows, lips, and smudging liner.</li>
            <li>it has been very useful.</li>
            <li>I love love love these brushes, they aren&#x27;t to light and aren&#x27;t to strong, they make blending and getting small details amazing.</li>
            <li>i love these brushes they are so smooth and work really well.</li>
            <li>Arrived as promised, I didnt think that the quality would be good, but its better than expected.</li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>Super excited</li>
            <li>and I love these just as much.  </li>
            <li>overall i think they are good starter brushes for me.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use these, but would love to.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes because they are soft, and yet still get the job done!!!</li>
            <li>anyway, I&#x27;m still learning my way around the artistic application of face products, so here&#x27;s hoping I learn a use for them soon.</li>
            <li>My very first brushes.</li>
            <li>Beware - you do not receive exactly what is pictured!</li>
            <li>I bought these as practice brushes, but I loved them so much that I bought another set that I&#x27;m currently waiting for.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i wanted, as described, and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>It took forever so if you don&#x27;t need them right away</li>
            <li>A good, basic set and the brushes are smaller so you can easily bring them with you wherever you go.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, but firm enough to be precise and the brushes themselves are the perfect size.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting very much for the price I paid, but these brushes have no quality whatsoever.</li>
            <li>But they were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>only problem was that the metal part that meets the bristles was scraped on one of the brushes, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the product quality or being able to use it</li>
            <li>all the different sizes gives you many options on a applying make up</li>
            <li>Just save your money and buy some real brushes!</li>
            <li>I received my package on time and they were carefully wrapped, which was nice.</li>
            <li>The brushes came pretty fast!</li>
            <li>small and effective!</li>
            <li>However there is a funny smell on the brushes, some of them smell like Circus peanuts (here&#x27;s a link if you don&#x27;t know what that is)</li>
            <li>the bullet looking one would seem to be good for crease blending, but it&#x27;s too stiff.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected otherwise they were great</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped really quck.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I pretty much got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes because I was in need of smaller, more precise brushes, and just new brushes in general.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these for my little sister that is starting to use brushes and they work great for her</li>
            <li>You would pay so much in department stores for these.</li>
            <li>Very recommended.</li>
            <li>Not so much blending shadows.</li>
            <li>However, the price was very feasible for a frugal gal like myself.</li>
            <li>and they work very well..</li>
            <li>Slow delivery good for what they cost</li>
            <li>Most of all I didn&#x27;t break the bank on them like the other stores I had seen.</li>
            <li>these are a good item but other than that it took a long time</li>
            <li>they came way earlier than expected which is amazing.</li>
            <li>There is one decent one, and that&#x27;s the creased dome brush</li>
            <li>Brushes came just as shown in the picture and they are so soft !!</li>
            <li>Was not expecting such amazing quality in such a low cost item.  </li>
            <li>Also the tracking of the item wasn&#x27;t accurate or helpful my delivery window was a month wide.</li>
            <li>they are really cute, and not cheap by my opinion.</li>
            <li>Only 1 or 2 of the brushes are useful but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>They are soft and for the price not bad especially compared to the cheaper ones you buy in a set at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes highly recommended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to make up</li>
            <li>When I purchased these brushes I wasn&#x27;t expecting very much since they were only five dollars.</li>
            <li>These brushes are tiny in width so not very useful for more than applying gel liner or shaping brows using the liquid concealer technique.</li>
            <li>Really soft brushes, can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li>They are ok just too small.  </li>
            <li>Mine are cheap oddly shaped brushes that I don&#x27;t have use for except maybe give them to my two year old for painting.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard, they get the product in but not enough to blend</li>
            <li>When I received them, I marveled at how soft they were, considering the price.  </li>
            <li>Unbelievably soft.  </li>
            <li>I did however check to see how the bristles felt and they were soft.</li>
            <li>No fallout on the bristles, but the edges are cut pretty jagged on one of the brushes, then the flat brush is way too big for makeup, and the bristles are not packed densely enough to pick up much color.</li>
            <li>and they are super soft yet firm</li>
            <li>They work pretty well, i dont like the big flat one</li>
            <li>I use it occasionally to do my eye make up and it hasn&#x27;t given me any problems so far.</li>
            <li>I like full brushes and these are really thin and don&#x27;t spread product very well.</li>
            <li>First of all, they are very rough and bristly and using them caused my eyelids to become irritated and red.</li>
            <li>I even wet my eye brushes with a little saline to get the full color of the shadow.</li>

            <li> Only 1 or 2 of the brushes are useful but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> They are soft and for the price not bad especially compared to the cheaper ones you buy in a set at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to make up</li>
            <li> When I purchased these brushes I wasn&#x27;t expecting very much since they were only five dollars.</li>
            <li> These brushes are tiny in width so not very useful for more than applying gel liner or shaping brows using the liquid concealer technique.</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes, can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> They are ok just too small.  </li>
            <li> Mine are cheap oddly shaped brushes that I don&#x27;t have use for except maybe give them to my two year old for painting.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard, they get the product in but not enough to blend</li>
            <li> When I received them, I marveled at how soft they were, considering the price.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievably soft.  </li>
            <li> I did however check to see how the bristles felt and they were soft.</li>
            <li> No fallout on the bristles, but the edges are cut pretty jagged on one of the brushes, then the flat brush is way too big for makeup, and the bristles are not packed densely enough to pick up much color.</li>
            <li> and they are super soft yet firm</li>
            <li> They work pretty well, i dont like the big flat one</li>
            <li> I use it occasionally to do my eye make up and it hasn&#x27;t given me any problems so far.</li>
            <li> I like full brushes and these are really thin and don&#x27;t spread product very well.</li>
            <li> First of all, they are very rough and bristly and using them caused my eyelids to become irritated and red.</li>
            <li> I even wet my eye brushes with a little saline to get the full color of the shadow.</li>
            <li> so I could have an angled flat brush and my set did not come with one.</li>
            <li> One con is that if you don&#x27;t properly clean them frequently they shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no angled brush, they are all bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> but like i said i&#x27;m no professional</li>
            <li> and they were much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be regular size.</li>
            <li> It should be good for applying base.      </li>
            <li> they are very stiff and dense, but soft.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish it would have come with just a brief explanation as to what each brush did.</li>
            <li> When I opened them one of the brushes had a piece of metal missing from where the wooden handle and brush fibers meet.</li>
            <li> Brushes are as expected.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes way sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Took longer than expected to get in.</li>
            <li> Decent brushes for the price, although if I had a complaint, I would say the fibers are very stiff.  </li>
            <li> The shipping to a little longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> That would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Not worth it not useful</li>
            <li> Small not what I expected.</li>
            <li> However, I do wish there had been a little hint</li>
            <li> eye shadow well, no to little fall out.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for....complete waste of money....</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm</li>
            <li> I.m not sure what some of them do which is a thumbs down for me.</li>
            <li> These are a bit too stiff for my liking.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the brushes kept shedding constantly whether it was in my eye shadows or on my face while I was doing my makeup, the brushes frustrated me and wasted my time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very unsatisfied , unhappy customer!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very hard to</li>
            <li> Still confused on which brush is which</li>
            <li> not a great buy</li>
            <li> but you could find worse</li>
            <li> Poor quality and came in with broken brushes.</li>
            <li> Just horrible, I&#x27;ll be surprised if I can use one of them, don&#x27;t buy from this company.</li>
            <li> and hey do not smell bad at all, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> And the circular brush shed very badly.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped really quck.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> thank you!! great product!!</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> I never received my item from the manufacturer and I even emailed them twice about it !! What a ripoff.  I&#x27;m a very unsatisfied , unhappy customer!!</li>
            <li> The shipping to a little longer than I expected. But they were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Small not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Slow delivery good for what they cost</li>
            <li> Awesome! I love them. You would pay so much in department stores for these. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great brushes I really enjoy them every day</li>
            <li> Decent brushes for the price, although if I had a complaint, I would say the fibers are very stiff.  Excellent eyebrow brush though.</li>
            <li> I bought these as practice brushes, but I loved them so much that I bought another set that I&#x27;m currently waiting for. The bristles are very soft, but firm enough to be precise and the brushes themselves are the perfect size. They&#x27;re easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem was that the metal part that meets the bristles was scraped on one of the brushes, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the product quality or being able to use it so I still give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! Perfect size, and all different types of brush styles.. Inexpensive too!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised, I didnt think that the quality would be good, but its better than expected. Nice smooth lines for my brows</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for....complete waste of money....cheap and poor quality</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I was in need of smaller, more precise brushes, and just new brushes in general.  When I received them, I marveled at how soft they were, considering the price.  They also are not as flimsy as they look online, and for off-brand brushes, they are AMAZING!! I own five Real Techniques eyeshadow brushes and four e.l.f. eyeshadow brushes and I love these just as much.  Very recommended.</li>
            <li> I wish they were bigger brushes</li>
            <li> I like these brushes a lot. However, I do wish there had been a little hint what all these brushes are used for, hence my 4 star rating. . That would be my only complaint. They are soft, they clean easily and the ones I do use work flawlessly with my makeup. Yes I do recommend these.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price</li>
            <li> Love these brushes nice quality love the price and they are super soft yet firm</li>
            <li> great value for the price - but just OK brushes</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes, can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Brushes are awesome, cheep, and smooth. I recommend. The variety can work magic for the eye. I do makeup, and this kit certainly came in handy, I&#x27;m ready to order more!</li>
            <li> So I was told as a beginner freelance makeup artist to buy myself affordable brushes. So I set out for the search and found some pretty good ones here. I love these brushes because they are soft, and yet still get the job done!!! Most of all I didn&#x27;t break the bank on them like the other stores I had seen. Fast and perfect condition shipping!</li>
            <li> Unbelievably soft.  Was not expecting such amazing quality in such a low cost item.  Holds eye shadow well, no to little fall out. Applies concealer and lip stick/gloss smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great assortment of brushes!  They are well-constructed and excellent to apply eye makeup, especially for brows.  Substantial, they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the brushes in the picture. Mine are cheap oddly shaped brushes that I don&#x27;t have use for except maybe give them to my two year old for painting. There&#x27;s no angled brush, they are all bigger than I expected. Just horrible, I&#x27;ll be surprised if I can use one of them, don&#x27;t buy from this company. NOT RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> Tried to return it but it&#x27;s very hard to and I couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Pretty good. No complaints</li>
            <li> I was not at all satisfied with this purchase. I wasn&#x27;t expecting very much for the price I paid, but these brushes have no quality whatsoever. First of all, they are very rough and bristly and using them caused my eyelids to become irritated and red. Secondly, the brushes kept shedding constantly whether it was in my eye shadows or on my face while I was doing my makeup, the brushes frustrated me and wasted my time and money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone and the only reason I gave them one star was because they were shipped to me on time and they looked pretty nice and had a good variety of brushes</li>
            <li> I love these brushes all the different sizes gives you many options on a applying make up</li>
            <li> I love my brushes; Thank you</li>
            <li> I guess they get the job done for the price. Just save your money and buy some real brushes!</li>
            <li> I bought these just to add to my make up brush collection. When I purchased these brushes I wasn&#x27;t expecting very much since they were only five dollars. I received my package on time and they were carefully wrapped, which was nice. When I opened them one of the brushes had a piece of metal missing from where the wooden handle and brush fibers meet. And the circular brush shed very badly. The rest of the brushes held their hair well. The bristles are firm and hey do not smell bad at all, which is a plus. I pretty much got what I paid for. They are good for beginners.</li>
            <li> i got these brushes today. they came way earlier than expected which is amazing. I.m not sure what some of them do which is a thumbs down for me. I&#x27;m new to make up so i thought these were a good eye brush starter set. they came nicely packaged and didn&#x27;t smell like anything. If they apply colors well i would give it a 4 out of 5 but like i said i&#x27;m no professional so don&#x27;t take my word for that. overall i think they are good starter brushes for me.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes they are so smooth and work really well. Thankyou</li>
            <li> These brushes ARENT very good. There is one decent one, and that&#x27;s the creased dome brush</li>
            <li> The brushes came pretty fast! They were just what I needed because I wanted to define my eyebrows and make it a more &amp;#34;crisp&amp;#34; clean look. By doing so, I&#x27;ll apply concealer underneath my eyebrows using the angle brush. It turned out perfect!!!!!! I&#x27;ll be ordering these brushes again!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really great quality considering the price. However, their bristles are stiff so these are best for brows, lips, and smudging liner. Not so much blending shadows. One con is that if you don&#x27;t properly clean them frequently they shed like crazy. Aside from that, great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes on time and they were packaged well.  The handle size is a bit short.  It&#x27;s good for a travel brush set and it&#x27;s a great price for it too.</li>
            <li> just got the, great shipping time. they were smaller than i thought, but i didn&#x27;t check the specs. nonetheless, i like them I was looking for a pointed crease brush specifically,I like  them all though. the sponge end of the double one feels like a beauty blender. it&#x27;s not cloth. It should be good for applying base.      Update! I really don&#x27;t use these, but would love to. just don&#x27;t know what for yet. they are very stiff and dense, but soft. the bullet looking one would seem to be good for crease blending, but it&#x27;s too stiff. anyway, I&#x27;m still learning my way around the artistic application of face products, so here&#x27;s hoping I learn a use for them soon. they are really cute, and not cheap by my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not the best but still usable</li>
            <li> Beware - you do not receive exactly what is pictured! I specifically ordered this so I could have an angled flat brush and my set did not come with one. I will now have to place another order to get the brush I wanted.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I wish it would have come with just a brief explanation as to what each brush did.</li>
            <li> Not so good ... It could be better</li>
            <li> This has met my expectations for eye make up brushes. it has been very useful.</li>
            <li> These is my go to brushes I love these the work good and a lot help whit the make-up........</li>
            <li> Kind of hard, they get the product in but not enough to blend</li>
            <li> pretty good and super cheap</li>
            <li> Still confused on which brush is which</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these for the price I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Good price, but not the best brushes... okay to pack on color, not to blend.</li>
            <li> Product is very fragile they look disposable..</li>
            <li> I like this set. I use it occasionally to do my eye make up and it hasn&#x27;t given me any problems so far. A good, basic set and the brushes are smaller so you can easily bring them with you wherever you go.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my little sister that is starting to use brushes and they work great for her but as for myself I wouldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I was rather impressed.  These work quite well and are easy to clean. You don&#x27;t get a lot of fall out from the eye shadows.  They actually hold the eye shadow. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate this a 5star is because the brushes are smaller than what I thought I was getting.  But all in all, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Great brush set! The price is right!</li>
            <li> They work pretty well, i dont like the big flat one though, always get powder flung into my eye ... everytime!!</li>
            <li> I keep this in my make-up to go bag! small and effective! these are great brushes.</li>
            <li> Not worth it not useful</li>
            <li> Exactly what i wanted, as described, and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Brushes are as expected.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again.  I don&#x27;t like what the brushes are made of.</li>
            <li> Only 1 or 2 of the brushes are useful but you can&#x27;t beat the price. No fallout on the bristles, but the edges are cut pretty jagged on one of the brushes, then the flat brush is way too big for makeup, and the bristles are not packed densely enough to pick up much color. not a great buy but you could find worse lol</li>
            <li> I love love love these brushes, they aren&#x27;t to light and aren&#x27;t to strong, they make blending and getting small details amazing. Super glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> It took forever so if you don&#x27;t need them right away these are a good item but other than that it took a long time</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected otherwise they were great</li>
            <li> Not nearly as soft as I thought they would be but over all work great!! Would buy again!!</li>
            <li> I had to reglue all the brushes bc they weren&#x27;t attached or they were flimsy. Will not purchase or advise to purchase</li>
            <li> This is a handy and convenient set.  For the price it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes way sooner than expected. Packaged very nicely. They are soft and for the price not bad especially compared to the cheaper ones you buy in a set at Wal-Mart. The only reason for the 4 star rating is because while using the shadow brush it doesn&#x27;t hold the shadow well and it flakes off. I even wet my eye brushes with a little saline to get the full color of the shadow. Otherwise-pretty good brushes for home use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are tiny in width so not very useful for more than applying gel liner or shaping brows using the liquid concealer technique. I  probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase this item again. However, the price was very feasible for a frugal gal like myself.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes highly recommended</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect so much better than spending $40 for them in a store! I love them they arrived on time and are just as good as sephora.</li>
            <li> Brushes came just as shown in the picture and they are so soft !! Love them</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars because I just received them yesterday and have not tried them yet and they were much smaller than expected. I did however check to see how the bristles felt and they were soft. However there is a funny smell on the brushes, some of them smell like Circus peanuts (here&#x27;s a link if you don&#x27;t know what that is) http://www.amazon.com/Circus-Marshmallow-Peanuts-16-Oz/dp/B000H6O3TQ and others smell like cleaning supplies. Also the tracking of the item wasn&#x27;t accurate or helpful my delivery window was a month wide.</li>
            <li> They are ok just too small.  I expected them to be regular size. The quality is good with no shedding and fair application.</li>
            <li> My very first brushes. Super excited and they work very well..</li>
            <li> Poor quality and came in with broken brushes. Took longer than expected to get in.</li>
            <li> These are a bit too stiff for my liking. I like full brushes and these are really thin and don&#x27;t spread product very well.</li>
