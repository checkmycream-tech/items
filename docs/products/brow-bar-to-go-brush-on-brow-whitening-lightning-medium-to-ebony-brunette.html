            <li>Fabulous.</li>
            <li>- I was expecting the original &amp;#34;Whitening Lightening&amp;#34; but instead received &amp;#34;Gerard Cosmetics&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>The two powders double as matte shadows, so that was good.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and the product arrived nice and new.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are getting the brunette for darker hair &amp; Blonde for lighter hair shades.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Looks so natural and lasts forever!</li>
            <li>With dark brown hair, and I ffek that the darker shade in this kit is a bit light for me.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it still works the same as the original brand.</li>

            <li> Other than that, it still works the same as the original brand.</li>
            <li> I finally purchased this after a long time of hearing YouTubers rave about this product...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easier to set, doesn&#x27;t look too harsh, and really simple to blend.</li>
            <li> I usually use pencils which end up making my brows look too dark, too fake, and it&#x27;s also easy to come off during the day.</li>
            <li> know I&#x27;m still learning and practicing how to do my brows not exactly a expert</li>
            <li> but I felt like it made my brows to dark</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like my brows supers dark</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to fill in my eye brows!</li>
            <li> I was just learning how to &amp;#34;sculpt&amp;#34; my thin eyebrows from years of plucking them and saw this product on a YouTube video.</li>

            <li> The Best I have used!!!</li>
            <li> Love it. You can also use it to contour.</li>
            <li> Luv this.  OMG!  It is so inexpensive but is the best brow powder.  Looks so natural and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I finally purchased this after a long time of hearing YouTubers rave about this product... I&#x27;m a bit dissapointed... I feel it is not as pigmented as I would have hoped. And for the brunette color... I feel it should be a bit darker ..</li>
            <li> Awesome seller! Fast shipping, and the product arrived nice and new. I was just learning how to &amp;#34;sculpt&amp;#34; my thin eyebrows from years of plucking them and saw this product on a YouTube video. I use Brow Bar To Go with Amazonian Clay Waterproof Brow Mousse. My eyebrow? Absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> BEST BROW MAKEUP EVER!! I LOVE this makeup! I usually use pencils which end up making my brows look too dark, too fake, and it&#x27;s also easy to come off during the day. I adore this powder bc it&#x27;s easier to set, doesn&#x27;t look too harsh, and really simple to blend. The brow wax in the kit helps my brows stay put a bit longer. Fabulous.</li>
            <li> Im a MAC NC 42 With dark brown hair, and I ffek that the darker shade in this kit is a bit light for me. Also, the wax feels more oily than waxy. The two powders double as matte shadows, so that was good. And it does give good color to the brows, just not to me.</li>
            <li> Great very good brown color</li>
            <li> The brow bar is great but I wanted the whitening lightening one like it says here but I got gerade cosmetics instead but it&#x27;s defiantly still a go and look for</li>
            <li> Love this brow bar to go! Especially because Carli Bybel uses it!!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to fill in my eye brows! Make sure you are getting the brunette for darker hair &amp; Blonde for lighter hair shades.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I felt like it made my brows to dark and I&#x27;m brunette but also know I&#x27;m still learning and practicing how to do my brows not exactly a expert yet but I don&#x27;t like my brows supers dark so I bought the blonde one as well. Fast shipping And in great condition.</li>
            <li> Just received it today. All I can say is ohhhh my gawd!!! Ladies plz u have to try this</li>
            <li> I like the brow bar, however I could have kept filling my brows in with my pencil. I also wish it came with 2 brushes and instructions. Maybe I&#x27;ll just have to get use to it.</li>
            <li> Love it, will buy it again once I need a refill</li>
            <li> LOVE it!!!!!! Will not go on without out!</li>
