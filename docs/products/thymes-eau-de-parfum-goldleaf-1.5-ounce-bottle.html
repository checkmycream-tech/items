            <li>It is very nice and light, but it also lingers and doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied throughout the day.</li>
            <li>But more importantly it makes me feel so happy to smell it.</li>
            <li>I hesitate to say it&#x27;s bogus, but Goldleaf has a much stronger, beautiful scent.</li>

            <li>I have used this fragrance for 5+ years I love it.  </li>

            <li>I really love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>When wearing it I received many compliments, so I decided to buy it online.  </li>
            <li>in fact you will probably love it.</li>
            <li>but it is lighter and more floral.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My personal best blind-buy ever !</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance because it smells like my mother, being her signature fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is my #1 favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Fresh Lavender delights but this is so much more!  </li>
            <li>This is a luxurious, very sweet floral perfume.  </li>
            <li>Shipping and handling was fast, product in good condition upon delivery.  </li>
            <li>It was remarkably easy to do</li>
            <li>Like the light fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was shipped free &amp;</li>
            <li>Not to strong, smells clean.  </li>
            <li>It is light, so you can wear it every day.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a few days after ordering in perfect shape!</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am most satisfied with the product and the mode of delivery.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clean, light aroma.  </li>
            <li>light, clean and fresh and not over overpowering at all!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a rich, unique, but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>Smells like a clean not overly flowery.</li>
            <li>It is light and fresh, and in my opinion not too floral</li>
            <li>It shipped super fast, and the packaging was super cute.</li>
            <li>I first found this product in a hospital gift shop!</li>
            <li>This is such a lovely fragrance and it lasts a long time on which is really great.  </li>
            <li>Fresh fields</li>
            <li>Incredibly fresh, both energizing &amp;</li>
            <li>This bottle is just not quite right.</li>
            <li>Based on this experiment, I DO think it is genuine, and I do NOT think it is old.</li>
            <li>I have used this parfum for several years and have received many favorable complements.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of First by Van Cleef and Arpels</li>
            <li>My personal interpretation is wind-fresh Lavender &amp; field wildflowers &amp; greenery :)  </li>
            <li>I recently ordered the powder and love it.</li>
            <li>Even though I felt the smell did not last the way my previous bottle of Goldleaf had, the packaging looked very good.  </li>
            <li>This makes a pleasant change from the usual perfume brands on offer.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this product for a long time and have a problem finding it in my area.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>LOVELY, LIGHT, DELICATE.</li>
            <li>It is not over whelming, but very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying it &amp; selling it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the real parfumes from France made in the 60s and 70s.</li>
            <li>I purchased it in New York on vacation one year &amp; have had to really be stingy with it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>This has been one of my favorite fragrances since I first encountered it in a small gift shop in a California seaside town.  </li>
            <li>I was at first doubtful as I like to choose my own scents, but I fell in love with it the first time I wore it.  </li>
            <li>Nobody is annoyed by the smell of a good soap.  </li>
            <li>The other products in the Goldleaf are fantastic too.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this item for a present and it was exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li>It is the favorite for the past 18 months or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little strong.</li>
            <li>Clean scent....not heavy, but substantial.</li>
            <li>So I carried my new bottle in my purse to a proper store-front retailer (more expensive there) and tried their tester &amp;#34;Goldleaf&amp;#34; on one wrist, and sprayed my Amazon-ordered bottle on the other.  </li>

            <li> So I carried my new bottle in my purse to a proper store-front retailer (more expensive there) and tried their tester &amp;#34;Goldleaf&amp;#34; on one wrist, and sprayed my Amazon-ordered bottle on the other.  </li>
            <li> None of that hideously stinky fake stuff out in fine stores costing an arm and a leg, which WONT wash off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to wait very long for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> Not very noticeable fragrance</li>
            <li> The product was just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s watered down, or</li>
            <li> bottle, affordable, universal scent unlikely to offend, affordable &amp; E-Z to blind-buy, &amp; such a pleasure to wear...  </li>
            <li> Not a problem except I usually wait until the bottle is empty</li>
            <li> , I wear it year round.</li>
            <li> My husband is terribly choosy about fragrances of any kind.  </li>
            <li> That being said he discovered this perfume a few years ago and purchased it for me.  </li>
            <li> so I have to do without for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what it is, but the bottle of Goldleaf</li>
            <li> My husband likes it and he usually doesn&#x27;t like me to wear perfume.</li>
            <li> Small 1.5 oz.</li>
            <li> but I do get asked usually by men what perfume am I wearing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to overdo it:  </li>
            <li> A must-own for every serious perfumista&#x27;s / mister&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Thymes Goldleaf Eau de Parfum Rollerball - .20oz  </li>
            <li> I would give it five stars, but there are scents (discontinued, sadly) which I prefer, so in a way we are settling.  </li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t any candles in our home that are artificially scented.  </li>
            <li> (I hate to say this) not what it presents to be....</li>
    </ol>

            <li> 5 Stars.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item for a present and it was exactly what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years. Like the light fragrance. It is not over whelming, but very pleasing.</li>
            <li> This is a luxurious, very sweet floral perfume.  A little goes a long way.  I love it for evening wear.</li>
            <li> Not very noticeable fragrance</li>
            <li> I first found this product in a hospital gift shop! Couldn&#x27;t get it at the time so I ordered it along with the powder and scented soap…LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product for a long time and have a problem finding it in my area.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied purchasing it on line.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  When it runs out, I buy more.</li>
            <li> LOVELY, LIGHT, DELICATE. Good for summer.</li>
            <li> Love the parfum.  Great delivery time.</li>
            <li> Goldleaf makes me smell fresh-out-of-the-shower.  It&#x27;s a soap-like fragrance, so it&#x27;s hard to overdo it:  Nobody is annoyed by the smell of a good soap.  Even though I felt the smell did not last the way my previous bottle of Goldleaf had, the packaging looked very good.  So I carried my new bottle in my purse to a proper store-front retailer (more expensive there) and tried their tester &amp;#34;Goldleaf&amp;#34; on one wrist, and sprayed my Amazon-ordered bottle on the other.  I waited an hour, then sniffed both.  They had each faded equally.  Goldleaf to freshen up with.  Based on this experiment, I DO think it is genuine, and I do NOT think it is old.</li>
            <li> I can always rely upon Thymes products to be top quality.  I received my compliments on my perfume</li>
            <li> The product was just what I expected.  Shipping and handling was fast, product in good condition upon delivery.  Love the smell of this Parfum!  Would order again!</li>
            <li> A little strong. I like the lotion more.</li>
            <li> Use to wear this years ago. Ordered some for daughter and fell in love with it all over again, had to order me some.</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely fragrance and it lasts a long time on which is really great.  Used to be Goldleaf and Hydrangea but now it is just Goldleaf.  It smells exactly the same.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> my current favorite. . . !!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I can buy thymes products from you. I couldn&#x27;t find any in the stores that are close to me. I purchased it in New York on vacation one year &amp; have had to really be stingy with it&#x27;s use. Thanks for carrying it &amp; selling it for a reasonable price. I like the lotion &amp; creme as well. It&#x27;s a great treat to myself.&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped free &amp; I didn&#x27;t have to wait very long for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is, but the bottle of Goldleaf I received seems to be off in scent. It seems like it&#x27;s watered down, or (I hate to say this) not what it presents to be....I hesitate to say it&#x27;s bogus, but Goldleaf has a much stronger, beautiful scent. This bottle is just not quite right. Unfortunately, the Thymes Goldleaf Eau de Parfum Rollerball - .20oz  I received in the same order has the same problem.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a beautiful perfume that mellows this is it.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 20 years and always get compliments every time I go out.  I don&#x27;t wear a ton of it either.  It&#x27;s the best in my opinion of the entire Tymes line.  The other products in the Goldleaf are fantastic too.  This is a top secret scent!</li>
            <li> A scent that has everybody telling you that you smell good. Clean scent....not heavy, but substantial. Non-offensive to others from the compliments I receive.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It&#x27;s so feminine and lasts forever.  I always get compliments and extra hugs when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have used this parfum for several years and have received many favorable complements. It arrived in a timely manner and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this scent. So do I</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! It is very nice and light, but it also lingers and doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied throughout the day. It shipped super fast, and the packaging was super cute. Excellent buy.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for 5+ years I love it.  Smells like a clean not overly flowery. I can&#x27;t remember the ingredients. Could look it up on Thymes website.</li>
            <li> Great service and I love the product</li>
            <li> I really love this fragrance.  Not to strong, smells clean.  My husband likes it and he usually doesn&#x27;t like me to wear perfume.</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars, but there are scents (discontinued, sadly) which I prefer, so in a way we are settling.  It is the favorite for the past 18 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> After a visit to the west coast of Florida my daughter brought a bottle of Thymes Eau de Parfum Golfleaf.  When wearing it I received many compliments, so I decided to buy it online.  It was remarkably easy to do and I received very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am most satisfied with the product and the mode of delivery.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> item arrived in good shape and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> This stuff is delicious. None of that hideously stinky fake stuff out in fine stores costing an arm and a leg, which WONT wash off. This lasts and the fragrance does not turn. You will like it...in fact you will probably love it. Reminds me of the real parfumes from France made in the 60s and 70s. Sexy, seductive and delicious.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite fragrances since I first encountered it in a small gift shop in a California seaside town.  It is light and fresh, and in my opinion not too floral, I wear it year round.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this scent before.  I like it&#x27;s clean, light aroma.  Not too flowery.  Not too spicy.  Not overpowering.  I&#x27;d recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This makes a pleasant change from the usual perfume brands on offer. It is a combination of my favourite floral scents with a hint of &#x27;freshly-showered&#x27;!. It reminds me of First by Van Cleef and Arpels but it is lighter and more floral. It&#x27;s a practical size, too, so you can keep it in your handbag.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely fragrance.  It is light, so you can wear it every day.  It arrived in a few days after ordering in perfect shape!</li>
            <li> Fresh fields perfume!&lt;br /&gt;Lavender &amp; wind-swept wildflowers w/ field &amp; forest floor greenery- Incredibly fresh, both energizing &amp; restorative- Like a hike through 3-Season foliage. Wondering where this incredible beauty has been all my life?  A must-own for every serious perfumista&#x27;s / mister&#x27;s.  Unisex.  Fresh Lavender delights but this is so much more!  Loooove Thymes GoldLeaf!  PS- Bottle is divine, packaging is exquisite (feminine packaging, unisex scent).  Small 1.5 oz. bottle, affordable, universal scent unlikely to offend, affordable &amp; E-Z to blind-buy, &amp; such a pleasure to wear...  My personal interpretation is wind-fresh Lavender &amp; field wildflowers &amp; greenery :)  My personal best blind-buy ever !</li>
            <li> Smells as wonderful as I remember Goldleaf and Hydrangeas smelling</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance because it smells like my mother, being her signature fragrance. It&#x27;s got a rich, unique, but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> This is my #1 favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;When I wear it, people often ask what scent I am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I will use nothing else.  It is the best in my book!</li>
            <li> Bought this to go along with the Dusting powder and my wife just loves it!  I even like the scent ... light, clean and fresh and not over overpowering at all!  I did good!</li>
            <li> Great and love the scent.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this fragrance for years and this is a great price. I recently ordered the powder and love it.</li>
            <li> Just as ordered! Love it!</li>
            <li> So lovely what a wonderful scent always am complimented when I have it on . But more importantly it makes me feel so happy to smell it.</li>
            <li> This parfum has a delicate, wonderfully fresh scent that my wife loves;</li>
            <li> A spray which is unmistakably the best. It is an addictive smell.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scent, I like it for this time of year! The price is also great!</li>
            <li> My husband is terribly choosy about fragrances of any kind.  We don&#x27;t any candles in our home that are artificially scented.  That being said he discovered this perfume a few years ago and purchased it for me.  I was at first doubtful as I like to choose my own scents, but I fell in love with it the first time I wore it.  Perfect for the work place as I don&#x27;t stand out but I do get asked usually by men what perfume am I wearing.  The bath powder is luscious also.  I cannot find a local seller and I have to order off the internet.  Not a problem except I usually wait until the bottle is empty so I have to do without for a few days.  I also like the fact that this is not an imported product.</li>
