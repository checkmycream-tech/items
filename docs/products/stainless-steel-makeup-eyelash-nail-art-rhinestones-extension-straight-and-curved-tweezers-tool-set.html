            <li>These tweezers would never be able to hold an eyelash let alone</li>
            <li>The tweezers are not sturdy and bend easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t think they would bend so easy.</li>
            <li>the tweezers where just fine.</li>
            <li>These are too light to handle for applying eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get these they are so cheaply made that the lashes won&#x27;t even grin between the 2 prongs</li>
            <li>It looks cheap.</li>
            <li>However, 2 stars for the cheap price.</li>
            <li>but overall satisfied it works good for applying eyelashes</li>
            <li>Im very dissapointed with the product!!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very flimsy, and bend very easily..</li>
            <li>I use for nail art and for general art and both work good.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really had the chance to use the straight ones, but I&#x27;m sure they will come in handy.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are very good qaulity and are NOT cheaply made.</li>
            <li>however the tip did not even come close enough to have a good shape to pick up pieces for the eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Good ONLY for nail art.</li>
            <li>ok came really fast</li>
            <li>These are good for individual lashes..</li>
            <li>Super slim, doesn&#x27;t grip at all.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are wonderful, I&#x27;m a manicurist and these are working great for those little things that are hard to pick up.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job, however they are not of a high enough quality for my wife to use for eyelash extension (or any fine work).</li>
            <li>nicely made strong product for pressie use but not for squeezing its for easily getting small things you hands or reg tweezers cant do</li>
            <li>I thought these tweezers would work better than the old ones I got</li>
            <li>Wish I would have spent more on a more quality product.</li>
            <li>It looks totaly different on the picture-sharp and nice.</li>
            <li>They work fine for what I bought them for, but again if you need a pair of high quality tweezers look else</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR A QUICK DELIVERY.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed for my nail art collection.</li>
            <li>TO RETURN THESE ITEM, THEY WOULD BE IN THE FIRST BOX ON THE WAY.</li>
            <li>Its a very low quality item made of cheap metal!</li>
            <li>but they work nicely for other stuff.</li>
            <li>I got it for Rhinestone work, This is good product, the length is a little short, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>This product was very flimsy and easy to bend, you only get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly fine, they close properly and I haven&#x27;t had a problem</li>
            <li>Thanks, these I was really looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This arrived fast and they were very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Feel very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Very unprofessional looking.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Hahaha</li>
            <li>The tweezers are made out of a very flimsy metal.</li>
            <li>these tweezers came in fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>They were very bendable, not sturdy.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality and crooked</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and very helpful.</li>
            <li>i not even complaint good for nothing</li>
            <li>it bends easily not its worth it for a cheap price and longer wait to recieve the product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those small and big rhinestones needed this pair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making my craft life more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>i use these for the regular falses specially the point one.</li>
            <li>But overall they are good and get the job done&lt;br /&gt;For picking up small rhinestones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them in my fresh water tank so far, but they are rusting.</li>
            <li>If you need tools to start doing nails, these are pretty standard if you like decorating with rhinestones.</li>
            <li>they are a little cheap and get the job done</li>
            <li>it wont bend your fake lashes and its got a good hold.</li>
            <li>My first review was removed but I would like other buyer to know what they are spending there money on.</li>
            <li>Good for picking up small project items (small screws, model parts) otherwise avoid!</li>
            <li>I would purchase, especially if you are into trying new things with your nails and doing various designs.</li>
            <li>These things are uneven and kind of weak.</li>
            <li>Not sure they can withstand very much use.</li>

            <li> Kind of regret getting it because of how badly it went.</li>
            <li> it was just regular metal not stainless steel.</li>
            <li> well worth it there a bit on the thin side</li>
            <li> Could be used as a picture description in dictionary for the entry &amp;#34;Cheap, crappy, flimsy Chinese product that you would throw to trashcan after handling for a few secs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE NOT STAINLESS STEEL.  </li>
            <li> i dont know if they ever actually closed together as tweezers r suppose</li>

            <li> They are not fine point.</li>
            <li> I use these two tools to apply rhinestones and small add-ons to my nails.</li>

            <li> One of it have broken into half after a few use.</li>

            <li> They don&#x27;t work for eyelash extensions because of how thick they are</li>
            <li> Too thick to use for eyelash extensions</li>
            <li> the tips are t0 thick</li>
            <li> they where also very dusty , but i think it was because of the packaging being crushed.</li>
            <li> The quality is so unbelievably crappy!</li>
            <li> I was buying them for the used of fake eyelash extensions and the other 2 pairs to pick up nail designs.</li>

            <li> What you will get is very thick tips with burrs.  </li>
            <li> Ultra thin.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste the $2 for them, they do not work!!!!</li>
            <li> It is really difficult to pick-up rhinestones.</li>
            <li> The metal is dirty and scratched up, and whatever coating is covering the &amp;#34;stainless steel&amp;#34; is flaking off.</li>
            <li> very poor quality!</li>
            <li> Worthless junk.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  </li>

            <li> Too thick to use for eyelash extensions</li>

The metal is dirty and scratched up, and whatever coating is covering the &amp;#34;stainless steel&amp;#34; is flaking off. Very unprofessional looking. These are going in the garbage, and I will reorder through someone else.</li>
            <li> i can apply individual eyelashes now.</li>
            <li> finally they are here, however don&#x27;t have the lashes to use them on, nor do we no when the lashes will arrive.</li>
            <li> I thought these tweezers would work better than the old ones I got but they don&#x27;t work for picking up rhinestones at all I&#x27;m sure it works to put on falsies but I don&#x27;t wear them maybe I should try them then I will let u all know then</li>
            <li> Got these way before expected! Bent tweezers came with rust but they sent me a new one with no hassle and got that one a few days later ! Love them for my nail art</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste the $2 for them, they do not work!!!!</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR A QUICK DELIVERY. I HAVE USED THESE AND MAKES IT EASIER TO WORK WITH THE ITEMS I WANT TO PUT ON MY NAILS. THANKS</li>
            <li> I use these two tools to apply rhinestones and small add-ons to my nails. They work perfectly fine, they close properly and I haven&#x27;t had a problem (&#x3D;</li>
            <li> This item is not describes well on-line.  The tweezers are not sturdy and bend easily.  It is really difficult to pick-up rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Crappiest, flimsiest tweezers ever. Could be used as a picture description in dictionary for the entry &amp;#34;Cheap, crappy, flimsy Chinese product that you would throw to trashcan after handling for a few secs&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> they are a little cheap and get the job done</li>
            <li> I bought these and for the price they are good. I just&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t think they would bend so easy. I accidentally hit&lt;br /&gt;The table with them and then I noticed that the tip was&lt;br /&gt;Bent. But overall they are good and get the job done&lt;br /&gt;For picking up small rhinestones.</li>
            <li> Very cheap material my toothpicks a stronger than that</li>
            <li> The product that came was not like the product seen in the picture. the quality was not good. it was just regular metal not stainless steel. I was buying them for the used of fake eyelash extensions and the other 2 pairs to pick up nail designs. however the tip did not even come close enough to have a good shape to pick up pieces for the eyelashes. It picks up big pieces of nail art. I didn&#x27;t buy this to pick up BIG nail art,  Bought it to pick up little ones. I will not be buying anymore. I hope this help. I hope this wont happened to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Great, I use it to apply eyelashes or rhinestones to face as a makeup artist</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for eyelash placements and I love it for my clients</li>
            <li> Good ONLY for nail art. These things are uneven and kind of weak. My cat is terrified of it, so it came in handy to put him on check when he misbehaves, so I gave it 3 stars for that. In all truth, these ARE good for picking up rhinestones...but then again, so is my dotting tool. I got what I payed for. Serves me well.</li>
            <li> Well for the i pay for it i not even complaint good for nothing&lt;br /&gt;I just dont understand why they selling stuff like this if is just trash.</li>
            <li> Definitely a great deal.  I use these for all my eyelash needs.  Haven&#x27;t really had the chance to use the straight ones, but I&#x27;m sure they will come in handy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get these they are so cheaply made that the lashes won&#x27;t even grin between the 2 prongs lol what a joke glad they were cheap in cost and no shipping! That should have been a clue.. Lol I gave it a one because I had to. Hahaha</li>
            <li> The tweezers are made out of a very flimsy metal. They bent the second time I used them. Wish I would have spent more on a more quality product.</li>
            <li> can use in different things</li>
            <li> I bought these for use in my aquariums, where they help with planting and cleaning. They do a good job, however they are not of a high enough quality for my wife to use for eyelash extension (or any fine work). The points do not line-up correctly and there is a noticeable bend in one pair. They work fine for what I bought them for, but again if you need a pair of high quality tweezers look else where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note. I&#x27;ve only used them in my fresh water tank so far, but they are rusting.</li>
            <li> Mine came bent and I broke it trying to bend them back. Worthless junk.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE NOT STAINLESS STEEL.  THEY FEEL LIKE PAPER VERY CHEAP, THEY FEEL SOMETHING MY DAUGHTER WILL PLAY. IF IT DID NOT COST ME $ TO RETURN THESE ITEM, THEY WOULD BE IN THE FIRST BOX ON THE WAY.</li>
            <li> these tweezers came in fast. it was probably 5 days or so. they did come in very crushed but the tweezers where just fine. they where also very dusty , but i think it was because of the packaging being crushed. works great for my fimo, rhinestones, and glitter.</li>
            <li> These tools are made for handling small stones when I do a pedicure.  They are excellent quality.  Shipping was fast.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Its a very low quality item made of cheap metal! It literally bends out of shape as you squeeze! Its not aligned proberly and has no grip. Good for picking up small project items (small screws, model parts) otherwise avoid!</li>
            <li> They are very dull a nd the tips are t0 thick</li>
            <li> It looks totaly different on the picture-sharp and nice. What you will get is very thick tips with burrs.  Im very dissapointed with the product!!!</li>
            <li> Update: One of it have broken into half after a few use. Low quality! Product matches the price. It looks cheap. However, 2 stars for the cheap price.</li>
            <li> not usable quality of product, should never be listed for sale.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t pick up anything with it.  Not even a hair.  The curved tweezer was worst.  I don&#x27;t even understand the purpose of these.</li>
            <li> ok came really fast just make sure no kids can get to it but overall satisfied it works good for applying eyelashes</li>
            <li> They were very bendable, not sturdy.</li>
            <li> The tweezers were so  bent upon arrival i dont know if they ever actually closed together as tweezers r suppose 2 n order 2 tweeze anything</li>
            <li> I got it for Rhinestone work, This is good product, the length is a little short, but it works fine. I&#x27;ll recommend it to someone who works with Rhinestone and stud.</li>
            <li> They do NOT pick up lashes at all. Good for nail art that&#x27;s about it. VERY disappointed in quality! .....</li>
            <li> Ultra thin.  Doesn&#x27;t feel sturdy, feels like they will break or bend very easily. Not sure they can withstand very much use.</li>
            <li> nicely made strong product for pressie use but not for squeezing its for easily getting small things you hands or reg tweezers cant do</li>
            <li> These are good for individual lashes.. i dont use invidual one but it does work to what ive seen.. i use these for the regular falses specially the point one.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality and crooked</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and very helpful. If you need tools to start doing nails, these are pretty standard if you like decorating with rhinestones.</li>
            <li> It is soo handy to have these! When trying to set nail tape and rhinestones, these tweezers are everything! I would purchase, especially if you are into trying new things with your nails and doing various designs.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible. These tweezers would never be able to hold an eyelash let alone any other item mentioned in the product name. They are not fine point. They are so blunt they aren&#x27;t even regular point.</li>
            <li> it wont bend your fake lashes and its got a good hold. But I can&#x27;t stress enough about the lashes that it came with it. Kind of regret getting it because of how badly it went. Still like the tweezers though...</li>
