            <li>Great product, I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>

            <li>nice product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as drying as most cleansers, though, which is actually a good thing.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I received a free full-size sample of this exfoliator and absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>This product was making my complexion bumpy and irritated, so I ended up throwing most of it away.  </li>
            <li>I love this exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>This irritated my face more than any product that contained 10% BP or 2% SA, stay away from this product at all costs.</li>
            <li>I look better than I have in years</li>
            <li>this one just happens to be my favorite for a couple of reasons.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t think of a way to sell it any more than I love it.</li>
            <li>Yeah it could use more microbeads</li>
            <li>I am really glad I picked this instead.</li>
            <li>This cleans/exfoliates the skin without drying it like many others do.</li>
            <li>It feels OK</li>
            <li>This exfoliator smells lovely and is not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li>I have use this product for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>However, we both love this product.  </li>
            <li>That would be even better.</li>
            <li>I love this product, keeps my skin looks radiant and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I like morning face washes, this works great and has a strong menthol / citrus smell, certainly helps wake me up.</li>
            <li>My daughter gave me my first tube of this, she loved it and got me some as a gift?</li>
            <li>I think this was the best buy I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time!</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love how fresh and tingly this scrub feels on my face!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible; I fell in love with it after the first use and can&#x27;t find it in any local stores.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves your skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth hydrated and tingly during and after the wash.</li>
            <li>So happy to see it online now as we can no longer find it locally in stores.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores near me, so I was thrilled to find it here.  </li>
            <li>and you just feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>After each use, it leaves your skin feeling cool and tingly.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance has a clean fresh scent that give you the feeling of clean skin.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to be used every day and smells great.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel so smooth, clean and fresh afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt really smell like the sweet Garnier smell, but it just smells</li>
            <li>The scrub that came in the old kid did such a great job you felt</li>
            <li>, i have somewhat sensitive skin, while using the product in the shower it felt tingly and refreshing</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>Leaves skin fresh, bright, tight...</li>
            <li>:) My husband and I rarely agree on anything, especially health and beauty type products.  </li>
            <li>I RECEIVED PACKAGE BROKEN GOT FULL REFUND, THE PRODUCTS SCENT WAS TOO STRONG &amp; STICKY!!!</li>
            <li>If I could give this product more stars I definitely would.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, clean, and fresh and is way more affordable than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>so she really pays attention to beauty stuff</li>
            <li>But since I had no choice I bought this stuff \\&quot;Exfoliating Gel\\&quot; and found out that it has like 1/10 of the scrubbing particles, mostly just a gel cleaner, not much exfoliation going on at all.</li>
            <li>Stick to natural things like coconut oil or fresh aloe vera</li>
            <li>straight from the plant.</li>
            <li>It scrubs into the skin nicely and afer a few seconds</li>
            <li>which was kind of nice, but after a few hours later i noticed my skin was very dry and irritated</li>
            <li>It made me feel like a new person every time I used it!</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser though it has microbeads so will likely be discontinued in the near future.</li>
            <li>I got some breakouts this week out of the blue (first time in years), and if I had the old product I know the scrub kit would have had this issue taken care of after one treatment, but</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as clean and polished as the previous product (polish kit).</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use every day.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, do NOT use this.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t even make my skin soft - it made it dryer than ever.</li>
            <li>My advice: trash it and go all natural.</li>
            <li>i was completely mortified.</li>
            <li>but it slowly removes impurities from your skin and tightens your pores for a more porcelain skin look.</li>
            <li>It cleanses my face without irritation,and it leaves my face feeling cool and tingly instead of tight and itchy.</li>
            <li>i woke up the next day to a complete nightmare!!</li>
            <li>Went for a professional facial, she said I needed no extractions, said pores were completely clear.</li>
            <li>Not gritty enough for real cleansing of the face and hands.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m willing to see what it continues to do for my other skin problems (hyperpigmentation, acne scars, all around dullness).</li>
            <li>i dont even want to step foot outside my house until my face is completely healed!</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, yet this product still gave me a burning sensation the second it touched my skin.</li>
            <li>my face was completely COVERED in red irritated bumps from my forehead, nose, cheeks, and even my eye lids!</li>
            <li>But this product really balances out my skin, even brightens it a little.</li>

            <li> It had a lot of scrubbing particles in it and made your face look polished, clean, refreshed, small pores and less visible age spots.</li>
            <li> I just threw this Garnier product away, and it&#x27;s the last time I&#x27;ll ever use something that&#x27;s not natural.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that traditional citrus Garnier smell, or at least it wasn&#x27;t very apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when on your face it felt like too much, the gel to exfoliating bead ratio is seriously lacking.</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesnt contain any acids or chemicals that are known to dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I alternately use a really expensive daily face wash system, but every third day I just have to switch this in because I miss it so much on the other days.</li>
            <li> Had clear skin before I had used this, by the third day of usage I was broken out, skin as red as the devil, and I felt a burning sensation all over my face.</li>
            <li> and I skipped past the big 50 a while back.</li>
            <li> I expected this to burn my skin like every other product does,but that didn&#x27;t happen with Garnier Expert Exfoliator.</li>
            <li> But most of all I was just disappointed by lack of exfoliation which I expected from a SCRUB.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts for a while--husband and I both use it-- a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I picked this because I like other Garnier products.  </li>
            <li> My husband on the other hand has oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find in local stores now!</li>
            <li> and my skin is slowly healing but not quick enough</li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous that such a product could be on the market.</li>
            <li> Odd gift</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just the product reacting with the ingredients of the sunscreen/foundation on my face when I washed it, or the product, but the cleanser smelled odd.</li>
            <li> The closest I can compare it to is a slight ammonia smell.</li>
            <li> The amount of product you applied to your hand felt like too little yet</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that flakes on my nose and is a little oily on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Price compares favorably and takes a little stress out of my life having it delivered.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> so i applied some of my everyday moisturizer that i use hoping it would help and went to bed.</li>
            <li> Cleansers and exfoliators usually make my face feel tight and itchy.</li>
            <li> Convenient to purchase online and a little cheaper too!</li>
            <li> The exfoliator isn&#x27;t harsh at all, at least for me.</li>
            <li> All ingredients I usually prefer to stay away from.</li>
            <li> like you got an expensive facial.</li>
            <li> I am so sad that this stuff is apparently no longer being made.  </li>
            <li> i called in sick at my job and ended up going to the emergency room, i needed something done, and fast... turns out something in the product caused me to have an allergic reaction, which was shocking because every beauty product i use on a regular basis from shampoo &amp; conditioner, moisturizers, eye creams, other facial cleansers, are all Garnier products.</li>
            <li> as the day went on it seemed to be getting worse and worse and my whole face itched like crazy!</li>
            <li> He put me on antibiotics and steroids to help heal the horrible reaction, that was 2 days ago</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product was making my complexion bumpy and irritated, so I ended up throwing most of it away.  I had read in a magazine that it was an effective product, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> cheaper than in store</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliator.  It is gentle enough to use every day. It removes all the dirt and make up.  After each use, it leaves your skin feeling cool and tingly.  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve used. I recommend it to everybody.  It smells great and leaves your skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> Had clear skin before I had used this, by the third day of usage I was broken out, skin as red as the devil, and I felt a burning sensation all over my face. Absolutely ridiculous that such a product could be on the market. On the actual cleaning aspect, it didn&#x27;t feel like it cleaned at all. The amount of product you applied to your hand felt like too little yet when on your face it felt like too much, the gel to exfoliating bead ratio is seriously lacking. This irritated my face more than any product that contained 10% BP or 2% SA, stay away from this product at all costs.</li>
            <li> fast delivery.  nice product</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me my first tube of this, she loved it and got me some as a gift? Odd gift I thought but it slowly removes impurities from your skin and tightens your pores for a more porcelain skin look. It is getting hard to find in local stores now! My daughter is Tiara Lanai a model/ actress so she really pays attention to beauty stuff her income depends on it. I look better than I have in years and I skipped past the big 50 a while back.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome for the price.  It scrubs into the skin nicely and afer a few seconds your face feels amazing.</li>
            <li> 1. I don&#x27;t know if it was just the product reacting with the ingredients of the sunscreen/foundation on my face when I washed it, or the product, but the cleanser smelled odd. The closest I can compare it to is a slight ammonia smell. It wasn&#x27;t that traditional citrus Garnier smell, or at least it wasn&#x27;t very apparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The exfoliator isn&#x27;t harsh at all, at least for me. I like to use this product in the summer/fall months when my face is at its oilest, and I need an exfoliator that gets rid of dirt and excess oil. It&#x27;s not as drying as most cleansers, though, which is actually a good thing. Even with oily skin like myself, drying out your skin only makes oil problems work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Parabens, alcohol, sulfates, limonene. All ingredients I usually prefer to stay away from. But this product really balances out my skin, even brightens it a little. So I&#x27;m willing to see what it continues to do for my other skin problems (hyperpigmentation, acne scars, all around dullness).</li>
            <li> Ive always been a fan of the garnier face products. this one just happens to be my favorite for a couple of reasons. I like products that you can actually feel working like Avon&#x27;s clearskin scrub and this item. I also like that it doesnt contain any acids or chemicals that are known to dry out your skin. This is the perfect face cash AFTER you come home from the gym!</li>
            <li> Went for a professional facial, she said I needed no extractions, said pores were completely clear. This stuff has minimized breakouts to practically ZERO. Leaves skin fresh, bright, tight...I couldn&#x27;t think of a way to sell it any more than I love it. Won&#x27;t use anything else...</li>
            <li> I love how fresh and tingly this scrub feels on my face! It&#x27;s incredible; I fell in love with it after the first use and can&#x27;t find it in any local stores. I alternately use a really expensive daily face wash system, but every third day I just have to switch this in because I miss it so much on the other days. My face feels smooth hydrated and tingly during and after the wash. Yeah it could use more microbeads but so can they all; however it does have a sufficient amount to feel like a good scrub. The bottle lasts for a while--husband and I both use it-- a little bit goes a long way. So happy to see it online now as we can no longer find it locally in stores.</li>
            <li> I picked this because I like other Garnier products.  I was looking for exfoliating face masks. I am really glad I picked this instead. I use it every day.  I think this was the best buy I&#x27;ve gotten in a long time!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser though it has microbeads so will likely be discontinued in the near future. ):</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED PACKAGE BROKEN GOT FULL REFUND, THE PRODUCTS SCENT WAS TOO STRONG &amp; STICKY!!!</li>
            <li> My husband will only use this face wash! It has a great smell and really makes your face feel good!</li>
            <li> This cleans/exfoliates the skin without drying it like many others do.</li>
            <li> Not gritty enough for real cleansing of the face and hands. It feels OK but I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator smells lovely and is not abrasive at all. Does the job well. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I received a free full-size sample of this exfoliator and absolutely love it!  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores near me, so I was thrilled to find it here.  I have oily, breakout prone skin and my skin has been it&#x27;s clearest ever (I&#x27;m 30) since using this.  I use it everyday.  It leaves my skin feeling soft, clean, and fresh and is way more affordable than other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have use this product for years and love it.  My local store use to carry it but, for some reason this store no longer have it on their shelves.  I was very happy to have found it on Amazon.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right I said WE :) My husband and I rarely agree on anything, especially health and beauty type products.  However, we both love this product.  There is no girly smell and you just feel clean after using it. I have combination skin that flakes on my nose and is a little oily on my forehead.  My husband on the other hand has oily skin.  We both have not had results this good on a product under $30.  Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am so sad that this stuff is apparently no longer being made.  It is gentle enough to be used every day and smells great.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I finally ran out of the Garnier Nutritioniste Regenerating Micro-Polish Kit I stocked up (and looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooved). The scrub that came in the old kid did such a great job you felt like you got an expensive facial. It had a lot of scrubbing particles in it and made your face look polished, clean, refreshed, small pores and less visible age spots. It made me feel like a new person every time I used it! But since I had no choice I bought this stuff \\&quot;Exfoliating Gel\\&quot; and found out that it has like 1/10 of the scrubbing particles, mostly just a gel cleaner, not much exfoliation going on at all. The gel is peperminty which feels good (unless you get it in the eye!). But most of all I was just disappointed by lack of exfoliation which I expected from a SCRUB. It also didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling as clean and polished as the previous product (polish kit). I got some breakouts this week out of the blue (first time in years), and if I had the old product I know the scrub kit would have had this issue taken care of after one treatment, but this GEL stuff didd&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve used for years.  Ordered on Amazon because I didn&#x27;t have time to get by the store.  Price compares favorably and takes a little stress out of my life having it delivered.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!  The fragrance has a clean fresh scent that give you the feeling of clean skin.  A good exfoliatin gel.</li>
            <li> Cleansers and exfoliators usually make my face feel tight and itchy. I expected this to burn my skin like every other product does,but that didn&#x27;t happen with Garnier Expert Exfoliator. It cleanses my face without irritation,and it leaves my face feeling cool and tingly instead of tight and itchy. If I could give this product more stars I definitely would.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, do NOT use this. My skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive, yet this product still gave me a burning sensation the second it touched my skin. I do not recommend it at all. Actually, I do not recommend any chemically made products. Stick to natural things like coconut oil or fresh aloe vera straight from the plant. They actually do make your skin softer and healthier. I just threw this Garnier product away, and it&#x27;s the last time I&#x27;ll ever use something that&#x27;s not natural. It didn&#x27;t even make my skin soft - it made it dryer than ever. My advice: trash it and go all natural.</li>
            <li> Convenient to purchase online and a little cheaper too! Wish it was lot an add on item though. That would be even better.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Makes your face feel so smooth, clean and fresh afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt really smell like the sweet Garnier smell, but it just smells clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. Love all Garnier Products!</li>
            <li> I love this product, keeps my skin looks radiant and healthy. Keeps my skin smooth and healthy. Evens skin tone and helps with acne. I love it</li>
            <li> i would give this product -5 stars if i could... i bought it about a week ago at my local CVS and used it only once, i have somewhat sensitive skin, while using the product in the shower it felt tingly and refreshing which was kind of nice, but after a few hours later i noticed my skin was very dry and irritated so i applied some of my everyday moisturizer that i use hoping it would help and went to bed. i woke up the next day to a complete nightmare!! my face was completely COVERED in red irritated bumps from my forehead, nose, cheeks, and even my eye lids! as the day went on it seemed to be getting worse and worse and my whole face itched like crazy! i was completely mortified. i called in sick at my job and ended up going to the emergency room, i needed something done, and fast... turns out something in the product caused me to have an allergic reaction, which was shocking because every beauty product i use on a regular basis from shampoo &amp; conditioner, moisturizers, eye creams, other facial cleansers, are all Garnier products. As directed by the doctor, i threw the product in the trash and will never touch it again. He put me on antibiotics and steroids to help heal the horrible reaction, that was 2 days ago and my skin is slowly healing but not quick enough, it has caused me to lose days at work and lose self confidence as well.. i dont even want to step foot outside my house until my face is completely healed!</li>
            <li> I like morning face washes, this works great and has a strong menthol / citrus smell, certainly helps wake me up.</li>
