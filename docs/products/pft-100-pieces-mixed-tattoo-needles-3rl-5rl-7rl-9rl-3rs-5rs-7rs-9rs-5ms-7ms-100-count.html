            <li>Love it, exactly what you&#x27;d hope</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and no problems.</li>
            <li>The previous reviews were great</li>

            <li>shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>thank you very much ,it is what it said it was.</li>
            <li>I look forward to purchasing some more shortly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pull skin (Unless of course you hook the tip by accident) and they&#x27;re pretty durable.</li>
            <li>product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast</li>
            <li>Great product, as expected no bend needles so far so no waste.</li>

            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Thanks One Tattoo World.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve checked every needle with a magnifying glass before using them and they&#x27;ve all been straight as can be and no burrs.</li>
            <li>The 9 liner gives a thick bold finish, probably my favorite needle to use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and they expire in 2020.</li>
            <li>Some of these needles came damaged/ unsterile due to the package being punctured, but I was still pretty pleased with the overall quality.</li>
            <li>bran new.</li>
            <li>Figured the first was just a mistake and this time it&#x27;s even later.</li>
            <li>I will buy my needles exclusively from One Tattoo world as long as the price stays reasonable.</li>

            <li> there was one box that was a little smashed on the corner</li>
            <li> when i got the needles the packaging for about half of them were already open and useless.</li>
            <li> Ordered these and when I got them 4 were dull.</li>

            <li> Love it, exactly what you&#x27;d hope</li>
            <li> Power cord was broken when I recieved the tattoo machine so I&#x27;ve never been able to use it</li>
            <li> Lots and lots of needles only thing is they seem to favor some needles sizes then others</li>
            <li> Good quality.. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast but I only got 50 needles and not 100 like promised. Bummer</li>
            <li> Some of these needles came damaged/ unsterile due to the package being punctured, but I was still pretty pleased with the overall quality.</li>
            <li> They seem to like it.  Said it is great.  Use it a lot</li>
            <li> some look dirty, some were bent but other then that it was ok .</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the price. The needles work well. I only use disposable needles so the quantity works out well in comparison to the costs.  I will buy my needles exclusively from One Tattoo world as long as the price stays reasonable.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered very quickly and 99% of the needles were usable. Other than a few bent needles everything was great but the package it came in looked like it had been through a boxing match lol</li>
            <li> Great needles! I only found like....2-4 bent, or unusable needles out of the 100 that I bought. Otherwise the assortment of 3,5, to 9 round liners work great. The 9 liner gives a thick bold finish, probably my favorite needle to use.</li>
            <li> They were very good and came in good time but I have received my paper that was with that order  and it has been a month ago now</li>
            <li> Pretty decent needles but a few had some badly soldered groupings or groupings that were messy with bent needles. I might look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Late every time. Figured the first was just a mistake and this time it&#x27;s even later.</li>
            <li> It came fast all there and i was very happy with them!!</li>
            <li> Received today, great buy. Only 1 needle bent out of the hundo.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of different brands of needles out there, I&#x27;ve tried many different kinds, and so far, these are my favorite. They don&#x27;t pull skin (Unless of course you hook the tip by accident) and they&#x27;re pretty durable. I will keep ordering these for as long as they make them. I&#x27;m still learning so don&#x27;t mind the mistakes in my tribal skull I did on my arm haha. Thanks One Tattoo World.</li>
            <li> when i got the needles the packaging for about half of them were already open and useless. not to happy about this purchase and wouuld like them to be resent.</li>
            <li> great quality needles. i&#x27;ve checked every needle with a magnifying glass before using them and they&#x27;ve all been straight as can be and no burrs.</li>
            <li> They got the job  done, still are.</li>
            <li> I was and am completely satisfied with these needles. there was one box that was a little smashed on the corner i was worried that it was going to hurt the needles but they were all good. Thanks again for the great product look forward to ordering more</li>

            <li> Make sure you look at the needles before you use them. Some are good some are bad</li>
            <li> These have been awesome!</li>
            <li> excellent quality and set</li>
            <li> These needles are not worth your money unless you are using them on a practice skin. If you were to use these on a person you would mess them up. Tips of needles over half had burrs and could not be used.</li>
