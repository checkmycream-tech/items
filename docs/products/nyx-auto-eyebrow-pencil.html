            <li>This brow pencil is amazing!</li>
            <li>tried so many, this is the best.  </li>
            <li>When I use NYX products I have the wonderful feeling that I am using something that has been created by people who love make</li>
            <li>And just the thought of knowing I don&#x27;t have to worry about sharpening it makes it that much more amazing!!</li>

            <li>I loved the eyebrow pencils except for one which looked like it had been used.</li>
            <li>The sharpness of the tip creates good lines.</li>
            <li>Matches my eyebrows perfectly and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Even it out and your good to go.</li>

            <li>Great :)</li>
            <li>Very nice, I plan on getting more</li>
            <li>This pencil goes on wonderfully smooth and has great color payoff when using a good primer.  </li>
            <li>Its the perfect shade of brown and it blends very very well.</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a great eyebrow pencil that goes on evenly and stays sharp/is easy to sharpen</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and looks great.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing...</li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>its handy.</li>
            <li>Would have liked it lighter browns</li>
            <li>Nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li>and it goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not strictly brown, its actually kind of reddish.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>and it had a nice brown.</li>
            <li>The NYX product will be a backup if I ever run out of the Maybeline product but honestly, I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Yes, the pencil works well and blends nicely into my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I purchased this pencil based on the many good reviews, but I find it to be of middling quality.  </li>
            <li>My favorite brow pencil love it more than my Anastasia dip brow pomade!!</li>
            <li>works good for me, easy to use</li>
            <li>just so convenient to be able to draw on and brush to give it a better effect !</li>
            <li>By far the best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>this is by far the best eyebrow liner eva made.</li>
            <li>(i.e., the tip doesn&#x27;t break off as you&#x27;re sharpening it), but this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a brow gel kind of girl</li>
            <li>Makes my fill in look completely natural and perfect!</li>
            <li>I simply love this pencil  the perfect color for my eyebrows and the look is very natural.</li>
            <li>but so easy to break!</li>
            <li>Great eyebrow pencil, and really longlasting!</li>
            <li>I just correct it with a cool tone powder and all is good.</li>
            <li>I am very light skin and brunette.. &#x27;</li>
            <li>worked as described and it is a good product to purchase and the best price, it cost less than in the stores</li>
            <li>I love this, I have very light eyebrows</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the brand though.</li>
            <li>I wish the brush was more angled though.</li>
            <li>love this product to make up my eyebrow</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this eye brow pencil/crayon.  </li>
            <li>I love using NYX products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This has more plum to it, color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I love love love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>I thought the color was OK</li>
            <li>love the look of arched ones c:.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like I give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;it could have more product in it though tbh.&lt;br /&gt;lol</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>The tip is also skinnier which allows for more precision.</li>
            <li>i love the quality of this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>but when I tried this it looked MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>I feel like you are better of buying a drug store liner.</li>
            <li>and i was kind of worried that this color would be too light on me</li>
            <li>Considering I don&#x27;t like the eyebrow pencils it is an okay one.</li>
            <li>I wanted the more &amp;#34;natural-looking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a retractable eyebrow pencil for a while, and I love NYX products</li>
            <li>for quality, I&#x27;ve used way better.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product</li>
            <li>More like a medium brown</li>
            <li>These colors run kind of light</li>
            <li>I love the formula though and it blends nicely, goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this, you are not always looking for your brush.  </li>
            <li>You will really love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely better than using an eye pencil.</li>
            <li>Who has so many eyebrows they have to comb them?</li>
            <li>I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>I love the texture (not oily), non-smudging even when sweating, and self-sharpening.  </li>
            <li>so I will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li>And I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A spoolie works much better.  </li>
            <li>A much better product is the IT cosmetics brow pencil or the Benefit cosmetic brow pencil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this pencil, I just reorder it again .</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>lOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re way better than the eyebrow cake set.</li>
            <li>I love this NYX  Eyebrow Pencil.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to use it or even try it.</li>
            <li>I love NYX, this just didnt do it for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more of an almond brown</li>
            <li>I love the brush at the end to fix my brows even if I don&#x27;t have time to put on the liner.</li>
            <li>The brush at the end is handy and nice to have right there for blending.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller also did pretty good, I received my brow pencil one day after they latest they estimated I would receive it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though, for the price, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Work pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s designed with a flat tip for easy application and the color matches my features perfectly.</li>
            <li>I really like this brow pencil because it is the perfect brown and it blends very well with the color of my brows.</li>
            <li>My mom ended up using it and it matched her light brown hair better than mine.</li>
            <li>NYX auto eyebrow pencil dark brown is wonderful, I love it.</li>
            <li>The color looked good on the picture, but not in real life.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The brow pencil works well, but watch out for the tip breaking since it breaks easily inside the pencil.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use,</li>
            <li>It is easy to put on (for someone that does not have defined eyebrows).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and goes well with my eyebrow color.</li>
            <li>This is a neat item that was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily, blends well, removes easily, doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes off easily with water and soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect color, the price is certainly right, and the issues with breakage and getting a fine enough point that I was having with the Covergirl product will not be a problem with the NYX pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This would have been a perfect replacement for the discontinued Maybelline Define-A-Brow Eyebrow Pencil in dark brown but this pencil has an orange tint.</li>
            <li>I love this product it make your brows look full and natural😀</li>
            <li>the dark brown is perfect for brunettes.  </li>
            <li>The color perfect for my dark brown complexion.</li>
            <li>I got the dark brown pencil and it works and looks wonderful!</li>
            <li>A fine pencil, but not as fine a one I used to buy.</li>
            <li>and I thought that looked fine,</li>
            <li>Then I could comb on my eyebrows, using the fine side of the comb at an angle to get a fine line on the outer edges.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and easily.  </li>
            <li>However, A WORTHY CHOICE!</li>
            <li>It works great, and if you know how to do it right, it will look very natural!</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly; a bit dark at first until you get the hang of putting it on, but all in all it is the BEST pencil I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>I think that it fits me perfectly, and the little brush on the back does great with taming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Perfect shade for my naturally very dark brows.</li>
            <li>Precise lines, great brow brush, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>the brown was too light</li>
            <li>It may be cheap but</li>
            <li>This brown was too light.  </li>
            <li>Color is too light for me.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth...</li>
            <li>I purchased the Brown one and it&#x27;s seems too light for my darkbrown-black hair</li>
            <li>For me this did not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>great for being only like 5 bucks too</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>, it goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>When I got this, it was a brown, like a light brown.</li>
            <li>but it was way to light for my color.</li>
            <li>but this was too light</li>
            <li>Easy to use but does not make clean lines.</li>
            <li>This pencil adds such a great look to the eyebrows, and you don&#x27;t have to put a lot.</li>
            <li>Coupled with a concealer this pencil does a fabulous job of drawing in your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally a light brown, and I always dye it darker.</li>
            <li>Otherwise for budget conscious people this is a good brow pencil</li>
            <li>Really great product, better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Used this kind for several years, liked it then and still do.  </li>
            <li>I love the retractable pencil because I always have a crisp edge for precise application.  </li>
            <li>It shows up great on my dark complexion and the pencil glides so smooth!</li>
            <li>The tip of the pencil turned out the be ellipse shaped for super easy application.</li>
            <li>It goeson very easily without having to apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I originally used a brow pencil I got from sephora for $12.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and I love the brush on the end of the product, however, it was quite harsh on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Not dark brown more like a light brown !</li>
            <li>The color is near perfect and the product typically goes on smoothly and easily though every now</li>
            <li>Like most of NYX&#x27;s products, this pencil is highly pigmented so coverage is very good with less coverage.</li>
            <li>This pencil is great to use and colors is as expected.</li>
            <li>Its not horrible because I have intense auburn hair,</li>
            <li>I noticed I spend so much time wasting the shave able pencils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s much smarter to pay more for a better&lt;br</li>
            <li>The comb was a good idea but an unfinished idea-- if they could think of a way to have the color contained in the comb, or come out of the comb, that would be terrific!</li>
            <li>it looks really good and blends in with my actual eyebrows.</li>
            <li>but I think not bad for price if you can get it to match.</li>
            <li>It is retractable with a cap and a great brush at the other end.  </li>
            <li>compacts, I keep coming back to Simply Powder because it is an awesome product that works great for me and is also extremely affordable.</li>
            <li>No real wow factor here just a good, quality eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>Although it was a great brow pencil, it was quickly used and I was wanting to find a pencil that would last much longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too waxy and it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>Id better choice the color more carefully next time.</li>
            <li>use it when I need a quick fix (camping etc,</li>
            <li>When I took the lid off the actual liner flew out, I managed to find it and shove it back in but wasnt impressed anyway..</li>
            <li>So far, very easily to apply.  </li>
            <li>just the right size to fit into a cosmetic purse, great little brush to help shape brows and color is true</li>
            <li>It is great for people like myself who have dark hair and need a darker pencil to fill in brow gaps,</li>
            <li>The brush on the other end is wonderful for brushing brows into place and also softening the color in the eyebrow for a natural ombre effect in the brow.  </li>
            <li>I fall in love all over again with every new NYX product I get.</li>
            <li>I really prefer my brows to look naturally full, smooth, and arched than to look like I&#x27;ve applied a brow pencil.  </li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use</li>
            <li>nice color, great for Asian with dark brown hair color</li>
            <li>I like this eyebrow pencil very much for its ease of use but would like to see it available in more shades, such as a light brown.</li>
            <li>Smudge easily and does not last more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this out since I had heard so many good reviews, but when mine arrived it was broken.</li>
            <li>Coming to this after using a traditional eyebrow pencil is amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, but I find that the color is really noticeable in my brown brows</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>FAR AS COLOR ITS OK.</li>
            <li>It is ok, the brush is too soft.</li>
            <li>it melts right off your face after about 2 hours..</li>
            <li>But what bugged me is the &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34; pencil just fell right out of the stick.</li>
            <li>I can never find one that has the right consistency or pigment.  </li>
            <li>Great item, a little on the red brown side, but super easy to apply, does not smudge.</li>
            <li>Having full eyebrows really changes the look of your face.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are dark but the brown is a good match</li>
            <li>It looks natural and is easily wiped off.</li>
            <li>However, Covergirl has been around for awhile and is a well-known brand with a great reputation, and I feel like they totally ripped me off hundreds of times over, especially when it comes to the eyebrow pencils and eyeliners I have purchased from them over the years.</li>
            <li>CHEAP AND CRAPPY PENCIL DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>Right now my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get more of these pencils cus</li>
            <li>CAME VERY FAST BEFORE DELIVERY DAY.</li>
            <li>I have very light blonde hair</li>
            <li>and it is fine so far,</li>
            <li>Works fine, blends in naturally.  </li>
            <li>My brows are gorgeous with little effort &amp; the color lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Dark brown&#x27; should have been fine, but it was too light!</li>
            <li>Absolutely buying it again!</li>
            <li>Works well and goes on smooth, dark seemed more like medium.</li>
            <li>Love this, use it several  times a week for over a year</li>
            <li>and I set it with an eyebrow powder to get the look exactly how I want it to be...</li>
            <li>The color is a pretty close match</li>
            <li>This is like, my favorite brow product next to Benefit&#x27;s Brow Zings!</li>
            <li>This is the first eyebrow pencil</li>
            <li>it is my first time to write the review .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly how I wanted it to work</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>but nope, it was absolutely just right.</li>
            <li>color dark brown is soft,  and incredibly pliable, it also blends expertly well and looks very much like a natural brow.</li>
            <li>my only criticism is that the color is a warm red based brown instead of the cool brown</li>
            <li>Seems based on other reviews that all their colors have a warm tone.</li>
            <li>eyebrows-- whether they are hot this season or not, some people have thin brows and need to be able to finely draw them or fill them in with a fine point.</li>
            <li>Nice color, maybe a hint of auburn in the dark brown.</li>
            <li>It seems to last all day and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>I purchased this pencil because I needed something easy to use when applying makeup on the go &amp; when I&#x27;m running short on time.</li>
            <li>so I have to hold it at a certain angle to prevent it from falling out.</li>
            <li>-less freak).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fine for the price, but certainly using a powder with brush looks much more natural.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and has a brush to smooth over stiff lines.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s retractable and has a soft brush to blend in for a more natural look, but it&#x27;s way too dark!</li>
            <li>It is really convenient to have liner and brush all in one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is a cheap, low quality item!  </li>
            <li>It blends very well.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t like it to much</li>
            <li>YOU HAVE TO REALLY COLOR YOUR EYEBROW IN TO GET THE COLOR TO STICK.</li>
            <li>but, really, it slides out every time</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really use brow pencils...</li>
            <li>This lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t smudge nearly as much during the day.</li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t really have a purpose in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky about which eyebrow pencils I like</li>
            <li>Very pigmented brown.</li>
            <li>But for $2 you cant complain too much.</li>
            <li>I really like this eyebrow pencil and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I have very sparse brows with no tail</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have very sparse brows</li>
            <li>the color looks very close to my hair color and doesn&#x27;t make my brows look like clown brows.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have so much control.</li>
            <li>It really does not do the trick in smoothing my brows.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s what I was expecting after ready the reviews.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also a weird squarish shape, which wasn&#x27;t really good for precise</li>
            <li>Loved the color but it broke down in two parts in my purse not long after I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Like some other reviewers said, it seems better</li>
            <li>Color is pretty dark but it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>ITS OK NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>more of a chestnut than a dark brown so may try to go a bit darker, but I do like this.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good price, but not a good product.</li>
            <li>I love the dark brown eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>The color is  more of a medium golden/chocolate brown than a dark brown.  </li>
            <li>the color is a dark brown as it states the price is affordable more so than the stores....</li>
            <li>All in all a decent product...</li>
            <li>It has a wide and narrow angle that makes it great to fill in and taper at the ends.  </li>
            <li>I would only recommend to someone with a fuller brow who only wanted more color or to define them.</li>
            <li>On the down side, it stays on about as well as your average brow pencil which isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I have used ENTIRE pencils in one sitting because I could not, not matter what I did, what sharpener I used, how slowly or gently I tried sharpening it, get anywhere near a fine point on the pencil without the pigment breaking completely off.</li>
            <li>very smooth and not too harsh on color.</li>
            <li>Use it all the time and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>I would prefer it to be a little more waxy and easier to manipulate</li>
            <li>The hue is a little more orange than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love and it a little to medium amount</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain, but I like this because my eyebrows look more like eyebrows and not fake.</li>
            <li>I like the shape of the tip, since it can simulate eyebrows better than a fat round pencil.</li>
            <li>It has an oval point instead of a normal circular ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this pencil everyday for over five months, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have spent upwards of $25 for an eye brow pencil, and this one is just as good, for a lot less.  </li>
            <li>The pencil  glides on easily and is simple enough for her to handle.</li>
            <li>Lasting color and easy to apply, lasting color.  </li>
            <li>so my eyebrows are nearly invisible, so I use this just to shade the brows themselves and the pigment adheres to the hair very well, resulting in a very natural look.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty cool little item...</li>
            <li>I like this pencil very much and use it daily.</li>
            <li>Looks very naturally</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking, and it lasts all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the pencil itself fine because it is exactly what I was looking for (self-sharpening, no extra highligher component, brush at one end) but the \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; color is reddish.  </li>
            <li>pencil does not need sharpening and although it does not self-sharpen to an extremely fine tip, the &amp;#34;wedge&amp;#34; shape of the pigment makes it easy to draw either a wider or a much more narrow line by simply changing the angle at which you&#x27;re drawing so that you are using the thin part of the wedge instead of the thicker part.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t chalky like some brow products and it was not expensive (it is the same price here as it is at Ulta&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>a dark brown usually works perfectly for me, but this one is lighter than expected.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate to have received the NYX Auto Eyebrow Pencil in Dark Brown this Christmas.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t know what a big difference this made until someone noticed.</li>
            <li>I understand that the Covergirl Brow and Eye Makers are not exactly top of the line eyebrow pencils, they sell for under $10, usually quite a bit under, and are widely available at pretty much every drugstore, grocery store, and discount store in the free world.</li>
            <li>I love their Simply Powder compacts and though I have tried more expensive, &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Lastly, the consistency, I swatched the color on my wrist to better see how it was too red and ended up having to do so multiple times because some swipes of the pencil just gave no color at all.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I am picky with brow pencils mainly because most can look fake or wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>There is also a stiff little brush on the end that comes in really handy for blending the product once it has been applied and for straightening out any clumped up brow hairs on the rare occasions</li>
            <li>Easy to use, convenient that it has a little brush on it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a little too much on the red side for a more natural look in my opinion.</li>
            <li>the color was a little darker than expected but the tip is much thicker than I anticipated which is good for &amp;#34;coloring&amp;#34; in the areas of sparseness but difficult to get a nice outline to start out with.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too light for my almost black eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>this is the first brow pencil purchase i&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s fun to use and it helps me get my eyebrow game right on</li>
            <li>This eyebrow pencil covers easily and does not easily clump or smear.</li>
            <li>It is a little too light.</li>
            <li>It clearly shapes the eyebrows just as I desired .</li>
            <li>It looks natural.</li>
            <li>but I like it so far</li>
            <li>I like a natural looking brow</li>
            <li>, the color looks natural and you can blend it with the included brush.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying Maybeline Define a Brow and am much happier with that product as the tip is much, much smaller and easier to control.</li>
            <li>My eyebrow look natural and the color stay all the day.</li>
            <li>It goes on without clumps, defines a natural brow line and is retractable.</li>
            <li>Tiny bit harsh but nice overall</li>
            <li>I am a blonde and have to make sure my brows don&#x27;t look to harsh.</li>
            <li>The Dark Brown color is true too.</li>
            <li>I am slowly being converted from sharpen pencils to the retractable can, it seems neater and more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good dark brown for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I applied a subtle amount and people were able to notice difference.</li>
            <li>applys well last all day would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of this product, but  I got the dark brown 05 and even though I have dark brown hair, it&#x27;s too light for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really dark</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look too dark or reddish like so many other pencils.</li>
            <li>Definitely NOT DARK BROWN.&lt;br /&gt;Ugh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, not very creamy which makes it skip across my eyebrows at first.</li>
            <li>but sadly it&#x27;s not really a dark brown.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not actually dark brown</li>
            <li>Not sure if the flat ended coloring part is helpful or problematic, but the larger sized, strong bristled brush at the other end is very useful.  </li>
            <li>The thinnest part is still a tad too thick for the ends of my brows but is easily adjusted to a much finer point with the gentle aid of a very sharp &amp;#34;exacto&amp;#34; knife, the kind I typically use for craft projects in which I cut small chunks of fimo clay off the &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; it comes packaged as, or need to make nonlinear cuts in paper.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m now repurchasing a dark brown one and see if it&#x27;ll be the right one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However the shade I ordered, dark brown, is not the right shade at all.</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with it sucks; it is too soft to smooth the product, so</li>
            <li>I got mine in blonde &amp; it looks so natural!</li>
            <li>No regrets!  </li>
            <li>It is such a small thing but makes such a striking difference on my face even if wearing no other makeup.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time the other day.</li>
            <li>Just wish the color were more accurate. :(</li>
            <li>but it can leave a bit of an orange tint if your not careful.</li>
            <li>Goes on pretty dark.</li>
            <li>it was exactly the color I expected, but once applied it was way too red</li>
            <li>Love it though the color stick was broken</li>
            <li>The pencil was broken when I got the package in the mail, but that&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li>Luckily, it wasn&#x27;t too pricey, so I didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money, but I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super lazy to use powders on my brows</li>
            <li>Just going to give the other one to my mom since I like it so much to return it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian with pretty dark hair/brows and tanned skin</li>
            <li>color is ok but the brush is useless, too soft for my liking.  </li>
            <li>One day late is no big deal to me, especially considering that the shipping was free.</li>
            <li>One day late is no big deal to me, especially considering that the shipping was free.</li>
            <li>I have dark auburn brown hair &amp; was afraid this would be too dark, but it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>(P.S.  the dark brown color is what you want to order if you have light to dark brown colored eyebrows without red coloring - I purchased from a solid seller, too).</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with its ease of use &amp; long lasting natural color.</li>
            <li>This product makes it so easy to darken my thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works really well and lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> So great to discover a great eyebrow pencil that does a great job for the fraction of the price of what I was paying for popular brands.  </li>
            <li> This brow pencil is amazing!</li>
            <li> tried so many, this is the best.  </li>
            <li> When I use NYX products I have the wonderful feeling that I am using something that has been created by people who love make</li>
            <li> And just the thought of knowing I don&#x27;t have to worry about sharpening it makes it that much more amazing!!</li>
            <li> and you never have to sharpen it or worry about ruining a good pencil..</li>

            <li> All in all they did a good job</li>
            <li> All in all they did a good job</li>
            <li> Fills in the areas that aren&#x27;t as full as I would like them to be perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great :)</li>
            <li> Very nice, I plan on getting more</li>
            <li> This pencil goes on wonderfully smooth and has great color payoff when using a good primer.  </li>
            <li> Its the perfect shade of brown and it blends very very well.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this eyebrow pencil!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for a great eyebrow pencil that goes on evenly and stays sharp/is easy to sharpen</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on and looks great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...</li>
            <li> amazing</li>
            <li> its handy.</li>
            <li> Would have liked it lighter browns</li>
            <li> Nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li> and it goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strictly brown, its actually kind of reddish.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> and it had a nice brown.</li>
            <li> The NYX product will be a backup if I ever run out of the Maybeline product but honestly, I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Yes, the pencil works well and blends nicely into my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pencil based on the many good reviews, but I find it to be of middling quality.  </li>
            <li> My favorite brow pencil love it more than my Anastasia dip brow pomade!!</li>
            <li> works good for me, easy to use</li>
            <li> just so convenient to be able to draw on and brush to give it a better effect !</li>
            <li> By far the best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> this is by far the best eyebrow liner eva made.</li>
            <li> (i.e., the tip doesn&#x27;t break off as you&#x27;re sharpening it), but this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a brow gel kind of girl</li>
            <li> Makes my fill in look completely natural and perfect!</li>
            <li> I simply love this pencil  the perfect color for my eyebrows and the look is very natural.</li>
            <li> but so easy to break!</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow pencil, and really longlasting!</li>
            <li> I just correct it with a cool tone powder and all is good.</li>
            <li> I am very light skin and brunette.. &#x27;</li>
            <li> worked as described and it is a good product to purchase and the best price, it cost less than in the stores</li>
            <li> I love this, I have very light eyebrows</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love the brand though.</li>
            <li> I wish the brush was more angled though.</li>
            <li> love this product to make up my eyebrow</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye brow pencil/crayon.  </li>
            <li> I love using NYX products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This has more plum to it, color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I love love love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> I thought the color was OK</li>
            <li> love the look of arched ones c:.&lt;br</li>
            <li> like I give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;it could have more product in it though tbh.&lt;br /&gt;lol</li>
            <li> but I love it.  </li>
            <li> The tip is also skinnier which allows for more precision.</li>
            <li> i love the quality of this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> but when I tried this it looked MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> I feel like you are better of buying a drug store liner.</li>
            <li> and i was kind of worried that this color would be too light on me</li>
            <li> Considering I don&#x27;t like the eyebrow pencils it is an okay one.</li>
            <li> I wanted the more &amp;#34;natural-looking&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a retractable eyebrow pencil for a while, and I love NYX products</li>
            <li> for quality, I&#x27;ve used way better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product</li>
            <li> More like a medium brown</li>
            <li> These colors run kind of light</li>
            <li> I love the formula though and it blends nicely, goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this, you are not always looking for your brush.  </li>
            <li> You will really love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s definitely better than using an eye pencil.</li>
            <li> Who has so many eyebrows they have to comb them?</li>
            <li> I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> I love the texture (not oily), non-smudging even when sweating, and self-sharpening.  </li>
            <li> so I will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> And I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A spoolie works much better.  </li>
            <li> A much better product is the IT cosmetics brow pencil or the Benefit cosmetic brow pencil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this pencil, I just reorder it again .</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> lOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re way better than the eyebrow cake set.</li>
            <li> I love this NYX  Eyebrow Pencil.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t able to use it or even try it.</li>
            <li> I love NYX, this just didnt do it for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more of an almond brown</li>
            <li> I love the brush at the end to fix my brows even if I don&#x27;t have time to put on the liner.</li>
            <li> The brush at the end is handy and nice to have right there for blending.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller also did pretty good, I received my brow pencil one day after they latest they estimated I would receive it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though, for the price, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Work pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s designed with a flat tip for easy application and the color matches my features perfectly.</li>
            <li> I really like this brow pencil because it is the perfect brown and it blends very well with the color of my brows.</li>
            <li> My mom ended up using it and it matched her light brown hair better than mine.</li>
            <li> NYX auto eyebrow pencil dark brown is wonderful, I love it.</li>
            <li> The color looked good on the picture, but not in real life.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The brow pencil works well, but watch out for the tip breaking since it breaks easily inside the pencil.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use,</li>
            <li> It is easy to put on (for someone that does not have defined eyebrows).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and goes well with my eyebrow color.</li>
            <li> This is a neat item that was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily, blends well, removes easily, doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes off easily with water and soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect color, the price is certainly right, and the issues with breakage and getting a fine enough point that I was having with the Covergirl product will not be a problem with the NYX pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This would have been a perfect replacement for the discontinued Maybelline Define-A-Brow Eyebrow Pencil in dark brown but this pencil has an orange tint.</li>
            <li> I love this product it make your brows look full and natural😀</li>
            <li> the dark brown is perfect for brunettes.  </li>
            <li> The color perfect for my dark brown complexion.</li>
            <li> I got the dark brown pencil and it works and looks wonderful!</li>
            <li> A fine pencil, but not as fine a one I used to buy.</li>
            <li> and I thought that looked fine,</li>
            <li> Then I could comb on my eyebrows, using the fine side of the comb at an angle to get a fine line on the outer edges.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and easily.  </li>
            <li> However, A WORTHY CHOICE!</li>
            <li> It works great, and if you know how to do it right, it will look very natural!</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly; a bit dark at first until you get the hang of putting it on, but all in all it is the BEST pencil I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I think that it fits me perfectly, and the little brush on the back does great with taming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade for my naturally very dark brows.</li>
            <li> Precise lines, great brow brush, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> the brown was too light</li>
            <li> It may be cheap but</li>
            <li> This brown was too light.  </li>
            <li> Color is too light for me.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth...</li>
            <li> I purchased the Brown one and it&#x27;s seems too light for my darkbrown-black hair</li>
            <li> For me this did not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> great for being only like 5 bucks too</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> , it goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> When I got this, it was a brown, like a light brown.</li>
            <li> but it was way to light for my color.</li>
            <li> but this was too light</li>
            <li> Easy to use but does not make clean lines.</li>
            <li> This pencil adds such a great look to the eyebrows, and you don&#x27;t have to put a lot.</li>
            <li> Coupled with a concealer this pencil does a fabulous job of drawing in your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a light brown, and I always dye it darker.</li>
            <li> Otherwise for budget conscious people this is a good brow pencil</li>
            <li> Really great product, better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Used this kind for several years, liked it then and still do.  </li>
            <li> I love the retractable pencil because I always have a crisp edge for precise application.  </li>
            <li> It shows up great on my dark complexion and the pencil glides so smooth!</li>
            <li> The tip of the pencil turned out the be ellipse shaped for super easy application.</li>
            <li> It goeson very easily without having to apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I originally used a brow pencil I got from sephora for $12.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I love the brush on the end of the product, however, it was quite harsh on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Not dark brown more like a light brown !</li>
            <li> The color is near perfect and the product typically goes on smoothly and easily though every now</li>
            <li> Like most of NYX&#x27;s products, this pencil is highly pigmented so coverage is very good with less coverage.</li>
            <li> This pencil is great to use and colors is as expected.</li>
            <li> Its not horrible because I have intense auburn hair,</li>
            <li> I noticed I spend so much time wasting the shave able pencils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s much smarter to pay more for a better&lt;br</li>
            <li> The comb was a good idea but an unfinished idea-- if they could think of a way to have the color contained in the comb, or come out of the comb, that would be terrific!</li>
            <li> it looks really good and blends in with my actual eyebrows.</li>
            <li> but I think not bad for price if you can get it to match.</li>
            <li> It is retractable with a cap and a great brush at the other end.  </li>
            <li> compacts, I keep coming back to Simply Powder because it is an awesome product that works great for me and is also extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> No real wow factor here just a good, quality eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Although it was a great brow pencil, it was quickly used and I was wanting to find a pencil that would last much longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too waxy and it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> Id better choice the color more carefully next time.</li>
            <li> use it when I need a quick fix (camping etc,</li>
            <li> When I took the lid off the actual liner flew out, I managed to find it and shove it back in but wasnt impressed anyway..</li>
            <li> So far, very easily to apply.  </li>
            <li> just the right size to fit into a cosmetic purse, great little brush to help shape brows and color is true</li>
            <li> It is great for people like myself who have dark hair and need a darker pencil to fill in brow gaps,</li>
            <li> The brush on the other end is wonderful for brushing brows into place and also softening the color in the eyebrow for a natural ombre effect in the brow.  </li>
            <li> I fall in love all over again with every new NYX product I get.</li>
            <li> I really prefer my brows to look naturally full, smooth, and arched than to look like I&#x27;ve applied a brow pencil.  </li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use</li>
            <li> nice color, great for Asian with dark brown hair color</li>
            <li> I like this eyebrow pencil very much for its ease of use but would like to see it available in more shades, such as a light brown.</li>
            <li> Smudge easily and does not last more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this out since I had heard so many good reviews, but when mine arrived it was broken.</li>
            <li> Coming to this after using a traditional eyebrow pencil is amazing.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, but I find that the color is really noticeable in my brown brows</li>
            <li> well worth it</li>
            <li> FAR AS COLOR ITS OK.</li>
            <li> It is ok, the brush is too soft.</li>
            <li> it melts right off your face after about 2 hours..</li>
            <li> But what bugged me is the &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34; pencil just fell right out of the stick.</li>
            <li> I can never find one that has the right consistency or pigment.  </li>
            <li> Great item, a little on the red brown side, but super easy to apply, does not smudge.</li>
            <li> Having full eyebrows really changes the look of your face.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are dark but the brown is a good match</li>
            <li> It looks natural and is easily wiped off.</li>
            <li> However, Covergirl has been around for awhile and is a well-known brand with a great reputation, and I feel like they totally ripped me off hundreds of times over, especially when it comes to the eyebrow pencils and eyeliners I have purchased from them over the years.</li>
            <li> CHEAP AND CRAPPY PENCIL DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Right now my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get more of these pencils cus</li>
            <li> CAME VERY FAST BEFORE DELIVERY DAY.</li>
            <li> I have very light blonde hair</li>
            <li> and it is fine so far,</li>
            <li> Works fine, blends in naturally.  </li>
            <li> My brows are gorgeous with little effort &amp; the color lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Dark brown&#x27; should have been fine, but it was too light!</li>
            <li> Absolutely buying it again!</li>
            <li> Works well and goes on smooth, dark seemed more like medium.</li>
            <li> Love this, use it several  times a week for over a year</li>
            <li> and I set it with an eyebrow powder to get the look exactly how I want it to be...</li>
            <li> The color is a pretty close match</li>
            <li> This is like, my favorite brow product next to Benefit&#x27;s Brow Zings!</li>
            <li> This is the first eyebrow pencil</li>
            <li> it is my first time to write the review .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly how I wanted it to work</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> but nope, it was absolutely just right.</li>
            <li> color dark brown is soft,  and incredibly pliable, it also blends expertly well and looks very much like a natural brow.</li>
            <li> my only criticism is that the color is a warm red based brown instead of the cool brown</li>
            <li> Seems based on other reviews that all their colors have a warm tone.</li>
            <li> eyebrows-- whether they are hot this season or not, some people have thin brows and need to be able to finely draw them or fill them in with a fine point.</li>
            <li> Nice color, maybe a hint of auburn in the dark brown.</li>
            <li> It seems to last all day and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pencil because I needed something easy to use when applying makeup on the go &amp; when I&#x27;m running short on time.</li>
            <li> so I have to hold it at a certain angle to prevent it from falling out.</li>
            <li> -less freak).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fine for the price, but certainly using a powder with brush looks much more natural.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has a brush to smooth over stiff lines.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s retractable and has a soft brush to blend in for a more natural look, but it&#x27;s way too dark!</li>
            <li> It is really convenient to have liner and brush all in one.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, low quality item!  </li>
            <li> It blends very well.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it to much</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE TO REALLY COLOR YOUR EYEBROW IN TO GET THE COLOR TO STICK.</li>
            <li> but, really, it slides out every time</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really use brow pencils...</li>
            <li> This lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t smudge nearly as much during the day.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t really have a purpose in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about which eyebrow pencils I like</li>
            <li> Very pigmented brown.</li>
            <li> But for $2 you cant complain too much.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyebrow pencil and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows with no tail</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows</li>
            <li> the color looks very close to my hair color and doesn&#x27;t make my brows look like clown brows.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have so much control.</li>
            <li> It really does not do the trick in smoothing my brows.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what I was expecting after ready the reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a weird squarish shape, which wasn&#x27;t really good for precise</li>
            <li> Loved the color but it broke down in two parts in my purse not long after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers said, it seems better</li>
            <li> Color is pretty dark but it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> ITS OK NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> more of a chestnut than a dark brown so may try to go a bit darker, but I do like this.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good price, but not a good product.</li>
            <li> I love the dark brown eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> The color is  more of a medium golden/chocolate brown than a dark brown.  </li>
            <li> the color is a dark brown as it states the price is affordable more so than the stores....</li>
            <li> All in all a decent product...</li>
            <li> It has a wide and narrow angle that makes it great to fill in and taper at the ends.  </li>
            <li> I would only recommend to someone with a fuller brow who only wanted more color or to define them.</li>
            <li> On the down side, it stays on about as well as your average brow pencil which isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> I have used ENTIRE pencils in one sitting because I could not, not matter what I did, what sharpener I used, how slowly or gently I tried sharpening it, get anywhere near a fine point on the pencil without the pigment breaking completely off.</li>
            <li> very smooth and not too harsh on color.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> I would prefer it to be a little more waxy and easier to manipulate</li>
            <li> The hue is a little more orange than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love and it a little to medium amount</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain, but I like this because my eyebrows look more like eyebrows and not fake.</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the tip, since it can simulate eyebrows better than a fat round pencil.</li>
            <li> It has an oval point instead of a normal circular ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this pencil everyday for over five months, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have spent upwards of $25 for an eye brow pencil, and this one is just as good, for a lot less.  </li>
            <li> The pencil  glides on easily and is simple enough for her to handle.</li>
            <li> Lasting color and easy to apply, lasting color.  </li>
            <li> so my eyebrows are nearly invisible, so I use this just to shade the brows themselves and the pigment adheres to the hair very well, resulting in a very natural look.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool little item...</li>
            <li> I like this pencil very much and use it daily.</li>
            <li> Looks very naturally</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural looking, and it lasts all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the pencil itself fine because it is exactly what I was looking for (self-sharpening, no extra highligher component, brush at one end) but the \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; color is reddish.  </li>
            <li> pencil does not need sharpening and although it does not self-sharpen to an extremely fine tip, the &amp;#34;wedge&amp;#34; shape of the pigment makes it easy to draw either a wider or a much more narrow line by simply changing the angle at which you&#x27;re drawing so that you are using the thin part of the wedge instead of the thicker part.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t chalky like some brow products and it was not expensive (it is the same price here as it is at Ulta&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> a dark brown usually works perfectly for me, but this one is lighter than expected.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to have received the NYX Auto Eyebrow Pencil in Dark Brown this Christmas.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t know what a big difference this made until someone noticed.</li>
            <li> I understand that the Covergirl Brow and Eye Makers are not exactly top of the line eyebrow pencils, they sell for under $10, usually quite a bit under, and are widely available at pretty much every drugstore, grocery store, and discount store in the free world.</li>
            <li> I love their Simply Powder compacts and though I have tried more expensive, &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Lastly, the consistency, I swatched the color on my wrist to better see how it was too red and ended up having to do so multiple times because some swipes of the pencil just gave no color at all.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I am picky with brow pencils mainly because most can look fake or wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> There is also a stiff little brush on the end that comes in really handy for blending the product once it has been applied and for straightening out any clumped up brow hairs on the rare occasions</li>
            <li> Easy to use, convenient that it has a little brush on it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a little too much on the red side for a more natural look in my opinion.</li>
            <li> the color was a little darker than expected but the tip is much thicker than I anticipated which is good for &amp;#34;coloring&amp;#34; in the areas of sparseness but difficult to get a nice outline to start out with.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too light for my almost black eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> this is the first brow pencil purchase i&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s fun to use and it helps me get my eyebrow game right on</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil covers easily and does not easily clump or smear.</li>
            <li> It is a little too light.</li>
            <li> It clearly shapes the eyebrows just as I desired .</li>
            <li> It looks natural.</li>
            <li> but I like it so far</li>
            <li> I like a natural looking brow</li>
            <li> , the color looks natural and you can blend it with the included brush.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying Maybeline Define a Brow and am much happier with that product as the tip is much, much smaller and easier to control.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow look natural and the color stay all the day.</li>
            <li> It goes on without clumps, defines a natural brow line and is retractable.</li>
            <li> Tiny bit harsh but nice overall</li>
            <li> I am a blonde and have to make sure my brows don&#x27;t look to harsh.</li>
            <li> The Dark Brown color is true too.</li>
            <li> I am slowly being converted from sharpen pencils to the retractable can, it seems neater and more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good dark brown for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I applied a subtle amount and people were able to notice difference.</li>
            <li> applys well last all day would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of this product, but  I got the dark brown 05 and even though I have dark brown hair, it&#x27;s too light for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really dark</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look too dark or reddish like so many other pencils.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT DARK BROWN.&lt;br /&gt;Ugh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, not very creamy which makes it skip across my eyebrows at first.</li>
            <li> but sadly it&#x27;s not really a dark brown.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not actually dark brown</li>
            <li> Not sure if the flat ended coloring part is helpful or problematic, but the larger sized, strong bristled brush at the other end is very useful.  </li>
            <li> The thinnest part is still a tad too thick for the ends of my brows but is easily adjusted to a much finer point with the gentle aid of a very sharp &amp;#34;exacto&amp;#34; knife, the kind I typically use for craft projects in which I cut small chunks of fimo clay off the &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; it comes packaged as, or need to make nonlinear cuts in paper.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m now repurchasing a dark brown one and see if it&#x27;ll be the right one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the shade I ordered, dark brown, is not the right shade at all.</li>
            <li> The brush that comes with it sucks; it is too soft to smooth the product, so</li>
            <li> I got mine in blonde &amp; it looks so natural!</li>
            <li> No regrets!  </li>
            <li> It is such a small thing but makes such a striking difference on my face even if wearing no other makeup.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time the other day.</li>
            <li> Just wish the color were more accurate. :(</li>
            <li> but it can leave a bit of an orange tint if your not careful.</li>
            <li> Goes on pretty dark.</li>
            <li> it was exactly the color I expected, but once applied it was way too red</li>
            <li> Love it though the color stick was broken</li>
            <li> The pencil was broken when I got the package in the mail, but that&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li> Luckily, it wasn&#x27;t too pricey, so I didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money, but I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super lazy to use powders on my brows</li>
            <li> Just going to give the other one to my mom since I like it so much to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with pretty dark hair/brows and tanned skin</li>
            <li> color is ok but the brush is useless, too soft for my liking.  </li>
            <li> One day late is no big deal to me, especially considering that the shipping was free.</li>
            <li> One day late is no big deal to me, especially considering that the shipping was free.</li>
            <li> I have dark auburn brown hair &amp; was afraid this would be too dark, but it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> (P.S.  the dark brown color is what you want to order if you have light to dark brown colored eyebrows without red coloring - I purchased from a solid seller, too).</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with its ease of use &amp; long lasting natural color.</li>
            <li> This product makes it so easy to darken my thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works really well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product, only sorry I did not get black instead of dark brown...</li>
            <li> i bought this because eyebrow game is a significant thing these days.</li>
            <li> A little lighter in color than I expected &amp; the pencil&#x27;s a little rough, however; I love the brush, blends well</li>
            <li> This pencil is as good if not better than the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> hope I can combine the dark brown and black to get exactly the color I need.</li>
            <li> The color is not orangey like others, either, but a natural looking dark brown.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s my first complaint.</li>
            <li> And it seems to last for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really trying to find a eyebrow pencil that didn&#x27;t make my brows look too dark (because they are already dark).</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t want to purchase black/charcoal because those would probably look less natural</li>
            <li> and then it seems like I get a couple of bum pencils that want to go on either blotchy and too thick or unevenly and way too lightly.</li>
            <li> with a smooth drawing liner and brush, i use it everyday and it is very decent price, compared to other expensive product.</li>
            <li> The only drawbacks I find is that if you have oily skin and forget your primer, your brows will migrate a bit and the dark brown color has a very warm, almost reddish base.  </li>
            <li> the brush at the end is a little weak but the pencil side makes up for it because the product is at an angle which makes it easy to apply and make the eyebrow shape you are wanting to achieve</li>
            <li> and so it just looks strange.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for so long, and it looks like the NYX Auto Eyebrow Pencil is it.</li>
            <li> so I cannot yet say how long the pencil lasts.</li>
            <li> This is a crayon that goes on very waxy and thick, and looks like a child drew on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> A little too waxy, and the brush is very soft, i like harder bristles.</li>
            <li> It was extremely dry as if it had been left to sit with the top off for a long period of time which made it very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> and this goes a long way to help that!</li>
            <li> THIS EYELINER WAS DRY INSIDE THE TUBE</li>
            <li> Like that the wax tip is not round but rather in a rectangle so as to get a wide line or narrow line depending on your preference.  </li>
            <li> It was packaged a little sloppily but no worse for wear, my brow pencil was still in the manufacturer&#x27;s packaging and obviously new and unused.</li>
            <li> Got the dark brown, and truly is brown, no red in it.  </li>
            <li> When applied it comes out as a deep mahogany instead of a dark brown.</li>
            <li> and it had too much red in the pigment to be called &#x27;dark brown&#x27;</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t looking for a heavy pencil and still this barely showed.</li>
            <li> Only con I go through them sooo fast and the dark brown color is hard to find always sold out in stores!</li>
            <li> Definitely not for black hair</li>
            <li> asian with naturally black hair/medium skin tone</li>
            <li> but, this NYX eyebrow pencil is better than other expensive ones!</li>
            <li> Every single make up lover should have a trusty eyebrow pencil!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get a natural application.</li>
            <li> The tip gets dull after a while and it makes it more difficult to draw eyebrows on.</li>
            <li> not quite what I expected</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> mine was broken and the whole pencil stick</li>
            <li> Works as expected and advertised</li>
            <li> However the color looked as expected.</li>
            <li> However, dark brown has a very red cast to it and isn&#x27;t dark enough, and black would be too dark.</li>
            <li> so I would suggest following the advice of other reviews and getting the black pencil if you have dark brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American and my eyebrows are black and I usually use a dark brown pencil</li>
            <li> i just write the main point that it&#x27;s broken when i got this,  not work</li>
            <li> Maybe I will try the black next time although I find black pencils to be too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can not find it in stores in the area I live in, so I constantly have to buy it online.</li>
            <li> I used to have to sharpen my pencil every other day, which was a pain.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as I expected.</li>
            <li> I expected when I think of dark brown.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use one end without the other</li>
            <li> With other brows pencils I had to apply allot of pressure just to get some color out of the product, but not with this one.</li>
            <li> The fine point is gone after the first use and then you have a thick rounded end forever after, which makes for a thick ugly brow line.</li>
            <li> I found on with Maybeline, but they have up and decided to quit making thier dark brown even though they still make all of the other colors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they designed this pencil to have such an oddly shaped point.</li>
            <li> Hard to blend in with actual dark brown eyebrow hairs..</li>
            <li> have been using Covergirl Brow &amp; Eye Makers in Midnight Brown for YEARS and have been primarily content but occasionally frustrated beyond words with them.</li>
            <li> so I got this brow pencil in dark brown.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dark brown, I&#x27;d recommend getting a darker color,</li>
            <li> NOT AS DARK AS EXSPECTED.</li>
            <li> I ORDER DARK BROWN.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a dark brown</li>
            <li> The dark brown works for me, and I have medium brown hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the product in the dark brown shade.</li>
            <li> The color, a dark brown is just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> I gave the pencil 3 stars for average staying power.</li>
            <li> I ordered this eye brows pencil in \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; and I would think that it would be a dark brown.</li>
            <li> I bought the Dark Brown, just looking at the pencil</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a dark brown to suit my dark hair.</li>
            <li> and I no longer care, the NYX Auto Eyebrow Pencil 05 Dark Brown has permanently taken my eyebrow pencil business away from Covergirl forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have light/fair skin, but my hair is dark dark brown</li>
            <li> so I give it a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> Does not run down your face when you exercise.  </li>
            <li> Dripped down during dinner</li>
            <li> So if you have dark eye brows, I recommend going with the black.</li>
            <li> The angle of the flat liner also makes it hard to draw on eyebrows and fill them in.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I dont like is that its a little hard.</li>
            <li> but I like a slightly ash tone brown for my brows.  </li>
            <li> even black if they have it.</li>
            <li> but non the less it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows come in black, so</li>
            <li> I used one pencil for 4 and a half months.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the it in black....</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it for eyeliner much less eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> However, I thought the dark brown would be a little bit darker.  </li>
            <li> Went from Maybelline eyebrow pencil, to the type you brush on (what a hassle and a mess), to this.  </li>
            <li> No hassle or mess with using this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Since my eyebrow is black, it&#x27;s a little wired because its brown.</li>
            <li> I bought this pencil for my sister who is on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> Also, being a retractable pencil there is little need to sharpen it, and there is less waste than with a wood pencil.</li>
            <li> This color appeared to be a little darker than I needed</li>
            <li> but I wish it was a little lighter in color.</li>
            <li> so it stands out a little bit.  </li>
            <li> BUT THE PRODUCT WAS HARD AND DRY!</li>
            <li> I have naturally black brows to go with pale skin</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair</li>
            <li> My everyday brow pencil.</li>
            <li> I saw a few reviews on this one and decided to try it</li>
            <li> I use this everyday I have had this for about 6 months</li>
            <li> That was a waste of about $9.</li>
            <li> And I do my eyebrows almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I received the eyebrow pencil a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Another waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> y fragile from them based upon the sloppy packaging on this item.</li>
            <li> The fact that I bought dark brown, and it wasn&#x27;t dark brown made me very mad/ disappointed.</li>
            <li> It also wipes off really easily, so no rubbing your face.</li>
            <li> One usually lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> Overall this pencil is such a let down, highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would definitely give the seller another chance but might be wary of purchasing anything very fragile from them based upon the sloppy packaging on this item.</li>
            <li> Barely any product, I opened the cap and all the product fell down onto the sink and smudged everywhere causing it to be a bit dirty.</li>
            <li> It is not tested on innocent animals, a very cruel practice.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> eyebrows, however I was not able to achieve those eyebrows with just this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> the others had, and it was the wrong color, different from the others I bought.</li>
            <li> I also do not like the small brush on the end.  </li>
            <li> HARD TO BLEND.</li>
            <li> It was a bit hard to blend in, thus, I had to run it over with some brow powder to soften it up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being a dark-skinned women and finding a pencil to match your complexion is hard.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly..do not have to press hard on the brow...</li>
            <li> At least it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a clown.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different brow pencils for awhile now in hopes of finding an affordable replacement for the disappointing Covergirl Brow &amp; Eye Makers</li>
            <li> I have been using it at least 6 days a week</li>
            <li> This liner sucks.  </li>
            <li> Not Everyone has fat thick furry</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s wayyyy too thick for an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> The NYX brow pencil works just as well as other expensive pencils.</li>
            <li> so it makes it difficult to apply under the arches where you need a sharp precision point.</li>
            <li> It also seems that out of every maybe 8-10 purchases of the Covergirl product, I will get a pack of 2 pencils in which one if not both of them are IMPOSSIBLE to sharpen without constantly breaking.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a good pencil at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me a waste of money.</li>
            <li> NOW THE OVER ALL PENCIL IS A VERY HARD WAX.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this pencil at all and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> no indication yet that it is about to &amp;#34;run out.&amp;#34; As soon as I figure out the approximate life span of the product I will update.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so are my (thin) eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I always buy expensive eyebrow pencils until I googled &amp; found this one &amp; decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and it does not look fake.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple kinds and always thought that it looks fake and un-natural on me.</li>
            <li> I just got the wrong color.</li>
            <li> yes I know it&#x27;s silly to wear make up camping</li>
            <li> But to just comb them, sorry, I don&#x27;t get the point.</li>
            <li> And I received it broken :(</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> This pencil has a orange tint to it, it&#x27;s terrible..</li>
            <li> This tip is horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Definitely not for black hair</li>
            <li> the brown was too light</li>
            <li> i bought this because eyebrow game is a significant thing these days. its handy.</li>
            <li> The color is like a medium brown. Its the perfect shade of brown and it blends very very well. It looks natural.</li>
            <li> very smooth and not too harsh on color. I love it</li>
            <li> Easy to use, convenient that it has a little brush on it. Color is pretty dark but it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> No real wow factor here just a good, quality eyebrow pencil. I think I would have been happier with the powder and the wax. I love the brand though.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use. I wish the brush was more angled though. The color is perfect on me</li>
            <li> It may be cheap but well worth it I like in my nyx  cosmetics</li>
            <li> Would have liked it lighter browns</li>
            <li> It works and blends so well its, it has a point thats easier to make smaller or bigger in shape and you never have to sharpen it or worry about ruining a good pencil.. the brush helps blend it to your eyebrow or if you use a powder over it like it do..</li>
            <li> Love this! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The brow pencil works well, but watch out for the tip breaking since it breaks easily inside the pencil. The advertised color is a different story... I&#x27;m Asian with pretty dark hair/brows and tanned skin so I got this brow pencil in dark brown. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a little too much on the red side for a more natural look in my opinion. Like some other reviewers said, it seems better</li>
            <li> Why have I been living my life without this? Every single make up lover should have a trusty eyebrow pencil! This color appeared to be a little darker than I needed but nope, it was absolutely just right. It goes on very smoothly; a bit dark at first until you get the hang of putting it on, but all in all it is the BEST pencil I have ever bought. Absolutely buying it again!</li>
            <li> Works well and goes on smooth, dark seemed more like medium. So when in doubt, choose darker.</li>
            <li> love this product to make up my eyebrow it is pefectttttt</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really dark but I like it so far</li>
            <li> It is not tested on innocent animals, a very cruel practice.  I love this product.  I&#x27;m not William, I&#x27;m his wife, Rachel.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow pencil!  It is great for people like myself who have dark hair and need a darker pencil to fill in brow gaps,</li>
            <li> Like that the wax tip is not round but rather in a rectangle so as to get a wide line or narrow line depending on your preference.  It is really convenient to have liner and brush all in one.  Nice for traveling.  Got the dark brown, and truly is brown, no red in it.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Great match on color.....Easy to apply.  Stays on all day and is not waxy.  I would recommend this product and/or purchase again.</li>
            <li> This pencil has a orange tint to it, it&#x27;s terrible.. it melts right off your face after about 2 hours.. I recommend brow powders instead.</li>
            <li> This brown was too light.  It&#x27;s hard to find a good dark brown for eyebrows.  I found on with Maybeline, but they have up and decided to quit making thier dark brown even though they still make all of the other colors.  Bum&#x27;s me out!  I wish someone would buy thier formula of brown and start making it again.</li>
            <li> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;QLa-k_rgaA4</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye brow pencil/crayon.  I have spent upwards of $25 for an eye brow pencil, and this one is just as good, for a lot less.  It is retractable with a cap and a great brush at the other end.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love using NYX products. This pencil is great to use and colors is as expected.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, low quality item!  I will go back to the more expensive one.  At least it doesn&#x27;t make me look like a clown.</li>
            <li> I have white hair and this works for my brows. The brush that comes with it sucks; it is too soft to smooth the product, so I use another brow brush with it. It seems to last all day and washes out easily. It isn&#x27;t chalky like some brow products and it was not expensive (it is the same price here as it is at Ulta&#x27;s). All in all a decent product...but I wish it was a little lighter in color.</li>
            <li> By far the best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve ever used! IT IS THE BOMB.COM! I got mine in blonde &amp; it looks so natural! Will diff. be buying another!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Color is too light for me. Smudge easily and does not last more than an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I like this pencil very much and use it daily. In order to grow out my eyebrows, I occasionally apply castor oil on a qtip to them. This pencil holds its color even if I applied the oil that very same day, it does not smudge. The brush is perfect for shaping.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t meet the expectations I had for it</li>
            <li> This has more plum to it, color not quite what I expected but the quality is good, I like the brush and it&#x27;s easy to use,</li>
            <li> This pencil goes on wonderfully smooth and has great color payoff when using a good primer.  I love the retractable pencil because I always have a crisp edge for precise application.  The brush on the other end is wonderful for brushing brows into place and also softening the color in the eyebrow for a natural ombre effect in the brow.  The only drawbacks I find is that if you have oily skin and forget your primer, your brows will migrate a bit and the dark brown color has a very warm, almost reddish base.  I have naturally black brows to go with pale skin so it stands out a little bit.  Its not horrible because I have intense auburn hair, but I like a slightly ash tone brown for my brows.  I just correct it with a cool tone powder and all is good.</li>
            <li> I always buy expensive eyebrow pencils until I googled &amp; found this one &amp; decided to give it a try. No regrets!  Instead of paying Estée Lauder $26, now I pay $4.99 &amp; it works just as well!</li>
            <li> I am picky with brow pencils mainly because most can look fake or wear out quickly. I originally used a brow pencil I got from sephora for $12. Although it was a great brow pencil, it was quickly used and I was wanting to find a pencil that would last much longer. The NYX brow pencil works just as well as other expensive pencils. I have been using it for about 2 months and it still has ways to go before I throw it away. It stays on all day and it does not look fake. It blends very well.</li>
            <li> Love this, use it several  times a week for over a year</li>
            <li> Tiny bit harsh but nice overall</li>
            <li> Loved this pencil. Precise lines, great brow brush, definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow pencil, and really longlasting!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyebrow pencil for years! I love it! It is easy to put on (for someone that does not have defined eyebrows). One usually lasts me a few months. I bought 5 to last me for a while. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of this product, but  I got the dark brown 05 and even though I have dark brown hair, it&#x27;s too light for me.  If your hair is dark brown, I&#x27;d recommend getting a darker color, even black if they have it.</li>
            <li> I did not like this eyebrow pencil at all. It&#x27;s too waxy and it wears off quickly. The pencil itself is shaped like an oval so it makes it difficult to apply under the arches where you need a sharp precision point. I was not happy with this pencil at all and will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I like the way it glides on but it can leave a bit of an orange tint if your not careful.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...It goes on so smooth...And just the thought of knowing I don&#x27;t have to worry about sharpening it makes it that much more amazing!! I use this and I set it with an eyebrow powder to get the look exactly how I want it to be...Great product! Will be purchasing again...</li>
            <li> This was a gr8 purchase . It clearly shapes the eyebrows just as I desired .</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it to much i don&#x27;t like the way it make my eyebrows look</li>
            <li> CAME VERY FAST BEFORE DELIVERY DAY. FAR AS COLOR ITS OK. NOT AS DARK AS EXSPECTED. I ORDER DARK BROWN. NOW THE OVER ALL PENCIL IS A VERY HARD WAX. HARD TO BLEND. YOU HAVE TO REALLY COLOR YOUR EYEBROW IN TO GET THE COLOR TO STICK. ITS OK NOT WORTH THE MONEY. SHOULD BE FOR .99CENTS!!!</li>
            <li> this is by far the best eyebrow liner eva made. iv tried mac, sleek, rimmel. etc.  I will neva go bak. I intend purchasing a dozen</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but so easy to break! Since my eyebrow is black, it&#x27;s a little wired because its brown. Id better choice the color more carefully next time. However, A WORTHY CHOICE!</li>
            <li> I love love love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Love it though the color stick was broken so I have to hold it at a certain angle to prevent it from falling out. It is such a small thing but makes such a striking difference on my face even if wearing no other makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never purchase this product again. It was extremely dry as if it had been left to sit with the top off for a long period of time which made it very difficult to apply. I like a natural looking brow so I wasn&#x27;t looking for a heavy pencil and still this barely showed.</li>
            <li> The third time went to use it all the crayon was stuck up in the cap.  Sending back for replacement.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a dark brown but when I used it it was a reddish brown</li>
            <li> Excellent product ...</li>
            <li> My everyday brow pencil. This makes the job easier and prettier to look at for the record.</li>
            <li> Went from Maybelline eyebrow pencil, to the type you brush on (what a hassle and a mess), to this.  So far, very easily to apply.  Stays on.  Like that the brush is built-in.</li>
            <li> I thought the color was OK but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. To begin with, the tip is v. blunt (like one review said almost squarish) so it&#x27;s hard to get a natural application. But what bugged me is the &amp;#34;retractable&amp;#34; pencil just fell right out of the stick. I slid it back in and continued to use it lol but, really, it slides out every time and it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for a great eyebrow pencil that goes on evenly and stays sharp/is easy to sharpen (i.e., the tip doesn&#x27;t break off as you&#x27;re sharpening it), but this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. The color is a pretty close match and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY! THIS EYELINER WAS DRY INSIDE THE TUBE I TRIED TO USE IT ON MY EYES BUT THE PRODUCT WAS HARD AND DRY! CHEAP AND CRAPPY PENCIL DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a brow gel kind of girl so I don&#x27;t really use brow pencils... This is the only exception though. This is like, my favorite brow product next to Benefit&#x27;s Brow Zings! I just set this powder and voila! Perfect brows!</li>
            <li> The pencil was broken when I got the package in the mail, but that&#x27;s okay.. It still works. It is a little too light. I am very light skin and brunette.. &#x27;Dark brown&#x27; should have been fine, but it was too light! Hard to blend in with actual dark brown eyebrow hairs..</li>
            <li> with a smooth drawing liner and brush, i use it everyday and it is very decent price, compared to other expensive product. this is the best. waterproof!</li>
            <li> idk what to say.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Nyx.&lt;br /&gt;they have great products.&lt;br /&gt;I got this cause i shave my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;and love the look of arched ones c:.&lt;br /&gt;so like I give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;it could have more product in it though tbh.&lt;br /&gt;lol</li>
            <li> This is the first eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve every had but I love it.  Easy to use and goes well with my eyebrow color.</li>
            <li> works good for me, easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always seen woman use these types of products to improve the fullness of their eyebrows. I have tried a couple kinds and always thought that it looks fake and un-natural on me. I saw a few reviews on this one and decided to try it, I got it from Target for about $5. I LOVE it! I am an African American woman and i got the &amp;#34;Dark Brown&amp;#34; color. I think that it fits me perfectly, and the little brush on the back does great with taming my eyebrows. The only thing that I dont like is that its a little hard. I would prefer it to be a little more waxy and easier to manipulate but non the less it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! It works great, and if you know how to do it right, it will look very natural! I do recommend using a wax of some sort to keep them on all day!</li>
            <li> this matches my eye brows perfectly.</li>
            <li> Coming to this after using a traditional eyebrow pencil is amazing. I used to have to sharpen my pencil every other day, which was a pain. This lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t smudge nearly as much during the day. The tip is also skinnier which allows for more precision. The dark brown works for me, and I have medium brown hair. Doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look too dark or reddish like so many other pencils.</li>
            <li> Completly satisfied with the product! It shows up great on my dark complexion and the pencil glides so smooth! The tip of the pencil turned out the be ellipse shaped for super easy application. My eyebrow regime just got 10x faster and cuter!!</li>
            <li> too red for my hair color</li>
            <li> A fine pencil, but not as fine a one I used to buy. Nice color, maybe a hint of auburn in the dark brown.</li>
            <li> I was really trying to find a eyebrow pencil that didn&#x27;t make my brows look too dark (because they are already dark). This product is great i got it in the medium brown and it works amazing i love the quality of this eyebrow pencil. The brush doesn&#x27;t really have a purpose in my opinion. but besides that a great buy!!!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool little item... the color is a bit lighter than I would like, more of a chestnut than a dark brown so may try to go a bit darker, but I do like this.</li>
            <li> A little lighter in color than I expected &amp; the pencil&#x27;s a little rough, however; I love the brush, blends well</li>
            <li> I used to use brow powder or eyeshadow for filling in my brows and I thought that looked fine, but when I tried this it looked MUCH BETTER. I just got the wrong color. I purchased the Brown one and it&#x27;s seems too light for my darkbrown-black hair so I&#x27;m now repurchasing a dark brown one and see if it&#x27;ll be the right one. Just going to give the other one to my mom since I like it so much to return it.</li>
            <li> For me this did not go on smoothly. It is also really red. The angle of the flat liner also makes it hard to draw on eyebrows and fill them in. I feel like you are better of buying a drug store liner.</li>
            <li> Barely any product, I opened the cap and all the product fell down onto the sink and smudged everywhere causing it to be a bit dirty. Then when i apply it, it would constantly break off, and I don&#x27;t even use a lot. The fact that I bought dark brown, and it wasn&#x27;t dark brown made me very mad/ disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow pencil I&#x27;ve ever used. Makes my fill in look completely natural and perfect!</li>
            <li> Great Pencil! I noticed I spend so much time wasting the shave able pencils. No hassle or mess with using this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> this is the first brow pencil purchase i&#x27;ve ever made.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s fun to use and it helps me get my eyebrow game right on point!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m asian with naturally black hair/medium skin tone and i was kind of worried that this color would be too light on me&lt;br /&gt;and i didn&#x27;t want to purchase black/charcoal because those would probably look less natural&lt;br /&gt;....buuut it&#x27;s perfect!!!! great for being only like 5 bucks too</li>
            <li> As described and helps me fill out my thinning (why, wth?) eyebrows.  Not sure if the flat ended coloring part is helpful or problematic, but the larger sized, strong bristled brush at the other end is very useful.  Good purchase.  (P.S.  the dark brown color is what you want to order if you have light to dark brown colored eyebrows without red coloring - I purchased from a solid seller, too).</li>
            <li> Not as dark as I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought the product in the dark brown shade. my only criticism is that the color is a warm red based brown instead of the cool brown I expected when I think of dark brown. It works for my sister though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really picky about which eyebrow pencils I like and this one is great, the color looks natural and you can blend it with the included brush.</li>
            <li> never have too many eyebrow makeup or brushes! lol</li>
            <li> Good for price but couldn&#x27;t get it to match my eyebrows. My end parts of brows are scarce. It looks painted but I think not bad for price if you can get it to match.</li>
            <li> Loved the color but it broke down in two parts in my purse not long after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Considering I don&#x27;t like the eyebrow pencils it is an okay one. I have oily skin so this product starts to disappear on me.</li>
            <li> I like this eyebrow pencil very much for its ease of use but would like to see it available in more shades, such as a light brown. I am a blonde and have to make sure my brows don&#x27;t look to harsh.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected. Great color and it goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I love the brush on the end of the product, however, it was quite harsh on my eyebrows. I wanted the more &amp;#34;natural-looking&amp;#34; eyebrows, however I was not able to achieve those eyebrows with just this eyebrow pencil. It was a bit hard to blend in, thus, I had to run it over with some brow powder to soften it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though, for the price, it&#x27;s pretty good. It feels a bit waxy, but it&#x27;s great to travel around with. I do love the pigment that the eyebrow pencil provides and sharpens my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because it&#x27;s cheap. but it&#x27;s not a good pencil at all. mine was broken and the whole pencil stick part just falls out</li>
            <li> I use this everyday I have had this for about 6 months and I still have some to go.it gives me the arch I love.only wished that the tips could be a lot sharper</li>
            <li> I love this pencil! Use it all the time and would highly recommend it to anyone. Don&#x27;t bother buying the eyebrow marker! This is truly all you need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strictly brown, its actually kind of reddish. It also wipes off really easily, so no rubbing your face. But It gets the job done, and its great for the price.</li>
            <li> The pencil is too waxy and actually caused me to lose eyebrow hairs. I had to stop using it. It took weeks for my eyebrows to grow back in n</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this. I&#x27;ve been looking for a retractable eyebrow pencil for a while, and I love NYX products so I thought this was going to be great.&lt;br /&gt;However the shade I ordered, dark brown, is not the right shade at all. Its very very red...I would label it auburn, NOT brown. Definitely NOT DARK BROWN.&lt;br /&gt;Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a weird squarish shape, which wasn&#x27;t really good for precise application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like that this doesn&#x27;t require a sharpener &amp; the brush is attached.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyebrow pencil ever! tried so many, this is the best.  It has a wide and narrow angle that makes it great to fill in and taper at the ends.  Glides beautifully.  I buy two at a time.</li>
            <li> The only eyebrow pencil I use!! I use this to outline my eyebrows and then I use an eyebrow kit to color it in! Works great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this eyebrow kit:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/NYX-Eyebrow-Cake-Powder-Brown/dp/B002QI2TPI/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1412020354&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;eyebrow+kit</li>
            <li> This eyebrow pencil is the second one I purchased.  I like it, it goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I bought this pencil for my sister who is on a tight budget. The color, a dark brown is just what she wanted. The pencil  glides on easily and is simple enough for her to handle. On the down side, it stays on about as well as your average brow pencil which isn&#x27;t great. I gave the pencil 3 stars for average staying power. Otherwise for budget conscious people this is a good brow pencil and I do like it.</li>
            <li> It is ok, the brush is too soft.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, but I&#x27;m going to used it anyway</li>
            <li> color is ok but the brush is useless, too soft for my liking.  can&#x27;t use one end without the other so I give it a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I liked it. It helped me shaped my eyebrows well and it had a nice brown.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and advertised</li>
            <li> my eyebrows on fleek!!! Lol</li>
            <li> nice color, great for Asian with dark brown hair color</li>
            <li> A little too waxy, and the brush is very soft, i like harder bristles.</li>
            <li> the color was a little darker than expected but the tip is much thicker than I anticipated which is good for &amp;#34;coloring&amp;#34; in the areas of sparseness but difficult to get a nice outline to start out with. Also, not very creamy which makes it skip across my eyebrows at first. I ended up buying Maybeline Define a Brow and am much happier with that product as the tip is much, much smaller and easier to control. The NYX product will be a backup if I ever run out of the Maybeline product but honestly, I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this eye brows pencil in \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; and I would think that it would be a dark brown. When I got this, it was a brown, like a light brown. The color was so off, I cannot even use it. That was a waste of about $9. The color looked good on the picture, but not in real life. So if you have dark eye brows, I recommend going with the black.</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the tip, since it can simulate eyebrows better than a fat round pencil. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but I like this because my eyebrows look more like eyebrows and not fake. The color is not orangey like others, either, but a natural looking dark brown.</li>
            <li> I love this pencil! Makes my eyebrows look perfect!</li>
            <li> I loved the eyebrow pencils except for one which looked like it had been used. It didn&#x27;t have the squared off tip the others had, and it was the wrong color, different from the others I bought.</li>
            <li> Not dark brown more like a light brown !</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time the other day. Work pretty good. Goes on pretty dark. Very pigmented brown. The sharpness of the tip creates good lines.</li>
            <li> I bought the Dark Brown, just looking at the pencil it was exactly the color I expected, but once applied it was way too red hued.&lt;br /&gt;As for quality, I&#x27;ve used way better. But for $2 you cant complain too much.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow pencil i have ever used!! I LOVE it!! stays put and doesnt melt off my face .Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I simply love this pencil  the perfect color for my eyebrows and the look is very natural. I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I like the pencil itself fine because it is exactly what I was looking for (self-sharpening, no extra highligher component, brush at one end) but the \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; color is reddish.  I have very dark brown hair and so it just looks strange.  Maybe I will try the black next time although I find black pencils to be too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m always hunting for the perfect eyebrow pencil.  I can never find one that has the right consistency or pigment.  This one was no exception, nor was the charcoal one that I also purchased from NYX.  Bummed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product but sadly it&#x27;s not really a dark brown. More like a medium brown and it&#x27;s too light for my almost black eyebrows. These colors run kind of light so I would suggest following the advice of other reviews and getting the black pencil if you have dark brown eyebrows. I love the formula though and it blends nicely, goes on really smooth. The brush at the end is handy and nice to have right there for blending. Just wish the color were more accurate. :(</li>
            <li> Really great product, better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Yes, the pencil works well and blends nicely into my eyebrows. But on the second day of using it,&lt;br /&gt;the hairs on the brush side started coming off. Now whenever I take this out of my makeup bag, there are little&lt;br /&gt;wiry hairs hanging off that get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s a good price, but not a good product. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s much smarter to pay more for a better&lt;br /&gt;product then this one.</li>
            <li> Love this, you are not always looking for your brush.  Lasting color and easy to apply, lasting color.  Does not run down your face when you exercise.  You will really love this product.</li>
            <li> The hue is a little more orange than I would like.&lt;br /&gt;I use it when I need a quick fix (camping etc, yes I know it&#x27;s silly to wear make up camping but I&#x27;m an eyebrow-less freak).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fine for the price, but certainly using a powder with brush looks much more natural.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. My eyebrows come in black, so a dark brown usually works perfectly for me, but this one is lighter than expected. Other than that it&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> This is a neat item that was easy to apply.  However, I thought the dark brown would be a little bit darker.  But either way I was still happy with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyebrow pencil and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I used one pencil for 4 and a half months. And I do my eyebrows almost everyday. I love this eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> Tried using this for my eyebrows but it was way to light for my color. I&#x27;m an African American and my eyebrows are black and I usually use a dark brown pencil but this was too light</li>
            <li> it is my first time to write the review . i just write the main point that it&#x27;s broken when i got this,  not work</li>
            <li> This tip is horrible.  It need to be finer to line the brow.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but does not make clean lines. I would only recommend to someone with a fuller brow who only wanted more color or to define them. I have very sparse brows with no tail and this just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> So great to discover a great eyebrow pencil that does a great job for the fraction of the price of what I was paying for popular brands.  I am a fan.</li>
            <li> Being a dark-skinned women and finding a pencil to match your complexion is hard. The picture is way darker then the pencil in person. It didn&#x27;t match my pigmentation at all. Unfortunately for me a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Matches my eyebrows perfectly and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I was looking a pencil for my eyebrow.  This is perfect. Perfect ending.  My eyebrow look natural and the color stay all the day.Thanks</li>
            <li> This pencil adds such a great look to the eyebrows, and you don&#x27;t have to put a lot. Even it out and your good to go.</li>
            <li> Only eyebrow pencil I use! Unfortunately I can not find it in stores in the area I live in, so I constantly have to buy it online. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not the best liner. The tip gets dull after a while and it makes it more difficult to draw eyebrows on. I have blonde eyebrow hair so I need the sharpness and accurateness of liner. Other than that, it works really well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this brow pencil because it is the perfect brown and it blends very well with the color of my brows. It goeson very easily without having to apply too much pressure. With other brows pencils I had to apply allot of pressure just to get some color out of the product, but not with this one. Great product!</li>
            <li> Used this kind for several years, liked it then and still do.  Great product, easy to use. One happy grandma.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade for my naturally very dark brows. Fills in the areas that aren&#x27;t as full as I would like them to be perfectly.</li>
            <li> This one goes on great and stays put. It looks natural and is easily wiped off. I have very sparse brows and this goes a long way to help that!</li>
            <li> I love the dark brown eyebrow pencil. I&#x27;ve never had an official eyebrow pencil before, instead using eyeliner or powder to shape my brows and I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long. I love this! I like how efficient it is to have the brush on one end, and the oval shaped end (rather than pencil point) made filling in my brows a breeze.</li>
            <li> I love this!  the color looks very close to my hair color and doesn&#x27;t make my brows look like clown brows.</li>
            <li> I like this eye brow pencil, it&#x27;s very nice., convenient to use and transport. I do plan to order again.</li>
            <li> This product makes it so easy to darken my thin eyebrows. So happy I got it. I&#x27;ve been thinking about getting it a shade lighter. But it&#x27;s definitely better than using an eye pencil.</li>
            <li> I received the eyebrow pencil a few weeks ago.  It matches my hair color perfect.  It goes on well and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I fall in love all over again with every new NYX product I get.I was fortunate to have received the NYX Auto Eyebrow Pencil in Dark Brown this Christmas. Imagine my delight when I unwrapped it. When I use NYX products I have the wonderful feeling that I am using something that has been created by people who love make up.&lt;br /&gt;The design of this pencil is so well conceived. It is a twist up pencil that is retractable.I am slowly being converted from sharpen pencils to the retractable can, it seems neater and more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The  color dark brown is soft,  and incredibly pliable, it also blends expertly well and looks very much like a natural brow. This the best eyebrow product I have used this year.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. This is a crayon that goes on very waxy and thick, and looks like a child drew on your eyebrows. The fine point is gone after the first use and then you have a thick rounded end forever after, which makes for a thick ugly brow line. The comb was a good idea but an unfinished idea-- if they could think of a way to have the color contained in the comb, or come out of the comb, that would be terrific! Then I could comb on my eyebrows, using the fine side of the comb at an angle to get a fine line on the outer edges. How perfect! But to just comb them, sorry, I don&#x27;t get the point. Not Everyone has fat thick furry eyebrows-- whether they are hot this season or not, some people have thin brows and need to be able to finely draw them or fill them in with a fine point. Who has so many eyebrows they have to comb them? It just proves how clumsy and waxy the crayon end is-- that you&#x27;d need to comb your eyebrow afterward to get the waxy lumps out. Gee, I did not like this product. Another waste of money.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, blends well, removes easily, doesn&#x27;t smudge. However, dark brown has a very red cast to it and isn&#x27;t dark enough, and black would be too dark. Seems based on other reviews that all their colors have a warm tone.</li>
            <li> Great product, only sorry I did not get black instead of dark brown...applys well last all day would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they designed this pencil to have such an oddly shaped point. It has an oval point instead of a normal circular ... and it&#x27;s wayyyy too thick for an eyebrow pencil. Luckily, it wasn&#x27;t too pricey, so I didn&#x27;t waste a lot of money, but I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Like most of NYX&#x27;s products, this pencil is highly pigmented so coverage is very good with less coverage. I have very light blonde hair so my eyebrows are nearly invisible, so I use this just to shade the brows themselves and the pigment adheres to the hair very well, resulting in a very natural look. Also, being a retractable pencil there is little need to sharpen it, and there is less waste than with a wood pencil.</li>
            <li> I love this pencil.  At first I didn&#x27;t know what a big difference this made until someone noticed. I applied a subtle amount and people were able to notice difference.</li>
            <li> Its ok. GOOD delivery</li>
            <li> This would have been a perfect replacement for the discontinued Maybelline Define-A-Brow Eyebrow Pencil in dark brown but this pencil has an orange tint. I love the texture (not oily), non-smudging even when sweating, and self-sharpening.  I just ordered the it in black....hope I can combine the dark brown and black to get exactly the color I need.</li>
            <li> I love this product it make your brows look full and natural😀and I got it a day ahead of the delivery day...</li>
            <li> Love and it a little to medium amount so I will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> Love them!!! My favorite brow pencil love it more than my Anastasia dip brow pomade!! Only con I go through them sooo fast and the dark brown color is hard to find always sold out in stores! That&#x27;s why I order THREE online lol but their great!!</li>
            <li> The product is great except it&#x27;s a lot lighter than advertised. I was hoping for a dark brown to suit my dark hair. When applied it comes out as a deep mahogany instead of a dark brown. The application and pigment is great. Just beware and keep in mind it&#x27;s not actually dark brown it&#x27;s a mahogany color. My mom ended up using it and it matched her light brown hair better than mine.</li>
            <li> worked as described and it is a good product to purchase and the best price, it cost less than in the stores</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow pencil!  Easy to use and has a brush to smooth over stiff lines.</li>
            <li> Great pencil for the price.  Goes on smoothly..do not have to press hard on the brow...the dark brown is perfect for brunettes.  This pencil is as good if not better than the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> And I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Covergirl Brow &amp; Eye Makers in Midnight Brown for YEARS and have been primarily content but occasionally frustrated beyond words with them. The color is near perfect and the product typically goes on smoothly and easily though every now and then it seems like I get a couple of bum pencils that want to go on either blotchy and too thick or unevenly and way too lightly. It also seems that out of every maybe 8-10 purchases of the Covergirl product, I will get a pack of 2 pencils in which one if not both of them are IMPOSSIBLE to sharpen without constantly breaking. I have used ENTIRE pencils in one sitting because I could not, not matter what I did, what sharpener I used, how slowly or gently I tried sharpening it, get anywhere near a fine point on the pencil without the pigment breaking completely off. I understand that the Covergirl Brow and Eye Makers are not exactly top of the line eyebrow pencils, they sell for under $10, usually quite a bit under, and are widely available at pretty much every drugstore, grocery store, and discount store in the free world. However, Covergirl has been around for awhile and is a well-known brand with a great reputation, and I feel like they totally ripped me off hundreds of times over, especially when it comes to the eyebrow pencils and eyeliners I have purchased from them over the years. I love their Simply Powder compacts and though I have tried more expensive, &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; compacts, I keep coming back to Simply Powder because it is an awesome product that works great for me and is also extremely affordable. I don&#x27;t know what their deal with eye pencils is and I no longer care, the NYX Auto Eyebrow Pencil 05 Dark Brown has permanently taken my eyebrow pencil business away from Covergirl forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pencil does not need sharpening and although it does not self-sharpen to an extremely fine tip, the &amp;#34;wedge&amp;#34; shape of the pigment makes it easy to draw either a wider or a much more narrow line by simply changing the angle at which you&#x27;re drawing so that you are using the thin part of the wedge instead of the thicker part. The thinnest part is still a tad too thick for the ends of my brows but is easily adjusted to a much finer point with the gentle aid of a very sharp &amp;#34;exacto&amp;#34; knife, the kind I typically use for craft projects in which I cut small chunks of fimo clay off the &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; it comes packaged as, or need to make nonlinear cuts in paper. This eyebrow pencil covers easily and does not easily clump or smear. There is also a stiff little brush on the end that comes in really handy for blending the product once it has been applied and for straightening out any clumped up brow hairs on the rare occasions they get clumped up with pigment. I LOVE this eyebrow pencil! I have been trying different brow pencils for awhile now in hopes of finding an affordable replacement for the disappointing Covergirl Brow &amp; Eye Makers I&#x27;ve been using for so long, and it looks like the NYX Auto Eyebrow Pencil is it. It&#x27;s the perfect color, the price is certainly right, and the issues with breakage and getting a fine enough point that I was having with the Covergirl product will not be a problem with the NYX pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only received my pencil about 2 weeks ago so I cannot yet say how long the pencil lasts. I have been using it at least 6 days a week and it is fine so far, no indication yet that it is about to &amp;#34;run out.&amp;#34; As soon as I figure out the approximate life span of the product I will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller also did pretty good, I received my brow pencil one day after they latest they estimated I would receive it. It was packaged a little sloppily but no worse for wear, my brow pencil was still in the manufacturer&#x27;s packaging and obviously new and unused. When I opened it, I found it to be in perfect condition. I would definitely give the seller another chance but might be wary of purchasing anything very fragile from them based upon the sloppy packaging on this item. One day late is no big deal to me, especially considering that the shipping was free. All in all they did a good job and I am happy with them and VERY happy with my eyebrow pencil :)y fragile from them based upon the sloppy packaging on this item. One day late is no big deal to me, especially considering that the shipping was free. All in all they did a good job and I am happy with them and VERY happy with my eyebrow pencil :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for her to keep her eyebrows tuned up. Works fine, blends in naturally.  Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for a dozen #2 school pencils, w/pretty teacher.</li>
            <li> PERFECT IN EVERY WAY JUST WISH IT LASTED LONGER&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Great product! Just wish it had a a larger spindle-type brush.</li>
            <li> I love it! Looks very naturally &amp; I have so much control.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pencil based on the many good reviews, but I find it to be of middling quality.  It goes on smoothly, but I find that the color is really noticeable in my brown brows and it&#x27;s very obvious that I&#x27;m wearing an eyebrow pencil, which is not the look I want.  I really prefer my brows to look naturally full, smooth, and arched than to look like I&#x27;ve applied a brow pencil.  The color is  more of a medium golden/chocolate brown than a dark brown.  I also do not like the small brush on the end.  It really does not do the trick in smoothing my brows.  A spoolie works much better.  A much better product is the IT cosmetics brow pencil or the Benefit cosmetic brow pencil.  Both are quality pencils that blend in well with my brow color and both have spoolies on one end.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eyebrow pencil! It&#x27;s very natural looking, and it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this pencil everyday for over five months, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Dripped down during dinner</li>
            <li> This liner sucks.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it for eyeliner much less eyebrows.  I put it on and it doesn&#x27;t even stay for an hour. Not even minutes. It&#x27;s like a washable crayon. Junk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with my purchase. It&#x27;s designed with a flat tip for easy application and the color matches my features perfectly. I&#x27;m a happy girl.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this eyebrow pencil. I just opened my box and tested it and it had too much red in the pigment to be called &#x27;dark brown&#x27;, that&#x27;s my first complaint. Second, the bristles on the cap have no firmness to them so they just go splat against your eyebrow when trying to brush them out. Lastly, the consistency, I swatched the color on my wrist to better see how it was too red and ended up having to do so multiple times because some swipes of the pencil just gave no color at all. Overall this pencil is such a let down, highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this pencil, I just reorder it again . It&#x27;s my must have</li>
            <li> Get it! You will love it.</li>
            <li> lOVE IT TO /// I WAS THINKING THAT I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT COSMETIC ON LINE BEFORE/// LOVE IT ///</li>
            <li> Great item, a little on the red brown side, but super easy to apply, does not smudge.</li>
            <li> the color is a dark brown as it states the price is affordable more so than the stores....the brush at the end is a little weak but the pencil side makes up for it because the product is at an angle which makes it easy to apply and make the eyebrow shape you are wanting to achieve</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking Id regret it cus id already bought the NYX eyebrow cake set to do my eyebrows.Right now my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t get more of these pencils cus they&#x27;re way better than the eyebrow cake set.Coupled with a concealer this pencil does a fabulous job of drawing in your eyebrows.The color perfect for my dark brown complexion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVED THIS!! just so convenient to be able to draw on and brush to give it a better effect ! I&#x27;m super lazy to use powders on my brows so this is awesome ! I ran out of the actual color so I just keep the brush and still use it</li>
            <li> I love this NYX  Eyebrow Pencil.  It goes on smooth and easily.  It makes my almost non-existent eyebrows look beautiful again.  Having full eyebrows really changes the look of your face.</li>
            <li> I have light/fair skin, but my hair is dark dark brown and so are my (thin) eyebrows. I love that it&#x27;s retractable and has a soft brush to blend in for a more natural look, but it&#x27;s way too dark! I should have used a rule of thumb and gone two shades lighter than my hair color. I should say that I went running with it on and although some of it rubbed off it never smudged outside of it&#x27;s area (like how eyeliner does). I would buy this brand again, but just not this color.</li>
            <li> Wow! This brow pencil is amazing! I purchased this pencil because I needed something easy to use when applying makeup on the go &amp; when I&#x27;m running short on time. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with its ease of use &amp; long lasting natural color. I have dark auburn brown hair &amp; was afraid this would be too dark, but it&#x27;s perfect. I simply line, fill, &amp; then blend with the brush. My brows are gorgeous with little effort &amp; the color lasts all day. Way to go, NYX!</li>
            <li> Very nice, I plan on getting more</li>
            <li> Love this product! Fast and easy to use and it blends well!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used couple of eyebrow pencils before but, this NYX eyebrow pencil is better than other expensive ones! Great :)</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this out since I had heard so many good reviews, but when mine arrived it was broken. After opening the sealed liner, I took the cap off and the entire 3 inch piece of liner just fell out..so I wasn&#x27;t able to use it or even try it. However the color looked as expected. Will not be re purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love this, I have very light eyebrows and this give them some color and makes them noticeable. I would definitely purchase this product again. I also like that it has the brush.</li>
            <li> it looks really good and blends in with my actual eyebrows. It&#x27;s exactly how I wanted it to work and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> I love NYX, this just didnt do it for me tho. I don&#x27;t like the texture of the pencil or the color.. And I received it broken :( When I took the lid off the actual liner flew out, I managed to find it and shove it back in but wasnt impressed anyway..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more of an almond brown but that&#x27;s what I was expecting after ready the reviews. Great pencil, lots of product!</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a light brown, and I always dye it darker. I got the dark brown pencil and it works and looks wonderful! I use it everyday. And it seems to last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It comes off easily with water and soap.</li>
            <li> works well for lining my eyebrows before I apply the rest of my makeup.......perfect</li>
            <li> I love the brush at the end to fix my brows even if I don&#x27;t have time to put on the liner. My eyebrows are dark but the brown is a good match and I always get compliments of how popping my eyebrows look.</li>
            <li> After buying and trying a dozen eyebrow liners, this one is one I&#x27;d reorder.  It goes on without clumps, defines a natural brow line and is retractable. The Dark Brown color is true too.</li>
            <li> just the right size to fit into a cosmetic purse, great little brush to help shape brows and color is true</li>
            <li> NYX auto eyebrow pencil dark brown is wonderful, I love it. Easy to put on and looks great. The brush is just a added bonus.</li>
