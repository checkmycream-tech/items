            <li>So glad I bought this!</li>

            <li>It is my favorite attachment!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>but it still works ok!</li>
            <li>It spins all the way the 4 scrubbing heads are all amazing</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how people (myself included) have lived life without one of these.</li>
            <li>I like the fact you can use your own cleansers and scrubs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to put the brush head on and off.</li>
            <li>So far so good this brush works soooo good!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>smooth.and it does get rid of your makeup alot better than using a wipe or hands</li>
            <li>Works great and gently.</li>
            <li>also there are bunch of them in ross store more cheaper</li>
            <li>The manual said it is water safe, but there is not need for me to test its accuracy.  </li>
            <li>I would love if this was rechargeable battery instead of 4 AA bettaries..</li>
            <li>it leaves you every time.. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely much better than washing your face with just your hands or wash towel.</li>
            <li>Love this brush</li>
            <li>instead it&#x27;s more versatile than traveling with the Mia 2.</li>
            <li>i actually love the fact that it comes with the heads because i almkst</li>
            <li>save your money to spend on a better product</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and it has much more attachments.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS BRUSH.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic brush!</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after i use my brush</li>
            <li>I now have 2 more for upcoming birthday</li>
            <li>My skin tends to suffer the most during the winter and summer season.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it if I could get a replacement head, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;ll happen.</li>
            <li>Love this face/body brush.</li>
            <li>He claims it causes the skin to produce more oil..</li>
            <li>TOP</li>
            <li>Loving this brush, all the heads are super awsome, I dropped it many times without it braking, and the brush has been  spinning very strong till now</li>
            <li>It really does the job &amp; feels amazing!</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and tingly after using the face brush, and the pumice attachment eliminates the need for a monthly pedicure!</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean!</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne prone skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>But most importantly I like the massaged and clean skin</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far and hope to continue to be pleased.</li>
            <li>The brush is great for taking off make up and just giving you and overall clean feeling alot better than just your hands and rag would do.</li>
            <li>I bought this on Groupon and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much cleaner and softer, and it looks brighter and more even as well!</li>
            <li>I have only used the cleansing and exfoliating brush and they both work great.</li>
            <li>The brush spins (as opposed to clarisonic that vibrates) and makes me skin feel really smooth after a wash.</li>
            <li>i ordered it from Italy on Sunday, and i received it on Wednsday, and its fantastic like it was in that utubr review</li>
            <li>Ever since receiving it and using it, my acne started to clear up nicely and my skin is much more cleaner than it was before.</li>
            <li>So far it good.</li>
            <li>I mainly just use the face brush, but the body brush is nice for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this</li>
            <li>The item came quickly and everything and the packaging was fine, but bottom-line if these are used products, just say so.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any significant improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li>So far I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a month I bought this product and so far I am loving it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s for guys to my skin never looked better and fast</li>
            <li>This brush really helps it look and feel better.</li>
            <li>The product is okay otherwise, but the fact that the head fell apart in to dozens of pieces really turns me off of the product.</li>
            <li>This product seemed great at first until 2 weeks of mild use and the face brush totally broke apart.</li>
            <li>Just wish I new what I could use to clean the bristles better.</li>
            <li>I was very happy about this and after using it the first time my skin felt so much different than when I would use a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li>It gets my face clean &amp; it is worth every penny &amp; even twice as much as I paid!</li>
            <li>And so far I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks so far I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li>Then the lightest bit of pressure stops it from spinning or it just stops spinning on its own - changed the batteries, same deal.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it;</li>
            <li>I find that the everyday brush is most effective on my face though there is an exfoliating brush included.</li>
            <li>The larger body brush is really nice for use in the shower.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>Nice that it comes with the extra brushes too.</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s good..</li>
            <li>I believe to the right.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, it&#x27;ll really help clean your face clearer.</li>
            <li>I have also quickly rinsed the entire handle under running sink water, but make sure I wasn&#x27;t holding it sideways to decrease the chance of water going in the battery cover cracks.</li>
            <li>I have yet to use the body brush or the pumice stone (not sure how to use the pumice stone anyway lol)</li>
            <li>its good but still my skin has black spot</li>
            <li>Some hot lady on YouTube was explaining her skin care regime and it included this.</li>
            <li>so I apply the brush to my face first when it&#x27;s off to allow the soap to run onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy it again.. and again.. and again... and again... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Product works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my first one that stopped working after 8 months.</li>
            <li>Not being able to adjust the intensity of the brush head on my face makes me not use it daily.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it, it was like it ate my face.</li>
            <li>It needs consistent power or it doesn&#x27;t even spin.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time this evening, and my facewash went EVERYWHERE when it started spinning.</li>
            <li>I first bought a \\&quot;spin brush\\&quot; for myself and saw a difference in 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>My first Spin brush fell from the window sill to the floor, almost 5 feet, and stopped working.</li>
            <li>Worked ok for 3 months only using it 1 minute a day until the motor died.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably to be expected based on the great price, but way too gross for my taste.</li>
            <li>Now when I apply makeup, it stays on longer and looks natural and clean.</li>
            <li>First of all my dermatologist highly recommended that I NOT use this!</li>
            <li>These bristles are super soft and conform to the face well to get into the pores.</li>
            <li>It is less effective than a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>, now I am becoming a little more sensitive to it and feel like I need to switch to the softer brush.  </li>
            <li>I like the large brush to exfoliate my body.</li>
            <li>but this product was gentle enough not to irritate but tuff enough to get in a good deep clean.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more I would have expected a $100-$200 brush to do so</li>
            <li>For the price works very well, notice a difference in acne and skin softness when not using.</li>
            <li>Will get a clarisonic from a real retailer.</li>
            <li>I was really liking this product until then.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also great to learn that this company stands behind its product.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li>you can even use it to get the extra skin off your lips to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li>Got here fast and was as shown.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a change using this</li>
            <li>and it works very well.</li>
            <li>My face felt so much cleaner than it did with manual face washing after using this product.</li>
            <li>I have used MANY other extremely expensive cleansing brushes, but this is by far the one that has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>The body brush with the right body wash leaves my skin clear, smooth,even, and glowing.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s other clarisonic brushes that are so much more $$.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love this product and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a clarisonic alternative.</li>
            <li>The only con is that it really eats the batteries quickly.</li>
            <li>This product only has one speed which is not bad.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and my skin looks much younger with regular use.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Less expensive then others of its kind and just as good in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I also use a regular soapy textured Clean &amp; Clear wash sometimes, but it applies to the brush just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done using it, I detach the head and rinse under water, then I reattach it and run the brush head over a clean towel while turned on to let it dry a little bit, then I just set it on top of my dresser to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>It really makes my skin feel soft and keep my acne at bay.</li>
            <li>(but I have to be honest, I have a massage brush for that which I would recommend in addition if you&#x27;re a skin care fanatic like I am).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even work if I put completely new batteries in it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make it seem like they are all brand new when clearly some of them (like those sent to all of us reviewers complaining of used/dirty products) are not.</li>
            <li>I use an oil based facial cleanser from Trader Joe&#x27;s and the brush doesn&#x27;t hold it in the bristles very well when I first squirt it on (obviously)</li>
            <li>The brushes looked better in terms of cleanliness, but the softest brush was not clean and white-</li>
            <li>but I love how I can take a very small amount of my foaming face wash and it makes it super foamy (and I like to believe extra foamy &#x3D; extra cleansing.</li>
            <li>Now my forehead is totally clear which is something I thought I&#x27;d never say😊</li>
            <li>This item arrived clearly used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 15 days so far.  </li>
            <li>It definitely cleans your skin very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After normal cleansing using my hands,  I generally still see makeup residue after cleansing</li>
            <li>I had to rate a star only for fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The bristles are way too soft to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>back feeling much smoother after continued use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worth the price ( maybe it works for other people, but for me it&#x27;s not ).</li>
            <li>I went back to my normal routine on top of the medicine he prescribed and my skin is still slowly healing from the major breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m already in love and can see improvements in my skin in some areas (dry dead skin).Also,  the product was delivered on time.</li>
            <li>only use the sensitive brush, and in the morning especially I am careful to use it extra gently and quickly or my face will be red.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have seen this other places at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>I wear makeup EVERYDAY and use a makeup removing wipe to clean my face prior to cleansing.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and everything makes me red or break out</li>
            <li>Barely cleaned my face but coated my bathroom in facewash.</li>
            <li>If you have an oily t-zone on your face, sensitive and acne skin (whether its just on your face or entire body), this brush is for you.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating brush attachment has just the right amount of scrub to get the job done without leaving my skin a mess!</li>
            <li>weight is heavier than the brush itself which makes it move extra slow and will sometimes just stop all together, i have yet to try the stone but other than that it&#x27;s ok for what I paid.</li>
            <li>He has extremely dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The soft brush is starting to to frail even though it said it could with stand 2 washes a day and last 3-4 months long.</li>

            <li> My skin tends to suffer the most during the winter and summer season.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love it if I could get a replacement head, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;ll happen.</li>
            <li> Love this face/body brush.</li>
            <li> He claims it causes the skin to produce more oil..</li>
            <li> TOP</li>
            <li> Loving this brush, all the heads are super awsome, I dropped it many times without it braking, and the brush has been  spinning very strong till now</li>
            <li> It really does the job &amp; feels amazing!</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and tingly after using the face brush, and the pumice attachment eliminates the need for a monthly pedicure!</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean!</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> But most importantly I like the massaged and clean skin</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far and hope to continue to be pleased.</li>
            <li> The brush is great for taking off make up and just giving you and overall clean feeling alot better than just your hands and rag would do.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Groupon and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much cleaner and softer, and it looks brighter and more even as well!</li>
            <li> I have only used the cleansing and exfoliating brush and they both work great.</li>
            <li> The brush spins (as opposed to clarisonic that vibrates) and makes me skin feel really smooth after a wash.</li>
            <li> i ordered it from Italy on Sunday, and i received it on Wednsday, and its fantastic like it was in that utubr review</li>
            <li> Ever since receiving it and using it, my acne started to clear up nicely and my skin is much more cleaner than it was before.</li>
            <li> So far it good.</li>
            <li> I mainly just use the face brush, but the body brush is nice for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this</li>
            <li> The item came quickly and everything and the packaging was fine, but bottom-line if these are used products, just say so.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any significant improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> So far I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month I bought this product and so far I am loving it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s for guys to my skin never looked better and fast</li>
            <li> This brush really helps it look and feel better.</li>
            <li> The product is okay otherwise, but the fact that the head fell apart in to dozens of pieces really turns me off of the product.</li>
            <li> This product seemed great at first until 2 weeks of mild use and the face brush totally broke apart.</li>
            <li> Just wish I new what I could use to clean the bristles better.</li>
            <li> I was very happy about this and after using it the first time my skin felt so much different than when I would use a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li> It gets my face clean &amp; it is worth every penny &amp; even twice as much as I paid!</li>
            <li> And so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks so far I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> Then the lightest bit of pressure stops it from spinning or it just stops spinning on its own - changed the batteries, same deal.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it;</li>
            <li> I find that the everyday brush is most effective on my face though there is an exfoliating brush included.</li>
            <li> The larger body brush is really nice for use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Nice that it comes with the extra brushes too.</li>
            <li> But other than that it&#x27;s good..</li>
            <li> I believe to the right.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, it&#x27;ll really help clean your face clearer.</li>
            <li> I have also quickly rinsed the entire handle under running sink water, but make sure I wasn&#x27;t holding it sideways to decrease the chance of water going in the battery cover cracks.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use the body brush or the pumice stone (not sure how to use the pumice stone anyway lol)</li>
            <li> its good but still my skin has black spot</li>
            <li> Some hot lady on YouTube was explaining her skin care regime and it included this.</li>
            <li> so I apply the brush to my face first when it&#x27;s off to allow the soap to run onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy it again.. and again.. and again... and again... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my first one that stopped working after 8 months.</li>
            <li> Not being able to adjust the intensity of the brush head on my face makes me not use it daily.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it, it was like it ate my face.</li>
            <li> It needs consistent power or it doesn&#x27;t even spin.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time this evening, and my facewash went EVERYWHERE when it started spinning.</li>
            <li> I first bought a \\&quot;spin brush\\&quot; for myself and saw a difference in 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> My first Spin brush fell from the window sill to the floor, almost 5 feet, and stopped working.</li>
            <li> Worked ok for 3 months only using it 1 minute a day until the motor died.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably to be expected based on the great price, but way too gross for my taste.</li>
            <li> Now when I apply makeup, it stays on longer and looks natural and clean.</li>
            <li> First of all my dermatologist highly recommended that I NOT use this!</li>
            <li> These bristles are super soft and conform to the face well to get into the pores.</li>
            <li> It is less effective than a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> , now I am becoming a little more sensitive to it and feel like I need to switch to the softer brush.  </li>
            <li> I like the large brush to exfoliate my body.</li>
            <li> but this product was gentle enough not to irritate but tuff enough to get in a good deep clean.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more I would have expected a $100-$200 brush to do so</li>
            <li> For the price works very well, notice a difference in acne and skin softness when not using.</li>
            <li> Will get a clarisonic from a real retailer.</li>
            <li> I was really liking this product until then.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also great to learn that this company stands behind its product.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li> you can even use it to get the extra skin off your lips to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> Got here fast and was as shown.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a change using this</li>
            <li> and it works very well.</li>
            <li> My face felt so much cleaner than it did with manual face washing after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used MANY other extremely expensive cleansing brushes, but this is by far the one that has worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> The body brush with the right body wash leaves my skin clear, smooth,even, and glowing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s other clarisonic brushes that are so much more $$.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love this product and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a clarisonic alternative.</li>
            <li> The only con is that it really eats the batteries quickly.</li>
            <li> This product only has one speed which is not bad.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and my skin looks much younger with regular use.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Less expensive then others of its kind and just as good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I also use a regular soapy textured Clean &amp; Clear wash sometimes, but it applies to the brush just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done using it, I detach the head and rinse under water, then I reattach it and run the brush head over a clean towel while turned on to let it dry a little bit, then I just set it on top of my dresser to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> It really makes my skin feel soft and keep my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> (but I have to be honest, I have a massage brush for that which I would recommend in addition if you&#x27;re a skin care fanatic like I am).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even work if I put completely new batteries in it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make it seem like they are all brand new when clearly some of them (like those sent to all of us reviewers complaining of used/dirty products) are not.</li>
            <li> I use an oil based facial cleanser from Trader Joe&#x27;s and the brush doesn&#x27;t hold it in the bristles very well when I first squirt it on (obviously)</li>
            <li> The brushes looked better in terms of cleanliness, but the softest brush was not clean and white-</li>
            <li> but I love how I can take a very small amount of my foaming face wash and it makes it super foamy (and I like to believe extra foamy &#x3D; extra cleansing.</li>
            <li> Now my forehead is totally clear which is something I thought I&#x27;d never say😊</li>
            <li> This item arrived clearly used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 15 days so far.  </li>
            <li> It definitely cleans your skin very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After normal cleansing using my hands,  I generally still see makeup residue after cleansing</li>
            <li> I had to rate a star only for fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too soft to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> back feeling much smoother after continued use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worth the price ( maybe it works for other people, but for me it&#x27;s not ).</li>
            <li> I went back to my normal routine on top of the medicine he prescribed and my skin is still slowly healing from the major breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m already in love and can see improvements in my skin in some areas (dry dead skin).Also,  the product was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> only use the sensitive brush, and in the morning especially I am careful to use it extra gently and quickly or my face will be red.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have seen this other places at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup EVERYDAY and use a makeup removing wipe to clean my face prior to cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and everything makes me red or break out</li>
            <li> Barely cleaned my face but coated my bathroom in facewash.</li>
            <li> If you have an oily t-zone on your face, sensitive and acne skin (whether its just on your face or entire body), this brush is for you.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating brush attachment has just the right amount of scrub to get the job done without leaving my skin a mess!</li>
            <li> weight is heavier than the brush itself which makes it move extra slow and will sometimes just stop all together, i have yet to try the stone but other than that it&#x27;s ok for what I paid.</li>
            <li> He has extremely dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The soft brush is starting to to frail even though it said it could with stand 2 washes a day and last 3-4 months long.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using the exfoliation brush twice a week or less (depending on how sensitive your skin is).</li>
            <li> Batteries will last long too</li>
            <li> Batteries last for a long time, even when used every day!</li>
            <li> I now only have the exfoliating head to use on my face, and it&#x27;s too rough for daily use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first purchased this, but now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have mild but persistent annoying adult acne and my skin was doing pretty well before I used this due to some facial soap changes and routine changes.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these for a long time, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton.</li>
            <li> Since I am born and raised in Miami, the heat is around all year long.</li>
            <li> I do agree that this product helps the skin absorb other products that may be included in ones individual skincare routine.</li>
            <li> It cleans just as well as that other brush, without leaving me with red, flaky skin afterward.</li>
            <li> The face brushes are what I expected, but for some reason my regular face brush is harder than the exfoliating one  </li>
            <li> Or at least if you are not sure you want to make the full investment, but want to try an electronic brush tool.</li>
            <li> However, the main brush attachment has already broken after only about three months of use.</li>
            <li> i definitely recommend this product if for some reason it breaks down on me</li>
            <li> The body brush is a HUGE disappointment.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish there were multiple speeds.</li>
            <li> Brush is all that I expected.</li>
            <li> and after I have removed my makeup and cleansed using the spin brush, there is absolutely no makeup residue.</li>
            <li> The two facial brushes helps me get rid of the dead skin that I can and could not get off with fingers.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare to other brands other than the price.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is, it was hard to take apart to put in the batteries.</li>
            <li> This brush really works well for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> This piece of junk lasted less than a year couldn&#x27;t get in contact with customer service in conclusion</li>
            <li> It makes a mess around you</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money ...</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t too harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> You can see the dried up product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also messy</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, which was destroyed by another, well-known, really expensive skin-cleansing brush.  </li>
            <li> My face was sore and felt raw.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I use it occasionally usually after party&#x27;s or hikes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m out of the return period and can&#x27;t get my money back.</li>
            <li> My skin hardly ever breaks out anymore.</li>
            <li> Hope it&#x27;s at least recyclable.</li>
            <li> The battery option sucks.</li>
            <li> (Duh.)</li>
            <li> I have really bad back acne</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I will say is that I had to buy batteries for this brush.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s a bad sign, but I am taking it as my face is getting smoother and softer and I just need to exfoliate less often.  </li>
            <li> The handle of the brush says &amp;#34;Vitagoods&amp;#34; on the side and on the one I received its half rubbing off (like from being used a lot) and was dirty.</li>
            <li> and it just gets worse in the summer with sweat and pools.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little disappointed by the body brush</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m having to work with Amazon because it was just out of the 30 day return policy.</li>
            <li> package was damaged and the brush looked used, and it was oily and smelled awful, like gross, went in the trash</li>
            <li> Warning if you have delicate/sensitive skin be wary of this brush.</li>
            <li> The packaging wasn&#x27;t sealed and one of the brush head appears to be dirty.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> I just received my item and I am disappointed that I got a used product.</li>
            <li> Disgusting and returning.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this is an awful experience because the thought of washing my face with someone else&#x27;s brush.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, do not buy.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brush really works well for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  There&#x27;s other clarisonic brushes that are so much more $$. This works just as well.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this but when i opened the package, i noticed that the two brush heads for the face were already used. All the bristles were frayed and there was residue on them.  :/</li>
            <li> does not get rid of acne..just letting you know..i bought this in hope it may help with my acne on my face..but it doesnt..it does leave my skin feeling softer and smooth.and it does get rid of your makeup alot better than using a wipe or hands</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush!  I have seen this other places at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> this thing is awesome. Some hot lady on YouTube was explaining her skin care regime and it included this. I use it occasionally usually after party&#x27;s or hikes. Works great and gently. Just wish I new what I could use to clean the bristles better.</li>
            <li> It is awfull ...by battery.&lt;br /&gt;. so week .It was a mistake for me buying this product don&#x27;t waste your money ...also there are bunch of them in ross store more cheaper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about 15 days so far.  And so far I love it. I have never had/used another facial cleanser so I can&#x27;t compare to other brands other than the price.  There is nothing more I would have expected a $100-$200 brush to do so it&#x27;s great for me!  I started using the exfoliating brush and it felt good, now I am becoming a little more sensitive to it and feel like I need to switch to the softer brush.  Not sure if that&#x27;s a bad sign, but I am taking it as my face is getting smoother and softer and I just need to exfoliate less often.  I have yet to use the body brush or the pumice stone (not sure how to use the pumice stone anyway lol) but I have taken the brush in the shower with me.  I have also quickly rinsed the entire handle under running sink water, but make sure I wasn&#x27;t holding it sideways to decrease the chance of water going in the battery cover cracks. The manual said it is water safe, but there is not need for me to test its accuracy.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone let it sit in the tub with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to put the brush head on and off. The head only spins in one direction.. I believe to the right. Event though it spins, I still use it in circular motions. I use an oil based facial cleanser from Trader Joe&#x27;s and the brush doesn&#x27;t hold it in the bristles very well when I first squirt it on (obviously) so I apply the brush to my face first when it&#x27;s off to allow the soap to run onto my skin.  If I turn it on the cleanser just sprays everywhere. I also use a regular soapy textured Clean &amp; Clear wash sometimes, but it applies to the brush just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done using it, I detach the head and rinse under water, then I reattach it and run the brush head over a clean towel while turned on to let it dry a little bit, then I just set it on top of my dresser to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially purchased this brush because my cousin recommended it and I am very happy for my purchase. I would definitely buy it again.. and again.. and again... and again... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worth the price ( maybe it works for other people, but for me it&#x27;s not ).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first purchased this, but now I can&#x27;t live without it. I mainly just use the face brush, but the body brush is nice for exfoliating. My skin feels so much cleaner and softer, and it looks brighter and more even as well! I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> The face brushes are what I expected, but for some reason my regular face brush is harder than the exfoliating one  but I&#x27;m a little disappointed by the body brush it&#x27;s weight is heavier than the brush itself which makes it move extra slow and will sometimes just stop all together, i have yet to try the stone but other than that it&#x27;s ok for what I paid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month I bought this product and so far I am loving it. It gets the job done! I have only used the cleansing and exfoliating brush and they both work great. This product only has one speed which is not bad. I recommend this product if you don&#x27;t want to by the clearsonic! I use it In the morning and night time. It definitely cleans your skin very well.</li>
            <li> For the price works very well, notice a difference in acne and skin softness when not using. If you face isn&#x27;t problematic enough for a clairsonic this is a great substitute. Or at least if you are not sure you want to make the full investment, but want to try an electronic brush tool. Also way cheaper here than on the vitagoods site.</li>
            <li> I would love if this was rechargeable battery instead of 4 AA bettaries.. But other than that it&#x27;s good.. It makes a mess around you tho.. So use it in the shower.. But most importantly I like the massaged and clean skin it leaves you every time.. :)</li>
            <li> Bought this on suggestions from my cousin. Ever since receiving it and using it, my acne started to clear up nicely and my skin is much more cleaner than it was before. These bristles are super soft and conform to the face well to get into the pores. It&#x27;s definitely much better than washing your face with just your hands or wash towel. Give it a try, it&#x27;ll really help clean your face clearer.</li>
            <li> Skin has improved greatly since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this baby!! My face and neck are glowing after only a week of using... And the price is good! Very happy with my purchase..</li>
            <li> Opened the box and it looked used, but I thought maybe that&#x27;s just how it looks.  When I went to insert the batteries there was creamy residue. Disgusting and returning. Will get a clarisonic from a real retailer.</li>
            <li> Brush is all that I expected. I have only been using it for a couple of days but I&#x27;m already in love and can see improvements in my skin in some areas (dry dead skin).Also,  the product was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and my skin looks much younger with regular use. However, the main brush attachment has already broken after only about three months of use. I can still use the exfoliating brush but I was disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> Gosh! Used this 4 times and it just stopped working. I was really liking this product until then. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m having to work with Amazon because it was just out of the 30 day return policy. Ugh!</li>
            <li> So far I LOVE it! In just 3 days I&#x27;ve noticed my skin look so different and the best it&#x27;s been in years. It makes my foundation on my face look flawless!  Very pleased so far and hope to continue to be pleased.</li>
            <li> So far so good this brush works soooo good!</li>
            <li> Love this brush it&#x27;s for guys to my skin never looked better and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks so far I&#x27;m impressed but I prefer the body and pumice stone over the facial brushes.  I also have a Mia 2 which I prefer to use on my face instead.  However for traveling I would take this product instead it&#x27;s more versatile than traveling with the Mia 2.</li>
            <li> Loved the concept, worked great for 7 days.  Then the lightest bit of pressure stops it from spinning or it just stops spinning on its own - changed the batteries, same deal.  It actually smells like the motor burned up.  Hope it&#x27;s at least recyclable.</li>
            <li> Product works exactly as described. Thanks. This is a replacement for my first one that stopped working after 8 months. Like the machine. We&#x27;ll see if this one continues to work.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! Within a day of using it the bumps under my skin on my forehead began to go away. So glad I bought this! Now my forehead is totally clear which is something I thought I&#x27;d never say😊</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved thks product!!!! It spins all the way the 4 scrubbing heads are all amazing i actually love the fact that it comes with the heads because i almkst bout the clarisonic for $200 and it only comes with one head....i definitely recommend this product if for some reason it breaks down on me i will purchase another one!</li>
            <li> I was soo excited to use this brush after all the good things I heard about it! So glad I got it!!! It really does the job &amp; feels amazing! Definitely worth it; no doubt!</li>
            <li> Will take the hassle out of manually cleaning your pores. Batteries will last long too</li>
            <li> This item arrived clearly used. I am definitely returning. It&#x27;s probably to be expected based on the great price, but way too gross for my taste. The handle of the brush says &amp;#34;Vitagoods&amp;#34; on the side and on the one I received its half rubbing off (like from being used a lot) and was dirty. The brushes looked better in terms of cleanliness, but the softest brush was not clean and white- like it is supposed to be. The item came quickly and everything and the packaging was fine, but bottom-line if these are used products, just say so. Don&#x27;t make it seem like they are all brand new when clearly some of them (like those sent to all of us reviewers complaining of used/dirty products) are not.</li>
            <li> package was damaged and the brush looked used, and it was oily and smelled awful, like gross, went in the trash and I washed my hands, didnt want to return it I was so grossed out</li>
            <li> The Spin Brush is AWESOME! I would definitely recommend using the exfoliation brush twice a week or less (depending on how sensitive your skin is). I have used MANY other extremely expensive cleansing brushes, but this is by far the one that has worked the best for me. I have been using it for two weeks (or close to) now. My pores are noticeably smaller, my hyperpigmentation is noticeably lighter and brighter and ALL BREAKOUTS have stopped. I honestly don&#x27;t know how people (myself included) have lived life without one of these. That having been said, this is not JUST a woman&#x27;s product. I use this every night on my husband. He has extremely dry, sensitive skin. His skin has been balanced and the tone has dramatically improved. I just wish it had a sponge attachment for applying moisturizer (but I have to be honest, I have a massage brush for that which I would recommend in addition if you&#x27;re a skin care fanatic like I am).</li>
            <li> Fab. Face cleared up after 2 days.</li>
            <li> Best product. I have been using this product since late April and its definitely worth the money , my skin has improved dramatically. Lived up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> This brush would be great if it had more than one speed. Not being able to adjust the intensity of the brush head on my face makes me not use it daily. The brush is great for taking off make up and just giving you and overall clean feeling alot better than just your hands and rag would do. Warning if you have delicate/sensitive skin be wary of this brush. The first time i used it, it was like it ate my face. My face was sore and felt raw.  Update: This piece of junk lasted less than a year couldn&#x27;t get in contact with customer service in conclusion save your money to spend on a better product</li>
            <li> Bought this iteam based on a youtube tutorial. So far it good.</li>
            <li> I love it. Great dupe to clarisonic and it has much more attachments. Why not 5 stars? The battery option sucks. Takes 4 AA and its just not practical. It needs consistent power or it doesn&#x27;t even spin. Regular store bought batteries lasted 3 days. Rechargeable batteries lasted a lot longer. The soft brush is starting to to frail even though it said it could with stand 2 washes a day and last 3-4 months long. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this after seeing multiple youtube beauty gurus test and approve this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and so far I really like it. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin but it isn&#x27;t too harsh on my face. The brush spins (as opposed to clarisonic that vibrates) and makes me skin feel really smooth after a wash. I find that the everyday brush is most effective on my face though there is an exfoliating brush included. The larger body brush is really nice for use in the shower. It is my favorite attachment! I have really bad back acne and it just gets worse in the summer with sweat and pools. This brush really helps it look and feel better. The entire device is waterproof so I have not had any problems with it being damaged. I probably won&#x27;t try the pumice stone but if I do I will update my review. My only complaint is that I wish there were multiple speeds. There is just one on/off switch. Other than that I love this product and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a clarisonic alternative.</li>
            <li> This product really works with getting the dead skin off your face and body. I like the fact you can use your own cleansers and scrubs. This was a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> Loving this brush, all the heads are super awsome, I dropped it many times without it braking, and the brush has been  spinning very strong till now</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin that breaks out easily. I wear makeup EVERYDAY and use a makeup removing wipe to clean my face prior to cleansing. After normal cleansing using my hands,  I generally still see makeup residue after cleansing so I decided to purchase a spin brush. The price is great and after I have removed my makeup and cleansed using the spin brush, there is absolutely no makeup residue. My skin feels smoother, my pores look smaller and my blemishes are fading. The body brush is really good as I use it to scrub my neck and shoulders.  Overall it is a great buy and I would purchase again. The only con is that it really eats the batteries quickly.</li>
            <li> I just received my item and I am disappointed that I got a used product. The packaging wasn&#x27;t sealed and one of the brush head appears to be dirty. I haven&#x27;t tried to use it so I can&#x27;t tell you how good/bad of a device it is. After researching and reading multiple reviews I finally made a discussion to purchase the Vitagoods spin brush. I&#x27;m so upset that I have to spend the time to return the item. I had to rate a star only for fast delivery. Otherwise this is an awful experience because the thought of washing my face with someone else&#x27;s brush. You can see the dried up product.</li>
            <li> I have acne and oily skin so I ordered this after seeing a review from a youtube star and the reviews on the product itself. I was very happy about this and after using it the first time my skin felt so much different than when I would use a regular washcloth. It felt deeper some how</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these for a long time, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton. I LOVE THIS BRUSH. It really makes my skin feel soft and keep my acne at bay. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The body brush is a HUGE disappointment.  The bristles are way too soft to exfoliate.  I already had a spin brush for facials and bought this one specifically for the body brush in order to exfoliate the entire body.  It is less effective than a washcloth.  The rest of the brushes and pumice stone work well.</li>
            <li> I was having a problem with acne and blemishes on my face, since I started using the cleansing brush my face has cleared up an enourmous amount.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Groupon and it works fine for me. Haven&#x27;t seen any significant improvement on my skin. I like the large brush to exfoliate my body.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic brush! I will never use anything else.  I have sensitive skin and everything makes me red or break out but this product was gentle enough not to irritate but tuff enough to get in a good deep clean. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time this evening, and my facewash went EVERYWHERE when it started spinning. Barely cleaned my face but coated my bathroom in facewash. Terrible product, do not buy.</li>
            <li> its good but still my skin has black spot</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after i use my brush</li>
            <li> I first bought a \\&quot;spin brush\\&quot; for myself and saw a difference in 3-4 days. My face feels clean and tingly after using the face brush, and the pumice attachment eliminates the need for a monthly pedicure! My hubby now also uses the face brush every day. I like it so much, I&#x27;ve given it as Christmas and birthday gifts, and the recipients rave about it, as well. I now have 2 more for upcoming birthday gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great to learn that this company stands behind its product. My first Spin brush fell from the window sill to the floor, almost 5 feet, and stopped working. (Duh.) I called to see whether I could have it repaired; they informed me that it was still under warranty (1 year) and they immediately sent me a replacement. Now THAT&#x27;s a warranty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Worked ok for 3 months only using it 1 minute a day until the motor died.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It allows you to wash your face and get every spot. It&#x27;s so gentle you can even use it to get the extra skin off your lips to keep them smooth. Worth the $$$. Very nice. The only thing is, it was hard to take apart to put in the batteries.</li>
            <li> Got here fast and was as shown. Works great! Less expensive then others of its kind and just as good in my opinion. I wish it was waterproof but for the price I am happy with it! Nice that it comes with the extra brushes too. I would recommend this to friends and family and buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works really well! I use mine every day. My skin hardly ever breaks out anymore. I went on a trip and did not bring it with me, and my skin started to break out again. Now that I have it I wonder how I ever lived without it! Not to mention you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> Since I am born and raised in Miami, the heat is around all year long. My skin tends to suffer the most during the winter and summer season. As a result, I decided to purchase this brush and I love it! The body brush with the right body wash leaves my skin clear, smooth,even, and glowing. The two facial brushes helps me get rid of the dead skin that I can and could not get off with fingers. Now when I apply makeup, it stays on longer and looks natural and clean. If you have an oily t-zone on your face, sensitive and acne skin (whether its just on your face or entire body), this brush is for you. The only bad thing I will say is that I had to buy batteries for this brush. Overall,great product!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! My face feels so clean!</li>
            <li> Love this thing!!!! Good buy</li>
            <li> This really clean your face and body and brings out the best in your skin</li>
            <li> This product seemed great at first until 2 weeks of mild use and the face brush totally broke apart. It literally crumbled in my hand when I took it out of my makeup bag. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m out of the return period and can&#x27;t get my money back. I&#x27;d love it if I could get a replacement head, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;ll happen. The product is okay otherwise, but the fact that the head fell apart in to dozens of pieces really turns me off of the product. I now only have the exfoliating head to use on my face, and it&#x27;s too rough for daily use.</li>
            <li> Motor lost a lot of power but it still works ok!</li>
            <li> Love this face/body brush. I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. Please purchase this brush asap, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed an overall improvement in my skin over after about a months&#x27; use. My skin was smoother. I had fewer blemishes, and my complexion was brighter over all. I also used the body scrubber which left my legs and back feeling much smoother after continued use. I do agree that this product helps the skin absorb other products that may be included in ones individual skincare routine. I would purchase this product again and recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> affordable and awesome.......got here on time</li>
            <li> First of all my dermatologist highly recommended that I NOT use this! He claims it causes the skin to produce more oil.. etc.. I don&#x27;t listen. I received this only a week before my derm appointment. I have mild but persistent annoying adult acne and my skin was doing pretty well before I used this due to some facial soap changes and routine changes. I didn&#x27;t see much of a change using this BUT I used to also always wash my face at night with a wash cloth. Which when I started doing that years ago compared to just washing with my fingers there was a ginormous difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I had my derm appointment and my doctor bashed on this product I thought I would only use it once a day instead of twice a day, I also stopped using my benzoyl peroxide daily and used the medicine he recommended. All of a sudden I had pimples! Which I did not have for over a month (really good for me). I went back to my normal routine on top of the medicine he prescribed and my skin is still slowly healing from the major breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution: like another reviewer pointed out, the battery cover is not the greatest.&lt;br /&gt;I only use the sensitive brush, and in the morning especially I am careful to use it extra gently and quickly or my face will be red.&lt;br /&gt;It is also messy but I love how I can take a very small amount of my foaming face wash and it makes it super foamy (and I like to believe extra foamy &#x3D; extra cleansing.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love IT!!!  It gets my face clean &amp; it is worth every penny &amp; even twice as much as I paid! Batteries last for a long time, even when used every day!</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, which was destroyed by another, well-known, really expensive skin-cleansing brush.  This has been a savior! It cleans just as well as that other brush, without leaving me with red, flaky skin afterward. The exfoliating brush attachment has just the right amount of scrub to get the job done without leaving my skin a mess!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in July and it works very well. My face felt so much cleaner than it did with manual face washing after using this product. The reason I am giving it such a low rating is because  mine stopped working after only 7 months of use (and I only used it occasionally). It doesn&#x27;t even work if I put completely new batteries in it. I contacted Vitagoods customer service (via their website) and asked if they could send me a replacement several days ago, and they have yet to respond.</li>
            <li> i ordered it from Italy on Sunday, and i received it on Wednsday, and its fantastic like it was in that utubr review i saw that made me want it! Love USA !! TOP</li>
