            <li>It&#x27;s a good toothpaste, but not helpful for me, at all.</li>
            <li>good paste, i never had pumps in my mouth after i used it,, it&#x27;s been a year since i started using this one, already bought it 6 times.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing Biotene changed their formula, which caused ulcer problems for my husband.</li>

            <li>So glad my mom found this product!</li>
            <li>, I decided to do my own research.</li>
            <li>Squigle is mild to my tongue, pleasant tasting and effective.</li>
            <li>It has a very light mint taste.</li>
            <li>We love Squigle.  </li>
            <li>I go this to prevent cancer sores, it ended up giving me more cancer sores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better than Rembrandt.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it too!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>When i need to boost it i sprinkle baking soda on top.</li>
            <li>I love the taste and texture of this toothpaste as well.</li>
            <li>Wonderful response on ordering and the product itself is just as reliable as the reviews said it was!&lt;br /&gt;The entire experience was rewarding and</li>
            <li>I researched online and many said to cut sulfates from all my products.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good, it seems to do a good job cleaning my teeth without any abrasiveness.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Like many others using this product I suffer from canker sores when using &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Nice mild fluoride toothpaste and no canker sores for years.</li>
            <li>No SLS - great for those who get frequent canker soers.</li>
            <li>Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong flavor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent paste, probably good for people with sensitivity, but lacks the oomph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use both the Enamel Saver and the Tooth Builder together as the peppermint was just a tad strong for my sore mouth.</li>
            <li>feel this works very well compared to market brands, the flavor is mild, wish it was stronger, but the teeth cleaning effect is amazing!</li>
            <li>The mint is mild, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out and it tastes great!  </li>
            <li>so happy to have left those &amp;#34;on-the-shelf&amp;#34</li>
            <li>IS in it that makes Squigle well worth paying more for</li>
            <li>That alone is worth the switch : )</li>
            <li>I first bought this after many recommendations from others.</li>
            <li>My dentist first introduced me to it more than 5 years ago when I was getting lots of mouth ulcers.  </li>
            <li>The taste is mildly minty and it makes my teeth feel really smooth.  </li>
            <li>, I love it so much I have bought it for others that have never heard of it.</li>
            <li>and I should try that product any way, even suggesting at one point that I just buy a full size tube (of a product I already know I don&#x27;t want because it doesn&#x27;t have the oral care ingredients I&#x27;m looking for), use it (which could result in hospitalization or death), then give it.</li>
            <li>For who knows what reason, they  changed their formula (I&#x27;m pretty sure the main ingredient is STRONG peppermint flavored battery acid) to the point that I would literally be in tears while brushing my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Most people use a different brand but Squigle works so much better.</li>
            <li>and if I do it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other non-SLS and Squigle is by far the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li>but now I rarely get one</li>
            <li>The first time I tried Squigle - I had a sore in full swing on my lip.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is when I came across Squigle: The good reviews were so numerous and most of the folks had similar issues of sensitivity, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>though I have to pinch pennies too, Squigle is worth every one of those pennies pinched.</li>
            <li>For years I used Rembrandt Canker sore toothpaste with great success (very few canker sores) but when they quit making it I went in search of an alternative.  </li>
            <li>Great source and very few out there to help with canker sores on lips and tongue ...</li>
            <li>Fantastic, I assume the high dosage of Xylitol is what really helped me.</li>
            <li>He loves the taste, it&#x27;s mouth friendly - no more ulcers - and he likes it MUCH more than the original Biotene formula.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real winner!</li>
            <li>First, what ISN&#x27;T in it:</li>
            <li>if you suffer with mouth sores and peri-oral dermatitis you should be willing to give this toothpaste a try.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be better than the name brand products I bought from the local stores.</li>
            <li>Others have more of a chalky or pasty feeling while Squigle is the closest thing to traditional toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li>can only conclude that his company is more interested in moving a particular product than having any concern about their customer&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>It is now the toothpaste that I pretty much always buy for my family.</li>
            <li>That said, I DO still get canker sores, so just be aware that this isn&#x27;t really a cure or anything.</li>
            <li>It is the only toothpaste he could tolerate and it still made his mouth feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t suffer from canker sore related toothpaste injuries I strongly recommend Squigle toothpaste today.</li>
            <li>I have perioral dermatitis and also my teeth are thinning in certain places.</li>
            <li>The taste is fine and it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li>Hard to find a good flouride paste without SLS.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Squigle after much research.  </li>
            <li>Get real.  </li>
            <li>It really helped to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I used to buy Rembrandt canker sore or their gentle care toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had canker sores my whole life and that toothpaste did the trick and for some reason avoiding chocolate helped which also caused me canker sores.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product works better than a lot of the other toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li>Sensitive gums, children safe, no chemicals, natural Xyitol - tastes fresh, not super &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; as my kids put it..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for others who have problems with SLS.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product if you suffer from canker sores</li>
            <li>I do find I have to use a little bit more than what I used with Rembrandt</li>
            <li>I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome and am sensitive to strong toothpaste, I get canker sores sometimes and suffer from dry mouth.</li>
            <li>she has real sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>But they clear up much faster</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is about as close to normal as I can get.</li>
            <li>Well I was very surprised when I found it on Amazon and bought a 2 pack</li>
            <li>Seems very gentle on the gums, which is key!  </li>
            <li>Dentists need to catch on and recommend SQUIGLE for all those with sensitive teeth, gums and reoccurring CANCER SORES!</li>
            <li>My clear skin has returned.</li>
            <li>Before I had frequent mouth sores</li>
            <li>I developed perioral dermatitis in my early 30s.  </li>
            <li>Naturally sweetened.</li>
            <li>So far it minimizes canker sores like Rembrandt used to.  </li>
            <li>it was an all natural toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>ten minutes later I should have a minty fresh feeling still, and just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Squigle toothpaste is one of only a few toothpastes without SLS, and I am certainly glad I found it.</li>
            <li>The first time someone mentioned to me about a toothpaste that helps with dry mouth</li>
            <li>In fact, he was quite willing to kill me in order to sell a single tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a side note, I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I whiten with Crest White Strips after starting this toothpaste, the whitening doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as it used to.  </li>
            <li>My husband had problems with canker sores, and hasn&#x27;t had a major recurrence since my daughter recommended Squigle.</li>
            <li>I have dry mouth and Squigle assists in cleaning and moisturizing while other tooth pastes tend to dry my mouth out more.</li>
            <li>The price was high enough that it compared with other all natural toothpastes and was actually quite high,  </li>
            <li>I am certain that the problems I had  before were caused by the SLS found in other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste for anyone who suffers with/from canker sores!</li>
            <li>I tried a few other SLS free toothpastes which didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve battled canker sores for eons and this toothpaste really has cut them way down.</li>
            <li>This guy clearly was not the least bit interested in my needs or concerns as a customer.</li>

            <li> ten minutes later I should have a minty fresh feeling still, and just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Squigle toothpaste is one of only a few toothpastes without SLS, and I am certainly glad I found it.</li>
            <li> The first time someone mentioned to me about a toothpaste that helps with dry mouth</li>
            <li> In fact, he was quite willing to kill me in order to sell a single tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a side note, I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I whiten with Crest White Strips after starting this toothpaste, the whitening doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as it used to.  </li>
            <li> My husband had problems with canker sores, and hasn&#x27;t had a major recurrence since my daughter recommended Squigle.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and Squigle assists in cleaning and moisturizing while other tooth pastes tend to dry my mouth out more.</li>
            <li> The price was high enough that it compared with other all natural toothpastes and was actually quite high,  </li>
            <li> I am certain that the problems I had  before were caused by the SLS found in other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for anyone who suffers with/from canker sores!</li>
            <li> I tried a few other SLS free toothpastes which didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled canker sores for eons and this toothpaste really has cut them way down.</li>
            <li> This guy clearly was not the least bit interested in my needs or concerns as a customer.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Regular&amp;#34; toothpaste was abrasive - some of the other natural choices didn&#x27;t offer flouride.  </li>
            <li> I get canker sores less often, and when I do get them they are less intense.</li>
            <li> Having been a Rembrandt G user for so long, I panicked when that product was taken off the market, knowing my canker sores would consequently return.  </li>
            <li> and will continue buying it as long as it works.</li>
            <li> Unsure the long term effect of the protection.  </li>
            <li> I still have to be careful not to eat anything too acidic, but Squiggle is making a big difference in itself.</li>
            <li> Finally a product with minimal ingredients.</li>
            <li> Other commercial and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products still use SLS.</li>
            <li> The dry mouth was a medication side effect.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have the dry mouth as I quit the medicine causing it, but I still use this toothpaste just because I prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I found Squigle and haven&#x27;t had a single caker sore since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had a single cavity since.  </li>
            <li> I had a few cavities a couple years back and found out that I had dry mouth which was causing them.  </li>
            <li> gentleman&#x27;s response was to hard-sell me on their other \\&quot;tooth builder\\&quot; paste.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing is I didn&#x27;t notice when I placed my order that it contained flouride.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After this conversation, I wouldn&#x27;t use this company&#x27;s products if they were given to me for free. :(</li>
            <li> But it IS helping to prevent dermatitis as the chemicals that are irritating to my skin present in other toothpastes are not insquiggle.  </li>
            <li> : Squiggle contains 36% Xylitol, a product of nature derived largely from birch wood and sometimes known as wood sugar, which is said to combat bad breath, gum disease, cavities and dry mouth</li>
            <li> The paste has a slight peppermint flavor but it is definitely not strong.</li>
            <li> I have been using Squigle toothpaste for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I explained that I don&#x27;&#x27;t have money to waste on a product that may turn out to be useless.to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My little boy hasn&#x27;t had a canker sore since he began using this toothpaste a couple of months ago!  </li>
            <li> I have painful, inflamed &amp; receding gums from Sjogrens syndrome &amp; this toothpaste has been very non-irritating &amp; soothing.</li>
            <li> Also, no more mouth sores.</li>
            <li> asked about the possibility of a sample of Enamel Saver toothpaste because peppermint flavoring has caused sensitivity in the past.</li>
            <li> ZERO canker sores in the past year</li>
            <li> son is 23 years old and suffered with painful canker sores since he was a little boy.  </li>
            <li> He was getting them frequently and they were quite ulcerated and painful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s next to impossible to find another toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t contain SLS. .  </li>
            <li> Also, after an expensive toothpaste, Squigle looked &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34; I ordered it and started using it and within 48 hours, all my sensitivities disappeared, no more pain</li>
            <li> sore suffers&amp;#34; for years, but now it is hard to find and very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> I get horrible mouth sore flares and dry mouth from Sjogrens Syndrome and Biotene HAD worked well</li>
            <li> Almost no taste or faint, very faint mint.  </li>
            <li> As a mom&lt;br /&gt;I felt frustrated and helpless that there seemed solution to the problem.  </li>
            <li> After a lifetime of suffering with painful sores in my mouth, changing toothpaste eliminated about 80% of my ulcers.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing and my toddler ripped the box so I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
            <li> He was getting terrible painful mouth sores and this tooth paste has prevented them.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t grow to an insane size anymore.</li>
            <li> because, according.to him, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m actually.allergic to - talk about insulting!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> We love Squigle.  Have been using it for a couple of years now.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re so happy to have left those &amp;#34;on-the-shelf&amp;#34; chemically pastes!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste for anyone who suffers with/from canker sores! It&#x27;s the best product since Rembrandt pulled their canker sore toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used. Other commercial and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products still use SLS. Hard to find a good flouride paste without SLS. Reduced to 4-star because of price. Wish Amazon had avail on Prime.</li>
            <li> I go this to prevent cancer sores, it ended up giving me more cancer sores.  It&#x27;s a good toothpaste, but not helpful for me, at all.</li>
            <li> Having been a Rembrandt G user for so long, I panicked when that product was taken off the market, knowing my canker sores would consequently return.  I decided to try Squigle after much research.  I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t know about it before.  It&#x27;s even better than Rembrandt.</li>
            <li> Great source and very few out there to help with canker sores on lips and tongue ... It does work on preventing them.</li>
            <li> good paste, i never had pumps in my mouth after i used it,, it&#x27;s been a year since i started using this one, already bought it 6 times.  and will continue buying it as long as it works.</li>
            <li> For years I have used Rembrandt, but their pricing for the canker sore preventive toothpaste is something like $40/tube.  Get real.  I switched to Squigle and haven&#x27;t had a canker sore.  The taste is fine and it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> I used Rembrant toothpaste &amp;#34;for cancer sore suffers&amp;#34; for years, but now it is hard to find and very expensive.  When I try regular toothpaste I get mouth sores. Squiggle has no SLS (sodium laurel sulfate).  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month, and I&#x27;ve had no mouth sores. I am so happy that I found a toothpaste that works for me!  I highly recommend it for others who have problems with SLS.</li>
            <li> The first time someone mentioned to me about a toothpaste that helps with dry mouth I thought they were joking on the name. Well I was very surprised when I found it on Amazon and bought a 2 pack, that was 3-4  years ago now. I continue to order it; I refuse to travel without it, I love it so much I have bought it for others that have never heard of it. I even send people the link to the product. Most people use a different brand but Squigle works so much better. I ran out of it once and I noticed the difference in two day&#x27;s had to order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Try it!  You&#x27;ll love it too!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I first bought this after many recommendations from others. It is now the toothpaste that I pretty much always buy for my family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing Biotene changed their formula, which caused ulcer problems for my husband. Otherwise, we never would have found Squigle. He loves the taste, it&#x27;s mouth friendly - no more ulcers - and he likes it MUCH more than the original Biotene formula. Squigle deserves a big hand. It&#x27;s a real winner!</li>
            <li> I have perioral dermatitis and also my teeth are thinning in certain places. I will update after dental appt to see if this has helped. But it IS helping to prevent dermatitis as the chemicals that are irritating to my skin present in other toothpastes are not insquiggle.  It tastes great and cleans my teeth well. When i need to boost it i sprinkle baking soda on top.</li>
            <li> I have been a long-time customer of Squigle.  My dentist first introduced me to it more than 5 years ago when I was getting lots of mouth ulcers.  It really helped to get rid of them.  I love the taste and texture of this toothpaste as well.</li>
            <li> First, what ISN&#x27;T in it: sodium lauryl sulfate, which can cause canker sores (aphthous ulcers). It&#x27;s next to impossible to find another toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t contain SLS. .  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What IS in it that makes Squigle well worth paying more for: Squiggle contains 36% Xylitol, a product of nature derived largely from birch wood and sometimes known as wood sugar, which is said to combat bad breath, gum disease, cavities and dry mouth and  is the key ingredient in the do-it-yourself mouth care system recommended by Ellie Phillips DDS on her web site and in her  book \\&quot;Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye: A Do-It-Yourself Mouth Care System for Healthy, Clean Gums and Teeth\\&quot; that works for me and which I also recommend.</li>
            <li> Started using after chemo for a cancer issue.  My dentist suggest using a stronger toothpaste to protect tooth enamel.  Unsure the long term effect of the protection.  It does taste good and cleans my teeth and time will tell how well it protect the enamel.</li>
            <li> I have been using Squigle toothpaste for a few years now.  Before I had frequent mouth sores but, but now I rarely get one and if I do it goes away quickly.  I am certain that the problems I had  before were caused by the SLS found in other toothpastes. Now I will never use another toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My daughter had stains on her teeth she has real sensitive teeth my dentist recommended it and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Dental cleanings have been a breeze since I started using this toothpaste a couple years ago. Also, no more mouth sores.</li>
            <li> Wonderful response on ordering and the product itself is just as reliable as the reviews said it was!&lt;br /&gt;The entire experience was rewarding and I will order this again and again.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life written a review but felt I had to in this case.&lt;br /&gt;My son is 23 years old and suffered with painful canker sores since he was a little boy.  As a mom&lt;br /&gt;I felt frustrated and helpless that there seemed solution to the problem.  Well...He hasn&#x27;t had one&lt;br /&gt;outbreak since he&#x27;s been using this toothpaste.  It&#x27;s just amazing!</li>
            <li> I developed perioral dermatitis in my early 30s.  My dermatologist suggest I try toothpaste with whitening products and avoid mint products.  I tried these suggestions, but with no improvement.  I researched online and many said to cut sulfates from all my products.  I started with this toothpaste.  Thank god for this!!! My clear skin has returned.</li>
            <li> I tried Squigle in desperation, trying to find a toothpaste that would not give me sores in the corner of my mouth.  The first time I tried Squigle - I had a sore in full swing on my lip.  The product soothed the sore over night so by morning the throbbing stopped and the healing started.  The taste is mildly minty and it makes my teeth feel really smooth.  I am a total convert!</li>
            <li> This is a product I found for my husband while he was going through chemo treatments.  It is the only toothpaste he could tolerate and it still made his mouth feel fresh and clean.  He does not plan on switching to another brand ever!</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste!  I have dry mouth and Squigle assists in cleaning and moisturizing while other tooth pastes tend to dry my mouth out more.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Regular toothpastes&amp;#34; burn my tongue. Squigle is mild to my tongue, pleasant tasting and effective.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste. This is the second time I have ordered it. The paste has a slight peppermint flavor but it is definitely not strong. My gum health has improved and I recommend this product.  It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Seems very gentle on the gums, which is key!  Almost no taste or faint, very faint mint.  My teeth felt good, too.  I used to use the Squigle without fluoride but decided on this now.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this stuff works surprisingly well. I get canker sores less often, and when I do get them they are less intense. That said, I DO still get canker sores, so just be aware that this isn&#x27;t really a cure or anything. But they clear up much faster and they don&#x27;t grow to an insane size anymore. I highly suggest this product if you suffer from canker sores</li>
            <li> I have painful, inflamed &amp; receding gums from Sjogrens syndrome &amp; this toothpaste has been very non-irritating &amp; soothing. It is over-priced but I will continue to buy this product until I find a cheaper version</li>
            <li> if you suffer with mouth sores and peri-oral dermatitis you should be willing to give this toothpaste a try.  It&#x27;s worked out great for me and hopefully it will do the same for you.</li>
            <li> This is the best TP available. Sensitive gums, children safe, no chemicals, natural Xyitol - tastes fresh, not super &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; as my kids put it.. Big fan and it&#x27;s on AutoShip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled canker sores for eons and this toothpaste really has cut them way down. I still have to be careful not to eat anything too acidic, but Squiggle is making a big difference in itself.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY toothpaste I can use that does not make me get cancer sores, cracked lips, etc. I swear by it. Seems to whiten my teeth as well. It has a very light mint taste. Dentists need to catch on and recommend SQUIGLE for all those with sensitive teeth, gums and reoccurring CANCER SORES! It is a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Since going to the dentist 3 months ago, I had continuous sensitivity and problems with pain. My dentist recommend I use a $25 toothpaste to help me and after about 2 weeks of using it and not seeing any improvements, I decided to do my own research. This is when I came across Squigle: The good reviews were so numerous and most of the folks had similar issues of sensitivity, I decided to give it a try. Also, after an expensive toothpaste, Squigle looked &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34; I ordered it and started using it and within 48 hours, all my sensitivities disappeared, no more pain and it&#x27;s been gone since then. Fantastic, I assume the high dosage of Xylitol is what really helped me. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> For years I used Rembrandt Canker sore toothpaste with great success (very few canker sores) but when they quit making it I went in search of an alternative.  I tried a few other SLS free toothpastes which didn&#x27;t work and I got a TON of canker sores.  Then I found Squigle and haven&#x27;t had a single caker sore since.</li>
            <li> This product works better than a lot of the other toothpaste I have tried. It seems to be better than the name brand products I bought from the local stores.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Sguigle.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste because it is gentel on my teeth, does not scratch the enamel. So far, so good, it seems to do a good job cleaning my teeth without any abrasiveness. I think it is helping.</li>
            <li> My little boy hasn&#x27;t had a canker sore since he began using this toothpaste a couple of months ago!  He was getting them frequently and they were quite ulcerated and painful.  So glad my mom found this product!</li>
            <li> Finally a product with minimal ingredients. Naturally sweetened. No SLS - great for those who get frequent canker soers. And, It&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Nice mild fluoride toothpaste and no canker sores for years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t support the Squigle company. They don&#x27;t give a bleep about your health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got off the phone with the Squigle company rep ([...]).&lt;br /&gt;I asked about the possibility of a sample of Enamel Saver toothpaste because peppermint flavoring has caused sensitivity in the past. I explained that I don&#x27;&#x27;t have money to waste on a product that may turn out to be useless.to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gentleman&#x27;s response was to hard-sell me on their other \\&quot;tooth builder\\&quot; paste. I explained OVER FOUR TIMES that I had no interest in that formulation, in part because I am severely allergic to one of the ingredients to the level of hospitalization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He kept arguing with me that I shouldn&#x27;t be allergic (because, according.to him, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m actually.allergic to - talk about insulting!) and I should try that product any way, even suggesting at one point that I just buy a full size tube (of a product I already know I don&#x27;t want because it doesn&#x27;t have the oral care ingredients I&#x27;m looking for), use it (which could result in hospitalization or death), then give it. to a friend if it does not work for me (wasting my money which I stated.up front I was trying to.avoid). This guy clearly was not the least bit interested in my needs or concerns as a customer. In fact, he was quite willing to kill me in order to sell a single tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only conclude that his company is more interested in moving a particular product than having any concern about their customer&#x27;s health. Please don&#x27;t encourage or support them via your spending habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this conversation, I wouldn&#x27;t use this company&#x27;s products if they were given to me for free. :(</li>
            <li> So far it minimizes canker sores like Rembrandt used to.  Gotten used to the different flavor.  Hope they keep selling it.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome and am sensitive to strong toothpaste, I get canker sores sometimes and suffer from dry mouth. This toothpaste is about as close to normal as I can get. The mint is mild, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out and it tastes great!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used to buy Rembrandt canker sore or their gentle care toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve had canker sores my whole life and that toothpaste did the trick and for some reason avoiding chocolate helped which also caused me canker sores.  Now that it is no longer being made I struggled with what to do.  I had tried Toms of Maine toothpaste but actually didn&#x27;t like it.  Squiggle does the job, cleans well, and no canker sores.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong flavor.  I do find I have to use a little bit more than what I used with Rembrandt but it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I had a few cavities a couple years back and found out that I had dry mouth which was causing them.  The dry mouth was a medication side effect.  I found this toothpaste here on Amazon and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve not had a single cavity since.  I believe that it was the switch to Squigle toothpaste in addition to starting Biotene mouthwash that saved my teeth.  I no longer have the dry mouth as I quit the medicine causing it, but I still use this toothpaste just because I prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I&#x27;ve also noticed that when I whiten with Crest White Strips after starting this toothpaste, the whitening doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as it used to.  That alone is worth the switch : )</li>
            <li> Squigle has been a lifesaver for me. Like many others using this product I suffer from canker sores when using &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothpaste. I have tried other non-SLS and Squigle is by far the best in my opinion. Others have more of a chalky or pasty feeling while Squigle is the closest thing to traditional toothpaste I have tried. It also tastes great to boot. Even if you don&#x27;t suffer from canker sore related toothpaste injuries I strongly recommend Squigle toothpaste today.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste, even though it&#x27;s spendy.  My husband had problems with canker sores, and hasn&#x27;t had a major recurrence since my daughter recommended Squigle.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Regular&amp;#34; toothpaste was abrasive - some of the other natural choices didn&#x27;t offer flouride.  This is the best.  ZERO canker sores in the past year since I moved to Squigle.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste.  Only negative thing is I didn&#x27;t notice when I placed my order that it contained flouride.</li>
            <li> lacks the same freshness of fluoride. I brush my teeth and ten minutes later I should have a minty fresh feeling still, and just don&#x27;t.It&#x27;s decent paste, probably good for people with sensitivity, but lacks the oomph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste deserves 10 stars!</li>
            <li> I get horrible mouth sore flares and dry mouth from Sjogrens Syndrome and Biotene HAD worked well and it was the only one I knew of.  For who knows what reason, they  changed their formula (I&#x27;m pretty sure the main ingredient is STRONG peppermint flavored battery acid) to the point that I would literally be in tears while brushing my teeth.  A fellow Sjogrens sufferer suggested I try Squigle. And I have never looked back! I use both the Enamel Saver and the Tooth Builder together as the peppermint was just a tad strong for my sore mouth. Using them together is perfect for me and it tastes way better than Biotene ever did. I&#x27;ve had no cavities or sensitivity issues since I started, and though I have to pinch pennies too, Squigle is worth every one of those pennies pinched.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste has made a big difference in my sons life. He was getting terrible painful mouth sores and this tooth paste has prevented them. I&#x27;m so happy that we found this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was an all natural toothpaste.  The price was high enough that it compared with other all natural toothpastes and was actually quite high,  but I got it and it has fluoride.  I haven&#x27;t used it one.  I got the oraMD and use that as well as coconut oil and I add baking soda every so often for extra cleaning.  Would not suggest this to anyone.  Very disappointing and my toddler ripped the box so I can&#x27;t even return it.</li>
            <li> feel this works very well compared to market brands, the flavor is mild, wish it was stronger, but the teeth cleaning effect is amazing!</li>
            <li> Toothpaste without SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) are the answer to my mouth ulcer problems (Canker Sores). After a lifetime of suffering with painful sores in my mouth, changing toothpaste eliminated about 80% of my ulcers. Then, simply reducing the amount of salty snacks I eat, I have ended my Canker sores forever. Squigle toothpaste is one of only a few toothpastes without SLS, and I am certainly glad I found it.</li>
