            <li>For acne prone skin, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>I liked the aloe vera mixture best.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This is a great all around clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>

            <li>Great Clay and &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; is always a good choice</li>
            <li>and also has all sorts of preservatives, I&#x27;d say make your own!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll start to notice it pulsates as it&#x27;s drying, but it&#x27;s a pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li>my skin feels really good after this mask.</li>
            <li>I am also going to try mixing some cinnamon or nutmeg in here too, as I have read they are good for acne also.</li>
            <li>but it works good for me and my 1-2 time a week hair washing routine.</li>
            <li>In fact my hair felt so good</li>
            <li>All you need is a good moisturizer to finish it off.</li>
            <li>Good quality clay.</li>
            <li>I have an oily skin and it works so good for me ..</li>
            <li>I had heard that clay was good for digestive system.</li>
            <li>Still, a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Washes off fairly well too.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews about this clay being a really good medium to increase tightness of your skin.</li>
            <li>best tighting i have ever seen, and my bathroom is full of a million products</li>
            <li>make sure you&#x27;ve got a great moisturizer to counter.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>The mask worked great, better than anything I have used.</li>
            <li>I am so glad, and happy I&#x27;ve tried this miraculous product.</li>

            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction and happy with choosing this seller to do business with.</li>
            <li>Use it in my hair and face mask, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.</li>
            <li>but I heard how amazing it leaves your skin after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>I use this to cleanse my hair and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>This stoped my cystic breakouts its amazing .wondering</li>
            <li>No need to mix, the two ingredients will combine on their own to make a versatile mud.</li>
            <li>and it did not leave any kind of stain whatsoever.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily, and this worked great!  </li>
            <li>My sister used it and liked it as well.</li>
            <li>a week at night and in the morning my skin still has a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with warm water and apply to my face (sometimes neck, chest, and arms), and keep it on until it dries (15-20 minutes).</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll use rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I thought, this is like a science experiment from high school, lol!</li>
            <li>Its very easy to mix up, as I have never tried a mask before that</li>
            <li>This yields the best results by far for drawing out impurities and tightening my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>perfect and sensitive</li>
            <li>This red clay is one of the best and the price is amazing</li>
            <li>Love to be able to mix up my own face clay mask.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep hoping for a good positive result!!</li>
            <li>This mask goes on very smooth and even.</li>
            <li>It doesnt have a strong smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I use this mask once a week, sometimes once in two weeks as with time you&#x27;ll see improvement and your skin get better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite clay powders.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li>I used it as an aquatic fertilizer.  :-)  </li>
            <li>Excellent facial mask!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product and saw results of my skin clearing and pores shrinking within about 3 days.</li>
            <li>I use it about twice a week, and I have to keep myself from using it more.  </li>
            <li>I love this powder.</li>
            <li>and I love how it dries off tightening the skin.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>Before I&#x27;ve purchased this item, I did read most of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I had simply filled my sink with warm tap water then washed my face.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I mix this with rose and glycerin water and leave it on for almost 15 minutes and it leaves my skin feeling so smooth and cleansed.</li>
            <li>love it :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and purchased it.  </li>
            <li>makes your skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li>I made way more than I needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned it is best to add just enough</li>
            <li>this stuff is so much better.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t give me anything better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>I will be buying more</li>
            <li>Its an excellent conditioner and the only drawback would be the lack of fragrance in your hair.</li>
            <li>After you wash the mask over, make sure to moisturize ---maybe with coconut oil or emu oil.</li>
            <li>Would purchase again.:)</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff, cheap and lasts forever!</li>
            <li>I love this face clay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to have a dedicated face towel to wash the clay off, however, because the red color does stain clothes and fabric.</li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I love love my skin now.</li>
            <li>I got 10 more minutes,</li>
            <li>Can I wait 10 more minutes?&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I have 5 more minutes</li>
            <li>THIS CLAY HAS MANY BENEFITS, U CAN SMELL &amp; FELL THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>great to make skin very soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I splashed my face generously with warm water for a minute or so, followed by a cool water splash and that was it.</li>
            <li>Besides all the natural benefits of the clay itself, the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the clay, I use it along with a couple of drops of glycerin and rose water.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so clean!</li>
            <li>its natural and great.</li>
            <li>though I haven&#x27;t seen 2/3 results yet (it&#x27;s not a miracle in a container), my skin does feel incredibly smooth and oil free after I use it!</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s a great natural product.</li>
            <li>Great all natural product</li>
            <li>Great mask for sensitive skin which by the way I have.</li>
            <li>Can be very useful , just need to find and time and get more organized&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>why its not priced higher but glad its not.!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use Nurtura from Avon, it works very well and makes your skin feel replenished on top of a nice working clay mask.</li>
            <li>Works great and keeps my complexion feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li>highly recommend for this product was sent to me, I am very satisfied and pleased, because if there was a mistake on their part, they will correct it right away, I say this from experience, and always hasen effort that we as customers are satisfied.</li>
            <li>Add chamomile or finely ground oatmeal to reduce redness or discolorations (age/ acne).</li>
            <li>This clay works fine</li>
            <li>It does dry your face out so make sure to have a great skin moisturizer to apply afterwards.</li>
            <li>I really love that this is an effective, inexpensive and all natural way to treat my skin.</li>
            <li>The clay dissolved immediately into a smooth, silky texture.</li>
            <li>Tightens the skin and gives a smooth texture of the epidermis 💗💗</li>
            <li>So gentle, yet effective.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it because I was in need a mask to help smooth out my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>I used this in some handmade soap to give it a light pinkish color, but it just turned it to a brown/tan.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be cleaning her face well and leaving it smooth.  </li>
            <li>Yes, she says, confirmed.</li>
            <li>Great for making pores smaller, controlling acne.</li>
            <li>I also really enjoy mixing it up - I can control the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a warning for anyone with fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far so good, I use it on my skin as a skin mask...</li>
            <li>Can use a variety of oils and/or mix with green or bentonite clay(also very economical) to achieve the perfect result for your type of skin.</li>
            <li>im pretty sure youll be just fine,</li>
            <li>The instructions on ratio of water to clay powder seems too high (too watery) to be effective.</li>
            <li>Product arrived with no spillage, appears to be a nice high quality.</li>
            <li>, it mixes well with water, I love that it&#x27;s gentle and washes off so easily</li>
            <li>Repeat until skin is free from rusty debris and in the end wash with cool water to close pores.</li>
            <li>The clay I received is in the original container</li>
            <li>When mixing, it seems like you need more water at first but trust me, the increments are correct.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that it does not over dry my sensitive skin or turn it bright red like most beauty/ cosmetics/ ect.</li>
            <li>Overall, I could not be more pleased and I feel that this is a wonderful, gentle, cleansing mask that can be used by anyone and/or adjusted to meet specific skin needs.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel really clean</li>
            <li>I use this about once a week to clean out my pores.</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshed after applying.</li>
            <li>Smells good, gentle on my skin, and feels very primal to mix up the powder and then paint on.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive this clay kind of burns and is itchy.</li>
            <li>no thanks lol</li>
            <li>If your skin does not feel better after this then you just have really picky skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a bit of product and will last you a good while.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Nice, fine grind &amp; mixed well during the process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly and intact.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is good, gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I  quickly apply my H2O Night Oasis Oxygenating Energizing Serum.</li>
            <li>I love this powder, it leaves your face feeling brand new,</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, I really did !</li>
            <li>Leaves skin exfoliated, very clean (pores are unclogged) but yet not dry and reduces the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft and bright and clear now!  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s all natural and approved for skin use, you can be sure it&#x27;s non-toxic to critters.  </li>
            <li>It just made my face feel fresh, supple and rejuvenated</li>
            <li>I mix equal parts clay powder and apple cider vinegar which makes a foamy kind of paste, put it on for about 15 mins and rinse.</li>
            <li>I have never used it before nor any kind of Morrocan red clay powder</li>
            <li>Look online at numerous websites for different masque recipes to find your ideal masque.</li>
            <li>I really liked the Now Foods European Clay Powder (which I used with aloe gel, I thought it worked well and helped clear acne.5 stars :) Thus decided to give this one a try</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth, soft and oil free.</li>
            <li>I have been using Aztec healing clay for about a year and really liked the results, so I thought I would give the Red Clay Powder a shot, and perhaps end up alternating the two.</li>
            <li>As far as detoxing/cleaning out pores, I&#x27;ve used better masks.  </li>
            <li>This dries quickly and when you remove it, your skin will feel amazingly smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>Although it washes right off and leaves no stains.&lt;br /&gt;Results: I am blushing like I just came out of sauna.</li>
            <li>After the first application of the mask and after it dried, about 15 minutes, I rinsed my face with warm water and noticed how clean my face was!</li>
            <li>I love that this mask is great, as is, but will also make an excellent  base for me to add other ingredients to, depending on what our skin needs are that day.  </li>
            <li>I originally got this because I wanted a more natural way of getting a deep clean.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, my face was super clean and soft.</li>
            <li>love this stuff ... works very well with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This led to a reduction of time the second time I used it, but I experienced the same dryness.</li>
            <li>so far i strongly advise not buying for this reason, did not try on hair..</li>
            <li>It make my face feel smooth and very soft.</li>
            <li>Either way, I have very sensitive skin now and was looking for natural and affordable ways to get the same results - this by itself is no miracle worker, but it&#x27;s definitely a great addition to my regimen.     </li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s 100% natural clay, which is great because I don&#x27;t want any other ingredients or chemicals going onto my skin.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of clay masks before.</li>
            <li>Just place this in a food safe container with an equal amount of water, and let it sit over night.</li>
            <li>In planted aquariums, the aquatic plants need root fertilizer to grow big and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually going to order more</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s results will be different, I am sure, but for this price, I would DEFINATELY try it if you are interested.</li>
            <li>You can feel your pulse through your face as it gets really dried, and your face will get warm, this means its doing its job, not painful at all.</li>
            <li>and I look forward to using this mask regularly! :-)</li>
            <li>This really helps out!</li>
            <li>I love this product and I&#x27;m definitely buying it again !</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this.  </li>
            <li>However, I am a first time user and to minimize dryness</li>
            <li>i cant stress i love this enough.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely a wonder product!</li>
            <li>(I read a lot of peoples&#x27; reviews saying their skin was red and blotchy for some time), but then it sure does brighten your skin for like maybe a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>It works better than the green clay for bringing life back into my face after a good shower.</li>
            <li>must tell you this first:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty dying.</li>
            <li>It happened the first time I used it, and I thought maybe it reacted with something I already had on my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin is dry, but I have acne prone skin also, so I thought this would be good because it&#x27;s for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I mix a small amount (about 2 teaspoon) with Shea Terra Pure Moroccan Rose Water until it is smooth.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say, that this rinsed off my skin easier than any other clay type mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>No blemishes or marks and leaves my skin feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li>it feels clean and soft ..</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m sure it works for some folks, but it didn&#x27;t do much of anything to help my skin.</li>
            <li>This product left my face feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much done with masks from now on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural clay with no other ingredients which I love.</li>
            <li>love how well it stores in dry form.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it twice-weekly in the summer, and weekly in the winter ( when my skin tends to dry out more).</li>
            <li>I love NOW products, and I really don&#x27;t know why it took me this long to try this one.</li>
            <li>large pores/prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>Pure clay powder nothing else.</li>
            <li>I also use pure aloe vera gel 2x</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for ways to combat my oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li>and I can see the effect on my large pores, it&#x27;s shrinking them gradually.</li>
            <li>daily which I think also has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>and it does really remove qucikly this way.</li>
            <li>blemishes have faded,pores appear smaller,noticed that my Daughter is not breaking out as much as before.</li>
            <li>clarifies really well, shrinks pores and draws out impurities from skin.</li>
            <li>I dont really care for anything perfume</li>
            <li>didnt just come packaged ready.</li>
            <li>but there wasn&#x27;t really a. Difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>and it was very relaxing.</li>
            <li>It really tightens your skin...</li>
            <li>Way to much powder per water.</li>
            <li>very drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied twice , however I&#x27;ve not seen or felt much of a difference after applying the mask and when I say differnce improvement to the skin...</li>
            <li>I rubbed gently, to remove any missed clay.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really, really helps suck all the excess oil and goop out of pores.</li>
            <li>I use this product about once a week and it really tightens up my pores.</li>
            <li>However, that hasn&#x27;t stopped me from using it since it does make my skin much softer afterwards.</li>
            <li>People pay so much for a tube of mask that drys out after time.</li>
            <li>I believed that this bh was a mole but after the facial, I noticed after I accidently squeezed it that it was filled with mucus and it has disappeared.</li>
            <li>I really like this clay.</li>
            <li>I was very relaxed.</li>
            <li>She wants me to order one for her immediately.</li>
            <li>It really does the trick on my stubborn skin.</li>
            <li>I have always used various masks and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I mix a tiny tea size spoon with my precious Evan Healy hydrosol and wear it on my face  for 30 minutes, it dries up completely</li>
            <li>main draw back with this is that I&#x27;ve had a strong reaction to it twice out of around six uses.  </li>
            <li>Really helped make my pores smaller and my face feels and looks clean when I use it.</li>
            <li>Great price for a product where a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for oily skin, large pores, acne, etc.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t use as much as planned , but used it in a past and liked it .</li>
            <li>Usually I put face towel in warm water and then put on my face to soften mask a bit</li>
            <li>I wiped my face (after rinsing) with a white/floral washcloth and the small amount that was on the cloth rinsed away with warm water also.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, I am going to say that this makes a HUGE mess when trying to remove as a face mask.</li>
            <li>all my black heads were gone from my cheeks and most form my chin</li>
            <li>If anything maybe half a spoon of water more.</li>
            <li>I just received my first order of Now Foods Moroccan Red Clay Powder and from the first use, I know this is a staple item I will not be without.  </li>
            <li>Usually masks make me break out more, but this calms the skin tone and diminishes blackheads pretty well.</li>
            <li>It clarified my hair yet left it super moisturized.</li>
            <li>I use this in my cold process soap as well as face masks..:) it makes pretty colors in my soap.:)</li>
            <li>I can only guess that this powder would be effective for the other uses also.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin either</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I really like using products that are natural.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li>I did end up adding quite a bit more water and a few drops of almond oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier than getting normal packaged clay masks off.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>But what I do know is that I do not want to live without this product from now on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using a cheap, store brand black head scrub, and my skin looks a lot better now, AND it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like this</li>
            <li>but I notice that during the winter time, my skin feels super dry after I use it.</li>
            <li>This clay powder leaves my face very very soft and man do i glow after</li>
            <li>The clay received is VERY different in color than the original version which was actually red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of acne and was on Pro-Activ for a decade with success until I guess age caught up to me or</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t just give it one star because the first time I used it, my pores did look smaller, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Today was my first time using Red Clay Powder.</li>
            <li>Before applying the red clay I did have three red pimple, which have reduced in size significantly.    </li>
            <li>I first mixed it with water</li>
            <li>face feels hot suddenly, for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>The only recommendation I have, is after you clean your face, make sure to apply some sort of moisturizer if your skin feels a little dry.</li>
            <li>This mask is so easy, all you have to do is mix about a tablespoon of powder to a few teaspoons of water, and apply to your face.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive, so it LOVES natural products like this one.</li>
            <li>This stings were like a low voltage current penetrating my skin, and moving around very fast, pulses much finer than the ones around my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I have also mixed it with coffee, coco butter, and vitamin e oil to make a mask for my stomach to smooth the loose skin from pregnancy</li>
            <li>Not only clear out my large pores and minimises my pimples-</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this product because I prefer all natural products rather than harsh chemicals to clean my face due to the fact that I have a combination of oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product is for sensitive skin, worked really well for me since I already have red cheeks all the time, this product didnt irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>My pores are clear and my skin is glowing.  </li>
            <li>It does tighten my pores and clear up any blemishes rather well.</li>
            <li>Its all natural and truly even out skin tone and helps keep blemishes away.</li>
            <li>I have to use it with water, as the cider vinegar is too &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin&#x3D; 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>My hair felt really soft after using this.</li>
            <li>My adult acne has cleared almost completely.  </li>
            <li>I got this product because I have sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li>Do it once a week followed by a serum and the results are baby soft skin</li>
            <li>So far I have had no adverse effects.</li>
            <li>Many people complained about removing the mask and it staining their skin.</li>
            <li>i think i will be using this instead of getting professional facials anymore.</li>
            <li>I have brown skin and the clay doesn&#x27;t show too many negative effects on my skin</li>
            <li>for people looking to apply this on your hair, I have no idea how this clay works on hair, but then I do know of an alternate which is much cheaper and works well with hair.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a big difference in this clay used by it</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so far I have no reactions to this product.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit expensive for the amount that you&#x60;re getting but it&#x60;s a good quality.</li>
            <li>After the first use it noticeably shrunk my pores and left my skin soft, it did not dry me out completely either.</li>
            <li>I use a large variety of skin products, as my skin tends to be very moody due to the fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li>I mean just ok.</li>
            <li>I will say that if you use it around friends, they will be extremely intrigued so be willing to share!</li>
            <li>makes a decent clay mask when mixed with Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel w/Rose Extract</li>
            <li>But using just this powder alone makes my skin unbelievably smoother, tighter, cleaner, and overall better.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes and a totally different use for this product.  </li>
            <li>My face feeling like someone is pulling it back, I think, it is normal...</li>
            <li>gets really tight as it starts drying and you feel your skin pulsing and tingling (some much needed circulation).&lt;br /&gt;Because its close to my skin tone when it dries I look really funky.</li>
            <li>I mixed pure aloe vera and a couple drops of rosemary essential oil with it</li>
            <li>my left and right side pulsating at the same time with the same tempo of my heart.</li>
            <li>I just used a little bathroom paper cup, to cover your whole face you dont need to use much.</li>
            <li>It left it cleansed and it felt very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I recommend wetting the clay all around your face first, this will make the hard clay very pliable again.</li>
            <li>I got this after researching different natural clay masks.</li>
            <li>Not because it does not work, but because I am extremely busy and do not have time for the entire process.  </li>
            <li>With all of them combined, I manage to get away with just barely tolerable skin.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY not for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I have tiny wrinkles under my eyes and around my upper lip and lower part of my neck, which are normal signs of aging.</li>
            <li>Definitely don&#x27;t leave it on longer than 15 minutes because it will hurt coming off if you let it dry too much.</li>
            <li>As soon as I lay down and relax, pulsing and stinging comes right back.</li>
            <li>I mix 1 tablespoon of powder with water to get lotion texture, apply with old flat foundation brush and let it work for about 15-20 min.then</li>
            <li>A Tablespoon or two mixed with a few drops of peppermint and/or almond oil and a small amount of water, makes a great spa masque for less than a dollar each.</li>
            <li>, i have super tiny ones so its hard to clear it all out between getting facials.</li>
            <li>Easy to rinse off too, dont be afraid to not use a washcloth as some have advised, I found even when it got near my eyes when just splashing my whole face with water instead of taking a longer time in wiping spots away with a cloth, that it didnt irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li>I put way to much there and that explains why this mud was so active there.</li>
            <li>It will not dry out that way</li>
            <li>It did burn a little the first time I used though, but it had no adverse effects.  </li>
            <li>I have used other clay&#x27;s before and have to say this is my least favorite</li>
            <li>As long as your not aiming directly for your eyeballs</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time a few days ago, and</li>
            <li>Then apply directly to your face, but make sure you slather it on real thick, and leave it on until it&#x27;s fully dry.</li>
            <li>Feels great, definitely makes my big ugly pores smaller.</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 weeks straight daily and then slowed down to twice a week or so.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably normal due to the mask pulling all the impurities from the face.</li>

            <li> Great Clay and &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; is always a good choice</li>
            <li> and also has all sorts of preservatives, I&#x27;d say make your own!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll start to notice it pulsates as it&#x27;s drying, but it&#x27;s a pleasant feeling.</li>
            <li> my skin feels really good after this mask.</li>
            <li> I am also going to try mixing some cinnamon or nutmeg in here too, as I have read they are good for acne also.</li>
            <li> but it works good for me and my 1-2 time a week hair washing routine.</li>
            <li> In fact my hair felt so good</li>
            <li> All you need is a good moisturizer to finish it off.</li>
            <li> Good quality clay.</li>
            <li> I have an oily skin and it works so good for me ..</li>
            <li> I had heard that clay was good for digestive system.</li>
            <li> Still, a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Washes off fairly well too.</li>

            <li> My skin feels amazing.  </li>

            <li> No need to mix, the two ingredients will combine on their own to make a versatile mud.</li>
            <li> and it did not leave any kind of stain whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily, and this worked great!  </li>
            <li> My sister used it and liked it as well.</li>
            <li> a week at night and in the morning my skin still has a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with warm water and apply to my face (sometimes neck, chest, and arms), and keep it on until it dries (15-20 minutes).</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll use rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I thought, this is like a science experiment from high school, lol!</li>
            <li> Its very easy to mix up, as I have never tried a mask before that</li>
            <li> This yields the best results by far for drawing out impurities and tightening my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> perfect and sensitive</li>
            <li> This red clay is one of the best and the price is amazing</li>
            <li> Love to be able to mix up my own face clay mask.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep hoping for a good positive result!!</li>
            <li> This mask goes on very smooth and even.</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a strong smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I use this mask once a week, sometimes once in two weeks as with time you&#x27;ll see improvement and your skin get better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite clay powders.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I used it as an aquatic fertilizer.  :-)  </li>
            <li> Excellent facial mask!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product and saw results of my skin clearing and pores shrinking within about 3 days.</li>
            <li> I use it about twice a week, and I have to keep myself from using it more.  </li>
            <li> I love this powder.</li>
            <li> and I love how it dries off tightening the skin.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> Before I&#x27;ve purchased this item, I did read most of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I had simply filled my sink with warm tap water then washed my face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I mix this with rose and glycerin water and leave it on for almost 15 minutes and it leaves my skin feeling so smooth and cleansed.</li>
            <li> love it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and purchased it.  </li>
            <li> makes your skin feel so smooth!</li>
            <li> I made way more than I needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned it is best to add just enough</li>
            <li> this stuff is so much better.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t give me anything better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> I will be buying more</li>
            <li> Its an excellent conditioner and the only drawback would be the lack of fragrance in your hair.</li>
            <li> After you wash the mask over, make sure to moisturize ---maybe with coconut oil or emu oil.</li>
            <li> Would purchase again.:)</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff, cheap and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I love this face clay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to have a dedicated face towel to wash the clay off, however, because the red color does stain clothes and fabric.</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love love my skin now.</li>
            <li> I got 10 more minutes,</li>
            <li> Can I wait 10 more minutes?&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I have 5 more minutes</li>
            <li> THIS CLAY HAS MANY BENEFITS, U CAN SMELL &amp; FELL THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> great to make skin very soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I splashed my face generously with warm water for a minute or so, followed by a cool water splash and that was it.</li>
            <li> Besides all the natural benefits of the clay itself, the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the clay, I use it along with a couple of drops of glycerin and rose water.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> its natural and great.</li>
            <li> though I haven&#x27;t seen 2/3 results yet (it&#x27;s not a miracle in a container), my skin does feel incredibly smooth and oil free after I use it!</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a great natural product.</li>
            <li> Great all natural product</li>
            <li> Great mask for sensitive skin which by the way I have.</li>
            <li> Can be very useful , just need to find and time and get more organized&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> why its not priced higher but glad its not.!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I use Nurtura from Avon, it works very well and makes your skin feel replenished on top of a nice working clay mask.</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps my complexion feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li> highly recommend for this product was sent to me, I am very satisfied and pleased, because if there was a mistake on their part, they will correct it right away, I say this from experience, and always hasen effort that we as customers are satisfied.</li>
            <li> Add chamomile or finely ground oatmeal to reduce redness or discolorations (age/ acne).</li>
            <li> This clay works fine</li>
            <li> It does dry your face out so make sure to have a great skin moisturizer to apply afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really love that this is an effective, inexpensive and all natural way to treat my skin.</li>
            <li> The clay dissolved immediately into a smooth, silky texture.</li>
            <li> Tightens the skin and gives a smooth texture of the epidermis 💗💗</li>
            <li> So gentle, yet effective.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it because I was in need a mask to help smooth out my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> I used this in some handmade soap to give it a light pinkish color, but it just turned it to a brown/tan.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be cleaning her face well and leaving it smooth.  </li>
            <li> Yes, she says, confirmed.</li>
            <li> Great for making pores smaller, controlling acne.</li>
            <li> I also really enjoy mixing it up - I can control the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a warning for anyone with fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far so good, I use it on my skin as a skin mask...</li>
            <li> Can use a variety of oils and/or mix with green or bentonite clay(also very economical) to achieve the perfect result for your type of skin.</li>
            <li> im pretty sure youll be just fine,</li>
            <li> The instructions on ratio of water to clay powder seems too high (too watery) to be effective.</li>
            <li> Product arrived with no spillage, appears to be a nice high quality.</li>
            <li> , it mixes well with water, I love that it&#x27;s gentle and washes off so easily</li>
            <li> Repeat until skin is free from rusty debris and in the end wash with cool water to close pores.</li>
            <li> The clay I received is in the original container</li>
            <li> When mixing, it seems like you need more water at first but trust me, the increments are correct.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that it does not over dry my sensitive skin or turn it bright red like most beauty/ cosmetics/ ect.</li>
            <li> Overall, I could not be more pleased and I feel that this is a wonderful, gentle, cleansing mask that can be used by anyone and/or adjusted to meet specific skin needs.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel really clean</li>
            <li> I use this about once a week to clean out my pores.</li>
            <li> Clean and refreshed after applying.</li>
            <li> Smells good, gentle on my skin, and feels very primal to mix up the powder and then paint on.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive this clay kind of burns and is itchy.</li>
            <li> no thanks lol</li>
            <li> If your skin does not feel better after this then you just have really picky skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a bit of product and will last you a good while.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Nice, fine grind &amp; mixed well during the process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived quickly and intact.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is good, gentle for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I  quickly apply my H2O Night Oasis Oxygenating Energizing Serum.</li>
            <li> I love this powder, it leaves your face feeling brand new,</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, I really did !</li>
            <li> Leaves skin exfoliated, very clean (pores are unclogged) but yet not dry and reduces the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft and bright and clear now!  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s all natural and approved for skin use, you can be sure it&#x27;s non-toxic to critters.  </li>
            <li> It just made my face feel fresh, supple and rejuvenated</li>
            <li> I mix equal parts clay powder and apple cider vinegar which makes a foamy kind of paste, put it on for about 15 mins and rinse.</li>
            <li> I have never used it before nor any kind of Morrocan red clay powder</li>
            <li> Look online at numerous websites for different masque recipes to find your ideal masque.</li>
            <li> I really liked the Now Foods European Clay Powder (which I used with aloe gel, I thought it worked well and helped clear acne.5 stars :) Thus decided to give this one a try</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth, soft and oil free.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aztec healing clay for about a year and really liked the results, so I thought I would give the Red Clay Powder a shot, and perhaps end up alternating the two.</li>
            <li> As far as detoxing/cleaning out pores, I&#x27;ve used better masks.  </li>
            <li> This dries quickly and when you remove it, your skin will feel amazingly smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li> Although it washes right off and leaves no stains.&lt;br /&gt;Results: I am blushing like I just came out of sauna.</li>
            <li> After the first application of the mask and after it dried, about 15 minutes, I rinsed my face with warm water and noticed how clean my face was!</li>
            <li> I love that this mask is great, as is, but will also make an excellent  base for me to add other ingredients to, depending on what our skin needs are that day.  </li>
            <li> I originally got this because I wanted a more natural way of getting a deep clean.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, my face was super clean and soft.</li>
            <li> love this stuff ... works very well with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This led to a reduction of time the second time I used it, but I experienced the same dryness.</li>
            <li> so far i strongly advise not buying for this reason, did not try on hair..</li>
            <li> It make my face feel smooth and very soft.</li>
            <li> Either way, I have very sensitive skin now and was looking for natural and affordable ways to get the same results - this by itself is no miracle worker, but it&#x27;s definitely a great addition to my regimen.     </li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s 100% natural clay, which is great because I don&#x27;t want any other ingredients or chemicals going onto my skin.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of clay masks before.</li>
            <li> Just place this in a food safe container with an equal amount of water, and let it sit over night.</li>
            <li> In planted aquariums, the aquatic plants need root fertilizer to grow big and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going to order more</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s results will be different, I am sure, but for this price, I would DEFINATELY try it if you are interested.</li>
            <li> You can feel your pulse through your face as it gets really dried, and your face will get warm, this means its doing its job, not painful at all.</li>
            <li> and I look forward to using this mask regularly! :-)</li>
            <li> This really helps out!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m definitely buying it again !</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this.  </li>
            <li> However, I am a first time user and to minimize dryness</li>
            <li> i cant stress i love this enough.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely a wonder product!</li>
            <li> (I read a lot of peoples&#x27; reviews saying their skin was red and blotchy for some time), but then it sure does brighten your skin for like maybe a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> It works better than the green clay for bringing life back into my face after a good shower.</li>
            <li> must tell you this first:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty dying.</li>
            <li> It happened the first time I used it, and I thought maybe it reacted with something I already had on my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry, but I have acne prone skin also, so I thought this would be good because it&#x27;s for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I mix a small amount (about 2 teaspoon) with Shea Terra Pure Moroccan Rose Water until it is smooth.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say, that this rinsed off my skin easier than any other clay type mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> No blemishes or marks and leaves my skin feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li> it feels clean and soft ..</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m sure it works for some folks, but it didn&#x27;t do much of anything to help my skin.</li>
            <li> This product left my face feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much done with masks from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% natural clay with no other ingredients which I love.</li>
            <li> love how well it stores in dry form.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it twice-weekly in the summer, and weekly in the winter ( when my skin tends to dry out more).</li>
            <li> I love NOW products, and I really don&#x27;t know why it took me this long to try this one.</li>
            <li> large pores/prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> Pure clay powder nothing else.</li>
            <li> I also use pure aloe vera gel 2x</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for ways to combat my oily skin and large pores.  </li>
            <li> and I can see the effect on my large pores, it&#x27;s shrinking them gradually.</li>
            <li> daily which I think also has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> and it does really remove qucikly this way.</li>
            <li> blemishes have faded,pores appear smaller,noticed that my Daughter is not breaking out as much as before.</li>
            <li> clarifies really well, shrinks pores and draws out impurities from skin.</li>
            <li> I dont really care for anything perfume</li>
            <li> didnt just come packaged ready.</li>
            <li> but there wasn&#x27;t really a. Difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> and it was very relaxing.</li>
            <li> It really tightens your skin...</li>
            <li> Way to much powder per water.</li>
            <li> very drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied twice , however I&#x27;ve not seen or felt much of a difference after applying the mask and when I say differnce improvement to the skin...</li>
            <li> I rubbed gently, to remove any missed clay.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really, really helps suck all the excess oil and goop out of pores.</li>
            <li> I use this product about once a week and it really tightens up my pores.</li>
            <li> However, that hasn&#x27;t stopped me from using it since it does make my skin much softer afterwards.</li>
            <li> People pay so much for a tube of mask that drys out after time.</li>
            <li> I believed that this bh was a mole but after the facial, I noticed after I accidently squeezed it that it was filled with mucus and it has disappeared.</li>
            <li> I really like this clay.</li>
            <li> I was very relaxed.</li>
            <li> She wants me to order one for her immediately.</li>
            <li> It really does the trick on my stubborn skin.</li>
            <li> I have always used various masks and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I mix a tiny tea size spoon with my precious Evan Healy hydrosol and wear it on my face  for 30 minutes, it dries up completely</li>
            <li> main draw back with this is that I&#x27;ve had a strong reaction to it twice out of around six uses.  </li>
            <li> Really helped make my pores smaller and my face feels and looks clean when I use it.</li>
            <li> Great price for a product where a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for oily skin, large pores, acne, etc.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use as much as planned , but used it in a past and liked it .</li>
            <li> Usually I put face towel in warm water and then put on my face to soften mask a bit</li>
            <li> I wiped my face (after rinsing) with a white/floral washcloth and the small amount that was on the cloth rinsed away with warm water also.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, I am going to say that this makes a HUGE mess when trying to remove as a face mask.</li>
            <li> all my black heads were gone from my cheeks and most form my chin</li>
            <li> If anything maybe half a spoon of water more.</li>
            <li> I just received my first order of Now Foods Moroccan Red Clay Powder and from the first use, I know this is a staple item I will not be without.  </li>
            <li> Usually masks make me break out more, but this calms the skin tone and diminishes blackheads pretty well.</li>
            <li> It clarified my hair yet left it super moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use this in my cold process soap as well as face masks..:) it makes pretty colors in my soap.:)</li>
            <li> I can only guess that this powder would be effective for the other uses also.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin either</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> and I really like using products that are natural.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li> I did end up adding quite a bit more water and a few drops of almond oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier than getting normal packaged clay masks off.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> But what I do know is that I do not want to live without this product from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using a cheap, store brand black head scrub, and my skin looks a lot better now, AND it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like this</li>
            <li> but I notice that during the winter time, my skin feels super dry after I use it.</li>
            <li> This clay powder leaves my face very very soft and man do i glow after</li>
            <li> The clay received is VERY different in color than the original version which was actually red.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of acne and was on Pro-Activ for a decade with success until I guess age caught up to me or</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t just give it one star because the first time I used it, my pores did look smaller, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Today was my first time using Red Clay Powder.</li>
            <li> Before applying the red clay I did have three red pimple, which have reduced in size significantly.    </li>
            <li> I first mixed it with water</li>
            <li> face feels hot suddenly, for 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> The only recommendation I have, is after you clean your face, make sure to apply some sort of moisturizer if your skin feels a little dry.</li>
            <li> This mask is so easy, all you have to do is mix about a tablespoon of powder to a few teaspoons of water, and apply to your face.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive, so it LOVES natural products like this one.</li>
            <li> This stings were like a low voltage current penetrating my skin, and moving around very fast, pulses much finer than the ones around my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have also mixed it with coffee, coco butter, and vitamin e oil to make a mask for my stomach to smooth the loose skin from pregnancy</li>
            <li> Not only clear out my large pores and minimises my pimples-</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product because I prefer all natural products rather than harsh chemicals to clean my face due to the fact that I have a combination of oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is for sensitive skin, worked really well for me since I already have red cheeks all the time, this product didnt irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> My pores are clear and my skin is glowing.  </li>
            <li> It does tighten my pores and clear up any blemishes rather well.</li>
            <li> Its all natural and truly even out skin tone and helps keep blemishes away.</li>
            <li> I have to use it with water, as the cider vinegar is too &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin&#x3D; 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> My hair felt really soft after using this.</li>
            <li> My adult acne has cleared almost completely.  </li>
            <li> I got this product because I have sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li> Do it once a week followed by a serum and the results are baby soft skin</li>
            <li> So far I have had no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> Many people complained about removing the mask and it staining their skin.</li>
            <li> i think i will be using this instead of getting professional facials anymore.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin and the clay doesn&#x27;t show too many negative effects on my skin</li>
            <li> for people looking to apply this on your hair, I have no idea how this clay works on hair, but then I do know of an alternate which is much cheaper and works well with hair.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a big difference in this clay used by it</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so far I have no reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit expensive for the amount that you&#x60;re getting but it&#x60;s a good quality.</li>
            <li> After the first use it noticeably shrunk my pores and left my skin soft, it did not dry me out completely either.</li>
            <li> I use a large variety of skin products, as my skin tends to be very moody due to the fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> I mean just ok.</li>
            <li> I will say that if you use it around friends, they will be extremely intrigued so be willing to share!</li>
            <li> makes a decent clay mask when mixed with Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel w/Rose Extract</li>
            <li> But using just this powder alone makes my skin unbelievably smoother, tighter, cleaner, and overall better.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and a totally different use for this product.  </li>
            <li> My face feeling like someone is pulling it back, I think, it is normal...</li>
            <li> gets really tight as it starts drying and you feel your skin pulsing and tingling (some much needed circulation).&lt;br /&gt;Because its close to my skin tone when it dries I look really funky.</li>
            <li> I mixed pure aloe vera and a couple drops of rosemary essential oil with it</li>
            <li> my left and right side pulsating at the same time with the same tempo of my heart.</li>
            <li> I just used a little bathroom paper cup, to cover your whole face you dont need to use much.</li>
            <li> It left it cleansed and it felt very soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I recommend wetting the clay all around your face first, this will make the hard clay very pliable again.</li>
            <li> I got this after researching different natural clay masks.</li>
            <li> Not because it does not work, but because I am extremely busy and do not have time for the entire process.  </li>
            <li> With all of them combined, I manage to get away with just barely tolerable skin.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY not for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I have tiny wrinkles under my eyes and around my upper lip and lower part of my neck, which are normal signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t leave it on longer than 15 minutes because it will hurt coming off if you let it dry too much.</li>
            <li> As soon as I lay down and relax, pulsing and stinging comes right back.</li>
            <li> I mix 1 tablespoon of powder with water to get lotion texture, apply with old flat foundation brush and let it work for about 15-20 min.then</li>
            <li> A Tablespoon or two mixed with a few drops of peppermint and/or almond oil and a small amount of water, makes a great spa masque for less than a dollar each.</li>
            <li> , i have super tiny ones so its hard to clear it all out between getting facials.</li>
            <li> Easy to rinse off too, dont be afraid to not use a washcloth as some have advised, I found even when it got near my eyes when just splashing my whole face with water instead of taking a longer time in wiping spots away with a cloth, that it didnt irritate my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I put way to much there and that explains why this mud was so active there.</li>
            <li> It will not dry out that way</li>
            <li> It did burn a little the first time I used though, but it had no adverse effects.  </li>
            <li> I have used other clay&#x27;s before and have to say this is my least favorite</li>
            <li> As long as your not aiming directly for your eyeballs</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time a few days ago, and</li>
            <li> Then apply directly to your face, but make sure you slather it on real thick, and leave it on until it&#x27;s fully dry.</li>
            <li> Feels great, definitely makes my big ugly pores smaller.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 weeks straight daily and then slowed down to twice a week or so.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably normal due to the mask pulling all the impurities from the face.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way, and I have lighter red hair and if you do too much</li>
            <li> remove the mask when dry, I place a wet washcloth over my face, let the mask become slightly wet again, and gently remove.</li>
            <li> I mixed it simply, per the instructions on the lable, only I used apple cider vinegar (I hate the smell, but it is good for my oily skin) instead of water.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what this stuff is really for</li>
            <li> You only have to use about a teaspoon or so, so this lasts a long time for the price.</li>
            <li> I notice my pores are flat, pumped out and looks like irritated.</li>
            <li> Tiny wrinkles under my eyes are stretched and gone.</li>
            <li> Could be anything - something on my face, not mixing right, etc., but its not worth it to figure it out since the results are pretty mediocre.</li>
            <li> I used it as a facial to tighten pores and it also treated a blackhead that i had for a very long time.</li>
            <li> 20 min is the max as it can make skin dry and red when you remove mask.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel like a babys bottom, and only takes about 10-15min to dry.</li>
            <li> Though the color is close to a red brown, when I used in my HP soap it is pink not red.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a  few times but it does seem to help my larger pores and tighten my face in general.</li>
            <li> You must remember to do not leave it on your face for too long-</li>
            <li> I mixed it with French Green Clay to see a big difference in the reaction in my skin.</li>
            <li> After washing it off, I noticed it really dried my face, and I will mention that I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was just curious about this red clay and, I never, ever thought, that one day I will be reviewing a mud.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My pores used to look like the skin of an orange, shiny and oily for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Closed my eyes and gave all my attention to these tiny pulses moving around my cheeks.</li>
            <li> next morning, my cheeks are pink.</li>
            <li> It does tend to dry out skin so the trick is to either a) not leave it on as long or often or b)</li>
            <li> I have also used this in a cold process facial soap recipe and so far it is a very luxurious bar!</li>
            <li> I only left the product on for 15 minutes, and mixed it with water, but it was very harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin-oily in centre with dry cheeks and used to use products for acne skin.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my face with a plastic brush I found in my bathroom and let it dry for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Your face will appear pink/red after, I advise to use something nurturing/moisturizing as soon as you rinse the mask off, you skin will feel tighter and a lit&#x27; dry.</li>
            <li> I apply it on my face and let it dry for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I am hoping it will help suck out the oils from my face and dry off the pimples.</li>
            <li> If that happens let it sit and dry out.</li>
            <li> So I did a test spot the next time and had no reaction for the next few uses.  </li>
            <li> I inherited my mother&#x27;s large pores, and I also have a lot of other skin issues due to fibromyalgia (excessive dryness, keratosis pilaris, loss of resiliency among others).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not cheap and it runs out fast.</li>
            <li> My skin always looks less red and</li>
            <li> Next time, I will using less and try coconut oil in place of water.</li>
            <li> I am a male past middle age, between olive and wheat complexion.</li>
            <li> There is a slight burn at the contour of my upper lip.</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel your skin tightening, and feel a tingling sensation, and my face was a little dry afterwards, but nothing too severe.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely feels less oily and this mask does not completely dry out my skin unlike other masks that I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li> it made my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to wash the mask off in the shower instead of at the sink so the mess isn&#x27;t as big a deal and to add an oil.</li>
            <li> Mix together, add a tiny bit of water, and roll it into little spheres.</li>
            <li> My face is a little red immediately after use, but I just do it before I go to sleep</li>
            <li> Then go back and wash off each little area.</li>
            <li> I sometimes add a few drops of essential oil.</li>
            <li> (literally just wet your face</li>
            <li> I see my cheeks are still wet.</li>
            <li> I have extremely pale, paper white skin</li>
            <li> Mixed with rosewater once, aloe vera juice another time and plain water another time.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the reason my pores are less clogged (since their hardly open) and less acne</li>
            <li> but I do know when I remove it, my skin is smoother and my pores do seem smaller with less black heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will not be using this again and will look for a pink mica or some other quality colorant.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did absolutely nothing to my skin, except dry it out.</li>
            <li> However, this one doesn&#x27;t dry me out or make my skin too tight - while drying or after removing.  </li>
            <li> Still exploring other  uses.</li>
            <li> I am 42 with extremely oily skin/</li>
            <li> I know it has other uses (according to the jar)</li>
            <li> She mixes this powder with some other stuff to create a face mask.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my face, it didn&#x27;t pull as much as other clay masks, however I did like the smoothness of it.</li>
            <li> u won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> When I move around I don&#x27;t feel anything on my face other then pulling.</li>
            <li> I use it once every week or every other week.</li>
            <li> Let dry for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I also did experience some slight redness on the face after I used it as other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> Between aloe vera gel and this red clay powder I have had major improvements with my troubled skin at age 28.</li>
            <li> Tip-use dark cloth to remove mask</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s thoroughly mixed together, (it becomess thick)</li>
            <li> After finishing putting the mask on, I figured, I lay down for 15-20 minutes, like the label says (note.</li>
            <li> Label does not say to lay down).</li>
            <li> , I feel my lowereyelids being pulled down</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend this mask, and I&#x27;ll be trying out their other products!</li>
            <li> no more...no less.</li>
            <li> A typical root-tab recipe is something to this effect:  </li>
            <li> On my no wash days, I take a little tiny bit and sprinkle it in my scalp, brush it through and immediately no more shine!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would take away my acne, make my skin less oily, and fade away scars.  </li>
            <li> and it also get&#x27;s rid of black heads and stuff.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is it is messy to put on.</li>
            <li> Needed this for making Black Pine Tar Salve.</li>
            <li> The picture of the vitamin jar is a little deceiving, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It started bubbling and a little smoke came out of the bowl</li>
            <li> Looks like a  little swollen.</li>
            <li> My skin feels firm, tight and thirsty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be a little messy at times, but it is clay we are talking about here.</li>
            <li> It dried out my face, and then made my hair brittle</li>
            <li> I tried a few but didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops of Moroccan argan oil when mixing to boost the hydration without any additional fragrance.</li>
            <li> It goes away after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Then tiny stings began below my cheeks, near the base of my nose.</li>
            <li> Use very very little liquid whenmixing.</li>
            <li> I had read some reviews online that some people had a hard time getting this off their face after it dried</li>
            <li> Not sure who&#x27;s fault it was</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the 6 oz container being small for what you pay, but I disagree.</li>
            <li> No more orange peel skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy, I use it with water.</li>
            <li> it is also very messy to make and gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> i noticed its not as hard to wash off as the Aztec mask.</li>
            <li> The shipping,however, was a week late.</li>
            <li> I use this red clay when making cold process soap.  </li>
            <li> Do not apply this mask too thick.</li>
            <li> The clay powder is extremely powdery and can be difficult to handle.</li>
            <li> Makes your pores small too!</li>
            <li> It stains your face red :(</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin was just dry, but it made my skin hurt really bad, like it was burning.</li>
            <li> apply a thin layer so it dries on time.</li>
            <li> as only an idiot would do that.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like how inconvenient and messy it was to have to mix it with water every time I wanted to use it.</li>
            <li> it works well on my teenage son who has very bad acne.</li>
            <li> Also, some say the clay mask is uncomfortable and burns and feels weird.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been obsessed with it ever since.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I threw the remaining powder away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recommending it to a friend with troubled skin</li>
            <li> Sounds weird that I&#x27;ve kept using it, but I&#x27;ll explain:  </li>
            <li> Buy some and try it out, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> It is still itchy but not as bad.</li>
            <li> No improvements :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s insane!  </li>
            <li> Sounds disgusting, but I was grateful for it.</li>
            <li> I have terrible skin, but this tightens my skin after I use my 3 step skin care, closing my pores, and getting rid of THE LOT of oil that my face produces.</li>
            <li> Does a pulling out of all the grim and bacteria on your face.</li>
            <li> and it was terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It really works! I have combination skin-oily in centre with dry cheeks and used to use products for acne skin.But they overdried my skin. this is different. Not only clear out my large pores and minimises my pimples- my skin feels really good after this mask. You must remember to do not leave it on your face for too long- 20 min is the max as it can make skin dry and red when you remove mask.I mix 1 tablespoon of powder with water to get lotion texture, apply with old flat foundation brush and let it work for about 15-20 min.then I remove it-Usually I put face towel in warm water and then put on my face to soften mask a bit and it does really remove qucikly this way.Repeat until skin is free from rusty debris and in the end wash with cool water to close pores. then I fallow my daily skin care- toner and moisturiser.  Tip-use dark cloth to remove mask it will get some &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; colour which you cannot wash out, so save you white ones for something else. I use this mask once a week, sometimes once in two weeks as with time you&#x27;ll see improvement and your skin get better. Hope it helps!</li>
            <li> blemishes have faded,pores appear smaller,noticed that my Daughter is not breaking out as much as before. My skin does feel softer after using a mask made with this. Still exploring other  uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different kinds of clay masks before. This yields the best results by far for drawing out impurities and tightening my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove the mask when dry, I place a wet washcloth over my face, let the mask become slightly wet again, and gently remove. I&#x27;ve had no problems with staining- not my skin or my towels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 6 ounces of red clay...no more...no less. The picture of the vitamin jar is a little deceiving, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this to make face masks and mud washes- a must have if your hair is curly or if your skin is oily. Just place this in a food safe container with an equal amount of water, and let it sit over night. No need to mix, the two ingredients will combine on their own to make a versatile mud.</li>
            <li> This mask is wonderful. Its all natural and truly even out skin tone and helps keep blemishes away. I have not had a reverse effects with this product it is truly a holy grail !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It make my face feel smooth and very soft.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite clay powders. My face is very sensitive, so it LOVES natural products like this one. I have to use it with water, as the cider vinegar is too &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; on my sensitive skin. I will buy more when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> It stains your face red :( no thanks lol</li>
            <li> love this product, but it fails to control oil. clarifies really well, shrinks pores and draws out impurities from skin.</li>
            <li> great to make skin very soft and healthy looking. apply a thin layer so it dries on time. sensitive skin&#x3D; 4 minutes. regular skin&#x3D;8 minutes...  if it makes your skin irritated and red after removing mask, dont worry... it will go away.     great product! would recommend.</li>
            <li> In planted aquariums, the aquatic plants need root fertilizer to grow big and healthy. This red-cay is perfect for providing iron and potassium in D.I.Y. \\&quot;root tabs\\&quot;. Because it&#x27;s all natural and approved for skin use, you can be sure it&#x27;s non-toxic to critters.  I can&#x27;t review its performance as a beauty product . . . I used it as an aquatic fertilizer.  :-)  A typical root-tab recipe is something to this effect:  3/4 cup red clay  3/4 cup plantex csm+b  2 tablespoons epsom salt  (magnesium sulfate)  2 tablespoons potassium sulfate  Mix together, add a tiny bit of water, and roll it into little spheres. Let dry for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Its minimized my pores, I haven&#x27;t had oily skin since using this product. I&#x27;m actually going to order more</li>
            <li> I just received my first order of Now Foods Moroccan Red Clay Powder and from the first use, I know this is a staple item I will not be without.  I am 42 with extremely oily skin/large pores/prone to breakouts. I have always used various masks and this is by far my favorite.  I mixed it simply, per the instructions on the lable, only I used apple cider vinegar (I hate the smell, but it is good for my oily skin) instead of water.  It started bubbling and a little smoke came out of the bowl and I thought, this is like a science experiment from high school, lol! The clay dissolved immediately into a smooth, silky texture. I applied it to my face with a plastic brush I found in my bathroom and let it dry for about 20 minutes. I splashed my face generously with warm water for a minute or so, followed by a cool water splash and that was it. I can honestly say, that this rinsed off my skin easier than any other clay type mask I have ever used. My skin felt and looked great. I had read some reviews online that some people had a hard time getting this off their face after it dried, it stained their washcloth, it stained their skin, etc. I have extremely pale, paper white skin and it did not leave any kind of stain whatsoever. I wiped my face (after rinsing) with a white/floral washcloth and the small amount that was on the cloth rinsed away with warm water also. Everyone&#x27;s results will be different, I am sure, but for this price, I would DEFINATELY try it if you are interested. I have teenage daughters who have some of the same skin issues I have and I have been researching homemade remedies online for a while now. I love that this mask is great, as is, but will also make an excellent  base for me to add other ingredients to, depending on what our skin needs are that day.  I have read that this can be mixed with aloe vera gel, lemon juice, witch hazel or essential oils for drier skin types. I am also going to try mixing some cinnamon or nutmeg in here too, as I have read they are good for acne also. Overall, I could not be more pleased and I feel that this is a wonderful, gentle, cleansing mask that can be used by anyone and/or adjusted to meet specific skin needs. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m IN LOVE with this clay!!!!  I mix a tiny tea size spoon with my precious Evan Healy hydrosol and wear it on my face  for 30 minutes, it dries up completely and I can totally feel my heart beats and the way it makes me flush! it&#x27;s insane!  I just can&#x27;t explain how well this works to extract every bit of gunk out of the pores! it loosens up the most stubborn blackheads and it absorbs sebum like crazyyyyyy!  my skin feels so soft and bright and clear now!  ugh. the best.</li>
            <li> This product is for sensitive skin, worked really well for me since I already have red cheeks all the time, this product didnt irritate my skin at all. Made my skin feel like a babys bottom, and only takes about 10-15min to dry. Some have said to leave it on longer, but I didnt have to. You can feel your pulse through your face as it gets really dried, and your face will get warm, this means its doing its job, not painful at all. Easy to rinse off too, dont be afraid to not use a washcloth as some have advised, I found even when it got near my eyes when just splashing my whole face with water instead of taking a longer time in wiping spots away with a cloth, that it didnt irritate my eyes at all. As long as your not aiming directly for your eyeballs im pretty sure youll be just fine, as only an idiot would do that. It doesnt have a strong smell, which is nice. I dont really care for anything perfume like, I just like the smell of \\&quot;clean\\&quot; and this clay mask does just that. Your face will appear pink/red after, I advise to use something nurturing/moisturizing as soon as you rinse the mask off, you skin will feel tighter and a lit&#x27; dry. I use Nurtura from Avon, it works very well and makes your skin feel replenished on top of a nice working clay mask. If your skin does not feel better after this then you just have really picky skin. I wont buy anything price, which is another reason this product has worked well for me. Its very easy to mix up, as I have never tried a mask before that didnt just come packaged ready. I just used a little bathroom paper cup, to cover your whole face you dont need to use much. So this container will last me awhile.</li>
            <li> The product is good, gentle for sensitive skin. The shipping,however, was a week late. Not sure who&#x27;s fault it was but it was supposed to be part of a gift which ended up not being part of it.</li>
            <li> I use this as a &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; for my red hair. On my no wash days, I take a little tiny bit and sprinkle it in my scalp, brush it through and immediately no more shine! A little goes a LONG way, and I have lighter red hair and if you do too much it almost looks like tan baby powder all up in your roots. Not sure what this stuff is really for but it works good for me and my 1-2 time a week hair washing routine.</li>
            <li> Tightens the skin and gives a smooth texture of the epidermis 💗💗</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I ran out.  The container is different than the one pictured; it&#x27;s actually a 6oz jar-ish container not the pill-ish container.  The clay I received is in the original container I am accustomed to.  The clay received is VERY different in color than the original version which was actually red.  This clay is hmmmm well....blond.  It still works well but something is always affected when companies change the \\&quot;recipe\\&quot; of their products, I just haven&#x27;t figured out what yet...</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin was just dry, but it made my skin hurt really bad, like it was burning. My face was red for a minute or two after I took it off! but there wasn&#x27;t really a. Difference in my skin. I just used water, too. And I don&#x27;t really have sensitive skin either</li>
            <li> Excellent facial mask!! So gentle, yet effective.  I also use it in my homemade powder foundation. &amp;#60;3 Perfect!</li>
            <li> This powder is really great! I purchased it because I was in need a mask to help smooth out my skin&#x27;s texture. I use one teaspoon of the powder and then I mix it with a teaspoon of water. After it&#x27;s thoroughly mixed together, (it becomess thick) I apply it on my face and let it dry for 30 minutes. My skin definitely feels less oily and this mask does not completely dry out my skin unlike other masks that I&#x27;ve previously used. I would recommend this product to anyone. This powder will stain your wash cloth, so when you remove it, you should use a wash cloth that is inexpensive!</li>
            <li> My hair felt really soft after using this.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction and happy with choosing this seller to do business with. Some people complain about the 6 oz container being small for what you pay, but I disagree. It&#x27;s quite a bit of product and will last you a good while. Unless you&#x27;re planning on rolling in it..then you may want to buy by the pound. Also, some say the clay mask is uncomfortable and burns and feels weird. I haven&#x27;t experienced burning or any type of discomfort whatsoever. I mixed pure aloe vera and a couple drops of rosemary essential oil with it and it was very relaxing. After rinsing, my face was super clean and soft. I don&#x27;t have big pores, so I didn&#x27;t notice anything there. It just made my face feel fresh, supple and rejuvenated and I look forward to using this mask regularly! :-) Happy face! &lt;3</li>
            <li> I love this powder, it leaves your face feeling brand new, what others have told me is that you can use the powder to take out lime disease.  This powder does everything!</li>
            <li> This really helps out! I&#x27;ve been a long time sufferer of acne and was on Pro-Activ for a decade with success until I guess age caught up to me or Pro-Activ changed their formula because I&#x27;m now allergic to the stuff. Either way, I have very sensitive skin now and was looking for natural and affordable ways to get the same results - this by itself is no miracle worker, but it&#x27;s definitely a great addition to my regimen.     It does tend to dry out skin so the trick is to either a) not leave it on as long or often or b) make sure you&#x27;ve got a great moisturizer to counter. I used it for 2 weeks straight daily and then slowed down to twice a week or so. My skin always looks less red and it def helps heal acne faster. Definitely going to keep buying this. You only have to use about a teaspoon or so, so this lasts a long time for the price. I&#x27;m not even halfway done with it and I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and a half. Definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> This red clay is one of the best and the price is amazing I have been a repeat buyer for over a year now improve skins texture and tightness</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this product because I prefer all natural products rather than harsh chemicals to clean my face due to the fact that I have a combination of oily and sensitive skin. This mask is so easy, all you have to do is mix about a tablespoon of powder to a few teaspoons of water, and apply to your face. After the first application of the mask and after it dried, about 15 minutes, I rinsed my face with warm water and noticed how clean my face was! I&#x27;m in love with this product and saw results of my skin clearing and pores shrinking within about 3 days.The only recommendation I have, is after you clean your face, make sure to apply some sort of moisturizer if your skin feels a little dry. That&#x27;s probably normal due to the mask pulling all the impurities from the face. This is definitely a product I will order in the future.</li>
            <li> love this stuff ... works very well with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This clay is awesome and cleanses your hair really good, without stripping it. In fact my hair felt so good I did not deep condition. I just applied a leave in conditioner and styled.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I&#x27;m definitely buying it again !</li>
            <li> i dont think this version is as organic as they make it seem. It dried out my face, and then made my hair brittle</li>
            <li> I got this after researching different natural clay masks. First of all, it&#x27;s 100% natural clay, which is great because I don&#x27;t want any other ingredients or chemicals going onto my skin. For acne prone skin, it&#x27;s great. Usually masks make me break out more, but this calms the skin tone and diminishes blackheads pretty well. My face is a little red immediately after use, but I just do it before I go to sleep and when I wake up, it has cleared up.</li>
            <li> No, did not get the product that I order. No way to reach them ,no phone number, if the is a way for me to reach them</li>
            <li> Use it every weekend as a relaxation treatment (make it into a mask). Works great and keeps my complexion feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily, and this worked great!  Best mask I&#x27;ve ever used. I mixed with witch hazel and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I use this red clay when making cold process soap.  Besides all the natural benefits of the clay itself, the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Will reduce pore size. I see some folks complain because it stains a wash cloth. You&#x27;ll get over your wash cloth despair when you use this! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> best tighting i have ever seen, and my bathroom is full of a million products</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this.  It did burn a little the first time I used though, but it had no adverse effects.  I use it about twice a week, and I have to keep myself from using it more.  My pores are clear and my skin is glowing.  My adult acne has cleared almost completely.  I have also mixed it with coffee, coco butter, and vitamin e oil to make a mask for my stomach to smooth the loose skin from pregnancy and I have seen improvement after two weeks. I will definitely order again before this runs out.</li>
            <li> highly recommend for this product was sent to me, I am very satisfied and pleased, because if there was a mistake on their part, they will correct it right away, I say this from experience, and always hasen effort that we as customers are satisfied.</li>
            <li> It really tightens your skin...</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have sensitive, oily skin. I was hoping for something to make my skin smoother and tighten my pores to prevent acne- but I ended up with a chemical burn. I only left the product on for 15 minutes, and mixed it with water, but it was very harsh on my face. I also have very fair skin, so this could be an atrivuting factor as well. Just a warning for anyone with fair sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Do it once a week followed by a serum and the results are baby soft skin</li>
            <li> I love this powder. I am using it to experiment on different DIY facial mask and I love how it dries off tightening the skin. I have a feeling it is tightening my pore. So far I have had no adverse effects. I have acne prone skin and I am hoping it will help suck out the oils from my face and dry off the pimples. I have been making regimens that include mixtures of honey, lemon, egg white and coconut oil together with the clay.</li>
            <li> I originally got this because I wanted a more natural way of getting a deep clean. My skin is dry, but I have acne prone skin also, so I thought this would be good because it&#x27;s for sensitive skin. Overall, I&#x27;m sure it works for some folks, but it didn&#x27;t do much of anything to help my skin. I also didn&#x27;t like how inconvenient and messy it was to have to mix it with water every time I wanted to use it. I&#x27;m currently using a cheap, store brand black head scrub, and my skin looks a lot better now, AND it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like this does. I&#x27;m pretty much done with masks from now on. I couldn&#x27;t just give it one star because the first time I used it, my pores did look smaller, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a red clay. Though the color is close to a red brown, when I used in my HP soap it is pink not red. Still does the job but is not red.</li>
            <li> I use the clay strictly for facial purposes and it tightens my face tighter than any plastic surgery could do. My face eventually relaxes after applying the mask. Also, I use witch hazel instead of water to make my facial mask. It may help.</li>
            <li> Been using it once a week now and its works wonders for my skin. No blemishes or marks and leaves my skin feeling clean and clear.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t follow the directions on this. Way to much powder per water. Make a thinner mask. Will last a while. very drying. My skin was scorched. i imagine it will work wonders as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I use this in my cold process soap as well as face masks..:) it makes pretty colors in my soap.:)</li>
            <li> Love to be able to mix up my own face clay mask.  Smells good, gentle on my skin, and feels very primal to mix up the powder and then paint on.  love how well it stores in dry form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this mask, and I&#x27;ll be trying out their other products!</li>
            <li> I order this product after reading on how wonderful it is for the skin.... read a couple of different reciepts and decided to go with on from a cosmotelogist.....I&#x27;ve applied twice , however I&#x27;ve not seen or felt much of a difference after applying the mask and when I say differnce improvement to the skin...perhaps it takes several uses before observing any consiberable change.....I&#x27;ll keep hoping for a good positive result!!</li>
            <li> Its ok. I mean just ok. It makes you feel really clean but it also makes your face hurt when its drying.</li>
            <li> makes a decent clay mask when mixed with Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel w/Rose Extract</li>
            <li> I used this clay powder as a deep cleanser for my kinky-curly hair.  It left it cleansed and it felt very soft and moisturized.  I would use it again for this purpose.  I know it has other uses (according to the jar) but I haven&#x27;t used it for anything but my hair.  I can only guess that this powder would be effective for the other uses also.</li>
            <li> Worked well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Today was my first time using Red Clay Powder. So far, I really like it. In the instructions you are asked to use 2 tablespoons of the clay and equal parts of water; following the directions I had excess,  which of course went into the trash. I did end up adding quite a bit more water and a few drops of almond oil. Next time, I will using less and try coconut oil in place of water. You can definitely feel your skin tightening, and feel a tingling sensation, and my face was a little dry afterwards, but nothing too severe. Before applying the red clay I did have three red pimple, which have reduced in size significantly.    Before I&#x27;ve purchased this item, I did read most of the reviews.  Many people complained about removing the mask and it staining their skin. I found it to be rather simple to remove.  I had simply filled my sink with warm tap water then washed my face. My sink was not stained, nor my grout. Since I had read that the clay does stain your laundry, I had used a paper towel, dampened with almond oil. I rubbed gently, to remove any missed clay. Overall, I did not experience any skin staining. However, I am a first time user and to minimize dryness I&#x27;ll wait ten minutes instead of waiting fifteen to twenty minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I just ordered it (my boyfriend got it for me from his account) and i cant stress i love this enough. I mix equal parts clay powder and apple cider vinegar which makes a foamy kind of paste, put it on for about 15 mins and rinse. all my black heads were gone from my cheeks and most form my chin, i have super tiny ones so its hard to clear it all out between getting facials. i think i will be using this instead of getting professional facials anymore. try it. its natural and great.</li>
            <li> I mix it with apple cider vinegar and use it on my hair. My hair has never felt so clean! I first mixed it with water but it didn&#x27;t do a great job. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s not cheap and it runs out fast. I wish it comes in a bigger jar and cheaper....</li>
            <li> I used this in some handmade soap to give it a light pinkish color, but it just turned it to a brown/tan.  It did not give any red hues at all.  I will not be using this again and will look for a pink mica or some other quality colorant.</li>
            <li> perfect and sensitive</li>
            <li> I used this clay as a hair mask. It clarified my hair yet left it super moisturized.</li>
            <li> This clay powder leaves my face very very soft and man do i glow after</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product! I have used this several times already. Mixed with rosewater once, aloe vera juice another time and plain water another time. I liked the aloe vera mixture best. I have also used this in a cold process facial soap recipe and so far it is a very luxurious bar! Will order again.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product for her face.  She mixes this powder with some other stuff to create a face mask.  It seems to be cleaning her face well and leaving it smooth.  This is her second order, so I guess she likes it.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I used it once and it removed all the blackheads within my skin. Sounds disgusting, but I was grateful for it. Only reapplied once since by initial use. Not because it does not work, but because I am extremely busy and do not have time for the entire process.  It does dry your face out so make sure to have a great skin moisturizer to apply afterwards. I will say that if you use it around friends, they will be extremely intrigued so be willing to share! lol.</li>
            <li> Use it in my hair and face mask, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I have terrible skin, but this tightens my skin after I use my 3 step skin care, closing my pores, and getting rid of THE LOT of oil that my face produces. I use it twice-weekly in the summer, and weekly in the winter ( when my skin tends to dry out more). I believe this is the reason my pores are less clogged (since their hardly open) and less acne prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be a little messy at times, but it is clay we are talking about here.</li>
            <li> Really helped make my pores smaller and my face feels and looks clean when I use it. My acne is stopping. It does stain washcloths, so I just use the same ones when I rinse it off. No big deal to me. It&#x27;s easier than getting normal packaged clay masks off.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend! Pure clay powder nothing else. Also, I just mixed water to make a mask. The mask worked great, better than anything I have used. I highly recommend for oily skin, large pores, acne, etc. Use very very little liquid whenmixing. Otherwise it will be too watery. If that happens let it sit and dry out.</li>
            <li> Great Clay and &amp;#34;now&amp;#34; is always a good choice</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have never used it before nor any kind of Morrocan red clay powder but I heard how amazing it leaves your skin after using it. Would recommend it to anyone. All you need is a good moisturizer to finish it off.</li>
            <li> I mix this with rose and glycerin water and leave it on for almost 15 minutes and it leaves my skin feeling so smooth and cleansed. It does tighten my pores and clear up any blemishes rather well. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin tone in just a months time of using this weekly. I also use pure aloe vera gel 2x daily which I think also has made a huge difference in my skin. Between aloe vera gel and this red clay powder I have had major improvements with my troubled skin at age 28. Miracle products!</li>
            <li> Good quality clay. Love it cause it taste good, smells good, mixes with water perfect, into a perfect creamy texture.</li>
            <li> it feels clean and soft .. I have an oily skin and it works so good for me .. love it :)</li>
            <li> I use this about once a week to clean out my pores. It&#x27;s great. I sometimes add a few drops of essential oil. Or mix it with apple cidar vinegar for some added AHA. It&#x27;s become part of my beauty regime and I really like using products that are natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that it would take away my acne, make my skin less oily, and fade away scars.  I&#x27;m currently using this product for the second time and though I haven&#x27;t seen 2/3 results yet (it&#x27;s not a miracle in a container), my skin does feel incredibly smooth and oil free after I use it! I can&#x27;t wait to see my face&#x27;s progress after further use.</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase after a review on YT and I&#x27;ve been obsessed with it ever since.  My skin feels amazing.  I&#x27;m glad I went ahead and purchased it.  Will keep replacing this product it&#x27;s now one of my holy grails.</li>
            <li> Ordered this thinking that it was for consumption. I had heard that clay was good for digestive system. Found out that it was for external use. Still, a good buy.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time a few days ago, and oh my goodness!!!.... It is amazing! really good product and awesome price too! makes your skin feel so smooth! and it also get&#x27;s rid of black heads and stuff.  love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great all around clay mask.&lt;br /&gt;You can use it alone or mix it with&lt;br /&gt;other ingredients. .</li>
            <li> A Tablespoon or two mixed with a few drops of peppermint and/or almond oil and a small amount of water, makes a great spa masque for less than a dollar each. Why spend $90.00 for a facial when you can do it yourself? Can use a variety of oils and/or mix with green or bentonite clay(also very economical) to achieve the perfect result for your type of skin. Add chamomile or finely ground oatmeal to reduce redness or discolorations (age/ acne). Leaves skin exfoliated, very clean (pores are unclogged) but yet not dry and reduces the appearance of fine lines. Look online at numerous websites for different masque recipes to find your ideal masque. A great product! Buy some and try it out, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I used it on my face, it didn&#x27;t pull as much as other clay masks, however I did like the smoothness of it. My sister used it and liked it as well.</li>
            <li> Good product. I received it on time. This product left my face feeling nice and soft. When mixing, it seems like you need more water at first but trust me, the increments are correct. If anything maybe half a spoon of water more. This mask goes on very smooth and even. I made way more than I needed. Definitely don&#x27;t leave it on longer than 15 minutes because it will hurt coming off if you let it dry too much.</li>
            <li> I really liked the Now Foods European Clay Powder (which I used with aloe gel, I thought it worked well and helped clear acne.5 stars :) Thus decided to give this one a try, it mixes well with water, I love that it&#x27;s gentle and washes off so easily (literally just wet your face and it melts off) BUT I don&#x27;t feel the pulsating effect like I did for the European Clay, so overall I feel it just doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this and the Aztec Clay mask for skin detoxing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten all of my family and girlfriends hooked on this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with water but sometimes throw in essential oils for an extra kick.&lt;br /&gt;It gets really tight as it starts drying and you feel your skin pulsing and tingling (some much needed circulation).&lt;br /&gt;Because its close to my skin tone when it dries I look really funky. Like I&#x27;m harboring a desert on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This keeps my oily skin in check, reduces the pore size, and gives me a glow.&lt;br /&gt;And i noticed its not as hard to wash off as the Aztec mask.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a bit of teatree oil and water and the mask feels amazing! Even my BF loves it.</li>
            <li> THis is the clay mask to get if you need one. Does a pulling out of all the grim and bacteria on your face. Will leave your skin red but refreshed. The redness goes away in 20 minutes. Just mix the powder with water, it mixes the easiest of all. Makes a great paste. I make a larger batch and then seal the leftover in a Tupperware. It will not dry out that way and I can just use it the next time. Washes off fairly well too. I recommend wetting the clay all around your face first, this will make the hard clay very pliable again. Then go back and wash off each little area. Apply moisture cream of choice.</li>
            <li> I use it for hair &amp; face masks. It&#x60;s a great natural product. The price is a bit expensive for the amount that you&#x60;re getting but it&#x60;s a good quality.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes and a totally different use for this product.  I bought capsules to ingest them as a anti-gas product.  I tried a few but didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  I would image the product works well for what it is intended - a face cleanser.</li>
            <li> Feels great, definitely makes my big ugly pores smaller.</li>
            <li> I use this to cleanse my hair and it&#x27;s amazing I just wish it came in a larger container!</li>
            <li> The instructions on ratio of water to clay powder seems too high (too watery) to be effective. I&#x27;ve learned it is best to add just enough so that it becomes a paste. The clay powder is extremely powdery and can be difficult to handle. I&#x27;m planning on transferring into a different container so it is easier to use and dispense.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a  few times but it does seem to help my larger pores and tighten my face in general. My only complaint is it is messy to put on. I had this clay powder all over the bathroom when I was finished. I also did experience some slight redness on the face after I used it as other reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I use it on my skin as a skin mask... it leaves my skin feeling clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for ways to combat my oily skin and large pores.  I&#x27;ve tried every clay mask there is and this stuff is so much better. I mix a small amount (about 2 teaspoon) with Shea Terra Pure Moroccan Rose Water until it is smooth.  This dries quickly and when you remove it, your skin will feel amazingly smooth and soft!  Pores look much smaller as well.  I do this once a week at night and in the morning my skin still has a nice glow.  I really love that this is an effective, inexpensive and all natural way to treat my skin.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t give me anything better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;my skin stays same whether I put it on or not.&lt;br /&gt;waste of money I think,.</li>
            <li> This clay works fine but I notice that during the winter time, my skin feels super dry after I use it. This is a product that will vary by person. My skin did get red with bumps after removal but that went away.</li>
            <li> I love NOW products, and I really don&#x27;t know why it took me this long to try this one. But what I do know is that I do not want to live without this product from now on. It is incredible!  I inherited my mother&#x27;s large pores, and I also have a lot of other skin issues due to fibromyalgia (excessive dryness, keratosis pilaris, loss of resiliency among others). I use a large variety of skin products, as my skin tends to be very moody due to the fibromyalgia. With all of them combined, I manage to get away with just barely tolerable skin. But using just this powder alone makes my skin unbelievably smoother, tighter, cleaner, and overall better. I mix it with warm water and apply to my face (sometimes neck, chest, and arms), and keep it on until it dries (15-20 minutes). Immediately after rinsing it off, my pores are much smaller, and my skin is tighter and smoother. This is absolutely a wonder product! I will be ordering it in bulk from now on!</li>
            <li> This stoped my cystic breakouts its amazing .wondering why its not priced higher but glad its not.! I will be buying more</li>
            <li> Purchased for my spa treatments....hope it does works on my clients!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews about this clay being a really good medium to increase tightness of your skin. Its been a week since I got the product and I&#x27;ve used it two times till now. I have brown skin and the clay doesn&#x27;t show too many negative effects on my skin (I read a lot of peoples&#x27; reviews saying their skin was red and blotchy for some time), but then it sure does brighten your skin for like maybe a couple of hours. Overall, I am happy with the clay, I use it along with a couple of drops of glycerin and rose water. Hopefully I&#x27;ll see some effects soon.&lt;br /&gt;Also for people looking to apply this on your hair, I have no idea how this clay works on hair, but then I do know of an alternate which is much cheaper and works well with hair. You can go to any Indian store and ask for Soapnut powder. Its an excellent conditioner and the only drawback would be the lack of fragrance in your hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, I really did ! I Unfortunately it did absolutely nothing to my skin, except dry it out. No improvements :(</li>
            <li> Used for making foundation and as a face mask</li>
            <li> If so, use this. I love it so much. Mix it with some apple cider vinegar and wait until it starts to fizz and froth. Then apply directly to your face, but make sure you slather it on real thick, and leave it on until it&#x27;s fully dry. You&#x27;ll start to notice it pulsates as it&#x27;s drying, but it&#x27;s a pleasant feeling. Really, really helps suck all the excess oil and goop out of pores. It&#x27;s like a detox for your skin! After you wash the mask over, make sure to moisturize ---maybe with coconut oil or emu oil. It&#x27;s best if used at night or on the weekend if you&#x27;re not planning on doing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep thinking that I&#x27;ll try to mixture some turmeric with it to see about the results but just haven&#x27;t gotten around to that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck everyone! Try this!</li>
            <li> I use this product about once a week and it really tightens up my pores. My face feels smooth, soft and oil free. Excellent product. Would purchase again.:)</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, I am going to say that this makes a HUGE mess when trying to remove as a face mask. I ruined a washcloth trying to get it off. However, that hasn&#x27;t stopped me from using it since it does make my skin much softer afterwards. I add a few drops of Moroccan argan oil when mixing to boost the hydration without any additional fragrance. I am very happy that it does not over dry my sensitive skin or turn it bright red like most beauty/ cosmetics/ ect. do. My recommendation is to wash the mask off in the shower instead of at the sink so the mess isn&#x27;t as big a deal and to add an oil. Great price for a product where a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use as much as planned , but used it in a past and liked it . Can be very useful , just need to find and time and get more organized&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff, cheap and lasts forever! People pay so much for a tube of mask that drys out after time. and also has all sorts of preservatives, I&#x27;d say make your own! And add essential oils that combat what you need targeted like acne or anti aging. Makes your pores small too!</li>
            <li> Product arrived with no spillage, appears to be a nice high quality.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive this clay kind of burns and is itchy. I really don&#x27;t see a big difference in this clay used by it self. I mixed it with French Green Clay to see a big difference in the reaction in my skin. It is still itchy but not as bad. I gave it 5 stars for the fact it works well on my teenage son who has very bad acne.</li>
            <li> I used it as a facial to tighten pores and it also treated a blackhead that i had for a very long time. I believed that this bh was a mole but after the facial, I noticed after I accidently squeezed it that it was filled with mucus and it has disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aztec healing clay for about a year and really liked the results, so I thought I would give the Red Clay Powder a shot, and perhaps end up alternating the two. I applied the mask, and left it on for fifteen minutes. After washing it off, I noticed it really dried my face, and I will mention that I do not have sensitive skin. This led to a reduction of time the second time I used it, but I experienced the same dryness. The third time wasn&#x27;t a charm. It caused me to breakout, when I am not prone to acne. Needless to say, I threw the remaining powder away.</li>
            <li> I did not notice a big change.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a Facial Masks. and it was terrible. it made my skin very dry. as well as break out. it is also very messy to make and gets everywhere. I have used other clay&#x27;s before and have to say this is my least favorite so far i strongly advise not buying for this reason, did not try on hair..</li>
            <li> Great all natural product</li>
            <li> I really like this clay. It works better than the green clay for bringing life back into my face after a good shower.</li>
            <li> My skin loves it. I&#x27;m recommending it to a friend with troubled skin</li>
            <li> You should try this product because it works great! After the first use it noticeably shrunk my pores and left my skin soft, it did not dry me out completely either. I have normal to oily skin. I was concerned with staining of my skin but that did not happen at all. Also I did not experience any tingling ect. like I read on one review. It&#x27;s 100% natural clay with no other ingredients which I love. Happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this face clay. It&#x27;s inexpensive and easy to use. I have sensitive skin and so far I have no reactions to this product. It leaves my skin feeling tighter and brighter. It&#x27;s best to have a dedicated face towel to wash the clay off, however, because the red color does stain clothes and fabric.</li>
            <li> Whaoo ! I don&#x27;t write reviews but I will start with this one ! Great mask for sensitive skin which by the way I have. Perfect for blackheads cause it draws it out to the surface. And it made my skin glow and close all my big pores. Love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Clean and refreshed after applying. I follow up with a serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Needed this for making Black Pine Tar Salve. The clay worked well for the intended use. Nice, fine grind &amp; mixed well during the process. Healing qualities have yet to be seen.</li>
            <li> I use this clay to gives self facials and you can definitely see the difference in my skin tone n texture but r a lot smoother. I love love my skin now. You should definitely try this as a facial mask u won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> I was just curious about this red clay and, I never, ever thought, that one day I will be reviewing a mud.&lt;br /&gt;I had masks before at local barber shop and wanted to try some minerals. I am a male past middle age, between olive and wheat complexion. I have tiny wrinkles under my eyes and around my upper lip and lower part of my neck, which are normal signs of aging. My pores used to look like the skin of an orange, shiny and oily for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I must tell you this first: Do not apply this mask too thick. I will tell you later, why? 1 tbsp for face and neck is plenty. Adding spring  water, while stirring, mixed, until it is a runny hand lotion. I started smearing it starting from my forehead, around eyes, (not too close to the eyes), cheeks, chin and neck. After finishing putting the mask on, I figured, I lay down for 15-20 minutes, like the label says (note. Label does not say to lay down). I was very relaxed. Within a minute pulsations started around my cheeks, parallel, my left and right side pulsating at the same time with the same tempo of my heart. This clay maybe accelerating circulation. My face feeling like someone is pulling it back, I think, it is normal... the mud is drying. Closed my eyes and gave all my attention to these tiny pulses moving around my cheeks. Then tiny stings began below my cheeks, near the base of my nose. This stings were like a low voltage current penetrating my skin, and moving around very fast, pulses much finer than the ones around my cheeks. I am amazed that a mud is doing this... I got 10 more minutes, When I move around I don&#x27;t feel anything on my face other then pulling. As soon as I lay down and relax, pulsing and stinging comes right back. Can I wait 10 more minutes?&lt;br /&gt;My face feels hot suddenly, for 10 seconds. Stings are now around my upper lip, It feels like running a micro needle roller there. There is a slight burn at the contour of my upper lip. I think: this is working! I have 5 more minutes, I feel my lowereyelids being pulled down and I can&#x27;t wait to see what this stuff did to me? Pulsating still continues on my cheeks at the same tempo. I get up to wash my face, and look in the mirror. I see my cheeks are still wet. I put way to much there and that explains why this mud was so active there. I wash my face and try not to splatter the red stuff allover the place. Although it washes right off and leaves no stains.&lt;br /&gt;Results: I am blushing like I just came out of sauna. My cheeks so red and  glowing. Looking closer I notice my pores are flat, pumped out and looks like irritated. My skin feels firm, tight and thirsty. I  quickly apply my H2O Night Oasis Oxygenating Energizing Serum. This is the only product I&#x27;ve been using the last 10 days or so. It is also great after shaving. I am just hoping that the redness will go away. I go to sleep and next morning, my cheeks are pink. Tiny wrinkles under my eyes are stretched and gone. Above my lips, tiny wrinkles, they&#x27;re still there but not so visible as before. Looks like a  little swollen. No more orange peel skin. I call my sister-in-law to see the difference, if she notices anything. Yes, she says, confirmed. She wants me to order one for her immediately. I am so glad, and happy I&#x27;ve tried this miraculous product. Next time I am going to roll in it. In the tub of course. I should have taken before and after photos. But I will add them next time. Although I want to keep my skin in this condition forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, comment on this and let me know about your experiences here. This is not the end of this review. It will continue...</li>
            <li> After using this I got a rash on my neck and face and was rushed to the ER and prescribed medication to fix it and it kept coming back... total cost: $350. DEFINITELY not for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Great for making pores smaller, controlling acne. I mix my with red clover tea and a splash of lemon juice. It really does the trick on my stubborn skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 5 times already and I can see the effect on my large pores, it&#x27;s shrinking them gradually.</li>
            <li> Works great with beauty products and masks. I used this to make a clay soap bar.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY HAIR BUT ONCE I RECEIVED IT, I ALSO USED IT ON MY FACE. THIS CLAY HAS MANY BENEFITS, U CAN SMELL &amp; FELL THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty dying. It sometimes can sting your face - I dont know what that means (drawing out impurities, or shrinking pores, etc) but I do know when I remove it, my skin is smoother and my pores do seem smaller with less black heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m lazy, I use it with water. If I got time, I use it with honey (keeps your face moisturized), cinnamon, and tumeric. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it a lot. I use it once every week or every other week.</li>
            <li> As far as detoxing/cleaning out pores, I&#x27;ve used better masks.  However, this one doesn&#x27;t dry me out or make my skin too tight - while drying or after removing.  I also really enjoy mixing it up - I can control the consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main draw back with this is that I&#x27;ve had a strong reaction to it twice out of around six uses.  My skin got really red and blotchy.  It goes away after a few hours.  Sounds weird that I&#x27;ve kept using it, but I&#x27;ll explain:  It happened the first time I used it, and I thought maybe it reacted with something I already had on my face.  So I did a test spot the next time and had no reaction for the next few uses.  However, last time I used it, I had the reaction again.  Could be anything - something on my face, not mixing right, etc., but its not worth it to figure it out since the results are pretty mediocre.</li>
