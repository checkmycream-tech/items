            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the mark up items.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are not good doesn&#x27;t even shaved</li>
            <li> the description is wrong though, it comes with the Razor and 16 Cartidges not 15, and also the razor is loaded with one</li>

            <li> I use this kind of razor for years. I use it under the shower and so the cartridges last for 5, 6 times, or more. Since I do not need to shave every day, 16 razor blades will, maybe, outlive me.</li>
            <li> Great razors shave very close and no razor burn&#x27;</li>

            <li> you can buy same pack at sams for $28. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the mark up items. good luck</li>
            <li> It is simply fantastic, and that is said by  peron that shaves twice a day. If you allow the crn: It is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> Great blades but here is the kicker.  I just bought them at sams club for 29.00</li>
            <li> The cartridges are not good doesn&#x27;t even shaved</li>
            <li> Great set of cartridges with a razor for a great price!</li>
