            <li>It isn&#x27;t the best tasting</li>
            <li>Very good Kava Kava for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used Kave before, this was a great place to start.</li>

            <li>I think kava is great for anxiety, stress, depression, attention problems.</li>
            <li>This is a great drink for calming and relaxing esp.</li>
            <li>Good stuff  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one good experience from this vendor before, but receiving this brown, dirt-like substance (kava cut with something else?)</li>
            <li>good quality</li>
            <li>this is the good stuff.</li>
            <li>I would too.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Feels so good.</li>
            <li>So good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added a teaspoon of vegetable oil  to warm water instead, and this seems to help (except for the taste and texture).</li>
            <li>Good kava has a nice, earthy flavor -- some people don&#x27;t like it, but I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the taste.</li>
            <li>I give it five stars because it is highly effective.</li>
            <li>Many directions say to mix it in warm water.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time to used cava root, and it works great,  I did follows some review direcctions about take it  with warm milk</li>
            <li>Just a great product, came in time, right weight.</li>
            <li>ive gotten it several times before and its great kava and their mitragyina speciosa samples ive tried are great too.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly and is a good product</li>
            <li>Finely ground powder and effective.</li>
            <li>, maybe you can get creative and make a smoothie.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Kava, and this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and works great.</li>
            <li>Not the best tasting thing in the world, but definitely has some tranquilizing effects.</li>
            <li>This is a decently potent kava, but the flavor is rather off-putting.</li>
            <li>but i think its a lie pharmaceutical companies just made that up so that we can go to them for meds that will give us cancer, and do even more damage to our bodies.</li>
            <li>The kratom was top notch</li>
            <li>best i have had yet out of five different kinds</li>
            <li>Amazing I am thrilled with this and thanks again!</li>
            <li>Good product, thanks!</li>
            <li>THE IS A GREAT NATURAL PRODUCT ON THE MARKET TODAY.</li>
            <li>This powder has a strong earthy smell and does cause numbing of the mouth (as an indicator of potency).</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, makes excellent calming Tea after a hard days work !&lt;</li>
            <li>Nothing but good things to say got my order early and a free sample of kratom which was potent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it often because of Kava&#x27;s possible side effects on the liver, but otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>Great for anxiety and low mood.</li>
            <li>Kava is by far the most effective that I have found, promoting a relaxed, euphoric and warming experience.</li>
            <li>I was very relaxed and able to sleep much better.</li>
            <li>I have a new favorite herb!</li>
            <li>At first it made me more talkative and then chilled me out for about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was supposed to use a strainer and put it in hot water, drink it as is, put it something else, etc.</li>
            <li>From my limited experience with Kava Kava, I will say that I experienced the full medicinal effects of the Kava with this company&#x27;s powder.</li>
            <li>I know that if u r looking into this product, u r searching for something cool to boost your brain or something...</li>
            <li>The reviews I read were true.</li>
            <li>Love it grate product fast delivery will defiantly order aging</li>
            <li>this stuff willl give you a mild relaxing buzz.</li>
            <li>so my excitement quickly turned to suspicion and dissatisfaction.</li>
            <li>I think this vendor is trust worthy and selling quality kava (smells like tastes like) but the potency just isn&#x27;t there for me.</li>
            <li>I just mixed it with warm milk, and drinking it was a chore.  </li>
            <li>I mixed it with warm not too hot almond milk cinnamon to kill the taste of the kava and some sugar not bad.</li>
            <li>I guess it might good for other folks, but every time I tried it my stomach would chirn for hours afterward.  </li>
            <li>, pretty much decided its not for me, but for those who enjoy it</li>
            <li>Especially since I love drinking kava at the kava bar.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to drink!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately for me, it dissolves best in milk (can&#x27;t digest milk).</li>
            <li>Only regret is not buying more.</li>
            <li>Definitely has the tongue numbing effect apparently indicative of good Kava extract.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this 5 stars because the package delivered before the estimated time, and it came as shown, and also it came with a&lt;br /&gt;sample of Blue Lotus 50x extract, thanks for the bonus :)</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for powder that is strong enough.</li>
            <li>If you can digest large amounts of milk, this may be for you.</li>
            <li>Definitely will not be my last thats for sure!</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that it would be something that would help my symptoms</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t help much with my pain (torn rotator cuff).  </li>
            <li>But this is the real thing</li>
            <li>stuff is the real mccoy.  </li>
            <li>but i dont think it is recommended to drink as much as i did as fast.</li>
            <li>it was to much cocoa</li>
            <li>Slept really well the night after adding oil.</li>
            <li>Made me sleepy within minuets, and I slept all night, straight through.</li>
            <li>Actually whole body.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time (thanks amazon prime).&lt;br /&gt;Opened</li>
            <li>Not everybody knows much about Kava root powder and was hoping it would have come with directions.</li>
            <li>I made 1 pitcher with the whole ounce.</li>
            <li>Over gram weight, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of muscle spasms from hard labor all my life , but I was very happy with the results after I managed to sip some of this down.</li>
            <li>not as potent as other brands, but decent for the price</li>
            <li>I struggle with a social anxiety disorder that has lead me to experiment with many different substances to help cope.</li>
            <li>it for sure is kava, however it wasn&#x27;t nearly as potent as i had hoped which was a major disappointment but if the whole ounce us taken in one sitting then one should feel a light intoxication.</li>
            <li>smoothie with this may make it palatable, but remember, it has to be 75 degrees or warmer (but not boiling) to work most effectively, so don&#x27;t throw in frozen fruit or ice cold yogurt or milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend a smaller dose in a tea :)</li>
            <li>The ancient Polynesians used this in ceremonies and parties to get high from.  </li>
            <li>This is high quality herb.</li>
            <li>and i can see myself having to buy a 40$ worth to last me a month that can get costly.</li>
            <li>Strong stuff, when used occasionally I always wake up the next day feeling better physically and mentally.</li>
            <li>However, the packaging was very professional</li>
            <li>And ounce of Kava does not go a long way, but the seller didn&#x27;t charge much and its the real deal.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more strength as I had to use a lot of the product to achieve the desired result but overall, it worked.  </li>
            <li>This kava is nicely ground and very dark, but it has an extremely bitter taste to it that I didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>It makes great grog, but if you do not know how bad it tastes, you are in for a real treat.  </li>
            <li>Without fat, it isn&#x27;t anywhere near as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been scrambling to find things to eliminate my work stress related isolation and anxiety and this really does the trick.</li>
            <li>This is the first time i tried real Kava i have purchased the supplements before( waste of money)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product one star because of the company and partly Amazon for not making the directions clear on how to actually consume the product.</li>
            <li>For anyone with taste concerns, I use dark hot chocolate mix with mine.</li>
            <li>But drinks made with it are pretty weak, they made me a bit happier, but it was pretty unimpressive.</li>
            <li>tastes like total crap as all kava does, my package also came with a free sample of blue lotus extract which was a nice suprise.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural things instead of Rx meds any day, the only real problem is choking this down.</li>
            <li>The kava came a long with some super green Malaysian kratom.</li>
            <li>By far the darkest, least effective kava product I&#x27;ve ever tried (including tinctures and capsules, which usually have minimal effects).</li>

            <li> Other than NO samples I like it- SO FAR.</li>
            <li> High dose made me feel a little loopy</li>
            <li> It was a small quantity for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> this stuff did kinda make me feel strange the next day</li>
            <li> this one is actually potent my tongue went numb the moment i tasted it.</li>
            <li> I spent extra for 2 day shipping-</li>
            <li> Figured since I spent extra</li>
            <li> and I have no problem reccomending them as long as you dont need your package ASAP</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the effects of this product and won&#x27;t be purchasing again, I felt angry and irritated, not calm what so ever.</li>
            <li> but does what is expected.</li>
            <li> that this is enough to make one round of grog.  </li>
            <li> is there&#x27;s not much in it</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED 2OZ TO MIX OR BLEND WITH OTHER KAVE ADS</li>
            <li> not as strong as one would like it to be, but doesnt taste bad, rather a woodsy taste.</li>
            <li> Admittingly I had a hard time getting this down, bitter does not describe it at all .lol.</li>
            <li> The Kava Kava powder came in a sketchy zip-lock baggie and was not very potent.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see how I can choke it down!</li>
            <li> and  it tastes bad, but it worked for me and my insomnia, and I wake up fresh at morning.</li>
            <li> Honestly...don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money</li>
            <li> In the end it ended up getting thrown out and a waste of money, the product should come with directions or Amazon should have them listed.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not exactly sure how someone who has never used this would know what to do with it.</li>
            <li> Or a small dose</li>
            <li> Not sure of the dosage.</li>
            <li> Sip slowly, expect some nausea, ginger root</li>
            <li> a teaspoon seems very small.</li>
            <li> This Kava is not good quality.</li>
            <li> Not really a taste and does make your mouth numb.</li>
            <li> just not great on solving problems</li>
            <li> but it is a five dollar product that i&#x27;m tired of chasing so</li>
            <li> but when mixed with kava made me very sick.</li>
            <li> wtf???</li>
            <li> First off, the taste, it&#x27;s literally the worst thing I have tasted in my life, and I have tasted some nasty things.&lt;br /&gt;Kava</li>
            <li> Btw, this stinks like crazy.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bad taste based on the reviews</li>
            <li> I am not going to take any stars off just because it tastes so bad, because Kava does taste bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just tastes bad, it will always taste bad no matter who you buy it</li>
            <li> The price is not so bad...</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible , which was expected, but had none of the effects that that it was suppose to have so all I feel it is, is terrible tasting tea.</li>
            <li> Horrible taste ....</li>
            <li> Yes, the taste is awful, the product however is quite alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I go to a Kava bar here in San Diego and thought I would buy this to have the same experience from drinking kava- but at home. I tried several preparation methods but felt basically nothing at all. Bummer! Especially since I love drinking kava at the kava bar.</li>
            <li> it for sure is kava, however it wasn&#x27;t nearly as potent as i had hoped which was a major disappointment but if the whole ounce us taken in one sitting then one should feel a light intoxication.</li>
            <li> Strong stuff, when used occasionally I always wake up the next day feeling better physically and mentally.</li>
            <li> Not for human consumption</li>
            <li> Horrible taste ....but does what is expected.</li>
            <li> wtf??? I was expecting a bad taste based on the reviews but this is something that should be put on fear factor!!! It comes with no dosage instructions what so ever so I&#x27;m not exactly sure how someone who has never used this would know what to do with it. I mixed 4 tsp with milk and thought this looks gross but &amp;#34;bottoms up&amp;#34; on my second drink I immediately spun around to the sink and tossed my cookies. The web sight mentioned straining it? is this something you have to do so it isn&#x27;t so chunky? I was really hoping that it would be something that would help my symptoms but I don&#x27;t see how I can choke it down! any suggestions?</li>
            <li> Good stuff  Recommend ONE beer before hand. Or a small dose</li>
            <li> Very good Kava Kava for the money.</li>
            <li> I guess it might good for other folks, but every time I tried it my stomach would chirn for hours afterward.  It also didn&#x27;t help much with my pain (torn rotator cuff).  I&#x27;ll stick with my red vein cratin.</li>
            <li> Good product, thanks!</li>
            <li> Not sure of the dosage. 1/8th a teaspoon seems very small. No effect.</li>
            <li> This Kava is not good quality. By far the darkest, least effective kava product I&#x27;ve ever tried (including tinctures and capsules, which usually have minimal effects). I&#x27;ve had one good experience from this vendor before, but receiving this brown, dirt-like substance (kava cut with something else?) outshines that and then some.</li>
            <li> It makes great grog, but if you do not know how bad it tastes, you are in for a real treat.  It is NASTY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need fat anyway to absorb the kavalactones.  Many directions say to mix it in warm water.  DO NOT DO IT.  Without fat, it isn&#x27;t anywhere near as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, maybe you can get creative and make a smoothie.  I just mixed it with warm milk, and drinking it was a chore.  But this is the real thing and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is enough to make one round of grog.  You take 3-4 cups every hour to two hours.  Do not overheat the milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A smoothie with this may make it palatable, but remember, it has to be 75 degrees or warmer (but not boiling) to work most effectively, so don&#x27;t throw in frozen fruit or ice cold yogurt or milk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is the real mccoy.  I am not going to take any stars off just because it tastes so bad, because Kava does taste bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And unlike the nutty supplements, this actually works.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and is a good product</li>
            <li> Amazing I am thrilled with this and thanks again!</li>
            <li> I struggle with a social anxiety disorder that has lead me to experiment with many different substances to help cope. Kava is by far the most effective that I have found, promoting a relaxed, euphoric and warming experience. Yes, the taste is awful, the product however is quite alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blend a cup or two of milk and 3-4 tbls of powder for 10 minutes and it&#x27;s ready to drink! Sip slowly, expect some nausea, ginger root helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> not as potent as other brands, but decent for the price</li>
            <li> BS. I know that if u r looking into this product, u r searching for something cool to boost your brain or something...but this is just BS. Honestly...don&#x27;t waste your time and money. Btw, this stinks like crazy.</li>
            <li> First off, the taste, it&#x27;s literally the worst thing I have tasted in my life, and I have tasted some nasty things.&lt;br /&gt;Kava just tastes bad, it will always taste bad no matter who you buy it from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the effects are mellow and calming once you get the taste out of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this 5 stars because the package delivered before the estimated time, and it came as shown, and also it came with a&lt;br /&gt;sample of Blue Lotus 50x extract, thanks for the bonus :)</li>
            <li> this stuff willl give you a mild relaxing buzz. also i chased with pineapple which i think it traditional.  this stuff did kinda make me feel strange the next day but i dont think it is recommended to drink as much as i did as fast. or the way i did. good quality</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more strength as I had to use a lot of the product to achieve the desired result but overall, it worked.  The price is not so bad...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the effects of this product and won&#x27;t be purchasing again, I felt angry and irritated, not calm what so ever. However, the packaging was very professional and I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;sketched out&amp;#34; feeling you might get if it arrived in just a plastic baggy.</li>
            <li> All I had hoped for. Finely ground powder and effective. Perfect in tea or milk! I&#x27;ve been looking for powder that is strong enough. This is it.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot to make me relax.  This stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> still havent gotten it, and its been over a month.  ive gotten it several times before and its great kava and their mitragyina speciosa samples ive tried are great too.  just not great on solving problems but it is a five dollar product that i&#x27;m tired of chasing so im writing this five dollar review</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible , which was expected, but had none of the effects that that it was suppose to have so all I feel it is, is terrible tasting tea.</li>
            <li> The Kava Kava powder came in a sketchy zip-lock baggie and was not very potent. I feel like I wasted my money and I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> It was my first time to used cava root, and it works great,  I did follows some review direcctions about take it  with warm milk and I did added  a spoon of cocoa, and 3 tbsp of sugar. Warning-- it was to much cocoa and  it tastes bad, but it worked for me and my insomnia, and I wake up fresh at morning.</li>
            <li> I had never had kava before and i just figured i would order the 1oz of it just to try it, pretty much decided its not for me, but for those who enjoy it this is the good stuff. tastes like total crap as all kava does, my package also came with a free sample of blue lotus extract which was a nice suprise. overall this is quality kava and i would recommend it</li>
            <li> Just a great product, came in time, right weight. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet but I heard it tastes like s***.</li>
            <li> I keep falling asleep.../snnnnn</li>
            <li> I have a new favorite herb! This stuff is fantastic! This is my first experience with Kava, and this stuff is amazing! Definitely will not be my last thats for sure!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and works great.</li>
            <li> Nothing but good things to say got my order early and a free sample of kratom which was potent.</li>
            <li> This powder has a strong earthy smell and does cause numbing of the mouth (as an indicator of potency). Unfortunately for me, it dissolves best in milk (can&#x27;t digest milk). I&#x27;ve added a teaspoon of vegetable oil  to warm water instead, and this seems to help (except for the taste and texture). Slept really well the night after adding oil. If you can digest large amounts of milk, this may be for you. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend adding the oil unless you are not concerned about adding fat and cholesterol to your diet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Kave before, this was a great place to start. It was a small quantity for a reasonable price. Mine was delivered in just about a weeks time. Made me sleepy within minuets, and I slept all night, straight through. Great product!</li>
            <li> I spent extra for 2 day shipping- almost all of the reviews says they had samples inside. Figured since I spent extra I would too.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good. Not really a taste and does make your mouth numb. Actually whole body. I like it so far. I mixed it in milk inside my blender bottle. Other than NO samples I like it- SO FAR.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, makes excellent calming Tea after a hard days work !&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 5</li>
            <li> Arrived on time (thanks amazon prime).&lt;br /&gt;Opened the box and saw something that looked &#x27;sketchy&#x27;. It didn&#x27;t have any product labels or directions on it so my excitement quickly turned to suspicion and dissatisfaction. Tried it once, I think it worked.</li>
            <li> It has helped a lot. It arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is stuff is great. The ancient Polynesians used this in ceremonies and parties to get high from.  If you take allot of it man it will get you so stoned. It numbs your entire mouth. Feels so good. I&#x27;ve been scrambling to find things to eliminate my work stress related isolation and anxiety and this really does the trick. So good.</li>
            <li> Only regret is not buying more. For anyone with taste concerns, I use dark hot chocolate mix with mine.</li>
            <li> not as strong as one would like it to be, but doesnt taste bad, rather a woodsy taste.</li>
            <li> Kava appears to be excellent quality. Definitely has the tongue numbing effect apparently indicative of good Kava extract. I don&#x27;t use it often because of Kava&#x27;s possible side effects on the liver, but otherwise great product. Mixed with some water and oil and pineapple. Not the best tasting thing in the world, but definitely has some tranquilizing effects.</li>
            <li> I made a tea out of this product which arrived within 3 days of ordering. The reviews I read were true. At first it made me more talkative and then chilled me out for about 2 hours. Great for anxiety and low mood. High dose made me feel a little loopy but that was short lived for about 30 minutes. I definitely recommend a smaller dose in a tea :)</li>
            <li> This is a decently potent kava, but the flavor is rather off-putting. Good kava has a nice, earthy flavor -- some people don&#x27;t like it, but I&#x27;ve always enjoyed the taste. This kava is nicely ground and very dark, but it has an extremely bitter taste to it that I didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> From my limited experience with Kava Kava, I will say that I experienced the full medicinal effects of the Kava with this company&#x27;s powder. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into Kava and want to buy your stuff from Amazon, I recommend this seller. From all the ones I&#x27;ve tried this is the best. And ounce of Kava does not go a long way, but the seller didn&#x27;t charge much and its the real deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product one star because of the company and partly Amazon for not making the directions clear on how to actually consume the product. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was supposed to use a strainer and put it in hot water, drink it as is, put it something else, etc. In the end it ended up getting thrown out and a waste of money, the product should come with directions or Amazon should have them listed. Not everybody knows much about Kava root powder and was hoping it would have come with directions.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i tried real Kava i have purchased the supplements before( waste of money) this one is actually potent my tongue went numb the moment i tasted it. I mixed it with warm not too hot almond milk cinnamon to kill the taste of the kava and some sugar not bad. the only problem  i have with it is there&#x27;s not much in it and i can see myself having to buy a 40$ worth to last me a month that can get costly. I think kava is great for anxiety, stress, depression, attention problems. I heard that kava damages the liver over time but i think its a lie pharmaceutical companies just made that up so that we can go to them for meds that will give us cancer, and do even more damage to our bodies.</li>
            <li> Love it grate product fast delivery will defiantly order aging</li>
            <li> The kava came a long with some super green Malaysian kratom. The kratom was top notch but when mixed with kava made me very sick. I made 1 pitcher with the whole ounce. My friend drank 2 cups and felt nothing. I think this vendor is trust worthy and selling quality kava (smells like tastes like) but the potency just isn&#x27;t there for me. I did used to take kava pills regularly. This might build a tolerance.</li>
            <li> I thought it was alright (slight high) when i was chewing it. But drinks made with it are pretty weak, they made me a bit happier, but it was pretty unimpressive.</li>
            <li> This is a great drink for calming and relaxing esp. before bed. It isn&#x27;t the best tasting but, all tatses the same</li>
            <li> I dont like how it takes them 4-5 days to process the shipping, and USPS missent the package but I did learn that wasnt the seller&#x27;s fault. All in all I like the purchase and I have no problem reccomending them as long as you dont need your package ASAP</li>
            <li> Admittingly I had a hard time getting this down, bitter does not describe it at all .lol. I have a lot of muscle spasms from hard labor all my life , but I was very happy with the results after I managed to sip some of this down. I was very relaxed and able to sleep much better. I prefer natural things instead of Rx meds any day, the only real problem is choking this down. I give it five stars because it is highly effective.</li>
            <li> This is high quality herb. Over gram weight, and fast shipping. Will shop again. A seller</li>
            <li> best i have had yet out of five different kinds</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED 2OZ TO MIX OR BLEND WITH OTHER KAVE ADS SOME KICK TO IT. THE IS A GREAT NATURAL PRODUCT ON THE MARKET TODAY.</li>
