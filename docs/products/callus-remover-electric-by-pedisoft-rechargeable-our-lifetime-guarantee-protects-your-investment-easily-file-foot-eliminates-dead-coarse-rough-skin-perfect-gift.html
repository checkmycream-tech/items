            <li>and so glad I ordered.</li>
            <li>also love that this is rechargeable because I never seem to have any batteries</li>
            <li>Sure beats the Dremmel tool with sandpaper that I&#x27;ve been using for years.</li>
            <li>So smooth!</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love mine and wish I could have found it sooner.</li>
            <li>Oh how I love this.</li>
            <li>well satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Skin is safe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it</li>
            <li>This is such an awesome tool!!!</li>
            <li>I was able to get the cream to soak in and my feet stay softer longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with product and service.</li>
            <li>This keep my feet looking smooth!</li>
            <li>Many operate on replaceable batteries, which I did not want to deal with.</li>
            <li>and it really helps to keep my feet looking great between pedicures.</li>
            <li>I bought it mostly because of great reviews on Amazon, however product didn&#x27;t live up to the fame.</li>
            <li>So far super happy!!</li>
            <li>Does the job and my foot feels more smooth :)</li>
            <li>This is very easy to clean and change rollers.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, I put some really rich moisturizing lotion on them and put some pedicure socks on and let my feet &#x27;marinate&#x27; for a couple of hours while I watched my favorite shows.</li>
            <li>You could easily see that this is a product that is going to work miracles.</li>
            <li>you want to make sure that your feet are clean.</li>
            <li>easy to use.  </li>
            <li>She is a beauty product fanatic so if she says a product is great, it must be REALLY great.</li>
            <li>I just need to see how easy for replacement files.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is strong and removes Callouses like a pro.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>My feet look and feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>We no longer have to pay a fortune to get her feet Smooth and well-maintained.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and lightweight.</li>
            <li>It was easy and quick to use, came charged and worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a powerful motor on it, and it will be thoroughly tested by her feet!</li>
            <li>so I was pretty pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great after a pedicure just to smooth off all the rough patches that were missed or as maintenance between pedicures.</li>
            <li>A brush is included to clean the head after usage.</li>
            <li>My feet feel much smoother now and I am happy I can use it as frequently as needed.</li>
            <li>Everything came with the callus remover including changing head &amp; brush to clean it off.  </li>
            <li>Works great, though I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s exactly the same thing as the CareMe product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get ready for sandal season quickly and easily with this PediSoft machine!  </li>
            <li>I love mine so much, I got one for my daughter.</li>
            <li>He says that this is helping tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, works great on tough cracked heels</li>
            <li>I rarely attend my feet</li>
            <li>So far, the quality is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>great device - first time I&#x27;ve been able to get rid of the hard, cracked calluses on my feet in years!  </li>
            <li>I have tried all kind of other &amp;#34;foot smoothing devices&amp;#34;, including manual &#x27;files&#x27; and the ped egg etc, which weren&#x27;t really cheap.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, worked amazingly fast and left my skin feeling smooth and not rough which I experienced with a different callous remover.  </li>
            <li>I used it right out the box.</li>
            <li>The speed is just right.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this, for the price of a professional pedicure you can do your own whenever you want to!</li>
            <li>Make sure that you don&#x27;t use it in the shower or bath and don&#x27;t hold on the skin in one spot for more than a few seconds or you get a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>If you get that rough, callused skin on your heels, this is the most fantastic thing you will ever use.</li>
            <li>but smooth is better than rough.</li>
            <li>But it works very very well.</li>
            <li>Took the heel calluses down to smooth skin easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too !</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to rush in the shower and try to get everything done before the hot water runs out.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used an electric callus remover.</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>Not enough power, it needs more speed.</li>
            <li>This effectively removes calluses and smooths rough feet.</li>
            <li>Now that we are full on in sandal season I am relieved to have something to soften my heels and keep them soft in between pedicures.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>If you apply too much pressure, it automatically stops spinning so you don&#x27;t accidentally hurt yourself .To</li>
            <li>With that said, this is so much easier  and faster than using a pumice stone..</li>
            <li>To me it is very necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
            <li>and my feet were much softer.</li>
            <li>I really like the plug in option, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries.</li>
            <li>We have the battery version and it doesn&#x27;t work as well, using tons of batteries and doesn&#x27;t have as much power.</li>
            <li>The motor is quiet and the unit fits comfortably in your hand.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Also, PediSoft delivered it right on time and was packaged professionally.</li>
            <li>This little device works wonders on removing calluses, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>My initial charge lasted for weeks of twice-a-week use, and though I purchased replacement heads, I haven&#x27;t worn out the original yet.  </li>
            <li>Well I was really excited about electrical pedicure, with no need to go through regular pedicure.</li>
            <li>I received another brand of callus remover for gift,  it was battery operated, and took more time to remove the callus,  However, the pedi soft is powerful,  took less time to remove the callus...</li>
            <li>Feels great on the feet - not too harsh or rough.  </li>
            <li>I does have safety features build in, just use steady pressure and it will do</li>
            <li>BUT afterward, my feet were very soft and were quite accepting of the foot cream!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as well as buying from this seller.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This thing works great on summer, tired, cracked flip flop wearing man feet!</li>
            <li>The cord is long enough to even do it in your favorite chair where you&#x27;re not leaning over hurting yourself.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida &amp; wear flip flops or sandals 11 months of the year.</li>
            <li>Love this little Pedicure machine!  </li>
            <li>I have diabetic nerve pain in my feet so they are VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I am an avid pumice stone user in the shower and get regular pedicures</li>
            <li>I used to look forward to pedicures just for the way my feet were actually soft for a change, and now I don&#x27;t need to get them because I can do this myself at home, whenever I want!  </li>
            <li>I actually bought this for my wife, and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>This product works well to smooth down calluses.</li>
            <li>Make sure you put a towel down or use over a trashcan as there will be lots of white residue coming off.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective it is at removing dry dead skin and calluses.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>but when i do I use a pumice stone and scrub and scrub until my feet feel soft .In</li>
            <li>and i wish i could have a faster way to  get soft feet and this callus remover does that.</li>
            <li>Gently rotate back and forth or side to side on the area you want for 2-3 seconds.</li>
            <li>I plugged it in and it was ready to go after waiting only 10 minutes to charge.</li>
            <li>I have never had soft feet</li>
            <li>Let me start off saying I was skeptical that this callus remover would do a good job.</li>
            <li>It works quickly and you can use it daily to keep that dry skin at bay.</li>
            <li>Snapping off the head to clean is a breeze, and appreciate the little brush you get to clean out the dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I wanted one that was rechargeable because the battery operated ones seemed less powerful according to the reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had any problems with sore feet after use, but I&#x27;m careful not to do too much at once.</li>
            <li>If held in one spot to long it will get that spot hot but just go back to it later.</li>
            <li>The callus remover is not rough on my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have really cracked and dry feet, you might have to use this daily until you get the desired results.</li>
            <li>So when I see these things on TV and the dry skin falling like snow, I get really freaked out because it looks so gross.  </li>
            <li>Her and my daughter do pedicures for each other and this just makes it that much easier.</li>
            <li>The meds dry my skin out and no matter how many pedicures I get that still somehow seems to be a little rough.</li>
            <li>only suggestions is to make sure you don&#x27;t press too hard or stay in the same place too long, it could take some skin off.</li>
            <li>LIGHT touch is the answer - may take a couple of days to get all the rough stuff off, but don&#x27;t need to press hard.  </li>

            <li> and it really helps to keep my feet looking great between pedicures.</li>
            <li> I bought it mostly because of great reviews on Amazon, however product didn&#x27;t live up to the fame.</li>
            <li> So far super happy!!</li>
            <li> Does the job and my foot feels more smooth :)</li>
            <li> This is very easy to clean and change rollers.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, I put some really rich moisturizing lotion on them and put some pedicure socks on and let my feet &#x27;marinate&#x27; for a couple of hours while I watched my favorite shows.</li>
            <li> You could easily see that this is a product that is going to work miracles.</li>
            <li> you want to make sure that your feet are clean.</li>
            <li> easy to use.  </li>
            <li> She is a beauty product fanatic so if she says a product is great, it must be REALLY great.</li>
            <li> I just need to see how easy for replacement files.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is strong and removes Callouses like a pro.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> My feet look and feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> We no longer have to pay a fortune to get her feet Smooth and well-maintained.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and lightweight.</li>
            <li> It was easy and quick to use, came charged and worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a powerful motor on it, and it will be thoroughly tested by her feet!</li>
            <li> so I was pretty pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great after a pedicure just to smooth off all the rough patches that were missed or as maintenance between pedicures.</li>
            <li> A brush is included to clean the head after usage.</li>
            <li> My feet feel much smoother now and I am happy I can use it as frequently as needed.</li>
            <li> Everything came with the callus remover including changing head &amp; brush to clean it off.  </li>
            <li> Works great, though I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s exactly the same thing as the CareMe product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get ready for sandal season quickly and easily with this PediSoft machine!  </li>
            <li> I love mine so much, I got one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> He says that this is helping tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, works great on tough cracked heels</li>
            <li> I rarely attend my feet</li>
            <li> So far, the quality is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> great device - first time I&#x27;ve been able to get rid of the hard, cracked calluses on my feet in years!  </li>
            <li> I have tried all kind of other &amp;#34;foot smoothing devices&amp;#34;, including manual &#x27;files&#x27; and the ped egg etc, which weren&#x27;t really cheap.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, worked amazingly fast and left my skin feeling smooth and not rough which I experienced with a different callous remover.  </li>
            <li> I used it right out the box.</li>
            <li> The speed is just right.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this, for the price of a professional pedicure you can do your own whenever you want to!</li>
            <li> Make sure that you don&#x27;t use it in the shower or bath and don&#x27;t hold on the skin in one spot for more than a few seconds or you get a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> If you get that rough, callused skin on your heels, this is the most fantastic thing you will ever use.</li>
            <li> but smooth is better than rough.</li>
            <li> But it works very very well.</li>
            <li> Took the heel calluses down to smooth skin easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to rush in the shower and try to get everything done before the hot water runs out.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used an electric callus remover.</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> Not enough power, it needs more speed.</li>
            <li> This effectively removes calluses and smooths rough feet.</li>
            <li> Now that we are full on in sandal season I am relieved to have something to soften my heels and keep them soft in between pedicures.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> If you apply too much pressure, it automatically stops spinning so you don&#x27;t accidentally hurt yourself .To</li>
            <li> With that said, this is so much easier  and faster than using a pumice stone..</li>
            <li> To me it is very necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
            <li> and my feet were much softer.</li>
            <li> I really like the plug in option, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries.</li>
            <li> We have the battery version and it doesn&#x27;t work as well, using tons of batteries and doesn&#x27;t have as much power.</li>
            <li> The motor is quiet and the unit fits comfortably in your hand.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Also, PediSoft delivered it right on time and was packaged professionally.</li>
            <li> This little device works wonders on removing calluses, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> My initial charge lasted for weeks of twice-a-week use, and though I purchased replacement heads, I haven&#x27;t worn out the original yet.  </li>
            <li> Well I was really excited about electrical pedicure, with no need to go through regular pedicure.</li>
            <li> I received another brand of callus remover for gift,  it was battery operated, and took more time to remove the callus,  However, the pedi soft is powerful,  took less time to remove the callus...</li>
            <li> Feels great on the feet - not too harsh or rough.  </li>
            <li> I does have safety features build in, just use steady pressure and it will do</li>
            <li> BUT afterward, my feet were very soft and were quite accepting of the foot cream!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it as well as buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This thing works great on summer, tired, cracked flip flop wearing man feet!</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to even do it in your favorite chair where you&#x27;re not leaning over hurting yourself.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida &amp; wear flip flops or sandals 11 months of the year.</li>
            <li> Love this little Pedicure machine!  </li>
            <li> I have diabetic nerve pain in my feet so they are VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I am an avid pumice stone user in the shower and get regular pedicures</li>
            <li> I used to look forward to pedicures just for the way my feet were actually soft for a change, and now I don&#x27;t need to get them because I can do this myself at home, whenever I want!  </li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my wife, and she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> This product works well to smooth down calluses.</li>
            <li> Make sure you put a towel down or use over a trashcan as there will be lots of white residue coming off.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective it is at removing dry dead skin and calluses.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> but when i do I use a pumice stone and scrub and scrub until my feet feel soft .In</li>
            <li> and i wish i could have a faster way to  get soft feet and this callus remover does that.</li>
            <li> Gently rotate back and forth or side to side on the area you want for 2-3 seconds.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in and it was ready to go after waiting only 10 minutes to charge.</li>
            <li> I have never had soft feet</li>
            <li> Let me start off saying I was skeptical that this callus remover would do a good job.</li>
            <li> It works quickly and you can use it daily to keep that dry skin at bay.</li>
            <li> Snapping off the head to clean is a breeze, and appreciate the little brush you get to clean out the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I wanted one that was rechargeable because the battery operated ones seemed less powerful according to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any problems with sore feet after use, but I&#x27;m careful not to do too much at once.</li>
            <li> If held in one spot to long it will get that spot hot but just go back to it later.</li>
            <li> The callus remover is not rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have really cracked and dry feet, you might have to use this daily until you get the desired results.</li>
            <li> So when I see these things on TV and the dry skin falling like snow, I get really freaked out because it looks so gross.  </li>
            <li> Her and my daughter do pedicures for each other and this just makes it that much easier.</li>
            <li> The meds dry my skin out and no matter how many pedicures I get that still somehow seems to be a little rough.</li>
            <li> only suggestions is to make sure you don&#x27;t press too hard or stay in the same place too long, it could take some skin off.</li>
            <li> LIGHT touch is the answer - may take a couple of days to get all the rough stuff off, but don&#x27;t need to press hard.  </li>
            <li> I stand for long hours at work and have developed some pretty thick calluses.</li>
            <li> I bought this the other day and so far I have only tried it once.</li>
            <li> Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to purchase - definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> I waited a few months before purchasing and kind of hate that I did as this was way worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that you use it completely dry, so</li>
            <li> I hate to write this review, since the customer service is very nice - e-mailing about sending and asking how things work out, but I am not willing to give this product another chance.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with callused hands/feet for so long now</li>
            <li> and i just  WISH that I would&#x27;ve known about this long ago.  </li>
            <li> I think the wear and tear of bare feet in heels all day is just too much for my poor feet.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t always notice when my feet are getting dry.  </li>
            <li> Trust me when I say they ARE dry.  </li>
            <li> , I did get the snow of dry skin</li>
            <li> I was actually scared to try it at first (the thought of an electric file is a little frightening) but it removes dead skin gently and painlessly.</li>
            <li> Usually it just sits on top my dry skin, but after the callus remover (yes it&#x27;s spelled weird)</li>
            <li> Electric Pedicure Callus Remover - a Rechargeable Foot Spa works by rotating and filing away at your heel, and can work either if your feet are dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this callus remover because I have issues  with extreme dry skin on my because of all the meds I take.</li>
            <li> After charging it all night like the instruction said I gave it a whirl for only a few minutes this morning.</li>
            <li> but you could physically see all of the dead skin coming off your feet.</li>
            <li> The harder the callus the longer this will take.</li>
            <li> But they could never even make a dent in the rough heal issue.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that this would work.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no snagging on fabric, scratching on my other foot etc.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders at removing dead dry skin from my feet.  </li>
            <li> I usually cringe when I have to shake hands with someone because my hands were so rough and dry.  </li>
            <li> After I charged this baby overnight I sat down and started grinding..</li>
            <li> Works great...just slightly underpowered.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have cracked dry heels, just thick calluses.</li>
            <li> It was a bit messy but if you do it over a trashcan or in the shower, it minimizes the mess.</li>
            <li> He was a little reluctant that this little machine was going to help.  </li>
            <li> I used this little miracle machine on my heels and balls of my feet and eww</li>
            <li> only took approximately four uses to have dramatically improved feet,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the wheel is stopping completely if you apply even lightest pressure, meaning to achieve the result I want it would take me 5 hours..</li>
            <li> I use this product a few times a week</li>
            <li> This works well, but I usually use it while sitting on the edge of the bathtub as it can make a mess when you use it.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see how much skin &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; this created.  </li>
            <li> How can anyone not LOVE this gadget?  </li>
            <li> It is literally useless, and I would get same results faster if I would take nail file and do pedicure with it.</li>
            <li> You hardly felt a thing</li>
            <li> Do not press hard.</li>
            <li> It files away the calluses, but it does take time if you have thick ones.</li>
            <li> but no matter what I do I have seriously callused feet.</li>
            <li> And when my heals get rough they crack and that hurts like crazy.</li>
            <li> summer the feet look so dry and bad</li>
            <li> my feet are tough.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s something I can deal with, I would prefer batteries because I&#x27;m usually soaking my feet and afraid I would drop it</li>
            <li> No more shaving and cutting feet!</li>
            <li> and yes it was weird.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to using this!  </li>
            <li> My feet aren&#x27;t horribly cracked and dry</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> He has ugly feet, and this is helping to beautify them.&lt;br /&gt;Being corded may make it awkward for some, but it has lots of power and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have cracked or ugly feet, I do wear heals a lot, and I do have some hardened skin.</li>
            <li> very bad callus remover want to return but my printer is on the fritz and computer for that matter.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was honestly. Impressed with this product.  Very easy to use, worked amazingly fast and left my skin feeling smooth and not rough which I experienced with a different callous remover.  I really like this. Thanks</li>
            <li> Let me start off saying I was skeptical that this callus remover would do a good job. After reading the reviews I decided that I had to give it a try. I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective it is at removing dry dead skin and calluses. My feet look and feel so smooth. I love this!</li>
            <li> great device - first time I&#x27;ve been able to get rid of the hard, cracked calluses on my feet in years!  LIGHT touch is the answer - may take a couple of days to get all the rough stuff off, but don&#x27;t need to press hard.  Works great.  Had a charging cord issue so returing but rebuy-ing immediately; best my heels have looked in years!  I go barefoot a lot and this keeps my feet looking good, plus gets that ground-in dirt off.</li>
            <li> i love this used it as soon as it arrived made my feet feel great</li>
            <li> This is the BEST Brand! Wouldn&#x27;t use another -- Works great and so glad I ordered. Fast shipping too !</li>
            <li> Wow! this gets the job done! I don&#x27;t really have a lot of dead skin on my feet...or so I thought..After I charged this baby overnight I sat down and started grinding..lol wow (again) there was a lot of white dust flying around. Afterwards, I put some really rich moisturizing lotion on them and put some pedicure socks on and let my feet &#x27;marinate&#x27; for a couple of hours while I watched my favorite shows. When I took the socks off it was like I had gone and had them done at a pedicure salon. Now if I could just learn how to paint my own nails I would have no need for them anymore.&lt;br /&gt;my only suggestions is to make sure you don&#x27;t press too hard or stay in the same place too long, it could take some skin off. I does have safety features build in, just use steady pressure and it will do it&#x27;s thing.&lt;br /&gt;I also love that this is rechargeable because I never seem to have any batteries around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*i received this product for a reduced price to review and give my hoest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical that this would work. I am an avid pumice stone user in the shower and get regular pedicures but no matter what I do I have seriously callused feet.

            <li> Great product! This is a powerful machine, and does a great job!!</li>
            <li> I rarely attend my feet but when i do I use a pumice stone and scrub and scrub until my feet feel soft .In summer the feet look so dry and bad and i wish i could have a faster way to  get soft feet and this callus remover does that. Electric Pedicure Callus Remover - a Rechargeable Foot Spa works by rotating and filing away at your heel, and can work either if your feet are dry or wet. If you apply too much pressure, it automatically stops spinning so you don&#x27;t accidentally hurt yourself .To use the callus remover you want to make sure that your feet are clean. Gently rotate back and forth or side to side on the area you want for 2-3 seconds. Do not press hard. Stop and check to see if you have the smoothness you desire. Repeat until you get the results you want. The harder the callus the longer this will take. With that said, this is so much easier  and faster than using a pumice stone.. I tried this before and after a shower and it worked great. It was a bit messy but if you do it over a trashcan or in the shower, it minimizes the mess.For faster remover ,apply a callus removing cream or gel and then use this callus remover after that has been on the feet for about 5 minutes.I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh!  easy to use.  love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today and it was great. Took the heel calluses down to smooth skin easily and quickly. Sure beats the Dremmel tool with sandpaper that I&#x27;ve been using for years. NO skin burn either, which was very pleasant. This item will pay for itself in savings on socks alone. I would highly recommend this product to everyone. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother in law and she loves it. Her and my daughter do pedicures for each other and this just makes it that much easier. Thank you for the opportunity for reviewing your product during your recent promotion. We no longer have to pay a fortune to get her feet Smooth and well-maintained.</li>
            <li> Works great!!  Wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to purchase - definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> This thing works great on summer, tired, cracked flip flop wearing man feet!</li>
            <li> I go barefoot a lot, so my feet are tough. This product works well to smooth down calluses. I&#x27;ve not had any problems with sore feet after use, but I&#x27;m careful not to do too much at once.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt; To me it is very necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thank you</li>
            <li> I received another brand of callus remover for gift,  it was battery operated, and took more time to remove the callus,  However, the pedi soft is powerful,  took less time to remove the callus... I like the electric and battery option alot.</li>
            <li> This Callus remover actually WORKS and does what it is supposed to do. Exactly as described and very easy to use. Also, PediSoft delivered it right on time and was packaged professionally. I highly recommend it as well as buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have diabetic nerve pain in my feet so they are VERY sensitive. This callus remover did not hurt my feet. It is easy to use and did an amazing job on my heels! It is easy to clean and lightweight.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE THIS!!! No more shaving and cutting feet! So smooth!</li>
            <li> How can anyone not LOVE this gadget?  HELLO?  I really don&#x27;t get it.  I have suffered with callused hands/feet for so long now and i just  WISH that I would&#x27;ve known about this long ago.  I usually cringe when I have to shake hands with someone because my hands were so rough and dry.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry because I use this on my hands and feet and I am finally rid of the calluses!  I am FREE and it feels so good!  5 BIG Stars!!!</li>
            <li> This was a game-changer for me!  I waited a few months before purchasing and kind of hate that I did as this was way worth the price.  I used to look forward to pedicures just for the way my feet were actually soft for a change, and now I don&#x27;t need to get them because I can do this myself at home, whenever I want!  :)  I chose this specific model because I like that it doesn&#x27;t run on batteries and it is rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;It only took approximately four uses to have dramatically improved feet, just about all the roughness is gone.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this, for the price of a professional pedicure you can do your own whenever you want to!</li>
            <li> This is the best I have used yet. Great that it is electric also. If held in one spot to long it will get that spot hot but just go back to it later. I love mine and wish I could have found it sooner.</li>
            <li> got it,looks good,will try it later!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, works great on tough cracked heels</li>
            <li> With some patience to avoid overdoing it at one time, this callous remover works great.  My initial charge lasted for weeks of twice-a-week use, and though I purchased replacement heads, I haven&#x27;t worn out the original yet.  Snapping off the head to clean is a breeze, and appreciate the little brush you get to clean out the dead skin.  So far, the quality is outstanding.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Does the job and my foot feels more smooth :)</li>
            <li> I love this device ,does great job......</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend and she has not stopped raving about it.  She is a beauty product fanatic so if she says a product is great, it must be REALLY great.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough. It does not even tickle!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my wife, and she absolutely loves it!  It had the best reviews, and now I understand why!  It seems to have a powerful motor on it, and it will be thoroughly tested by her feet!</li>
            <li> Oh how I love this. It is strong and removes Callouses like a pro. I am loving my smooth feet !  They look great.</li>
            <li> I used it right out the box. Oh my then used on my daughter, then my boyfriend. Lol we all loved it so much. I just need to see how easy for replacement files. But it works very very well. I will buy for gifts. Received this for review</li>
            <li> Works great, though I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s exactly the same thing as the CareMe product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used an electric callus remover. It is rechargeable which beats having to change batteries. It is very easy to use and it works!  I have been using it nightly and continue to see results. It comes with 2 rollers and replacement rollers can be purchased.... after using this callus remover your feet feel amazing.  A brush is included to clean the head after usage. Everything you need is included in the box. This is a Spa treatment for your feet in the privacy of your own home!</li>
            <li> This electric callus remover works. I plugged it in and it was ready to go after waiting only 10 minutes to charge. It files away the calluses, but it does take time if you have thick ones. I stand for long hours at work and have developed some pretty thick calluses. My feet feel much smoother now and I am happy I can use it as frequently as needed.</li>
            <li> Saw the reviews were fairly good for this so I thought what the heck. I wanted one that was rechargeable because the battery operated ones seemed less powerful according to the reviews. My feet aren&#x27;t horribly cracked and dry so I was pretty pleased with the results. Make sure that you don&#x27;t use it in the shower or bath and don&#x27;t hold on the skin in one spot for more than a few seconds or you get a burning sensation. I used it on both feet for a total of about 20 min and my feet were much softer. If you have really cracked and dry feet, you might have to use this daily until you get the desired results. Make sure you put a towel down or use over a trashcan as there will be lots of white residue coming off. This is very easy to clean and change rollers. I will be using this on a weekly basis, especially during the summer with sandals!</li>
            <li> My husband has had issues with callus on his feet for years. He was a little reluctant that this little machine was going to help.  But, after trying this electric callus remover he was amazed!  Everything came with the callus remover including changing head &amp; brush to clean it off.  Even the batteries were included.  Very good quality machine and well satisfied.  Everyone needs one of these in their household!</li>
            <li> This callus remover is great!! I don&#x27;t have to spend all of that money at the nail shop. This is a great buy!!</li>
            <li> very bad callus remover want to return but my printer is on the fritz and computer for that matter.  How can I return without a label?</li>
            <li> Before I use this, I was worried about callus remover&#x27;s sharpness.. but, it is not. It only removes the callus. Skin is safe. ;-)  I like it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this callus remover because I have issues  with extreme dry skin on my because of all the meds I take. The meds dry my skin out and no matter how many pedicures I get that still somehow seems to be a little rough. Because I get pedicures every two weeks this was a great device to have just to smooth your feet in between. It&#x27;s electric but that&#x27;s something I can deal with, I would prefer batteries because I&#x27;m usually soaking my feet and afraid I would drop it but I rememdy that by just removing myself from the foot wash bowl. The callus remover is not rough on my skin. It&#x27;s not abrasive and doesn&#x27;t leave your feet huritng afterwards. The speed is just right. Now the skin is not going to come off immediately but I assure you if you continue to use you WILL see a difference. Just continue to use it. The cord is long enough to even do it in your favorite chair where you&#x27;re not leaning over hurting yourself. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it and I know over time it will be the perfect match with my bi weekly pedicures. I received this product at a discount rate in exchange for an honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m impressed. I have tried all kind of other &amp;#34;foot smoothing devices&amp;#34;, including manual &#x27;files&#x27; and the ped egg etc, which weren&#x27;t really cheap. But they could never even make a dent in the rough heal issue. And when my heals get rough they crack and that hurts like crazy. So this device worked out of the box, I used it for under 2 minutes and my heals are smoother than I ever remember them being. There&#x27;s no snagging on fabric, scratching on my other foot etc. SO NICE. It was easy and quick to use, came charged and worked like a charm. So far super happy!!</li>
            <li> With the littlest amount of pressure it stops rotating. It&#x27;s well made but I don&#x27;t recommend. I returned it.</li>
            <li> I really like the plug in option, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about batteries. This works well, but I usually use it while sitting on the edge of the bathtub as it can make a mess when you use it.</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome tool!!!</li>
            <li> Works great...just slightly underpowered.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday.  He had callouses on his feet that would crack and bleed.  He says that this is helping tremendously.  He has ugly feet, and this is helping to beautify them.&lt;br /&gt;Being corded may make it awkward for some, but it has lots of power and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> So when I see these things on TV and the dry skin falling like snow, I get really freaked out because it looks so gross.  I honestly would not have tried this on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But BOY, would I have missed out!  I LOVE this thing!  I have recently been diagnose with moderate Peripheral Neuropathy awhile back and I don&#x27;t always notice when my feet are getting dry.  Trust me when I say they ARE dry.  I used this little miracle machine on my heels and balls of my feet and eww, I did get the snow of dry skin and yes it was weird.  BUT afterward, my feet were very soft and were quite accepting of the foot cream!  Usually it just sits on top my dry skin, but after the callus remover (yes it&#x27;s spelled weird) I was able to get the cream to soak in and my feet stay softer longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly once you use it, you don&#x27;t have to use it often if you just keep up the maintenance on your feet.  But if you forget and it gets out of control!  PediSoft to the rescue!  I&#x27;m not grossed out anymore, I just prop my feet on the wastebasket and use a grocery bag as a liner so I can throw it out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get ready for sandal season quickly and easily with this PediSoft machine!  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review*</li>
            <li> Product performs as advertised. Completely satisfied with product and service.</li>
            <li> Works great, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Not enough power, it needs more speed.</li>
            <li> Great &amp; Powerful. I live in Florida &amp; wear flip flops or sandals 11 months of the year. This keep my feet looking smooth! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I hate to write this review, since the customer service is very nice - e-mailing about sending and asking how things work out, but I am not willing to give this product another chance. I bought it mostly because of great reviews on Amazon, however product didn&#x27;t live up to the fame. I don&#x27;t have cracked or ugly feet, I do wear heals a lot, and I do have some hardened skin. Well I was really excited about electrical pedicure, with no need to go through regular pedicure. Unfortunately the wheel is stopping completely if you apply even lightest pressure, meaning to achieve the result I want it would take me 5 hours..( I am exaggerating - didn&#x27;t tried actually). It is literally useless, and I would get same results faster if I would take nail file and do pedicure with it. Sorry!</li>
            <li> This works great! We have the battery version and it doesn&#x27;t work as well, using tons of batteries and doesn&#x27;t have as much power. This effectively removes calluses and smooths rough feet.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful tool. If you get that rough, callused skin on your heels, this is the most fantastic thing you will ever use. It works quickly and you can use it daily to keep that dry skin at bay. I love mine so much, I got one for my daughter. She used mine and loved it, so this is making a perfect gift for her! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Great for removing calluses. Saves me from having to get pedicures. The recharging is good because I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries.</li>
            <li> Love this little Pedicure machine!  Worked wonders at removing dead dry skin from my feet.  Should have splurged sooner.  I bought this one because it is recharged via an internal battery through electric plug in.  Many operate on replaceable batteries, which I did not want to deal with.</li>
            <li> This little device works wonders on removing calluses, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Does nothing.  Returned.</li>
            <li> I use this product a few times a week and it really helps to keep my feet looking great between pedicures.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use. I was actually scared to try it at first (the thought of an electric file is a little frightening) but it removes dead skin gently and painlessly. The motor is quiet and the unit fits comfortably in your hand.  I received at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I have never had soft feet but smooth is better than rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to using this!  Feels great on the feet - not too harsh or rough.  I love the rechargeable batteries too!</li>
