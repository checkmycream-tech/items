            <li>I love this brush for foundation, it buffs it in effortlessly and leaves NO streaks.  </li>
            <li>any more it was just that bit.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS BRUSH FOR CONTOURING</li>
            <li>I know that may not be its intended purpose, but that&#x27;s my favorite way to use it.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>

            <li>Also to top off some translucent setting powder.</li>
            <li>I love how the brush is angled and makes it easy to apply bronzer.</li>
            <li>Easily cleans up, the foundation goes on smooth and there is no feathering of the hairs!</li>
            <li>will probably order more from sigma, now that I know that their brushes are such good quality!</li>
            <li>brush (contour and applying foundation etc), and it&#x27;s very true.</li>
            <li>Sigma&#x27;s customer service department is just so great to work with if you have any problems that I feel more comfortable ordering directly from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BE CAREFUL, GIRLS (and boys) &lt;3</li>
            <li>I use MAC gold deposit to contour and it doesn&#x27;t blend at all I bought cheap contouring brush at Clare&#x27;s and let me tell you it blends wayyyy better than this here.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very dense and soft, providing the most even and flawless application.</li>
            <li>The angle on this brush is great for contouring if you want a diffused natural look.</li>
            <li>Makes the foundation look so smooth - much better than a sponge.  </li>
            <li>is so soft and is great for putting on foundation.</li>
            <li>I use this one for foundation application and love how easily and smooth it makes application.</li>
            <li>I cant wait to try the full line!</li>
            <li>This is my first Sigma brush and I love it!</li>
            <li>This brush is great for many different reasons.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i guess i&#x27;ll find another use for it, but i primarily intended it for a more precise blush application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are looking into a good foundation brush I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>You dab more than you stroke, and I feel that it does allow for a better coverage (say, I have more blemishes or acne a certain day</li>
            <li>My foundation feels lighter but looks even more full coverage when I use this brush.</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I use it with my liquid Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder foundation, and it makes application easy and streak free.</li>
            <li>I wrote to Amazon customer service and was so pleased with how quick and helpful they were.</li>
            <li>and I really am looking forward to getting more!</li>
            <li>beautiful brush, very soft while being very dense!</li>
            <li>how lightly you pushed- is a tell tale</li>
            <li>and it provides and smooth finish for both.</li>
            <li>I use this brush to apply a light bronzer or blush around the face.</li>
            <li>feed backs are so important.  </li>
            <li>I figured the domed shape of the brush combined with the angle would make it great for blending in both cream and powder products, especially for contouring.  </li>
            <li>It makes the foundation application so smooth.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed any hairs falling out (as I did with the Sigma F20), but this may be because the brush is light in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No matter how lightly I applied pressure</li>
            <li>so far so good, hope it lasts..</li>
            <li>I found great reviews of the flat top brush of this brand on another site, and then others said this angled one was better for getting at certain parts of your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s angled tip makes it easy to get into every area of your face for full coverage.</li>
            <li>They appear to be well made, look stylish, and are priced very reasonably for the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li>I have received my new angled top kabuki brush and I love it.  </li>
            <li>absolutely love  love my new brush .</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I originally used to rounded kabuki and gradually went over to this one.</li>
            <li>They refunded my shipping costs and sent me a shipping label to return my original brush.</li>
            <li>Worth every buck!</li>
            <li>I have many other sigma brushes and they are by far the best brushes for the money!  </li>
            <li>Wow, these brushes keep getting better and better-  </li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and sturdy enough to stay in place to apply your blush/bronzer in the perfect place.</li>
            <li>Read so many positive reviews on Youtube regarding Sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brush is extremely easy to spot clean thanks to the fact that it is synthetic (I use the paper towel and MAC brush cleanser method) and it does not shed at all!  </li>
            <li>I have a whole set and love everyone of them.</li>
            <li>Nice, sturdy brushes with soft, dense bristles that get the job done.</li>
            <li>Im kicking myself because I didnt buy the full set.</li>
            <li>These are OK, I just prefer softer brushes (Real Techniques or the BeautyBlender).</li>
            <li>I had been worried that since this was from a seller (that was fulfilled by Amazon) I may not get a full refund, but there were no questions asked.</li>
            <li>Love this brush so much</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t expect was how flawless it will work with very little effort!  </li>
            <li>instead I kept my hopes up and applied some super glue to the handle worked out well</li>
            <li>However, as much as I love my regular set, the Sigmax brushes are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is very dense, great quality and deposits a lot of color instead of soaking it up in the brush.</li>
            <li>but I found this absorbed too much of the product and is better suited to apply bronzer/blush.</li>
            <li>They arrived rather quickly and I would order again from this seller.</li>
            <li>I would like to try the flat top one though, to see which I like better.  </li>
            <li>After owning it several months, I was so impressed that I bought two more brushes (the Angled and Round Kabuki).</li>
            <li>You have found a new loyal customer :-)</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite brush.</li>
            <li>It also washes easily and doesn&#x27;t shed much if at all.</li>
            <li>I know you can&#x27;t shop &#x27;anywhere&#x27; online, and get the real thing!!</li>
            <li>I love how dense and soft this brush is!</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd brush from Sigma and I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li>Thanks Sigma!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more brushes from Sigma!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It can be used for contouring because of the angled brush, but I use this brush for foundation and it applies so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t use much product.</li>
            <li>Sigma wins ..  ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love the soft bristels.</li>
            <li>This brand is worth every cent</li>
            <li>This brush is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>The brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Def worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely worth</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also purchased the flat top and tapered kabuki brushes and am super excited it try them out</li>
            <li>Very good quality to last a long time.  </li>
            <li>It gives me just the right amount of blush.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to try this brush out because of the positive reviews!</li>
            <li>it is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think I may also purchase the flat and round top kabuki brushes although this is a great shape for blending around the jawline.</li>
            <li>so soft and easy to work with just what I needed</li>
            <li>I finally found the right brush, love this blush brush so much!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great soft brush.</li>
            <li>Great for getting in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>This brush dose exactly what it says it dose ,, i use it for foundation ..  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first product from Sigma, so</li>
            <li>This is my first Sigma brush</li>
            <li>Let me start this review by letting everyone know that this is the first time that I have purchased a sigma brush</li>
            <li>Brush did exactly as it should have done.</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied and will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li>(thanks amazon!).</li>
            <li>This brush is VERY multi-functional!</li>
            <li>This is the first Sigma brush I purchased</li>
            <li>I fell in love with my Sigma F80 brush and decided to give this a try because its bristles are made of the same synthetic material.  </li>
            <li>No hair fallout and maintain it&#x27;s shape very well!</li>
            <li>Love this and will buy again in the future!</li>
            <li>I like to stipple with this first, then blend in.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>I love the entire Sigma Brush line.  </li>
            <li>will have to buy other brushes and make my own set.</li>
            <li>Bought it after reading the positive reviews and took a chance.  </li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and firm and dense and it applies foundation and CC cream very nicely.</li>
            <li>you are better of buying a cheap replica at Alliexpress and get the same cheap brush for way less.</li>
            <li>It came fast and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I use this brush for my bronzer when i want a more dramatic look and to create an amazing contour.  </li>
            <li>I got this because Jaclyn Hill (makeup artist youtube channel) kept recommending this particular brush multiple times in many of her videos.</li>
            <li>Some were lousy, some were decent, but none impressed me much...until now.</li>
            <li>It is super soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>I normally buy my brushes directly from Sigma, but decided to get this one from Amazon because I could get free shipping.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft.  </li>
            <li>Soft, soft brush, very pleased, but $21.00 for a brush was an expense for me, hopefully it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It blends really well.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and came really fast</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t absorb so much of the product</li>
            <li>the angle of the brush really helps bring my cheeks out and doesnt break ever.</li>
            <li>I think with this one I am rubbing my face too much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for both beginners and pros!</li>
            <li>It creates a very even application that looks like an air-brushed effect.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Bellus F84 over this to any one who wants to save money and not give up quality.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really do like this brush.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t had a problem with it</li>
            <li>Very dense.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are soft and the size of it is good enough for either daily use or travelling.</li>
            <li>Of all the money wasted on other brushes, this, by far is the best foundation/powder brush in the market.</li>
            <li>I have the Sigma 15-pc set, the 12-pc set, the flat top and the round top synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li>the quality is way superior compared to other brushes in the same price range.</li>
            <li>This is my first sigma brush and since this was such a hit, I&#x27;ll be purchasing more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>definitely getting your moneys&#x27; worth here!</li>
            <li>I have purchased Sigma Beauty Round Top Synthetic Kabuki and the Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki previously and love them.  </li>
            <li>It was mostly the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sigma brush and I must say, the quality far exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone just starting out to the most seasoned professional because of the ease of use and end result.</li>
            <li>Looking at the brush online and reading the description I could tell that it would be a decent brush for liquid and cream foundation.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li>This particular brush was not in that set (which I knew), and I didn&#x27;t buy it at that time.</li>
            <li>Although its recommended for blush and contouring I use it to mainly apply foundation and blush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are also very soft!</li>
            <li>You can usually find a 10% off code, which most likely will make it just as cheap, even after shipping costs, as Amazon.</li>
            <li>Sure wish Sigma would sell their individual brushes in hot pink like the 3DHD.</li>
            <li>Sigma brushes are definitely high quality.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>So high end</li>
            <li>I use this brush for contouring, which gets a little tricky because the line becomes much harsher / more defined - not something you want when trying to create a natural &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>the brush is so soft THE SELLER SENT IT TO ME SO FAST</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly soft and very dense.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft it almost feels like a gentle face massage.  </li>
            <li>, I think I would grab this one over my normal brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not nearly as good as my new beauty blender, but this is a go to brush 4 sure !</li>
            <li>I have just spent hours reading articles like http://pumpkincat210.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/how-to-avoid-buying-fake-m-a-c-cosmetics/, only to find that SO many makeup products are being faked these days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been collecting them over the past 6 months and this one is another new favorite.</li>
            <li>And so I just had to complete my Sigma collection and get this brush too!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, it&#x27;s a dream!</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft, but it&#x27;s also dense!</li>
            <li>so soft!</li>
            <li>I have used many methods for applying liquid foundation, ex. sponges, beauty blender, finger method, regular foundation brushes, and even other duo fibre brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this brush only if you&#x27;re looking for precision powder, or are willing to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sigma brush and it won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
            <li>I only gave it a 4 stars because it could be a little more narrow to make a more defined contour.</li>
            <li>I was a very excited to buy this brush because of the recommendations heard about this, and they weren&#x27;t wrong, super soft but at the same time firm enough for applying foundation or facial cream, just love the finish, like porcelain, so smooth to your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not ridiculously more packed than the other brush, but it&#x27;s a gorgeous addition to my brush collection.</li>
            <li>I have recently been into cream blushes which really works well for mature skin (I am 49), and I found that this brush, because of its shape and density, does the job for me.  </li>
            <li>Wen i washed the brush all the product came out and the white bristles looked clean, however, it did take a while longer to dry because it is a kabuki.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and blends so well.</li>
            <li>IT IS SOO SOFT ON MY SKIN</li>
            <li>It is so soft to your skin and it does what it supposed to do in a really professional way.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think different brushes would make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Everything was fixed within 2 hours of writing to Amazon customer service.</li>
            <li>It:&lt;br /&gt;-has soft bristles</li>
            <li>It is so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>They refunded my purchase, told me to purchase another brush from a different seller (because the original seller did not have any other F84s in stock) and select 1 day shipping.</li>
            <li>I strongly believe this product is a fake when I first received my brush</li>
            <li>It applies my make-up so evenly and smoothly that the pores on the skin hardly show.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I would probably order this directly from Sigma in the future.</li>
            <li>I am keeping it though to see how it works with my Bare Minerals foundation powder.</li>
            <li>I did not get any fall out except for the first deep cleaning which is to be expected.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, she says it feels like the expensive one, very soft and idk she really love it</li>
            <li>I wish I can purchase the other two; possibly on my next paycheck ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Real Techniques face brush for a long time, but hearing all the constant hype on Youtube about the Sigma F80 finally convinced me to try Sigma.</li>
            <li>Because its tapered it gets into creases (around nose and such) and awkward spots really well :)</li>
            <li>When I received the brush I did a deep cleaning and waited for my new kabuki brush to dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great Customer Service experience: This brush came to me slightly damaged, which is unusual for a Sigma brush.</li>

            <li> I love the handle.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> The reason I am writing is because I saw a crappy \\&quot;MADE IN CHINA\\&quot; sticker attached to my brush, on top of the \\&quot;MADE IN USA\\&quot; engraving on the handle.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Love the angled shape too for getting into all the spaces of the face.</li>
            <li> I bought a well-known brand at a local cosmetic store and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0045W4X16 Sigma Beauty Angled Top Synthetic Kabuki - F84]]</li>
            <li> For those of us who cant afford the Chanel brushes, these are the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I totally recomend this brush for a flawless blush application.</li>
            <li> A most have in every girl makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I have had the brush for one week now and have used it with many of my products.</li>

            <li> I just love it, this Brush will always be in my collection.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt my favourite Sigma-brush, and I&#x27;ll recommend it to my friends for sure.</li>

            <li> i like this one better because doesnt shed on me like the F80...</li>

            <li> So glad that I ordered.</li>
            <li> and it applies smoothly!</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are better than Mac.</li>
            <li> but I use mine as a blush brush because I love the way it applies it.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite make-up accessory.  </li>
            <li> one of the better brushes one can buy.  </li>

            <li> I have also noticed that my foundation holds up and looks better throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush was more dense than I was used to with my MAC angled brush, which has taken some getting used to.</li>
            <li> but i mostly use it for apply bronzer and contouring.</li>
            <li> love this brush</li>

            <li> :) AMAZING brush its sooo soft and feels great in your hand</li>
            <li> I love this for my cream bronzers.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for foundation, it buffs it in effortlessly and leaves NO streaks.  </li>
            <li> any more it was just that bit.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH FOR CONTOURING</li>
            <li> I know that may not be its intended purpose, but that&#x27;s my favorite way to use it.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed it many times and no sheddding.</li>
            <li> Also to top off some translucent setting powder.</li>
            <li> I love how the brush is angled and makes it easy to apply bronzer.</li>
            <li> Easily cleans up, the foundation goes on smooth and there is no feathering of the hairs!</li>
            <li> will probably order more from sigma, now that I know that their brushes are such good quality!</li>
            <li> brush (contour and applying foundation etc), and it&#x27;s very true.</li>
            <li> Sigma&#x27;s customer service department is just so great to work with if you have any problems that I feel more comfortable ordering directly from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL, GIRLS (and boys) &lt;3</li>
            <li> I use MAC gold deposit to contour and it doesn&#x27;t blend at all I bought cheap contouring brush at Clare&#x27;s and let me tell you it blends wayyyy better than this here.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very dense and soft, providing the most even and flawless application.</li>
            <li> The angle on this brush is great for contouring if you want a diffused natural look.</li>
            <li> Makes the foundation look so smooth - much better than a sponge.  </li>
            <li> is so soft and is great for putting on foundation.</li>
            <li> I use this one for foundation application and love how easily and smooth it makes application.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to try the full line!</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush and I love it!</li>
            <li> This brush is great for many different reasons.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i guess i&#x27;ll find another use for it, but i primarily intended it for a more precise blush application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are looking into a good foundation brush I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> You dab more than you stroke, and I feel that it does allow for a better coverage (say, I have more blemishes or acne a certain day</li>
            <li> My foundation feels lighter but looks even more full coverage when I use this brush.</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I use it with my liquid Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder foundation, and it makes application easy and streak free.</li>
            <li> I wrote to Amazon customer service and was so pleased with how quick and helpful they were.</li>
            <li> and I really am looking forward to getting more!</li>
            <li> beautiful brush, very soft while being very dense!</li>
            <li> how lightly you pushed- is a tell tale</li>
            <li> and it provides and smooth finish for both.</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply a light bronzer or blush around the face.</li>
            <li> feed backs are so important.  </li>
            <li> I figured the domed shape of the brush combined with the angle would make it great for blending in both cream and powder products, especially for contouring.  </li>
            <li> It makes the foundation application so smooth.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed any hairs falling out (as I did with the Sigma F20), but this may be because the brush is light in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how lightly I applied pressure</li>
            <li> so far so good, hope it lasts..</li>
            <li> I found great reviews of the flat top brush of this brand on another site, and then others said this angled one was better for getting at certain parts of your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s angled tip makes it easy to get into every area of your face for full coverage.</li>
            <li> They appear to be well made, look stylish, and are priced very reasonably for the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I have received my new angled top kabuki brush and I love it.  </li>
            <li> absolutely love  love my new brush .</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I originally used to rounded kabuki and gradually went over to this one.</li>
            <li> They refunded my shipping costs and sent me a shipping label to return my original brush.</li>
            <li> Worth every buck!</li>
            <li> I have many other sigma brushes and they are by far the best brushes for the money!  </li>
            <li> Wow, these brushes keep getting better and better-  </li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and sturdy enough to stay in place to apply your blush/bronzer in the perfect place.</li>
            <li> Read so many positive reviews on Youtube regarding Sigma brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brush is extremely easy to spot clean thanks to the fact that it is synthetic (I use the paper towel and MAC brush cleanser method) and it does not shed at all!  </li>
            <li> I have a whole set and love everyone of them.</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy brushes with soft, dense bristles that get the job done.</li>
            <li> Im kicking myself because I didnt buy the full set.</li>
            <li> These are OK, I just prefer softer brushes (Real Techniques or the BeautyBlender).</li>
            <li> I had been worried that since this was from a seller (that was fulfilled by Amazon) I may not get a full refund, but there were no questions asked.</li>
            <li> Love this brush so much</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t expect was how flawless it will work with very little effort!  </li>
            <li> instead I kept my hopes up and applied some super glue to the handle worked out well</li>
            <li> However, as much as I love my regular set, the Sigmax brushes are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Overall it is very dense, great quality and deposits a lot of color instead of soaking it up in the brush.</li>
            <li> but I found this absorbed too much of the product and is better suited to apply bronzer/blush.</li>
            <li> They arrived rather quickly and I would order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I would like to try the flat top one though, to see which I like better.  </li>
            <li> After owning it several months, I was so impressed that I bought two more brushes (the Angled and Round Kabuki).</li>
            <li> You have found a new loyal customer :-)</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite brush.</li>
            <li> It also washes easily and doesn&#x27;t shed much if at all.</li>
            <li> I know you can&#x27;t shop &#x27;anywhere&#x27; online, and get the real thing!!</li>
            <li> I love how dense and soft this brush is!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd brush from Sigma and I absolutely love them!</li>
            <li> Thanks Sigma!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more brushes from Sigma!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It can be used for contouring because of the angled brush, but I use this brush for foundation and it applies so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t use much product.</li>
            <li> Sigma wins ..  ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love the soft bristels.</li>
            <li> This brand is worth every cent</li>
            <li> This brush is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> The brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Def worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely worth</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Also purchased the flat top and tapered kabuki brushes and am super excited it try them out</li>
            <li> Very good quality to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It gives me just the right amount of blush.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try this brush out because of the positive reviews!</li>
            <li> it is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think I may also purchase the flat and round top kabuki brushes although this is a great shape for blending around the jawline.</li>
            <li> so soft and easy to work with just what I needed</li>
            <li> I finally found the right brush, love this blush brush so much!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great soft brush.</li>
            <li> Great for getting in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> This brush dose exactly what it says it dose ,, i use it for foundation ..  </li>

            <li> This is my first Sigma brush</li>
            <li> Let me start this review by letting everyone know that this is the first time that I have purchased a sigma brush</li>
            <li> Brush did exactly as it should have done.</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied and will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> (thanks amazon!).</li>
            <li> This brush is VERY multi-functional!</li>
            <li> This is the first Sigma brush I purchased</li>
            <li> I fell in love with my Sigma F80 brush and decided to give this a try because its bristles are made of the same synthetic material.  </li>
            <li> No hair fallout and maintain it&#x27;s shape very well!</li>
            <li> Love this and will buy again in the future!</li>
            <li> I like to stipple with this first, then blend in.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the entire Sigma Brush line.  </li>
            <li> will have to buy other brushes and make my own set.</li>
            <li> Bought it after reading the positive reviews and took a chance.  </li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and firm and dense and it applies foundation and CC cream very nicely.</li>
            <li> you are better of buying a cheap replica at Alliexpress and get the same cheap brush for way less.</li>
            <li> It came fast and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for my bronzer when i want a more dramatic look and to create an amazing contour.  </li>
            <li> I got this because Jaclyn Hill (makeup artist youtube channel) kept recommending this particular brush multiple times in many of her videos.</li>
            <li> Some were lousy, some were decent, but none impressed me much...until now.</li>
            <li> It is super soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I normally buy my brushes directly from Sigma, but decided to get this one from Amazon because I could get free shipping.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super soft.  </li>
            <li> Soft, soft brush, very pleased, but $21.00 for a brush was an expense for me, hopefully it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It blends really well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and came really fast</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t absorb so much of the product</li>
            <li> the angle of the brush really helps bring my cheeks out and doesnt break ever.</li>
            <li> I think with this one I am rubbing my face too much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for both beginners and pros!</li>
            <li> It creates a very even application that looks like an air-brushed effect.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Bellus F84 over this to any one who wants to save money and not give up quality.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really do like this brush.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had a problem with it</li>
            <li> Very dense.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are soft and the size of it is good enough for either daily use or travelling.</li>
            <li> Of all the money wasted on other brushes, this, by far is the best foundation/powder brush in the market.</li>
            <li> I have the Sigma 15-pc set, the 12-pc set, the flat top and the round top synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li> the quality is way superior compared to other brushes in the same price range.</li>
            <li> This is my first sigma brush and since this was such a hit, I&#x27;ll be purchasing more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> definitely getting your moneys&#x27; worth here!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Sigma Beauty Round Top Synthetic Kabuki and the Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki previously and love them.  </li>
            <li> It was mostly the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush and I must say, the quality far exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone just starting out to the most seasoned professional because of the ease of use and end result.</li>
            <li> Looking at the brush online and reading the description I could tell that it would be a decent brush for liquid and cream foundation.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> This particular brush was not in that set (which I knew), and I didn&#x27;t buy it at that time.</li>
            <li> Although its recommended for blush and contouring I use it to mainly apply foundation and blush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are also very soft!</li>
            <li> You can usually find a 10% off code, which most likely will make it just as cheap, even after shipping costs, as Amazon.</li>
            <li> Sure wish Sigma would sell their individual brushes in hot pink like the 3DHD.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are definitely high quality.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> So high end</li>
            <li> I use this brush for contouring, which gets a little tricky because the line becomes much harsher / more defined - not something you want when trying to create a natural &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> the brush is so soft THE SELLER SENT IT TO ME SO FAST</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly soft and very dense.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft it almost feels like a gentle face massage.  </li>
            <li> , I think I would grab this one over my normal brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as my new beauty blender, but this is a go to brush 4 sure !</li>
            <li> I have just spent hours reading articles like http://pumpkincat210.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/how-to-avoid-buying-fake-m-a-c-cosmetics/, only to find that SO many makeup products are being faked these days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been collecting them over the past 6 months and this one is another new favorite.</li>
            <li> And so I just had to complete my Sigma collection and get this brush too!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft, it&#x27;s a dream!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft, but it&#x27;s also dense!</li>
            <li> so soft!</li>
            <li> I have used many methods for applying liquid foundation, ex. sponges, beauty blender, finger method, regular foundation brushes, and even other duo fibre brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this brush only if you&#x27;re looking for precision powder, or are willing to learn how to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush and it won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 stars because it could be a little more narrow to make a more defined contour.</li>
            <li> I was a very excited to buy this brush because of the recommendations heard about this, and they weren&#x27;t wrong, super soft but at the same time firm enough for applying foundation or facial cream, just love the finish, like porcelain, so smooth to your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not ridiculously more packed than the other brush, but it&#x27;s a gorgeous addition to my brush collection.</li>
            <li> I have recently been into cream blushes which really works well for mature skin (I am 49), and I found that this brush, because of its shape and density, does the job for me.  </li>
            <li> Wen i washed the brush all the product came out and the white bristles looked clean, however, it did take a while longer to dry because it is a kabuki.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and blends so well.</li>
            <li> IT IS SOO SOFT ON MY SKIN</li>
            <li> It is so soft to your skin and it does what it supposed to do in a really professional way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think different brushes would make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Everything was fixed within 2 hours of writing to Amazon customer service.</li>
            <li> It:&lt;br /&gt;-has soft bristles</li>
            <li> It is so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> They refunded my purchase, told me to purchase another brush from a different seller (because the original seller did not have any other F84s in stock) and select 1 day shipping.</li>
            <li> I strongly believe this product is a fake when I first received my brush</li>
            <li> It applies my make-up so evenly and smoothly that the pores on the skin hardly show.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I would probably order this directly from Sigma in the future.</li>
            <li> I am keeping it though to see how it works with my Bare Minerals foundation powder.</li>
            <li> I did not get any fall out except for the first deep cleaning which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she says it feels like the expensive one, very soft and idk she really love it</li>
            <li> I wish I can purchase the other two; possibly on my next paycheck ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Real Techniques face brush for a long time, but hearing all the constant hype on Youtube about the Sigma F80 finally convinced me to try Sigma.</li>
            <li> Because its tapered it gets into creases (around nose and such) and awkward spots really well :)</li>
            <li> When I received the brush I did a deep cleaning and waited for my new kabuki brush to dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great Customer Service experience: This brush came to me slightly damaged, which is unusual for a Sigma brush.</li>
            <li> high considering I found the same angled kabuki brush by Bellus on amazon for much less.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Sigma F80 and Real Techniques Expert Face brush for liquid foundation, and I prefer this one to the others by a long shot.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles and little to no hair has shed from the brush since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Even after washing it a few times, the bristles are very soft and brush has kept it shaped.</li>
            <li> It is the only way I apply my foundation now, and I know I will be using it for a very long time!  </li>
            <li> The old brush i used ot use left little hairs all over my face, this brush has never shed once!</li>
            <li> I have quite a few natural hair brushes but decided to try the synthetic type.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to apply the brush lighter and in soft swirls to diminish the harsh line it can draw, and it&#x27;s working well</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble blending on my chin, but this brush has completely fixed it.</li>
            <li> I am almost positive this seller/and/or/brush is a complete fake-</li>
            <li> I was debating between the angled and rounded kabuki,  I read that if you have dry skin (which I do) you should paint your makeup on,  not buff it.  </li>
            <li> If it is washed with soap and water, it takes FOREVER to dry, as it is so dense.</li>
            <li> I use it every single time I put bronzer on...</li>
            <li> :) I was duped into purchasing a MAC blush brush a while back, and though it put my blush on reasonably well, it shed horribly.</li>
            <li> the handle was loose</li>
            <li> U actually use less producer w sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> It is expensive for a single brush but  totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> The articles said to be careful with makeup made in China.</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day and spot cleaning the brushes with wet ones.</li>
            <li> This brush came faster then expected.</li>
            <li> Affordable with quality that beats any other brand.</li>
            <li> One for a friend and the other for myself..</li>
            <li> I will replace my other brushes also.</li>
            <li> I intend to buy the other brushes in this line.</li>
            <li> I have 2 other Sigma foundation brushes, but didn&#x27;t like them for applying liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> these are the same, as if not better than mac brushes.</li>
            <li> please save your money its not worth it</li>
            <li> Price was a less than MAC but</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t have waited this long to purchased this brush, wasted so much money on expensive one!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I reach for this everyday.</li>
            <li> been using for a few months</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t waste any product.  </li>
            <li> No more tugging and pulling the skin with the sponges I have used previously.  </li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few makeup brushes in the past.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s slanted also gets those hard to reach eye areas.</li>
            <li> At least now</li>
            <li> I had to have at least one of them</li>
            <li> I had to get at least one Sigma brush to understand what the buzz was about</li>
            <li> I always was frustrated with how my bronzer looked on my face &amp; didn&#x27;t know how much of it had to do with it being the wrong</li>
            <li> does - neither are bad, they are just different.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t tolerate a brush that leaves a bunch of stray hairs behind all over my face.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving it 5 starts is because there was some shedding that I found to be annoying.</li>
            <li> I am so serious!</li>
            <li> I would consider this brush to be by far the worst contouring brush I have ever used</li>
            <li> Compared to expensive Mac ones, Sigma brushes are softer, they don&#x27;t shed and apply product so well.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> makeup is made with crazy chemicals like arsenic, copper, and LEAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gotta tell you, I believe this is a fake!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Sigma!</li>
            <li> absolutely OBSESSED with this brush!</li>
            <li> I ended up being very disappointed..</li>
            <li> but at the end the quality was awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! Perfect for my Chanel Soliel bronzer :)</li>
            <li> Love this brush.Great for getting in hard to reach areas.Good quality! !!</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. Excellent quality and great price!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I finally found my go-to brush for foundation.  I love the handle. It is light and easy to use.  I use the angle of the brush to get to the sides of my nose.  The flatness of the brush allows me to stipple where I need to when building foundation. I am planning on also purchasing the smaller version of this brush P84.</li>
            <li> This brush dose exactly what it says it dose ,, i use it for foundation ..  and it applies foundation beautifully and perfectly  .. loosiing my Mac brush .... Sigma wins ..  ..</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s soft and doesn&#x27;t shed will have to buy other brushes and make my own set.</li>
            <li> This tool is my best friend!!!! I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love how the brush is angled and makes it easy to apply bronzer.</li>
            <li> I gotta tell you, I believe this is a fake! I have just spent hours reading articles like http://pumpkincat210.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/how-to-avoid-buying-fake-m-a-c-cosmetics/, only to find that SO many makeup products are being faked these days. Almost everything on ebay is a fake, and many on here, too. The reason I am writing is because I saw a crappy \\&quot;MADE IN CHINA\\&quot; sticker attached to my brush, on top of the \\&quot;MADE IN USA\\&quot; engraving on the handle. The articles said to be careful with makeup made in China. I am almost positive this seller/and/or/brush is a complete fake- the fact it broke you out no matter how lightly you pushed- is a tell tale sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake makeup is made with crazy chemicals like arsenic, copper, and LEAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return this brush in a heartbeat, but I threw away the package. At least now I know you can&#x27;t shop &#x27;anywhere&#x27; online, and get the real thing!! This goes for all makeup! BE CAREFUL, GIRLS (and boys) &lt;3</li>
            <li> I use this brush for contouring my cheek bones, both with powder and cream products. I love how dense and soft this brush is!</li>
            <li> I have the Sigma 15-pc set, the 12-pc set, the flat top and the round top synthetic brushes. Compared to expensive Mac ones, Sigma brushes are softer, they don&#x27;t shed and apply product so well. And so I just had to complete my Sigma collection and get this brush too!  I have recently been into cream blushes which really works well for mature skin (I am 49), and I found that this brush, because of its shape and density, does the job for me.  Very happy with my Sigma brush collection!</li>
            <li> Using this brush for liquid foundation, makes for a flawless look! It&#x27;s angled tip makes it easy to get into every area of your face for full coverage.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite foundation brush. I use it with my origins liquid foundation to buff it into my skin and it works great to smooth out lines and blend product. It has held up well after washing as well, it has not lost its shape and it has never shed! The old brush i used ot use left little hairs all over my face, this brush has never shed once! Love the angled shape too for getting into all the spaces of the face.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this brush! It&#x27;s so soft, it&#x27;s a dream! You can even smell the quality. Excellent to create that \\&quot;flushed cheekbones\\&quot; look. It&#x27;s my first product from Sigma, so now I want to try more! Thank you Sigma!</li>
            <li> I have quite a few natural hair brushes but decided to try the synthetic type.  I bought a well-known brand at a local cosmetic store and wasn&#x27;t impressed.  I saw this Sigma brush on Amazon and liked that it is angled and kabuki.  It is a great brush that compares with much more expensives brushes.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I am such a fan of the Sigma brushes.  I have purchased Sigma Beauty Round Top Synthetic Kabuki and the Sigma Beauty Flat Top Synthetic Kabuki previously and love them.  I had to have the last of the set.  I am so excited to have the angled top brush!!  These brushes make my makeup flawless!!  YA!!!</li>
            <li> I would consider this brush to be by far the worst contouring brush I have ever used it doesn&#x27;t blend well leaves a streaking line. I use MAC gold deposit to contour and it doesn&#x27;t blend at all I bought cheap contouring brush at Clare&#x27;s and let me tell you it blends wayyyy better than this here. I strongly believe this product is a fake when I first received my brush the handle was loose I should&#x27;ve taken that as a sign and return this brush back ASAP instead I kept my hopes up and applied some super glue to the handle worked out well but at the end the quality was awful I can&#x27;t fix quality....please save your money its not worth it you are better of buying a cheap replica at Alliexpress and get the same cheap brush for way less.</li>
            <li> this is a very good brush....... i us it for putting on bronzer and the brush is so soft THE SELLER SENT IT TO ME SO FAST AND THE SHIPPING WAS GREAT .... U SHOULD DEFINITly BUY IT [[ASIN:B0045W4X16 Sigma Beauty Angled Top Synthetic Kabuki - F84]]</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Not nearly as good as my new beauty blender, but this is a go to brush 4 sure !</li>
            <li> For those of us who cant afford the Chanel brushes, these are the next best thing. I use this one for foundation application and love how easily and smooth it makes application. I have a whole set and love everyone of them.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd brush from Sigma and I absolutely love them! Nice, sturdy brushes with soft, dense bristles that get the job done. Affordable with quality that beats any other brand. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Sigma!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. I especially love it for bronzer because it gets right into the hollows of the cheeks. It is super soft and doesn&#x27;t shed. It&#x27;s a really good brush to have in a makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush to apply blush or if u want foundation.Im inlove with Sigma brushes,amaizing products.    I totally recomend this brush for a flawless blush application.A most have in every girl makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! My makeup goes on flawlessly! Definitely recommend. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> amazeballs brush for applying your foundation. Because its tapered it gets into creases (around nose and such) and awkward spots really well :)</li>
            <li> I read the wonderful reviews about this brush and I had to get it. When I received the brush I did a deep cleaning and waited for my new kabuki brush to dry. I have had the brush for one week now and have used it with many of my products. Angled brushes work well when applying make up on the face, and this product worked magic. Felt good on my face and carried the product well on the bristles and gave an even application. I have been using it every day and spot cleaning the brushes with wet ones. I did not get any fall out except for the first deep cleaning which is to be expected. Great product! I love it!</li>
            <li> I only use Sigma brushes because they are wonderful and they get the job done beautifully and the price is reasonable.  However, as much as I love my regular set, the Sigmax brushes are my favorite.  The Kabuki line is amazing and this brush is perfect for contouring.  Well done, Sigma.</li>
            <li> Flawless finish!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking into a good foundation brush I highly recommend this product. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase. Also purchased the flat top and tapered kabuki brushes and am super excited it try them out</li>
            <li> I just received this brush and I immediately had to try it out. I needed a good brush for my foundation, I was using a Sephora stippling brush since forever and I wanted to try this brush out because of the positive reviews! This is my first Sigma brush and I really am looking forward to getting more! I absolutely LOVE it! so soft and easy to work with just what I needed and it is like I said...FABULOUS!!!! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This brush is one of the softest I&#x27;ve ever owned and hasn&#x27;t seemed to shed at all. I use it with liquid foundation as well as bronzer and it provides and smooth finish for both. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This brush is great! forgetting around my nose and under my eyes. I just love it, this Brush will always be in my collection.</li>
            <li> This brush is great to use for the application of foundation underneath the eye area. It does great at making your make up look flawless!</li>
            <li> Let me start this review by letting everyone know that this is the first time that I have purchased a sigma brush and I&#x27;m so glad that I did! Looking at the brush online and reading the description I could tell that it would be a decent brush for liquid and cream foundation. When i received it in the mail, I was impressed with the packaging and the included brush guard. As a makeup artist, I am very critical when it comes to the brushes that I use. Let me tell you guys that this brush has proven to be the BEST brush that I have ever used to apply liquid and cream foundation. The bristles are very dense and soft, providing the most even and flawless application. The angle on this brush is great for contouring if you want a diffused natural look. Wen i washed the brush all the product came out and the white bristles looked clean, however, it did take a while longer to dry because it is a kabuki. I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone just starting out to the most seasoned professional because of the ease of use and end result. Im kicking myself because I didnt buy the full set. I cant wait to try the full line!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft, but it&#x27;s also dense! It&#x27;s great for applying cream or powder blush, but can also be using as a foundation brush as well! I reach for this everyday. It&#x27;s definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> Wow, these brushes keep getting better and better-  Another great brush, this will be perfect for blush, for contouring the face, or bronzing. It will also be a great brush for mineral powers, and cream blushes. So happy with this company. The brushes are so well made, and feel so wonderful on the skin, so glad I found Sigma.</li>
            <li> I found great reviews of the flat top brush of this brand on another site, and then others said this angled one was better for getting at certain parts of your face. I had to have at least one of them so I chose this one. It really is a great brush, my foundation looks quite nice when I use it. It&#x27;s very soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Washes well. I would like to try the flat top one though, to see which I like better.  Very nice brush quality for the money. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> The product arrives in a cute bag, and theres no doubt that the quality is great!! I love the soft bristels. The size and shape are perfect for applying blush and bronzer. This is without a doubt my favourite Sigma-brush, and I&#x27;ll recommend it to my friends for sure.</li>
            <li> I finally found the right brush, love this blush brush so much! I shouldn&#x27;t have waited this long to purchased this brush, wasted so much money on expensive one! best blush I&#x27;ve ever purchased!!! will probably order more from sigma, now that I know that their brushes are such good quality!</li>
            <li> Brush did exactly as it should have done. Wished I had purchased two</li>
            <li> This brush is Incredible! I am so serious! This is my new favorite brush. Excellent Quality and very soft compact bristles! I was expecting a good brush but instead I got an excellent one. I am so satisfied and will definitely purchase more in the future! Thanks Sigma!!</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush and I love it! It is so soft and perfect for blush and bronzer. I will definitely be buying more brushes from Sigma!</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful!  I use it for foundation application and it makes the work easy and leaves flawless coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I use it for my liquid foundation and it&#x27;s perfect. The angled top is great and really gets the product where I want it. It blends really well. I would totally get this brush again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sigma brush and I must say, the quality far exceeds my expectations. I used to use a regular blush brush or my fingers to apply cream blush but neither worked as well as this F84 kabuki. It&#x27;s so soft and blends so well. I will definitely be purchasing more Sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> I only gave it a 4 stars because it could be a little more narrow to make a more defined contour. Overall it is very dense, great quality and deposits a lot of color instead of soaking it up in the brush. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and came really fast (thanks amazon!). I feel it&#x27;s better for blush than bronzer and the quality is way superior compared to other brushes in the same price range. Love it!</li>
            <li> I just received the sigma brush and its amazing i use it to apply the foundatin and work great, its soft and make your foundation look smooth and flawless, its the best brush ive ever had i recommend it to everyone, i just love it:)</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this brush!!! I use it to apply and blend liquid foundation and the synthetic bristles apply any product PERFECTLY! It&#x27;s incredibly soft and very dense. Just perfect.</li>
            <li> I have received my new angled top kabuki brush and I love it.  I use it for cream blush, it works great for contouring!!  I would purchase brushes from sigma again!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THISS! I wish I can purchase the other two; possibly on my next paycheck ;) This brush is VERY multi-functional! Most of the time, I use it for foundation. But sometimes I use it for blush or contouring! Because it&#x27;s angled, its good to get on the crevices of your face! Definitely recommend to every man and woman out there!</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BRUSH IT IS SOO SOFT ON MY SKIN AND IT APPLIES MY FOUNDATION PERFECTLY. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS BRUSH TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> I never want to use another brand of brushes again. Since I started using sigma my make up compliments have sky rocketed! This brand is worth every cent</li>
            <li> i like this one better because doesnt shed on me like the F80...It is a great foundation or a cream brush</li>
            <li> Applies liquid foundation brilliantly, giving a natural airbrushed look. Definitely my favourite foundation brush in my collection. I used to use the MAC 187 but I found this absorbed too much of the product and is better suited to apply bronzer/blush. The sigma brush requires minimum effort to achieve a flawless look. I think I may also purchase the flat and round top kabuki brushes although this is a great shape for blending around the jawline.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these brushes. One for a friend and the other for myself..Great brush..So glad that I ordered. They arrived rather quickly and I would order again from this seller. My friend loves hers as well.</li>
            <li> I got this because Jaclyn Hill (makeup artist youtube channel) kept recommending this particular brush multiple times in many of her videos. I don&#x27;t watch loads of make up videos, but she does a great job explaining makeup etc, in addition to all products involved in the application - including brushes. I brought a Sigma brush set because of her raves about them. This particular brush was not in that set (which I knew), and I didn&#x27;t buy it at that time. I loved that brush set, but I decided to get this one as well because, well, she said it was an &amp;#34;all purpose&amp;#34; brush (contour and applying foundation etc), and it&#x27;s very true. I like that It&#x27;s versatile. It also applies foundation differently than a foundation brush does - neither are bad, they are just different. I like how a foundation brush applies, but I also like how this one applies as well. You dab more than you stroke, and I feel that it does allow for a better coverage (say, I have more blemishes or acne a certain day, I think I would grab this one over my normal brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i suggest you add it to your collection!</li>
            <li> this is a perfect brush for bronzer! I use it every single time I put bronzer on...its a synthetic brush so it doesn&#x27;t absorb so much of the product and it applies smoothly! love sigma!</li>
            <li> Amazing.  I was debating between the angled and rounded kabuki,  I read that if you have dry skin (which I do) you should paint your makeup on,  not buff it.  So I got the angled.  It is amazing.  My Foundation looks flawless,  and stays all day.  I brush in downward strokes,  then stipple it (with the same brush) to blend any streak marks.</li>
            <li> This Sigma F84 is an awesome brush when applying foundation!! No streaks, blends beautifully! Feels amazing on your skin. The fact that it&#x27;s slanted also gets those hard to reach eye areas.</li>
            <li> A must have in your repertoire of make-up brushes.  Very good quality to last a long time.  It also blends well with liquid foundation.  Sigma brushes are better than Mac.</li>
            <li> I Love this brush! You can use it as a foundation brush but I use mine as a blush brush because I love the way it applies it. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I use this brush to apply a light bronzer or blush around the face. Even after washing it a few times, the bristles are very soft and brush has kept it shaped.</li>
            <li> This brush is well worth the price.  This has to be my favorite make-up accessory.  It applies my make-up so evenly and smoothly that the pores on the skin hardly show.  The bristles are so soft it almost feels like a gentle face massage.  No more tugging and pulling the skin with the sponges I have used previously.  Wish I would have had this item all along.</li>
            <li> Pefect....one of the better brushes one can buy.  I have used many over the years and this is absolutely the best I have found.  Bought it after reading the positive reviews and took a chance.  Glad I did.....feed backs are so important.  I will replace my other brushes also. Would recommend it for anyone looking for the best in brushes.</li>
            <li> Perfect for contouring! Very soft bristles and little to no hair has shed from the brush since I started using it. Sigma brushes are definitely high quality.</li>
            <li> absolutely love  love my new brush .</li>
            <li> These are my daughters favorite brushes she loves them great quality, super soft,&lt;br /&gt;for perfect application every time. Thank you Sigma</li>
            <li> great brush perfect angle on it everyone should have this brush that applies makeup. get it you will love it</li>
            <li> Love it!! I would definitely buy this again. The brush is soft and it&#x27;s perfect for contouring. If you&#x27;re hesitant don&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing amazing !,&lt;br /&gt;This is great for contouring..I use this always...I also use this if I use tapered kabuki brush for more of a defined line and then blend it out with this ...but this alone is great for contour and even blush...so soft!</li>
            <li> I already owned a rounded Sigma kabuki brush and I loved it.  I wanted another brush as a back up. These Sigma kabuki brushes are great for applying foundation. Foundation blends effortlessly. I will never use another type of foundation brush!</li>
            <li> I had to get at least one Sigma brush to understand what the buzz was about and I can honestly say that it is a delight! It is so soft to your skin and it does what it supposed to do in a really professional way.</li>
            <li> the angle of the brush really helps bring my cheeks out and doesnt break ever. been using for a few months and it&#x27;s still in great condition like it arrived.</li>
            <li> I use this for foundation every day. I originally used to rounded kabuki and gradually went over to this one. I like it a lot. I feel it blends well and doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and firm and dense and it applies foundation and CC cream very nicely. It cleans up beautifully in alcohol and dries fairly quickly when cleaned in alcohol. If it is washed with soap and water, it takes FOREVER to dry, as it is so dense.</li>
            <li> I love Sigma brushes.  I&#x27;ve been collecting them over the past 6 months and this one is another new favorite. I bought it for a blush brush and am very happy using it for blush.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush very soft and it&#x27;s great with foundation.  I really love all of the Sigma brushes that I own. I am very happy that I purchased this one, and believe me you won&#x27;t regret it if you purchase one too.</li>
            <li> This is the first Sigma brush I purchased and I love it! the bristles are soft and the size of it is good enough for either daily use or travelling. The packaging was nice, it arrived in perfect shape. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think different brushes would make much of a difference. I was wrong. This brush leaves my makeup flawless and gives me perfect coverage.  I intend to buy the other brushes in this line.</li>
            <li> These are OK, I just prefer softer brushes (Real Techniques or the BeautyBlender). I think with this one I am rubbing my face too much.</li>
            <li> The numerous 5-star reviews helped me make this excellent choice.  The brush blends my Estee Lauder cream foundation beautifully.  Great quality and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold on the fact that this is the best brush out there. I&#x27;m paranoid now to take care of it :)</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  Glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> so far so good, hope it lasts..</li>
            <li> I fell in love with my Sigma F80 brush and decided to give this a try because its bristles are made of the same synthetic material.  I figured the domed shape of the brush combined with the angle would make it great for blending in both cream and powder products, especially for contouring.  What I didn&#x27;t expect was how flawless it will work with very little effort!  With this brush I am able to achieve a flawless look fast and easy.  The brush is extremely easy to spot clean thanks to the fact that it is synthetic (I use the paper towel and MAC brush cleanser method) and it does not shed at all!  I highly recommend this for both beginners and pros!</li>
            <li> This brush is great for many different reasons. It can be used for contouring because of the angled brush, but I use this brush for foundation and it applies so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t use much product. Definitely my go to brush when applying foundation! Overall a great makeup brush for anyones makeup collection!</li>
            <li> This sigma brush is the best foundation brush I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;plus it is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. My bronzer routine is a lot easier because of it. Great buy - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use this brush daily. It has become an all-time favorite make-up purchase. I recommend it highly. Now I want the entire set!</li>
            <li> I use the brush to blend blushes on my cheeks.  It gives an air brushed effect.  The brush is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. Of all the money wasted on other brushes, this, by far is the best foundation/powder brush in the market. I can&#x27;t describe how happy I am with the result. It makes the foundation application so smooth. Great job, Sigma. You have found a new loyal customer :-)</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for everything. No hair fallout and maintain it&#x27;s shape very well! Love this and will buy again in the future!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! Great for contouring with bronzer, that&#x27;s all I use it for. Not the best brush for applying blush.</li>
            <li> So soft, and perfect for contouring cheeks.  This is my first sigma brush and since this was such a hit, I&#x27;ll be purchasing more sigma brushes in the future.</li>
            <li> this is a great base brush.</li>
            <li> I have used many methods for applying liquid foundation, ex. sponges, beauty blender, finger method, regular foundation brushes, and even other duo fibre brushes. The Sigma Beauty Angled Top Synthetic Kabuki brush is the best brush I have ever used for applying foundation!! It creates a very even application that looks like an air-brushed effect. My foundation feels lighter but looks even more full coverage when I use this brush. I have also noticed that my foundation holds up and looks better throughout the day. The bristles are also very soft! I am very happy that I purchased this make-up brush. It is the only way I apply my foundation now, and I know I will be using it for a very long time!  I would also like to say that Sigma make-up brushes are amazing!! Sigma and some MAC are the only brand of make-up brushes I use, not because of the name but because of the quality! Also, Sigma brushes are sold for a great price!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is great for applying blush on the cheek bones. I like the softness and thickness of the brush.  It applies makeup evenly on my face. I definitely recommend this brush. It is expensive for a single brush but  totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> This brush was more dense than I was used to with my MAC angled brush, which has taken some getting used to. I use this brush for contouring, which gets a little tricky because the line becomes much harsher / more defined - not something you want when trying to create a natural &amp;#34;shadow&amp;#34; effect. I&#x27;ve learned to apply the brush lighter and in soft swirls to diminish the harsh line it can draw, and it&#x27;s working well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any hairs falling out (as I did with the Sigma F20), but this may be because the brush is light in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this brush only if you&#x27;re looking for precision powder, or are willing to learn how to use it. Otherwise, it&#x27;s probably not on my must have list.</li>
            <li> absolutely OBSESSED with this brush! it is AMAZING. you can use it for putting on foundation but i mostly use it for apply bronzer and contouring. love this brush it is a must have!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, she says it feels like the expensive one, very soft and idk she really love it</li>
            <li> This brush is sooooo nice easy to use perfect for foundation feel like a diva love it I recommend this product...</li>
            <li> أنا مرة أخرى لأكثر! انها لا تحصل على أفضل من ذلك. سأفعل، وسوف نكون سعداء لشرائها مرة أخرى.&lt;br /&gt;هل أقول أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة. يا &amp;#34;حسنا أنا لا أحب هذه المجموعة الفرشاة.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few makeup brushes in the past. Some were lousy, some were decent, but none impressed me much...until now. I ran across Sigma brushes at Amazon and, after reading some reviews, I somewhat reluctantly decided to try one (the stippling brush). After owning it several months, I was so impressed that I bought two more brushes (the Angled and Round Kabuki). I LOVE ALL OF THEM! They feel wonderful on your face (almost like mink, or one of those really soft velvety blankets). They apply and blend makeup nicely. They appear to be well made, look stylish, and are priced very reasonably for the quality of the brushes. And best of all...my very favorite feature...they haven&#x27;t shed a single hair! :) I was duped into purchasing a MAC blush brush a while back, and though it put my blush on reasonably well, it shed horribly. I just can&#x27;t tolerate a brush that leaves a bunch of stray hairs behind all over my face. Yuck! Enough said. Honestly, a repeat purchase kind of says it all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love w/ my kabuki brush. I use it to apply my highlighter and it&#x27;s fantabulous!!! I received it within 2 days!</li>
            <li> I was a very excited to buy this brush because of the recommendations heard about this, and they weren&#x27;t wrong, super soft but at the same time firm enough for applying foundation or facial cream, just love the finish, like porcelain, so smooth to your face. i highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. It came fast and exactly as pictured. Soft bristles. Feels great on your cheeks. Def worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfect foundation brush</li>
            <li> This is PERFECT for bronzing. I always was frustrated with how my bronzer looked on my face &amp; didn&#x27;t know how much of it had to do with it being the wrong brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love this brush. It goes with me everywhere when I travel.</li>
            <li> Brush review: this brush is amazing. I have 2 other Sigma foundation brushes, but didn&#x27;t like them for applying liquid foundation. A friend recommended the Sigma Kabuki brushes and I selected the angled brush for my needs. I have always had trouble blending on my chin, but this brush has completely fixed it. it blended beautifully and I can apply my foundation &amp; blend it more quickly than I could when I used my fingers. I will never use another foundation brush. It&#x27;s completely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I would probably order this directly from Sigma in the future. You can usually find a 10% off code, which most likely will make it just as cheap, even after shipping costs, as Amazon. Sigma&#x27;s customer service department is just so great to work with if you have any problems that I feel more comfortable ordering directly from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Customer Service experience: This brush came to me slightly damaged, which is unusual for a Sigma brush. I normally buy my brushes directly from Sigma, but decided to get this one from Amazon because I could get free shipping. The brush was wiggly inside the metal shaft. It felt as if the wood handle would eventually come out of the shaft. I wrote to Amazon customer service and was so pleased with how quick and helpful they were. They refunded my purchase, told me to purchase another brush from a different seller (because the original seller did not have any other F84s in stock) and select 1 day shipping. They refunded my shipping costs and sent me a shipping label to return my original brush. I had been worried that since this was from a seller (that was fulfilled by Amazon) I may not get a full refund, but there were no questions asked. I already have my replacement. Everything was fixed within 2 hours of writing to Amazon customer service.</li>
            <li> Quality of this brush was great and application even. Price was a less than MAC but high considering I found the same angled kabuki brush by Bellus on amazon for much less. I would recommend the Bellus F84 over this to any one who wants to save money and not give up quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Real Techniques face brush for a long time, but hearing all the constant hype on Youtube about the Sigma F80 finally convinced me to try Sigma. I got the F84 instead because I thought I&#x27;d like the angled brush better and I love it! It&#x27;s not ridiculously more packed than the other brush, but it&#x27;s a gorgeous addition to my brush collection. This is my first Sigma brush and it won&#x27;t be my last!</li>
            <li> This is my go to favorite foundation brush.  Easily cleans up, the foundation goes on smooth and there is no feathering of the hairs!</li>
            <li> i love this brush!  it&#x27;s nice with the synthetic brushes so it doesn&#x27;t waste any product.  these are the same, as if not better than mac brushes.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best foundation brush I have found. I like to stipple with this first, then blend in. My foundation has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Love love this sigma angled kabuki brush.  I have many other sigma brushes and they are by far the best brushes for the money!  I use this brush for my bronzer when i want a more dramatic look and to create an amazing contour.  I have received numerous comments on my makeup recently and I swear it&#x27;s because of these sigma brushes.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Love the brush! Perfect for contouring. Would highly recommend! Well made and very good quality. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Best of the best tank you sygma</li>
            <li> Soft, soft brush, very pleased, but $21.00 for a brush was an expense for me, hopefully it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> best brush iv ever felt, buy from net rush, you wont be dissapointed! :) AMAZING brush its sooo soft and feels great in your hand</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for blush. It:&lt;br /&gt;-has soft bristles&lt;br /&gt;-hold rights amount of powder&lt;br /&gt;-proper weight&lt;br /&gt;-right concentration of bristles&lt;br /&gt;-does not shed</li>
            <li> I love this for my cream bronzers. I could also use this for liquid foundation if I wanted to, but I don&#x27;t prefer it for that use. It picks up product and blends it out great. It also washes easily and doesn&#x27;t shed much if at all.</li>
            <li> Sigma never disappoints. Amazing brush!! Bristles are soft and sturdy enough to stay in place to apply your blush/bronzer in the perfect place. Absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> Makes the foundation look so smooth - much better than a sponge.  I love the angled Kabuki and would def recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It gives me just the right amount of blush.</li>
            <li> This brush came faster then expected. is so soft and is great for putting on foundation. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice, quality makeup brushes. I am very pleased with this foundation brush. I use it with my liquid Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder foundation, and it makes application easy and streak free.</li>
            <li> perfect as all products from sigma!</li>
            <li> Love this brush so much</li>
            <li> I love the entire Sigma Brush line.  Great brushes, excellently made.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for foundation, it buffs it in effortlessly and leaves NO streaks.  Love it!  The bristles are super soft.  They wash up well and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I really do like this brush. The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving it 5 starts is because there was some shedding that I found to be annoying. It was mostly the first few times I used it. I really haven&#x27;t had a problem with it any more it was just that bit. Other than that it is a great soft brush.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS BRUSH FOR CONTOURING</li>
            <li> This brush is great for blending liquid foundation into the skin. I know that may not be its intended purpose, but that&#x27;s my favorite way to use it.  I previously used the Sigma F80 and Real Techniques Expert Face brush for liquid foundation, and I prefer this one to the others by a long shot.</li>
            <li> i like this brush in a way how it appeals to me rather than what i wanted it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t expect the hairs to be so dense so it&#x27;s not applying the blush how i&#x27;d like to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i guess i&#x27;ll find another use for it, but i primarily intended it for a more precise blush application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll grow on me.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Bobbi Brown Luminizing liquid foundation. I was so excited!! I ended up being very disappointed..my application looked splotchy and it irritated my skin. I think it was the Vitamin C I use with my moiturizer before applying foundation and the friction of the brush. No matter how lightly I applied pressure it just wasn&#x27;t working. I am keeping it though to see how it works with my Bare Minerals foundation powder.</li>
            <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever paid for. Worth every buck! U actually use less producer w sigma brushes. There make up is amazing also</li>
            <li> great brush, I use it too apply my Chanel Perfect Lumiere foundation! beautiful brush, very soft while being very dense! definitely getting your moneys&#x27; worth here!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush but I prefer the F80 for foundation application.  This one is great for cream blush or cream contouring.  All the Sigma Kabuki brushes work well overall.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are very easy to use. Excellent high quality. This brush is great for contour the areas of the cheeks.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  Read so many positive reviews on Youtube regarding Sigma brushes.  I have the 3DHD brush.  I prefer this one.  Very dense.  Although its recommended for blush and contouring I use it to mainly apply foundation and blush.  Sure wish Sigma would sell their individual brushes in hot pink like the 3DHD.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing for foundation and blush! It is so soft and doesn&#x27;t shed. The price is great, and the quality is better than MAC brushes!</li>
            <li> Nice brush for the price. I&#x27;ve washed it many times and no sheddding. I have used it to blend my foundation after i have dotted and rubbed it in. Also to top off some translucent setting powder. Very nice brush, I&#x27;d say comprable to my MAC ones but not as pricey. WOuld definitely buy again and different ones from Sigma.</li>
            <li> I love sigma brushes! So high end but for a considerably low price! must have! Great contour brush for your every day kit!</li>
