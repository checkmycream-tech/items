            <li>I love the dotters!</li>
            <li>They are really tiny, perfect for designs on the nails that require more than one stone &amp; the colors are great!  </li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;) great on the shipping end also!</li>
            <li>have my own technique for getting rhinestones out and on my nails.</li>
            <li>The included hand-tools are nice but the tweezers are just a bit too flexible.</li>
            <li>Nice colors</li>
            <li>Was totally excited when orderd it great price and all the gems</li>
            <li>They allow for great designs and are fun to use.</li>
            <li>you get a lot of each color enough to do lots of manicures and the container is very nice a lot better than the wheel ones that some come in and each color has its own lid very nice.</li>
            <li>Great product, exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>and sure couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s some sort of conspiracy!! :)</li>
            <li>BTW lovely rhinestones, both quality and color.</li>
            <li>- Not quite as sparkly as I hoped, more of a plastic look</li>
            <li>Love the dotter and everything else.</li>
            <li>use it all the time and love the container as well.</li>
            <li>I love the tool that you can use to pick up the rhinestones.</li>
            <li>I love all of these items.</li>
            <li>Great price for so much stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the added bonus of the dotting tools and the tweezers for the Rhinestones.</li>
            <li>The marblized dotting pens are awesome, they actually have the marbling swirls through the handle!</li>
            <li>Love the color of the rhinestones.</li>
            <li>However, I thought the dotting tools would be a more variety of sizes.</li>
            <li>It did not come with 3000 pieces, more like 1000.</li>
            <li>Im glad it came w/ dotting tools &amp; tweezers.</li>
            <li>love the sparkle</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a love item.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used several times and have been wonderful working with them.  </li>
            <li>love that it came with the sticks to pick up each piece very happy I finally got them</li>
            <li>put them on so many ways</li>
            <li>For the price it couldn&#x27;t be any better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I thought there would be more rhinestones in each section</li>
            <li>This has so many rhinestones in it that I will never run out.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I ordered the 2mm in size.  </li>
            <li>This selection is highly reccommended and assists greatly in perfection of nail designs.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers are perfect for the tiny Rhine stones, easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all pretty good quality</li>
            <li>Excited!</li>
            <li>Easy to use with nail glue and top coat.</li>
            <li>Useful complete and price range perfect.  </li>
            <li>The dotters are fine they work well and clean up nicely.</li>
            <li>Priced amazingly and it is fun to experiment with.</li>
            <li>I love all the beautiful different rhinestones!</li>
            <li>Now, they did take a couple of weeks to arrive here in the US, I&#x27;ve learned to just order a head of time and whenever it shows up early, its great.  </li>
            <li>I love the dotting tools and the tweezers for detailed easier placement of bling.</li>
            <li>specially how they look on!</li>
            <li>As expected very nice product!</li>
            <li>Stones have a bright shine and colors are vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I love getting my nails done and these make them look so much more fun.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The gems are easy to apply but even easier to fall off.</li>
            <li>These little kits are great for people who love to do there own nails</li>
            <li>The rhinestones aren&#x27;t as big as in the picture, nor is the box, BUT still very cute!</li>
            <li>That is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>light green&lt;br /&gt;215 pink&lt;</li>
            <li>The dotters are light weight</li>
            <li>Its smaller than you would think, so its great</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dirt cheap -_-</li>
            <li>It was worth the wait!    </li>
            <li>But deff worth the wait !</li>
            <li>These also came a lot faster than the expected date always makes for a happy customer</li>
            <li>The rhinestones themselves were exactly what I wanted, cant wait to have some fun with nail art :-)</li>
            <li>like it was such a good deal</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for the tools but the rhinestones are a fun bonus.  </li>
            <li>Its a good value, especially if you want all your items to arrive at one time.  </li>
            <li>Pic makes it look like the container is full</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find this exact one on my account and wanted to make sure my review went for the right company anyway</li>
            <li>The dotting tools alone are worth $4 and the tweezers will be useful!</li>
            <li>Great variety, small size to fit all nails, good quantity for low price.</li>
            <li>These are very pretty</li>
            <li>It was a large quantity and came very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love my new nail art &amp;#34;diamonds&amp;#34; they are no sworvoskys</li>
            <li>I love it that it came with tweezers new way to do designs my nails</li>
            <li>One thing a girl loves is sparkles, I&#x27;m so happy I bought this little nail.</li>
            <li>too light weight, you can&#x27;t really grip things well.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of fun with these</li>
            <li>Overall really nice.</li>
            <li>So much fun</li>
            <li>Its really worth it for the price and amount of things you purchase.</li>
            <li>Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li>Lot of fun.</li>
            <li>I loved it &amp; then I looked at other reviews</li>
            <li>they look pretty on nails just exactly the size i like!</li>
            <li>No problems, I would say look at the other products this seller has to offer, and next time I will buy more then one because it is a good quality product for the price.</li>
            <li>Heaps more rhinestones than I realised, but I am already having fun with different ideas, between them and the dotting pens.</li>
            <li>I may go for a bit bigger size next time, but these will be great for now.  </li>
            <li>Thank u very much.</li>
            <li>(Loved the little thank</li>
            <li>Came in good time considering it came from China (a little over 2 weeks) and us exactly how it looked in the picture except for one thing.  </li>
            <li>but they r really pretty not too plastic</li>
            <li>only wish we got as many rhinestones as the picture shows.</li>
            <li>I love the different size and dotting tools.!</li>
            <li>Was exactly what I had ordered.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely order from this seller again!</li>
            <li>The first time using the dotters the metal part just came out</li>
            <li>Why put 10 heads when there&#x27;s mostly the same?</li>
            <li>She is having fun changing her nails as often as she wants.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last on more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li>Okay, first of all, the box is smaller than what is pictured, &amp; I didn&#x27;t not get what is pictured.</li>
            <li>and I love that you get different colors.</li>
            <li>The dotting tools are great very sturdy and pretty mine were all different colors not all blue the tweezers I don&#x27;t really care for</li>
            <li>Great fun contained in some tiny little beads.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers are pretty handy, I previously purchased the wax pencil for picking up gemstones but it tended to smudge my polish.  </li>
            <li>My order came very fast and it was exactly what I expected and more.</li>
            <li>The stones are small and a good size for nails.  </li>
            <li>The rhinestones stick out a little futther than i expected especially for nails but good product and good sized stones.</li>
            <li>Its easy to open, and doesn&#x27;t spill everywhere.  </li>
            <li>This was a nice little selection of nail jewels.</li>
            <li>Much thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon and</li>
            <li>light blue</li>
            <li>I guess I get tence and squeeze them to much as I&#x27;ve bent them and the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; is now gone.  </li>
            <li>But for 1.00 I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>They are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I recieved my order much sooner than promised</li>
            <li>It is everything and more that I have expected.</li>
            <li>,it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my table.  </li>
            <li>I really like the colors and</li>
            <li>it is a whole set.</li>
            <li>- that said - this seller has taken every step possible to make sure their customers are getting a quality product - there isn&#x27;t much more they could do short of taping each compartment and even that isn&#x27;t a 100% guarantee that the occasional &#x27;pop&#x27; won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain for what I paid.</li>
            <li>The only reason this has a 4star and not 5 stars is due to those cheaply made tweezers, but for the money its ok.</li>
            <li>The gem colors are vibrant and the tweezers that come with are very helpful .</li>
            <li>The picture shows that each container looks full with the stones, but when i got mine it was just barley covering the bottom maybe 100 stones each... that is a total of 1,200 not 3,000.</li>
            <li>I love these small studs, and the whole set as well!</li>
            <li>but there is a decent amount of each color.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I received 5 pink dotting tools and tweezers for free with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I can shipping was normal</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really into nails &amp; don&#x27;t want to spend much on tools &amp; such, this is a must buy!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize they&#x27;d come in a different color, but pink is one of my favorite colors</li>
            <li>, Colors have a good selection, black, diamond, yellow, red, light purple, dark purple, red/purple like a wine color,</li>
            <li>dark blue&lt;br /&gt;255 light purple&lt;</li>
            <li>We use a LOT of various types and styles of cases as we do a lot of fishing and even with those, the lids can open up - this is to be expected with any kind of case like this -</li>
            <li>A little bit cheaply made but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional nail tech</li>
            <li>your imagination run wild.  </li>
            <li>I received all round stones (no weird shapes) and a pretty variety of colors (including black).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -</li>
            <li>Glad it only cost a few dollars</li>
            <li>It looks like the other colors are the same quantity, so I&#x27;m comfortable</li>
            <li>containers arent even half full.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t count the stones, but I think it&#x27;s a decent amount for such a low price.</li>
            <li>The lids will not be unexpectedly popping open by mistake.</li>
            <li>so i pushed it back in, nothing a little super glue</li>
            <li>The dotting tools come in 4 different sizes (correct me if I am wrong) and I have already done some amazing nail designs.</li>
            <li>This particular package came in a timely manner which was what amazon expected the estimated date to be.</li>
            <li>So it was not a long wait</li>
            <li>light/dark green, light/dark blue and light pink</li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas present and no other present has been so well utilized.</li>
            <li>And could only save just a little of the black, light blue and purple.</li>
            <li>Tweezers are thin but look like they will work fine.</li>

            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I love the dotters!</li>
            <li> They are really tiny, perfect for designs on the nails that require more than one stone &amp; the colors are great!  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I bought this product!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;) great on the shipping end also!</li>
            <li> have my own technique for getting rhinestones out and on my nails.</li>
            <li> The included hand-tools are nice but the tweezers are just a bit too flexible.</li>
            <li> Nice colors</li>
            <li> Was totally excited when orderd it great price and all the gems</li>
            <li> They allow for great designs and are fun to use.</li>
            <li> you get a lot of each color enough to do lots of manicures and the container is very nice a lot better than the wheel ones that some come in and each color has its own lid very nice.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> and sure couldn&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s some sort of conspiracy!! :)</li>
            <li> BTW lovely rhinestones, both quality and color.</li>
            <li> - Not quite as sparkly as I hoped, more of a plastic look</li>
            <li> Love the dotter and everything else.</li>
            <li> use it all the time and love the container as well.</li>
            <li> I love the tool that you can use to pick up the rhinestones.</li>
            <li> I love all of these items.</li>
            <li> Great price for so much stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the added bonus of the dotting tools and the tweezers for the Rhinestones.</li>
            <li> The marblized dotting pens are awesome, they actually have the marbling swirls through the handle!</li>
            <li> Love the color of the rhinestones.</li>
            <li> However, I thought the dotting tools would be a more variety of sizes.</li>
            <li> It did not come with 3000 pieces, more like 1000.</li>
            <li> Im glad it came w/ dotting tools &amp; tweezers.</li>
            <li> love the sparkle</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a love item.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used several times and have been wonderful working with them.  </li>
            <li> love that it came with the sticks to pick up each piece very happy I finally got them</li>
            <li> put them on so many ways</li>
            <li> For the price it couldn&#x27;t be any better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I thought there would be more rhinestones in each section</li>
            <li> This has so many rhinestones in it that I will never run out.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I ordered the 2mm in size.  </li>
            <li> This selection is highly reccommended and assists greatly in perfection of nail designs.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers are perfect for the tiny Rhine stones, easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all pretty good quality</li>
            <li> Excited!</li>
            <li> Easy to use with nail glue and top coat.</li>
            <li> Useful complete and price range perfect.  </li>
            <li> The dotters are fine they work well and clean up nicely.</li>
            <li> Priced amazingly and it is fun to experiment with.</li>
            <li> I love all the beautiful different rhinestones!</li>
            <li> Now, they did take a couple of weeks to arrive here in the US, I&#x27;ve learned to just order a head of time and whenever it shows up early, its great.  </li>
            <li> I love the dotting tools and the tweezers for detailed easier placement of bling.</li>
            <li> specially how they look on!</li>
            <li> As expected very nice product!</li>
            <li> Stones have a bright shine and colors are vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I love getting my nails done and these make them look so much more fun.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The gems are easy to apply but even easier to fall off.</li>
            <li> These little kits are great for people who love to do there own nails</li>
            <li> The rhinestones aren&#x27;t as big as in the picture, nor is the box, BUT still very cute!</li>
            <li> That is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> light green&lt;br /&gt;215 pink&lt;</li>
            <li> The dotters are light weight</li>
            <li> Its smaller than you would think, so its great</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dirt cheap -_-</li>
            <li> It was worth the wait!    </li>
            <li> But deff worth the wait !</li>
            <li> These also came a lot faster than the expected date always makes for a happy customer</li>
            <li> The rhinestones themselves were exactly what I wanted, cant wait to have some fun with nail art :-)</li>
            <li> like it was such a good deal</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for the tools but the rhinestones are a fun bonus.  </li>
            <li> Its a good value, especially if you want all your items to arrive at one time.  </li>
            <li> Pic makes it look like the container is full</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find this exact one on my account and wanted to make sure my review went for the right company anyway</li>
            <li> The dotting tools alone are worth $4 and the tweezers will be useful!</li>
            <li> Great variety, small size to fit all nails, good quantity for low price.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty</li>
            <li> It was a large quantity and came very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love my new nail art &amp;#34;diamonds&amp;#34; they are no sworvoskys</li>
            <li> I love it that it came with tweezers new way to do designs my nails</li>
            <li> One thing a girl loves is sparkles, I&#x27;m so happy I bought this little nail.</li>
            <li> too light weight, you can&#x27;t really grip things well.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of fun with these</li>
            <li> Overall really nice.</li>
            <li> So much fun</li>
            <li> Its really worth it for the price and amount of things you purchase.</li>
            <li> Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li> Lot of fun.</li>
            <li> I loved it &amp; then I looked at other reviews</li>
            <li> they look pretty on nails just exactly the size i like!</li>
            <li> No problems, I would say look at the other products this seller has to offer, and next time I will buy more then one because it is a good quality product for the price.</li>
            <li> Heaps more rhinestones than I realised, but I am already having fun with different ideas, between them and the dotting pens.</li>
            <li> I may go for a bit bigger size next time, but these will be great for now.  </li>
            <li> Thank u very much.</li>
            <li> (Loved the little thank</li>
            <li> Came in good time considering it came from China (a little over 2 weeks) and us exactly how it looked in the picture except for one thing.  </li>
            <li> but they r really pretty not too plastic</li>
            <li> only wish we got as many rhinestones as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I love the different size and dotting tools.!</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I had ordered.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely order from this seller again!</li>
            <li> The first time using the dotters the metal part just came out</li>
            <li> Why put 10 heads when there&#x27;s mostly the same?</li>
            <li> She is having fun changing her nails as often as she wants.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last on more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Okay, first of all, the box is smaller than what is pictured, &amp; I didn&#x27;t not get what is pictured.</li>
            <li> and I love that you get different colors.</li>
            <li> The dotting tools are great very sturdy and pretty mine were all different colors not all blue the tweezers I don&#x27;t really care for</li>
            <li> Great fun contained in some tiny little beads.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers are pretty handy, I previously purchased the wax pencil for picking up gemstones but it tended to smudge my polish.  </li>
            <li> My order came very fast and it was exactly what I expected and more.</li>
            <li> The stones are small and a good size for nails.  </li>
            <li> The rhinestones stick out a little futther than i expected especially for nails but good product and good sized stones.</li>
            <li> Its easy to open, and doesn&#x27;t spill everywhere.  </li>
            <li> This was a nice little selection of nail jewels.</li>
            <li> Much thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon and</li>
            <li> light blue</li>
            <li> I guess I get tence and squeeze them to much as I&#x27;ve bent them and the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; is now gone.  </li>
            <li> But for 1.00 I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> They are very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I recieved my order much sooner than promised</li>
            <li> It is everything and more that I have expected.</li>
            <li> ,it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my table.  </li>
            <li> I really like the colors and</li>
            <li> it is a whole set.</li>
            <li> - that said - this seller has taken every step possible to make sure their customers are getting a quality product - there isn&#x27;t much more they could do short of taping each compartment and even that isn&#x27;t a 100% guarantee that the occasional &#x27;pop&#x27; won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain for what I paid.</li>
            <li> The only reason this has a 4star and not 5 stars is due to those cheaply made tweezers, but for the money its ok.</li>
            <li> The gem colors are vibrant and the tweezers that come with are very helpful .</li>
            <li> The picture shows that each container looks full with the stones, but when i got mine it was just barley covering the bottom maybe 100 stones each... that is a total of 1,200 not 3,000.</li>
            <li> I love these small studs, and the whole set as well!</li>
            <li> but there is a decent amount of each color.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received 5 pink dotting tools and tweezers for free with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I can shipping was normal</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really into nails &amp; don&#x27;t want to spend much on tools &amp; such, this is a must buy!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize they&#x27;d come in a different color, but pink is one of my favorite colors</li>
            <li> , Colors have a good selection, black, diamond, yellow, red, light purple, dark purple, red/purple like a wine color,</li>
            <li> dark blue&lt;br /&gt;255 light purple&lt;</li>
            <li> We use a LOT of various types and styles of cases as we do a lot of fishing and even with those, the lids can open up - this is to be expected with any kind of case like this -</li>
            <li> A little bit cheaply made but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional nail tech</li>
            <li> your imagination run wild.  </li>
            <li> I received all round stones (no weird shapes) and a pretty variety of colors (including black).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -</li>
            <li> Glad it only cost a few dollars</li>
            <li> It looks like the other colors are the same quantity, so I&#x27;m comfortable</li>
            <li> containers arent even half full.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t count the stones, but I think it&#x27;s a decent amount for such a low price.</li>
            <li> The lids will not be unexpectedly popping open by mistake.</li>
            <li> so i pushed it back in, nothing a little super glue</li>
            <li> The dotting tools come in 4 different sizes (correct me if I am wrong) and I have already done some amazing nail designs.</li>
            <li> This particular package came in a timely manner which was what amazon expected the estimated date to be.</li>
            <li> So it was not a long wait</li>
            <li> light/dark green, light/dark blue and light pink</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas present and no other present has been so well utilized.</li>
            <li> And could only save just a little of the black, light blue and purple.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are thin but look like they will work fine.</li>
            <li> These will last a long time for decorating.</li>
            <li> Only com is it took long to arrive.</li>
            <li> The product shipped earlier than I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that all the stones were neatly packaged (contrary to some other reviews).</li>
            <li> The dotting tools came with 5 different sizes on one end and on the other, sides are the same sizes.</li>
            <li> considering it had to come a long way.</li>
            <li> but it took so long to get here over a month which I didn&#x27;t like and</li>
            <li> (Pink, Blue, Yellow, White &amp; Green)</li>
            <li> the diamonds/jewls are so tiny thought they were a little bigger</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother to count every single one, I would say 3K is about the amount there.</li>
            <li> The delivery was prompt and actually came a few days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I received everything that said would come in, none of the rhinestones loose.</li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t going to fall loose and get all over everything else.</li>
            <li> Long story short, we counted, there were 75 stones in each of the 12 little sections.  </li>
            <li> but came much smaller than the ones I had previously.</li>
            <li> Took about 3 and a half weeks since I ordered, expected delivery between July 1St - 23rd, but it came on the 2nd!</li>
            <li> You still have to be careful and coordinated to pull this off.</li>
            <li> stick n could not pick up the heavy bigger studs now</li>
            <li> This product arrived before expected and all of the rhinestones were still contained in the plastic container.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> One end comes in the same size as the other five, however, the other end come in small to big.    </li>
            <li> so it wasnt a total waste of money</li>
            <li> The tools came in pink.</li>
            <li> Other than that, everything works well.</li>
            <li> I was antacipating this item due to tweezers that came with them for the rhinestones.  </li>
            <li> the rhinestones were in the 12 compartment container which did keep the color separated from each other.</li>
            <li> Entirely too small</li>
            <li> Rhinestones on the other hand is what brought my rating down.</li>
            <li> Its so hard to open that I ended up breaking my nails.</li>
            <li> I got little plastic bows of different colors, no more than 5 apiece.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;230 dark purple</li>
            <li> saying I got at least 3,000 total.  </li>
            <li> but on the plus side it did arrive only a day late.</li>
            <li> A few pink rhinestones were spilled out of the container but the plastic package it was in caught them.  </li>
            <li> they do fall off within a few days if you dont coat them every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but there was like half of it.</li>
            <li> Delivery lit was a few days less that seller&#x27;s ETA</li>
            <li> Some of the rhinestones fell out of their little container, but no biggie.</li>
            <li> I want to know is, how in the world do they ship this stuff from Hong Kong, through customs, for so little??</li>
            <li> the tweezers help I used to use the little pick up</li>
            <li> Also got this in a little over a week.&lt;br /&gt;223</li>
            <li> Will work for the little ones</li>
            <li> but you will not receive as many rhinestones as it seems in the pics I&#x27;ve read other reviews and seen others were disappointed don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> : /</li>
            <li> small amount of rhinestones.</li>
            <li> , I mean I guess I know that 2mm is small</li>
            <li> but I will admit the package is slighly hard to get into..</li>
            <li> Because some people complained about not getting 3,000 rhinestones, I did a sample count of one color</li>
            <li> The tweezers I use for my fimo cutting and for rhinestones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and shocked.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> but the tweezers were rusty :-(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have a lot of fun with these and sure couldn&#x27;t beat the price. Delivery lit was a few days less that seller&#x27;s ETA so that was a plus too!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it to add designs to my nail.  The different colors help so that I can add different rhinestones when I apply different nail polishes</li>
            <li> This is a good set to purchase, it has just about everything you need to get started designing nails.  The tweezers are pretty handy, I previously purchased the wax pencil for picking up gemstones but it tended to smudge my polish.  You still have to be careful and coordinated to pull this off.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail and it looks just like the picture. Some of the rhinestones fell out of their little container, but no biggie. Tweezers are thin but look like they will work fine. There are 5 dotting tools but only 5 or six different sizes on the ends, not the 10 I was expecting. Again, no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I want to know is, how in the world do they ship this stuff from Hong Kong, through customs, for so little?? I think it&#x27;s some sort of conspiracy!! :)</li>
            <li> Not bad. rhinestones were scattered within the package.  Beautiful colors.  My daughter loved the look on her nails after I did them</li>
            <li> I am writing this review under my boyfriends name cause he ordered it for me and I couldn&#x27;t find this exact one on my account and wanted to make sure my review went for the right company anyway I was very happy with this purchase but want to state a couple things to let buyers know about. These little kits are great for people who love to do there own nails but you will not receive as many rhinestones as it seems in the pics I&#x27;ve read other reviews and seen others were disappointed don&#x27;t get me wrong you get a lot of each color enough to do lots of manicures and the container is very nice a lot better than the wheel ones that some come in and each color has its own lid very nice. The dotting tools are great very sturdy and pretty mine were all different colors not all blue the tweezers I don&#x27;t really care for but I&#x27;m sure they work great doesn&#x27;t affecting my review cause I don&#x27;t have a problem with them its just I don&#x27;t need them for the rhinestones have my own technique for getting rhinestones out and on my nails. So for the price can&#x27;t beat it a great deal and kit. These also came a lot faster than the expected date always makes for a happy customer</li>
            <li> Useful complete and price range perfect.  This selection is highly reccommended and assists greatly in perfection of nail designs.  Try it to appreciate it.  Much thanks</li>
            <li> Loved everything about this product but still giving 3 stars because of the box of the rhinestones. Its so hard to open that I ended up breaking my nails. Finally have to use the tweezer which came along to open it. I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a part of the deal... BTW lovely rhinestones, both quality and color.</li>
            <li> This was a nice little selection of nail jewels. I didn&#x27;t count the stones, but I think it&#x27;s a decent amount for such a low price. I received all round stones (no weird shapes) and a pretty variety of colors (including black).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - Great variety, small size to fit all nails, good quantity for low price. Perfect starter kit for learning how to use jewels.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Not quite as sparkly as I hoped, more of a plastic look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: The dotting tools are very nice!</li>
            <li> the tool helps design my kids and my along with the tweezers for adding the jewels. and will be using them for a wedding party</li>
            <li> Its a great deal. Everything its like advertise. Love the dotter and everything else. I recommend it to everyone who loves to decorate their nails.</li>
            <li> Came in good time considering it came from China (a little over 2 weeks) and us exactly how it looked in the picture except for one thing.  The dot tools are actually each a different color making them easier to tell apart!  This is a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Great fun contained in some tiny little beads.  The included hand-tools are nice but the tweezers are just a bit too flexible.</li>
            <li> I love my new nail art &amp;#34;diamonds&amp;#34; they are no sworvoskys but they r really pretty not too plastic like it was such a good deal the dotting pens alone are like 10$ at the nail store n the tweezers help I used to use the little pick up stick n could not pick up the heavy bigger studs now I can shipping was normal n the package was perfect  I&#x27;m 100% happy I ordered this p.s I&#x27;m a professional nail tech so yes these are things I use a lot ! Thanks amazon and</li>
            <li> use it all the time and love the container as well. the tweezers are great and the dotting tools are so cute.</li>
            <li> I am trying out the nail art as a hobby and for me this was good place to start out.</li>
            <li> I loved it &amp; then I looked at other reviews &amp; I seen one where it said all the rhinestones werent there so I went &amp; counted all of mine. so all together I got 2882 rhinestones. They owe me 118 rhinestones. Also got this in a little over a week.&lt;br /&gt;223 green&lt;br /&gt;228 fuchsia&lt;br /&gt;252 black&lt;br /&gt;278 light blue&lt;br /&gt;268 dark blue&lt;br /&gt;255 light purple&lt;br /&gt;230 dark purple&lt;br /&gt;220 light green&lt;br /&gt;215 pink&lt;br /&gt;218 orange&lt;br /&gt;276 clear&lt;br /&gt;219 red</li>
            <li> Overall really nice. Tweezers work well. Rhinestone are good quality for price. Dotting tools are good. only wish we got as many rhinestones as the picture shows. containers arent even half full. : /</li>
            <li> I love these small studs, and the whole set as well! When the studs came in those, 3 of the lids were open. And could only save just a little of the black, light blue and purple.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this purchase. The price of this stuff was awesome considering what you get. It&#x27;s all pretty good quality and I didn&#x27;t even realize that I was getting some dotting tools with the rienstones so that was a really nice surprise when they came lol</li>
            <li> ! I received the rhinestones...and  immediately I noticed that some of the stones where outside the container. Also the stones are very tiny.</li>
            <li> Heaps more rhinestones than I realised, but I am already having fun with different ideas, between them and the dotting pens. Arrived in great time, as well</li>
            <li> I have not used the dotting tools yet but they are made well and I can see no problem using them.  The stones are small and a good size for nails.  Stones have a bright shine and colors are vibrant.  The tweezers I use for my fimo cutting and for rhinestones they were perfecy but while using to cut my fimo canes I guess I get tence and squeeze them to much as I&#x27;ve bent them and the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; is now gone.  But for grabbing the stones they were perfect!</li>
            <li> LOVE! Heeeey! Bling in all colors! Our toes, nails, neighbors, friends, relatives... I may even bling my Chihuahua&#x27;s nails!!! Excited!</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for the tools but the rhinestones are a fun bonus.  Because some people complained about not getting 3,000 rhinestones, I did a sample count of one color (I wasn&#x27;t going to count all of them).  When I reached 200, I stopped, and there were still a lot of that color left.  It looks like the other colors are the same quantity, so I&#x27;m comfortable saying I got at least 3,000 total.  The colors are nice and bright, and the tools do what I need them to do.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for someone like me who is a novice at nail art, but does not want to head to the nail salon every time I feel like adding something to my manicure. Priced amazingly and it is fun to experiment with.</li>
            <li> One thing a girl loves is sparkles, I&#x27;m so happy I bought this little nail. Perfect for anyone at any nail art skill set.</li>
            <li> Great price for so many sparkles and colors  The price was good and would definately order again.  So much fun</li>
            <li> Nice colors but came much smaller than the ones I had previously. A little bit cheaply made but what do you expect lol. I like the case they came in and good deal for the tools that came with it too.</li>
            <li> I love all the beautiful different rhinestones! I love the different size and dotting tools.! I love the tool that you can use to pick up the rhinestones. I think this was a great deal. I love all of these items. I use them all.</li>
            <li> reached perfectly, which is what I got paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good I will continue purchasing this product has been very good</li>
            <li> Love! Great price for so much stuff. Was exactly what I had ordered. Thank you so much! I love the dotters!</li>
            <li> Love the added bonus of the dotting tools and the tweezers for the Rhinestones. These will last a long time for decorating.</li>
            <li> Just got mine in the mail today! Took about 3 and a half weeks since I ordered, expected delivery between July 1St - 23rd, but it came on the 2nd! So it was not a long wait considering it had to come a long way. The rhinestones aren&#x27;t as big as in the picture, nor is the box, BUT still very cute! The marblized dotting pens are awesome, they actually have the marbling swirls through the handle! I love this product and will definitely order from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Great for your manicure.</li>
            <li> The dotters are fine they work well and clean up nicely. The first time using the dotters the metal part just came out so i pushed it back in, nothing a little super glue wont fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rhinestones on the other hand is what brought my rating down. It does not look at all like the picture. The picture shows that each container looks full with the stones, but when i got mine it was just barley covering the bottom maybe 100 stones each... that is a total of 1,200 not 3,000. The stones work/look good on my nails they do fall off within a few days if you dont coat them every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: Shipping takes what feels like FOREVER!</li>
            <li> Love the color of the rhinestones. However, I thought the dotting tools would be a more variety of sizes. There&#x27;s only three different sizes among the 10 sides. Was disappointed about that. Why put 10 heads when there&#x27;s mostly the same?</li>
            <li> You do NOT get 3,000 rhinestones, maybe 1,000 (maybe). The tweezers and dotting tools are great though! Still not the best.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because there are many colored pieces for a great price but I will admit the package is slighly hard to get into..</li>
            <li> It did not come with 3000 pieces, more like 1000. But for 1.00 I can&#x27;t really complain. The dotting tools were great!</li>
            <li> This product does not come with the 3000 pieces that the name boasts. There were MAYBE 150 of each color.</li>
            <li> For the price you get a lot of product. The rhinestones stick out a little futther than i expected especially for nails but good product and good sized stones.</li>
            <li> This product arrived before expected and all of the rhinestones were still contained in the plastic container. I would say there is definitely not 3000 of them but there is a decent amount of each color. The dotting tools alone are worth $4 and the tweezers will be useful!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, and my granddaughter seems to be very happy with the product. Seems to be a successful purchase.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I received this package about a month after I ordered it. It was worth the wait!    The tweezers are perfect for the tiny Rhine stones, easy to handle.  The Rhine stones come in twelve different colors (as shown in the picture.) no colors were repeated. I didn&#x27;t bother to count every single one, I would say 3K is about the amount there. They are really tiny, perfect for designs on the nails that require more than one stone &amp; the colors are great!  Five dotting tools came with the set, I thought I would get them all blue like in the picture but they actually came in different colors. (Pink, Blue, Yellow, White &amp; Green) They are very sturdy. One end comes in the same size as the other five, however, the other end come in small to big.    For not even $4, this is a great buy. Can&#x27;t complain at all! If you&#x27;re really into nails &amp; don&#x27;t want to spend much on tools &amp; such, this is a must buy!</li>
            <li> I received everything that said would come in, none of the rhinestones loose. I received 5 pink dotting tools and tweezers for free with this purchase. Its really worth it for the price and amount of things you purchase.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my niece for Chrismtas and she loves it!  She is having fun changing her nails as often as she wants.</li>
            <li> I recieved my order much sooner than promised so that was a plus but I dont think my order had the 3000 stones as stated maybe about 2000. Glad it only cost a few dollars so it wasnt a total waste of money Im glad it came w/ dotting tools &amp; tweezers.</li>
            <li> Have already made happy clients by using this set. It is everything and more that I have expected. I love it and will be ordering more from this seller!!!</li>
            <li> This particular package came in a timely manner which was what amazon expected the estimated date to be. The rhinestones are pretty small, but plentiful and came in the container as shown in the picture. Everything was included that the seller shows in the picture. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was under the impression that the dotting tools would have 10 different sizes, but that is not the case. The dotting tools came with 5 different sizes on one end and on the other, sides are the same sizes. Other than that, everything works well.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal, it comes with everything it says it will and for a great price. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy if you need dotting tools or tweezers, and the gems come in a convenient case.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are great. love the sparkle</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a love item.  I was antacipating this item due to tweezers that came with them for the rhinestones.  I figured it would make them easier to handle.  This is the case if its bigger rhinestones, but not the smaller ones.  Its a good value, especially if you want all your items to arrive at one time.  Now, they did take a couple of weeks to arrive here in the US, I&#x27;ve learned to just order a head of time and whenever it shows up early, its great.  It arrived earlier than the estimated time.  The dotters are light weight and I&#x27;ve used several times and have been wonderful working with them.  I like the case that these rhinestones came in.  I can reuse it.  That is a huge plus.  Its easy to open, and doesn&#x27;t spill everywhere.  Its smaller than you would think, so its great,it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my table.  I also use the dotters to place these rhinestones, so I would recommend this to someone who is looking for these items combined.  If you are getting this just for the tweezers, I would so pass on this, they are lightweight, but too light weight, you can&#x27;t really grip things well.  The only reason this has a 4star and not 5 stars is due to those cheaply made tweezers, but for the money its ok.</li>
            <li> Pic makes it look like the container is full but it is not. small amount of rhinestones. Will work for the little ones</li>
            <li> love that it came with the sticks to pick up each piece very happy I finally got them</li>
            <li> all the items was like it was stated and no unwelcome surprises. the rhinestones were in the 12 compartment container which did keep the color separated from each other.</li>
            <li> My order came very fast and it was exactly what I expected and more. I am very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> much smaller than I thought, I mean I guess I know that 2mm is small but theyre perfect for flowers, Colors have a good selection, black, diamond, yellow, red, light purple, dark purple, red/purple like a wine color, light/dark green, light/dark blue and light pink</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters for Christmas and the quality is great and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;) great on the shipping end also! Packed nice and arrived in a short period of time!</li>
            <li> I love getting my nails done and these make them look so much more fun. I like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my nail tech.  It arrived, I took it for my appointment this morning and gave it to her, telling her there were 3,000 stones.  Long story short, we counted, there were 75 stones in each of the 12 little sections.  That is 900, NOT 3000.  I am contacting Amazon.  Replace or refund!  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed and shocked.  This type of thing never happened to me before from Amazon.  I realize it isn&#x27;t Amazon, it&#x27;s their supplier but.....</li>
            <li> Was totally excited when orderd it great price and all the gems but it took so long to get here over a month which I didn&#x27;t like and the diamonds/jewls are so tiny thought they were a little bigger but it&#x27;s good for the price and I like how they were separated</li>
            <li> Great product, great value and the price is a bargain. No problems, I would say look at the other products this seller has to offer, and next time I will buy more then one because it is a good quality product for the price.</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are nice and the case is great and i like the marbling tools but the tweezers were rusty :-( but on the plus side it did arrive only a day late.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Compact case.  Great selection of color.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> As expected very nice product! Thank u very much. I really like the colors and specially how they look on!</li>
            <li> Love the rhinestones!! The delivery was prompt and actually came a few days earlier than expected. The rhinestones themselves were exactly what I wanted, cant wait to have some fun with nail art :-)</li>
            <li> Came on time packed well look good it is a whole set. stones, tools, tweezers.Easy to use with nail glue and top coat. put them on so many ways cause has lots of diffent color stones,could not do it with out the tool and didn,t have to buy,came with it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I bought this product! It&#x27;s a great deal, you get dotting tools, rhinestones, and tweezers to pick up the rhinestones all at a very good price. The product shipped earlier than I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that all the stones were neatly packaged (contrary to some other reviews). The dotting tools come in 4 different sizes (correct me if I am wrong) and I have already done some amazing nail designs. Will definitely be buying again soon!</li>
            <li> The gems are easy to apply but even easier to fall off. They don&#x27;t last on more than 2 days.  However the nail pens are great. They allow for great designs and are fun to use.</li>
            <li> It was a large quantity and came very quickly. I didn&#x27;t realize that you needed glue or something for the rhinestones, but just a heads up you may want to get some of that as well.</li>
            <li> Nicce variety.  Great tools.  Everything you need to bling out yuor nails.&lt;br /&gt;Let your imagination run wild.  Lot of fun.</li>
            <li> So cheap and so perfect! I use there all the time not only for my nails but also for make up ! I&#x27;ve had mine for about 6 months now and it seems like I haven&#x27;t even put a dent in it. The gem colors are vibrant and the tweezers that come with are very helpful . For the price it couldn&#x27;t be any better. I will def be buying these again!!...once I run out which seems like never!</li>
            <li> I love it that it came with tweezers new way to do designs my nails #happy love dotting tools bye</li>
            <li> Item came 2 1/2 weeks prior to scheduled delivery.  Great product, exactly as pictured. Don&#x27;t quite think there&#x27;s 3000 pieces but for the price I paid, I&#x27;m more than satisfied with this product!!! They look great on my clients and my daughfers nails!!!!</li>
            <li> Okay, first of all, the box is smaller than what is pictured, &amp; I didn&#x27;t not get what is pictured. I got little plastic bows of different colors, no more than 5 apiece. The only reason I&#x27;m not going thru the hassle of calling the seller is cusz it&#x27;s dirt cheap -_-</li>
            <li> Only com is it took long to arrive. But deff worth the wait !</li>
            <li> Entirely too small and I don&#x27;t believe there is anywhere close to 3000 of them.</li>
            <li> I love it. I highly recommend it. I got this as a Christmas present and no other present has been so well utilized.</li>
            <li> I thought there would be more rhinestones in each section but there was like half of it. Really good though</li>
            <li> This has so many rhinestones in it that I will never run out. I love the dotting tools and the tweezers for detailed easier placement of bling.</li>
            <li> Great Nail Art Set!  Each piece was packaged individually and the rhinestone case was even put in plastic and heat sealed so should something fall out of the plastic case (which can happen with any type of case like this), it wasn&#x27;t going to fall loose and get all over everything else. 5 stars to this seller for taking those extra steps to insure customer satisfaction!! I&#x27;d like to emphasize the rhinestone case. We use a LOT of various types and styles of cases as we do a lot of fishing and even with those, the lids can open up - this is to be expected with any kind of case like this - I&#x27;ve even had it happen with my weekly med case - that said - this seller has taken every step possible to make sure their customers are getting a quality product - there isn&#x27;t much more they could do short of taping each compartment and even that isn&#x27;t a 100% guarantee that the occasional &#x27;pop&#x27; won&#x27;t happen. This is a great nail art set and I highly recommend it. (Loved the little thank you card too)</li>
            <li> I recieved this item in great shape.  A few pink rhinestones were spilled out of the container but the plastic package it was in caught them.  The container is well made.  They are pretty small so I&#x27;m glad I ordered the 2mm in size.  I may go for a bit bigger size next time, but these will be great for now.  The dotting tools are very nice along with the tweezers.  I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> good product and great price :) very happy w/this purchase. they look pretty on nails just exactly the size i like!</li>
            <li> These are very pretty and I love that you get different colors. But the diamonds r a bit big. Especially for smaller nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happier with this than I thought I&#x27;d be. The tools came in pink. I didn&#x27;t realize they&#x27;d come in a different color, but pink is one of my favorite colors so I&#x27;m not complaining. The container for the stones is made well. The lids will not be unexpectedly popping open by mistake. The tweezers are perfect as well. I really can&#x27;t complain for what I paid.</li>
