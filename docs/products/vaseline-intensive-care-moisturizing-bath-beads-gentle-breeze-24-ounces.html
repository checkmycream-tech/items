            <li>This is great in a nice, warm bath and the price is much lower than any store near me.</li>
            <li>bubble bath is easy to find everywhere....</li>
            <li>IT arrived new and the boxes were in really good condition.</li>
            <li>It was works fine.</li>
            <li>I Quickly discovered that Walgreens carries a bath bead called Studio 35 that works even better than Vaseline.</li>
            <li>and this immediately moisturized my skin, Never oily and lightly scented.</li>
            <li>When I get out of the bath, my skin feels silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy clean from tub.</li>
            <li>I use it because it keeps the bathtub clean without my having to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline Intensive Care Bath Beads is the perfect bath product for use where the water is hard like mine is.</li>
            <li>The product itself is of coarse good quality, but the price knocked my girdle off...</li>
            <li>Smells great and really does make a noticeable different in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly &amp; the box wasn&#x27;t damaged at all.</li>
            <li>and i enjoy a hot extended bath with the bubbles and all that jazz, and this just did not do anything for me, and i&#x27;m not saying i should have better understood the product, but i found what i wanted in shop rite, for example, and normally i would go all draconian on me to first finish up all this stuff, but i got no pushback from my conscious when i chose this new product and decided i didn&#x27;t even want to mix them.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Simple pleasures. :)</li>
            <li>I do much of my shopping on Amazon, but this is robbery!</li>
            <li>I live in Alaska which is REALLY dry, especially in the winter; this product is a great addition to my evening bath.</li>
            <li>After a bath, my body feels super soft.</li>
            <li>I have always loved these bath beads but they have become hard to find.</li>
            <li>I am a real guy , This winter dryness has me tossing all night ,itching and scratching  .I</li>
            <li>/&gt;If baths didn&#x27;t cost so much, I would even bathe in this just to soften</li>
            <li>These moisturize really well.</li>
            <li>Something about the fragrance combined with the way by body feels in the silky smooth water simply washes away my stress.</li>
            <li>I feel that I don&#x27;t particularly feel very moisturized by it.</li>
            <li>I get pretty clear bags pour in the Vaseline Intensive Care Bath Beads, attach ribbons.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I have to use A LOT in order to get the full effect of amazingness.</li>
            <li>but enough to last through many baths.  </li>
            <li>you are like my wife and just have to take a bath everyday. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>you know, i live alone</li>
            <li>but these bath beads are really hard to find and they&#x27;re much better then bubble bath.</li>
            <li>I recommend anyone looking for a fragrant, soft water experience to try this product.</li>
            <li>This product has been very helpful soothing my skin during my daily baths</li>
            <li>I never get dry skin thanks to these bath beads.</li>
            <li>I saw out at dollar General for 2$+..</li>
            <li>I have a crazy busy life, just like most of US in this modern world.</li>
            <li>I used a too much the first time and it made my skin feel just a little bit filmy - be aware that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The mild fragerance replaces the chemical odor of the hard water and the product eliminates all rings and build up in the tub.</li>

            <li> Time to pamper my dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry from an allergic reaction I&#x27;ve had to a detergent</li>
            <li> not too oily, won&#x27;t leave marks as other bead with plastic shell.</li>
            <li> I did a search for bath oil beads and this product (along with other scents) came up.</li>
            <li> Try some of the other scents&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth paying the shipping to return.  </li>
            <li> It did give a slightly oily feel to the water, so I will give it credit for that.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product in the grocery store or drug store for so much less.  </li>
            <li> They only run a little over $2 a box!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for the little marble-sized balls of oil, these are not them.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the scent is, but it&#x27;s not a good one</li>
            <li> but, I guess I read the price wrong.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a terrible product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Vaseline Intensive Care Moisturizing Bath Beads are great at helping to keep your skin from drying out in winter.  Plus it makes your bath water feel like silk.</li>
            <li> This product is great!!!  However, go to your nearest fFamily Dollar store and buy it for $2.50 a box.</li>
            <li> It was alright. It made the water green, so that&#x27;s weird... And it made my legs itchy (probably from shaving before using this. It was okay, though. NOT A BUBBLE BATH!</li>
            <li> I am a real guy , This winter dryness has me tossing all night ,itching and scratching  .I give my self a soak before my shower at night.A great relief .But I have to hide the box .LOL</li>
            <li> This bath powder is the best &#x27;take me away&#x27; product I&#x27;ve ever found on the market.  I recommend anyone looking for a fragrant, soft water experience to try this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite of the scents but the products are identical in quality- my skin is silky soft and I smell delightful. I live in Alaska which is REALLY dry, especially in the winter; this product is a great addition to my evening bath. Husband has also started using it for the same purpose.</li>
            <li> I use it every day. not too oily, won&#x27;t leave marks as other bead with plastic shell. very good price.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned before...I love this product and order it in bulk. IT is the only thing out there that actually works for me. IT arrived new and the boxes were in really good condition.</li>
            <li> way overpriced -- but product is out of circulation at this point</li>
            <li> This product has been very helpful soothing my skin during my daily baths</li>
            <li> This is not bubble bath...bubble bath is easy to find everywhere....but these bath beads are really hard to find and they&#x27;re much better then bubble bath. They make you feel silky all over and it lasts. I never get dry skin thanks to these bath beads.</li>
            <li> The product itself is of coarse good quality, but the price knocked my girdle off...after I bought it here I saw out at dollar General for 2$+..</li>
            <li> Could not find this product anywhere close to home.&lt;br /&gt;Love the subscribe and save a- now I never run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m goona go ahead and call this a miracle bath. My skin was very dry from an allergic reaction I&#x27;ve had to a detergent and this immediately moisturized my skin, Never oily and lightly scented. Simply a  pleasure to bathe in.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this was the case when I purchased them.  I was looking for the little marble-sized balls of oil, these are not them.  Not worth paying the shipping to return.  It would be nice if the description of the product had been more helpful!</li>
            <li> I did a search for bath oil beads and this product (along with other scents) came up. I was thinking about the beads that contain oil but this is like a granular powder, or ground bath salts, not the bath oil beads I was looking for. The scent is very, very strong and overpowering so if you have any tendency toward allergies, I would avoid it. It did give a slightly oily feel to the water, so I will give it credit for that. However, I do not think it should be called &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; because that is not traditionally what bath beads meant at one time. I would not order this again as this is not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My sister and mom used these all the time a long ways back..&lt;br /&gt;I bought them each one box of this for Christmas...&lt;br /&gt;Both were very happy to get this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some more for my wife.. She is in love with the product. It&lt;br /&gt;smells pretty good and makes her skin feel even softer than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If baths didn&#x27;t cost so much, I would even bathe in this just to soften&lt;br /&gt;my dry skin.. I do really love the scent. Try some of the other scents&lt;br /&gt;if you are like my wife and just have to take a bath everyday. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I use it because it keeps the bathtub clean without my having to clean it.  The price on Amazon is competitive with the stores.  It arrived within days of my ordering it.  Sometimes I have trouble finding it in the stores, so I like to buy it here, about 6 boxes at a time.  I&#x27;ll always use it.</li>
            <li> The smell of these beads are AMAZING! After a bath, my body feels super soft. The only thing is that I have to use A LOT in order to get the full effect of amazingness. Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> Smells great and really does make a noticeable different in my skin.  I used a too much the first time and it made my skin feel just a little bit filmy - be aware that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> These moisturize really well. When I get out of the bath, my skin feels silky and smooth. I have two issues with the product, though. One: the smell. I don&#x27;t know what the scent is, but it&#x27;s not a good one and it&#x27;s not relaxing. It actually gave me a sinus headache and I had to throw the rest out. I wish there was a choice between scents because I would use the product if I actually enjoyed the smell. Two: the packaging. I&#x27;m not a fan of having bath products contained in boxes. It should be in a plastic container that won&#x27;t be destroyed if it comes in contact with water.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly &amp; the box wasn&#x27;t damaged at all. It was works fine. There were no signs of clumps from moisture.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing beads turn an ordinary bath into something luxurious.  The water feels wonderful on your skin, and the fragrance just hightens the sense of being pampered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus?  You&#x27;ll get out of the tub with skin that&#x27;s velvety and moist, rather than taut and dehydrated.</li>
            <li> IS the perfect product for my skin, because here in the tropic the skin is very escamosa y reseca y este producto es el ideal para mi tipo de piel, estoy contenta con el tamano de la caja.</li>
            <li> Vaseline Intensive Care Bath Beads is the perfect bath product for use where the water is hard like mine is. The mild fragerance replaces the chemical odor of the hard water and the product eliminates all rings and build up in the tub. Love it. A real problem solver for hard water areas. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because I love it in my bath.  But, and this is a big but, I guess I read the price wrong.  I think I temporarily lost my mind because I would never have paid over $40 for this one box of Bath Beads!  24 ounces or not.  I have bought this product in the grocery store or drug store for so much less.  Maybe not 24 oz. but enough to last through many baths.  I don&#x27;t fault the seller because this was my mistake and one I won&#x27;t make again.</li>
            <li> I loved this product but the manufacturer of Vaseline decided to discontinue the productðŸ˜ª. I Quickly discovered that Walgreens carries a bath bead called Studio 35 that works even better than Vaseline. They only run a little over $2 a box!!! A photo of the product is attached below.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Vaseline Intensive Care Moisturizing Bath Beads with my Subscribe and Save order.  Time to pamper my dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> I have always loved these bath beads but they have become hard to find. I knew I could find them on Amazon if they were to be found anywhere. I am glad to have found a source for these bead which make the bath water feel like silk.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product!  It really softens your skin while making you smell great!  I would not want to take a bath without this product!</li>
            <li> This is an ok product smells nice.  I feel that I don&#x27;t particularly feel very moisturized by it. Easy clean from tub.</li>
            <li> I find that using this product in my bath seems to eliminate (or at least reduce) the appearance of a bathtub ring.  Also feels nice in the water.  Simple pleasures. :)</li>
            <li> Warm baths taken with Vaseline Intensive Care Bath Beads are the best way I know to truly relax. Something about the fragrance combined with the way by body feels in the silky smooth water simply washes away my stress. I have a crazy busy life, just like most of US in this modern world. When I get home I just want to get away from all of the outside drama. Vaseline Intensive Care Bath Beads help me do that. TAKE CAUTION when getting in and out of the bathtub. There is a heightened slip factor. I have used this product as a gift many times also. I get pretty clear bags pour in the Vaseline Intensive Care Bath Beads, attach ribbons. Done. Everyone has always loved it.</li>
            <li> you know, i live alone and i enjoy a hot extended bath with the bubbles and all that jazz, and this just did not do anything for me, and i&#x27;m not saying i should have better understood the product, but i found what i wanted in shop rite, for example, and normally i would go all draconian on me to first finish up all this stuff, but i got no pushback from my conscious when i chose this new product and decided i didn&#x27;t even want to mix them. there is nothing objective about this. i&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a terrible product. i&#x27;m just saying it didn&#x27;t give me any joy.</li>
            <li> seems to help with itchy skin</li>
            <li> This is great in a nice, warm bath and the price is much lower than any store near me. (This will make hubbie very happy)</li>
            <li> Every store within 10 miles of me that carries this product charges $1.79-$1.99. I do much of my shopping on Amazon, but this is robbery! Don&#x27;t buy this here. Get it at your local grocery or pharmacy. Sheesh!</li>
