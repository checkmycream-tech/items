            <li>Given the opportunity to review mouthwash is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>This is the one that seems to work best of all I&#x27;ve tried to date.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>but I am So happy Amazon carries it</li>
            <li>and so happy I don&#x27;t have to go to Target and buy it there.</li>
            <li>I got this at a GREAT price on Amazon using the subscribe and save program.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Listerine is a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Listerine is a good product.</li>
            <li>Produce good results if you use it after cleaning your tongue.</li>
            <li>My grandmother used to use the original formula and boy am I glad they have more variety now!!!  </li>
            <li>recommend Listerine Freshburst as an effective, inoffensively-flavored mouth rinse which is targeted both to reduce plaque and gingivitis.</li>
            <li>Plus, it has a pleasant, minty taste, one that keeps my mouth feeling fresh for quite some time after I use it.</li>
            <li>Because most people want to know if Mouthwash works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I am not alone in my annoyance at my fellow reviewers comments below.</li>
            <li>Now here comes the important part, don&#x27;t rinse with water afterwards!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and we are still using the same bottle.</li>
            <li>The flavor on this one is fine, lots better than what my mother used.</li>
            <li>generally, I like to use the mouthwash when I first wake up, and I know that Listerine is one of the best brands to kill those germs in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Great buy and the product is a standard that we have all used for years.</li>
            <li>This is just as important as brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>He always used the original listerine which can drop you to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this flavor but would describe it as &#x27;mint plus.&#x27;</li>
            <li>This Listerine was offerd as a special on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Burns my mouth but good overall.</li>
            <li>Listerine leaves my mouth feeling so fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a semi-sweetly mild, minty flavor.</li>

            <li>The Fresh Burst taste is a huge improvement over the original flavor, which I absolutely detest!</li>
            <li>easy to decant into smaller bottle for easy access!</li>
            <li>I tried several different brands and discovered that Listerine worked best in keeping plaque from building and also keeping my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Then I rinse full strength with this mouthwash, making sure to tilt my head back, and forward and side to side, and my mouth is doing fine now.</li>
            <li>Enjoy being able to go to the door and not the store for about the same money.  </li>
            <li>Ahhhh, fresh breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, FRESH &amp; MINTY.</li>
            <li>do brush my teeth with toothpaste right after breakfast but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do this every day and your teeth and gums will be as healthy as you can possibly get them at home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do this every day and your teeth and gums will be as healthy as you can possibly get them at home.</li>
            <li>is much better flavor to swish around your mouth with the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However it doesn&#x27;t replace your tongue cleaner for fresh breath, which is pretty much the case with all the mouth wash.</li>
            <li>To maximize the positive effects of Listerine, it has to be used correctly, so here are my recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did you know that it is really important to practice oral hygiene especially after you first wake</li>
            <li>She mixes a little with warm water for use with her waterpik.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth having brushed and done a thirty-second or so rinse with the Listerine Freshburst - very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Who knew I&#x27;d be paying so much for just mouthwash?&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t even need that much - don&#x27;t do a whole cap -</li>
            <li>Instead, put a \\&quot;small\\&quot; amount in your mouth, and then gently brush your teeth with your toothbrush, working the Listerine into the crevases between your teeth and gums, and in between your teeth.</li>
            <li>That special included free shipping, thus making the product price much less than the price at Sams or Wal Mart.</li>
            <li>The longer contact time means more germs killed.</li>
            <li>Convenient way to shop and well worth the price for this giant size . . .</li>
            <li>I had a toothache in my upper right tooth, so what I do is brush the heck out of my teeth and then rinse four times with water (after brushing again with just water to loosen the used toothpaste).</li>
            <li>His flippant mockery of this product only serves to highlight his ignorance concerning the crippling effects of halitosis, - a disease which currently holds me in it&#x27;s terminal grip.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of mouthwashes out there, but there are only two that are consistently recommended by the dentist.  </li>
            <li>We use listerine all the time and so the larger container size is really nice, other than that this is just the same listerine that you buy at the store.</li>
            <li>Since Listerine kills germs by direct contact, you want to get the product into the gum pockets to cleanse them - so use your toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The longer you use Listerine, the better it works; so brush with it for at least 1-2 minutes per time.</li>
            <li>Yes, Listerine does kill millions of germs as advertized, but those germs replicate very fast and will return to regular levels in a very short period of time, so by using it twice or even three times per day, you keep germs depressed all day</li>
            <li>After the teeth are clean, vigorously brush the top surface of the tongue to root out the germs that cause bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Given the opportunity to review mouthwash is awesome.  Thank you Amazon.com.  Because most people want to know if Mouthwash works.  I mean if mouthwash doesn&#x27;t work who will tell America (or the rest of the world) what is up.  Next I&#x27;m gonna see if I can review Chereios.  I hope so.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way this mouthwash is kinda of tough on the mouth and doesn&#x27;t give one the Alchol Buzz, that Is really needed with a product like this.  I&#x27;d try Peppermint Schanpps as an alternative.</li>
            <li> This Listerine was offerd as a special on Amazon. That special included free shipping, thus making the product price much less than the price at Sams or Wal Mart. Great buy and the product is a standard that we have all used for years.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure I am not alone in my annoyance at my fellow reviewers comments below. His flippant mockery of this product only serves to highlight his ignorance concerning the crippling effects of halitosis, - a disease which currently holds me in it&#x27;s terminal grip. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My breath is truly rancid. Every morning it starts off unbearable, and rapidly gets worse.  &lt;br /&gt;Imagine if you extracted a dead goats stomach, left it in the sun for a few days, added a dozen rotten eggs, dipped it in a cess-pit, then set about vomiting over the whole filthy lot. Well that&#x27;s what I wake up with every morning. It&#x27;s only by ingesting a bottle of listerine a day that I can keep any food down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I avoid all unnecessary social contact, preferring to remain indoors. In fact the local council has registered my house an environmental hazard after an internal inspection (2 people died in the process). &lt;br /&gt;Nobody comes to visit, they think it&#x27;s infectious, even when I&#x27;m wearing the mask.</li>
            <li> Who knew I&#x27;d be paying so much for just mouthwash?&lt;br /&gt;Well, I do now that I have tried the generic brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do brush my teeth with toothpaste right after breakfast but generally, I like to use the mouthwash when I first wake up, and I know that Listerine is one of the best brands to kill those germs in your mouth. Did you know that it is really important to practice oral hygiene especially after you first wake up?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t even need that much - don&#x27;t do a whole cap - just fill the cap to a 1/3 and swish a lot and you are done. Ahhhh, fresh breath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s more expensive than other brands but I am So happy Amazon carries it and so happy I don&#x27;t have to go to Target and buy it there. Would buy again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am a dentist who uses Listerine on a daily basis. Without going into boring scientific detail, I use the product because it works - it kills germs associated with gingivitis and bad breath. To maximize the positive effects of Listerine, it has to be used correctly, so here are my recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use it at least two times per day, in the morning and in the evening before bed. Yes, Listerine does kill millions of germs as advertized, but those germs replicate very fast and will return to regular levels in a very short period of time, so by using it twice or even three times per day, you keep germs depressed all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t just swish with Listerine. Instead, put a \\&quot;small\\&quot; amount in your mouth, and then gently brush your teeth with your toothbrush, working the Listerine into the crevases between your teeth and gums, and in between your teeth. These are the areas where gingivitis germs grow and do damage to your gums. Since Listerine kills germs by direct contact, you want to get the product into the gum pockets to cleanse them - so use your toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The longer you use Listerine, the better it works; so brush with it for at least 1-2 minutes per time. The longer contact time means more germs killed. After the teeth are clean, vigorously brush the top surface of the tongue to root out the germs that cause bad breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. After cleaning your teeth with Listerine, you should briefly brush them again with a fluoridated toothpaste. I don&#x27;t care what brand of toothpaste you use, as long as it has the ADA seal of approval and has fluoride in it. Put a small amount on the brush and gently brush your teeth. Now here comes the important part, don&#x27;t rinse with water afterwards! If you thoroughly rinse with water afterwards, you are rinsing off the beneficial fluoride. The goal is to leave it on your teeth as long as possible, so brush, spit out the excess and don&#x27;t rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Floss your teeth once daily. There is no rinse in the world that can kill the germs that infect the teeth and gums in-between your teeth, so it is essential to floss once per day, preferably before bed. This is just as important as brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do this every day and your teeth and gums will be as healthy as you can possibly get them at home. This effort will save you hundreds of dollars, for you will cut down on cavities and the need for expensive dental scalings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listerine is a good product. As a dentist I recommend it and use it myself. The Fresh Burst taste is a huge improvement over the original flavor, which I absolutely detest! Use a flavor of Listerine that is of your liking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;koneis no rinse in the world that can kill the germs that infect the teeth and gums in-between your teeth, so it is essential to floss once per day, preferably before bed.

            <li> I had a toothache in my upper right tooth, so what I do is brush the heck out of my teeth and then rinse four times with water (after brushing again with just water to loosen the used toothpaste). Then I rinse full strength with this mouthwash, making sure to tilt my head back, and forward and side to side, and my mouth is doing fine now. Great product!!</li>
            <li> YOUR MOUTH &amp; TEETH WILL THANK YOU., FRESH &amp; MINTY.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He always used the original listerine which can drop you to the ground.&lt;br /&gt;This is much better flavor to swish around your mouth with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too!</li>
            <li> Not much to say...I like the flavour. However it doesn&#x27;t replace your tongue cleaner for fresh breath, which is pretty much the case with all the mouth wash. So it does what it is supposed to do. Produce good results if you use it after cleaning your tongue.</li>
            <li> I purchase Listerine regularly.  It&#x27;s been especially helpful for my teenage daughter who has braces.  She mixes a little with warm water for use with her waterpik.  Listerine leaves my mouth feeling so fresh and clean.  My grandmother used to use the original formula and boy am I glad they have more variety now!!!  I got this at a GREAT price on Amazon using the subscribe and save program.  I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and we are still using the same bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of mouthwash over the years, but when gargling Listerine Antiseptic Mouthwash, Freshburst flavor, there is no doubt this stuff is working. As a daily regimen I usually brush twice a day, once in the morning and again at night before going to bed. After each brushing I followup with a gargle of Listerine and I can feel it exterminating the millions of germs on contact. It has a bold minty taste and a slight (non painful) burn as you gargle. The original flavor tasted horrible but this tastes great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
            <li> Listerine is a &#x27;must have&#x27; for me. I wasn&#x27;t familiar with this flavor but would describe it as &#x27;mint plus.&#x27; Convenient way to shop and well worth the price for this giant size . . . easy to decant into smaller bottle for easy access!</li>
            <li> When I found out from my dentist several years ago that I had the start of gum disease I began using mouthwash regularly (and also started flossing). I tried several different brands and discovered that Listerine worked best in keeping plaque from building and also keeping my mouth feeling fresh. I then tried several different varieties of Listerine before settling on its Freshburst mouthwash. This is the one that seems to work best of all I&#x27;ve tried to date. Plus, it has a pleasant, minty taste, one that keeps my mouth feeling fresh for quite some time after I use it. I recommend using it twice a day, as is indicated on the bottle. I use it immediately after I brush after eating breakfast. And I also use it before I go to bed at night. Doing this has kept my gum recession from progressing over the past few years.</li>
            <li> What can you say about listerine?  My mother used it, probably my grandmother.  I use it all the time.  The flavor on this one is fine, lots better than what my mother used.</li>
            <li> We use listerine all the time and so the larger container size is really nice, other than that this is just the same listerine that you buy at the store.</li>
