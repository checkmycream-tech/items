            <li>It has a very strong smell to it</li>

            <li>I tried it because I&#x27;d been using Bhringaraj oil with great success.</li>
            <li>I sure hope it&#x27;s effective...</li>
            <li>Wow, this is great for growing a beard!</li>
            <li>I love this product it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, exactly like allspice (which is what Jamaican &#x27;pimento&#x27; is), so it&#x27;s not offensive smelling if you want to use it as a hair grooming oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>My beautician recommended this product and it works fine!  </li>
            <li>Feels and looks so healthy, shinny and strong!</li>
            <li>the feeling and the smell very light.</li>
            <li>it very nice and helps me very very much.</li>
            <li>It has kind of a strong smell</li>
            <li>This was amazing and worked great for my hair and my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I love love love it .....</li>
            <li>This oil is much, much better than the plan JBCO.  </li>
            <li>It shipped to me fast and in great condition also.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not oily or greasy like most hair oil products.</li>
            <li>I am sure this product works wonders for some people.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt that this product works, I just wish you got more for what it costs.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Ok I used it on my scalp and it gives a tingling feeling</li>
            <li>LOVE THE CONSISTANCY</li>
            <li>However, I love the way it makes my scalp feel tingly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give more details in about a month.</li>
            <li>I think it is mostly the castor oil itself that has been helping my hair to grow and be stronger, so instead of two containers, I will just stick with my JBCO to seal and moisturize since I do not mind its thicker consistency and save my money.</li>
            <li>Asked for more.</li>
            <li>hope product work as well as what i read about it if work i will be ordering more just give it time to work.</li>
            <li>I  love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>is to put more hair.</li>
            <li>The edges get more wear and tear because I wrap my hair at night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use this product about 3 times now, and I love the feeling it provides.  </li>
            <li>it with your favorite lotion if you decide to use on skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that my beer is fuller thicker and all around better looking and feeling this product</li>
            <li>I guess I was expecting a better result.</li>
            <li>Recently, I can tell Tropic Isle has adjusted the formula to lighten the fragrance of the oil (before it used to be VERY strong) but the effectiveness and quality are in no way diminished!!!</li>
            <li>BUT i use so many products</li>
            <li>,  I LOVE it and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>and I must say that I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I must say I am so glad I did</li>
            <li>The hair on the top and front of my head is getting stronger.</li>
            <li>OK LET ME SAYS THIS</li>
            <li>OK,I WILL GIVE IT SOME MORE TIME,</li>
            <li>and I will surely be buying this again.</li>
            <li>Regardless of whether I notice any growth I&#x27;m going to get more of this oil.  </li>
            <li>Her hair has now stopped shedding and never looked so healthy.</li>
            <li>my hair would show an inch or more in growth.</li>
            <li>I can feel fullness in my hair and it feels more silky, stronger, and it&#x27;s falling out at a slower rate.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>

            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff and so does my hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff...</li>
            <li>but i love the smell and what it does to my hair when i apply it.  </li>
            <li>but i am really in love wih this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is okay, but the Argan oil works wonders.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>make sure you wash it out.</li>
            <li>I can tolerate tea tree oil better than this.</li>
            <li>The more ways you take care of your hair, the better off it will be.</li>
            <li>but if you leave it in just use a moisturizer that smells better.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love the way it stimulates my scalp but seen no differences in the length or thickness of my hair</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>So far so good !</li>
            <li>The product is ok , smells so good and for hot oil mascara work great&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!!  </li>
            <li>I ran across the reviews for Tropic Isle Strong Roots Oil and was astonished by how many folks said this works, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>You better have strong roots to withstand this growth oil.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell; it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>Tablets + Hair Growth Essentials - 60 capsules - Promotes Hair Growth, Healthy Skin, and Strong Nails]].</li>
            <li>I lightly dab across sections of my scalp and massage with my fingers for nice, light even application.</li>
            <li>I have fine caucasian hair, so it may work better on thicker or curly hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and clean!</li>
            <li>I think this may be more for ethnic hair, I have brown, fine hair and this just is not a product I will use again.</li>
            <li>Make sure you also use some good shampoo, shampoo with black castor oil is great, and a conditioner with shea butter is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear my hair in locs &amp; it gives my new growth a very nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this helps my hair grown, but it sure makes it silky and very, very shinny!!</li>
            <li>I will re-visit this review in a couple of months, so I can give a more accurate and descriptive write about this product.  </li>
            <li>Great on sensitive scalps as well</li>
            <li>This product was not for me - I am sure it is my chemical make up - because most of the reviews are great - it simply didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>wow this is a great product i use this twice a week</li>
            <li>So happy i found something to make my hair thicker and grow that is natural.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT FOR BOTH NATURAL AND RELAXED HAIR.</li>
            <li>I am a 63 year old BF who has experienced hair loss since I was 39.  </li>
            <li>(It smells wonderful by the way, then again I&#x27;ve always been partial to the spice fragrance notes)</li>
            <li>I love the smell, which is very distinct.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, the smell is not the best, but I do not find it offensive.  </li>
            <li>Which means anybody could easily make this themselves.</li>
            <li>This growth oil keeps your hair clean and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because it has a spout for easy application.</li>
            <li>I do like that it has an easy pour spout, it washes out easily, and you get quite a bit of oil.</li>
            <li>cells that block the hair follicle pores are zapped away and the hair&lt;br /&gt;can grow very quickly and uninhibited.</li>
            <li>Just the simple, &#x27;your hair looks great&#x27;, or &#x27;I love your hair&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and does make my hair seem thicker when I use it.</li>
            <li>it would be so easy to get the hair I&#x27;ve been wanting.</li>
            <li>I used many many products and had marginal success with Growganics and Hairfinity vitamins  among others.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is strong and it truly works.</li>
            <li>Strong warning:  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong but it doesnt bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Strong smell</li>
            <li>Tropic Isle Strong Roots</li>
            <li>The scent can be strong, but that does not bother me.</li>
            <li>Smells to strong for my liking</li>
            <li>everyone seemed to talk about how it had a strong smell and what not.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that a product has magical properties and makes something as nice or better than what it was, but this oil definitely surprised me!</li>
            <li>and the way my scalp tingles in a refreshing cool (not burning) way.&lt;br /&gt;Since applying it to my hair each evening, I have noticed a significant reduction in hair loss when I shower and brush and there seems to be more baby hairs growing around my hair line.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the cool tingling feeling it gives when applying it to my scalp.</li>
            <li>I warm the bottle in hot water for a minute, then use a shower cap.</li>
            <li>First of all i would like to say that i purchase this product with my own money</li>
            <li>it actually smells good in a way but very strong.</li>
            <li>seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>awesome product, I&#x27;m on a 30 day challenge Jamaican black castor oil treatment.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I seriously am never disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li>i just wanna let ppl know that red pimento oil is pretty good!</li>
            <li>Although it smells funcky, it is all worth it !</li>
            <li>After using this product once a week for 3 weeks, I had a less than pleasant allergic reaction known as Contact Dermatitis!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the results after 3-month after using this product.</li>
            <li>He is was so excited that I bought him the shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>I love this product but only 4OUNCES for that much money, is killing my money in great size.</li>
            <li>However, I decided to incorporate a hot oil treatment and to try a more moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be sure to be consistent.</li>
            <li>before I ordered it I researched it further on the Internet how to use it safely and effectively on relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>I thought more natural ingredients would be better.</li>
            <li>Massage it into my clean scalp and put on a shower cap for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I used this product only once and was pleasantly supprised  that it did what is said.  </li>
            <li>the oils smells nice and it comes in a wonderful bottle that makes it easy to apply to the hair and scalp, but when I applied it my eyes got irritated, may be its because I left on for a long time or because I used too much</li>
            <li>There is nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li>The product came quicker than expected which is great.</li>
            <li>As nice as this product is, it would be FAR cheaper to make it than buy it.</li>
            <li>The smell, everybody says the smell is unbearable, not SO true.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and it really does work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking a lot of supplements, vitamins, Rogaine, and anything that has had good reviews to grow back my hair without subcombing to hair implants.</li>
            <li>My hair loves it, it is very moisturizing and healthy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing true results.</li>
            <li>Love the smell it really did make  </li>
            <li>I then rinse with cool water and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love it because it stopped my scalp from itching so much.</li>
            <li>I need to give it more time, but it did leave my scalp very itchy.</li>
            <li>(I use a natural remedy, Saw Palmetto, which is extremely effective), in combination with this.</li>
            <li>This stuff has an odor that, while it&#x27;s not really bad can seem cloying after a while.</li>
            <li>i liked it for the fact that my hair felt super soft after i washed it out.</li>
            <li>Other than this, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great addition to the other products from this compant I have tried.</li>
            <li>KEEPS HAIR AND SCALP FRESH, CLEAN, SHINE, SOOTHES AND CALMS THE SCALP</li>
            <li>Personally, I think the smell is ok, not too strong and not too light.</li>
            <li>The pimento oil makes my scalp tingle &amp; it has a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>BUT MY BAGS AREA YOU COULD SAY THEY WERE SOME WHAT BOLD</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for a healthier and more vibrant hair.</li>
            <li>is until you finally find what really works for your hair)and for me, finding a GREAT REGIMEN  </li>
            <li>and now you have a super growth formula going on.</li>
            <li>Does seem to relieve pain quickly..</li>
            <li>I ordered this item and it did arrive quickly and well</li>
            <li>Before I did my research about this product I was wearing a quick weave, however, I do not like weave, so</li>
            <li>It grows and thickens the hair quickly..</li>
            <li>Super product and looking forward to hearing about the super growth that will happen in Kenya.</li>
            <li>During my most recent visit to the salon, my stylist suggested that I incorporate more moisturizing products into my regimen.  </li>
            <li>About 14 months ago, I exerienced massive hair loss -- the top completely, most of the front and some on both sides.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels healthy and vibrant.</li>
            <li>other than the finer strands in the front of my head had a very smooth and nicely defined wave pattern.  </li>
            <li>It recommends using it 2 times a week with a hot cap, or under a hair dryer, but I just wrap my hair in a light towel or cap and turn on the blow dryer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>what I do is take a very hot towel and put it on my head.</li>
            <li>in all, I am very pleased with this product and definitely plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it so much that I am now oiling my hair every night!</li>
            <li>Primarily use it for a hot oil treatment after coloring and washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use my oil and Dominican deep conditioners and loving the quick growth of my hair my scalp feel clean and nurtured</li>
            <li>I use the strong root pimento oil along with Jamaican black castor oil &amp; I have seen good hair growth results.</li>
            <li>But I tried many different topical hair growth formulas and this one seemed to be the most effective.</li>
            <li>effect meaning many folicles are opening and came to surface which means new hair is coming.  </li>
            <li>I have also noticed a lot more baby hairs which means that it is helping me grow new hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my new favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>( more thickness than new growth).</li>
            <li>It was so strong that I decided it was ready for some color</li>
            <li>It may be too strong for sensitive scalp, fine hair and edges.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, strong roots</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product and much better than the expensive hot oil treatments you buy.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this and his hair stopped falling out after a week of consistent use!</li>
            <li>It seem like it was working well the first day or two , and than i notice my hair was just coming out!  </li>
            <li>I am a new user to this product, initially when used as directed I experienced a lot of shedding.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the pure castor oil from same company.</li>
            <li>in all this is a lovely oil to use that is easy to shampoo out in the morning and gives a nice condition to the hair due to the natural oil.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle of this stuff and let me tell you this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Hope you will enjoy using it as much as I am.</li>
            <li>worked nice wish they had bigger bottle</li>
            <li>Worth trying.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use this yet, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>He continues to use with success in scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try if you are not prone to breakouts on your skin.</li>
            <li>If you have ever smelled Jamaican Allspice in the grocery store, then this oil smells similar to that but more light.</li>
            <li>Okay I know the old saying anything with the word growth dont believe .</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It definitely gives the hair a boost of volume and nice shine.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff and the way it feels on my natural 4b/4c hair.  </li>
            <li>I also love the natural smell.</li>
            <li>I love that all the ingredients are natural and there are no artificial perfumes.</li>
            <li>Love the product for my natural hair</li>
            <li>I hoped that I would have success in growing out my hairline</li>
            <li>Oh well, worth a try I guess.</li>
            <li>I use Tropic Hair Growth directly on my scalp which grows my hair and keeps it healthy, I also mix it with Jamaican&lt;br /&gt;Black</li>
            <li>i love this stuff better than the other brands.</li>
            <li>I must say, it is a bit itchy the first minute or so after you apply it, but it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivery was pretty quick, I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I noticed on the directions that you have to rinse it out</li>
            <li>It straight up smells like pimento....if you&#x27;re familiar with that scent.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t work right away.</li>
            <li>then I go right over it</li>
            <li>YOU GOT THE RIGHT</li>
            <li>When you apply the oil to the scalp,&lt;br /&gt;you can feel it start to zing right away.</li>
            <li>right now.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Yeah you read that right.</li>
            <li>I put it on right before I go to bed and then wash it out in the morning.</li>
            <li>If it will help with hair loss, too early to say, but manageability, healthy shine and fulness - yes, that&#x27;s what I got after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells very natural, though for some people the smell may be too strong.</li>
            <li>The other ingredients (Jamaican black castor oil, wheat germ oil and coconut oil) are all very good at promoting healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will order lots more in the near future.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not sure if the flakes I experienced are a byproduct of the growth</li>
            <li>My roots in the front part of my hair have grown and I am so happy, my friend recommended castor oil for my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time trying it, and got results right away..</li>
            <li>This makes for easy dispensing and application directly to the roots of the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I saw this product when purchasing Jamaican Black Castor Oil so since I loved that by Tropic Isle Living, I assumed I would like this also.</li>
            <li>This item really works, my hair is growing back nicely and thicker as well.</li>
            <li>Buying a larger bottle would be more economical if you like how it works.</li>
            <li>I guess time and regular use will tell just how effective this product really is</li>
            <li>/&gt;For even better chances of success, use a oral supplement such as biotin-</li>
            <li>hands down one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li>I leave in my hair 20 mins with a cap right before shampooing and my hair is much more thicker I definitely notice growth.  </li>
            <li>I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>Very very gooey.</li>
            <li>Most people use a hair regrowth formula and ignore the other important things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied a mild texturizer to my hair during the second month and a week after I resumed application of the product to my scalp, I started getting a strong case of the \\&quot;itchies.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It was an easy process, high marks all around, highly recommend and will buy again...</li>
            <li>So far i have not seen a HUGE change in my edges</li>
            <li>and I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I first learned about the Tropic Isle JBC products when i say my co-worker using them and deciced that i would try them after hearing that they worked for her  </li>
            <li>i plan to take my braids out soon and continue using the product as both a hot oil treatment and on my scalp every 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope this current review helps.. :-)</li>
            <li>I like the smell of this product use it as a hot oil treatments</li>
            <li>I use this about once a week as a hot oil massage.  </li>
            <li>I have about 2 more uses left in my bottle and have been using it maybe about two months.  </li>
            <li>I was speechless on how fast my hair grew !</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 starts because this product did exactly what it said it would</li>
            <li>IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>I NEED TO SAVE UP AND BUY A WHOLE BATCH TO BE SHIPPED OVER!  </li>
            <li>this is my first purchase ...</li>
            <li>This is the first time I am using this product.</li>
            <li>However when I first used the product, it did make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>I USE IT AS A HOT OIL TREATMENT</li>
            <li>This product started working the first time she used it.</li>
            <li>so it could be used as a hot oil treatment and the coconut oil as a pre-shampoo treatment.  </li>
            <li>and I already started yesterday with my challenge when i recieved the pimento oil first.</li>
            <li>hot oil</li>
            <li>And the delivery is fast so I will buy again!</li>
            <li>I wash my hair first because I use lots of cosmetic products on my hair to make it look fuller.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a spicy type of smell to it, and from I can tell, only healthy and helpful ingredients.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again, but won&#x27;t need to for a decade since it goes really far for my light use.</li>
            <li>I use this product as a hot oil treatment for my hair</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t forget to give yourself a hot oil treatment with this and sit under a hair steamer(haven&#x27;t done this)</li>
            <li>I can only imagine it would add more results.</li>
            <li>( I threw the first bottle away)</li>
            <li>The first time was to oil my scalp</li>
            <li>I use it as a weekly hot oil treatment.  </li>
            <li>I usually do a Hot oil treatment, biweekly</li>
            <li>It practically cleared my dandruff issues when I was on the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I love and will only use this stuff.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the effects as it is absorbed into the scalp.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what the sellers said it would.</li>
            <li>It is not runny and it will do exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what the label said it would do.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE SEVERAL BALD SPOTS IN TBE TOP.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>(my hair reaches just below the top of my back) and I flat-ironed.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like white and not liquids</li>
            <li>first time using this Imixed it with my shae butter and just used as an oil for my scalp</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I was so pleased with the protein treatment by the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ususally there is a cycle where it comes out in the top and grows back.  </li>
            <li>You can tell the difference the first time that you use it.  </li>
            <li>first the scent was so overpowering that it gagged me.</li>
            <li>what I do is use it as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>Too hot.</li>
            <li>I steam my hair first...</li>
            <li>I applied it to my scalp every night I find that if im consistent with using my products i don&#x27;t get results</li>
            <li>i did exactly that</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice but was satisfied with the immediate results......</li>
            <li>OK product a little to strong for my hair problem would reorder</li>
            <li>However, it is great to use as a daily scalp moisturizer, as my scalp is usually pretty dry.</li>
            <li>If this stuff pumps up my fine hair without weighing it down, Im sure it will work for pretty much any hair type.</li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t that pleasant which is why I usually apply it a day or two before my wash day.  </li>
            <li>I have just purchased my seond bottle even though the first is more than half full.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft anc clean scalp.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it&#x27;ll thicken my hair and get it back growing back good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relaxed ( 7 weeks post) and my hair came out nice and soft after I washed and deep conditioned.  </li>
            <li>this is a must if you want to see a different in the feel and texture of your hair love it now everyone in the house wants to use it</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t know if it has to do with the Castro oil, the coconut oil or this red pimento oil that is making my hair grow at this fast rate, but i know for sure</li>
            <li>Well, I just picked up this product, so this is an initial review, but I can definitely feel the oil perking up my scalp when I apply it, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>I am still trailing the product, so I can&#x27;t give it five stars as of yet, but I am anticipating positive results.</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on a positive review.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice results the first month I used it,</li>
            <li>but my hair grows pretty fast any way.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty much bald in two spots and I saw a difference within a couple of weeks of massaging the oil in those areas.</li>
            <li>At this point, my hair feels really soft and full of moisturize.  </li>
            <li>My hair was shiny, soft and full of body...</li>
            <li>I was upset about the 2 car garage forming at the top of my scalp and searched high and low for product.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong as you do smell the red pimento</li>
            <li>The only con is the smell wayyyy to strong</li>
            <li>One thing I do want you to know is that you can get Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair</li>
            <li>I do not use for Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil 4 Ounce, I had any Laser Comb Therapy treatment hair loss, promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li>but with STRONG ROOTS RED PIMENTO OIL, the experience was one of the BEST!MY 4C HAIR BECAME</li>

            <li>I have been rubbing it into my eyebrows and eyelashes and should have taken before and after photos as I am certain my eyebrows are filling in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I now use 100% Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>THIS OIL IS VERY STRONG, RICH, THICK</li>
            <li>It is like I have found a new love and respect for my hair and wish to take care of it as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Take a DHT blocker daily, make sure to get plenty of food, B vitamins, omega 3&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s, plenty of sleep on a consistent basis, and buy some shampoos and conditioners that have some tea tree oil as well as other remedies that are good for the hair, and let your hair air dry after a shower.</li>
            <li>Its my first time using this particular product</li>
            <li>I liked it a little.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff...</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li>the difficulty in getting it out of my hair is a deterrent, really)</li>
            <li>I am in my 40&#x27;s and my hair has thinned so much because of food intolerances</li>
            <li>My hairdresser looked at my scalp at the beginning and then again after several weeks and confirmed that my folicles are showing activity.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the smell of the product that resembles a tropical cinnamon type of scent.  </li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>but it really hasn&#x27;t gotten any longer.  </li>
            <li>I used this regime for about 4 months straight</li>
            <li>I used this regime for about 4 months straight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had and used this product for over 2 weeks, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really done anything.</li>
            <li>To my surprise this product really made my hair shine for days.</li>
            <li>I really like this product...</li>
            <li>I have very course hair - 4-C hair.</li>
            <li>Growth Oil - 4oz much cheaper at your Beauty Supply Store.</li>
            <li>You can really smell the pimento in this oil .</li>
            <li>but I think I will just stick with my vitamins because it&#x27;s so much of a hassle to use every week.</li>
            <li>Cant really say if I like it or not.</li>
            <li>This product really does work.  </li>
            <li>I have always had really thing hair</li>
            <li>and I never had that much hair too.</li>
            <li>this product really works for me.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t get much out of this product and will not re-order.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel really moisturized.</li>
            <li>My daughter was diagnosed with seborrhea of the scalp, and the red pimento worked wonders for her scalp, and her bald spots filled in too.</li>
            <li>Thanks you so much I will keep in touch with you....</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>The top of my hair (center) is where it was the thinnest and around</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect anything to happen for that area</li>
            <li>The whole truth and nothing but the truth I&#x27;ve had my twist in for 2wks and 4 days</li>
            <li>but I just gently use my finger tips.</li>
            <li>My hair grows much faster.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to spread out.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely keep using.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li>and I really like the applicator bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really did not like this product at all.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very moisturized and</li>
            <li>There is a real sense that it is feeding the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I was often in a rush to get ready and would tear a brush through it</li>
            <li>i absolutely loveeee the smell of this oil.</li>
            <li>I tell you that it really promotes hair growth.  </li>
            <li>idk if this really works I&#x27;ll keep but probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>It really is helping my hair grow</li>
            <li>No one can tell me this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>And also hoped it would really make it grow faster.</li>
            <li>I really did not care for this product.</li>
            <li>IT MADE MY HAIR VERY GREASY</li>
            <li>My staple products are Phytospecific Intense Nutrition Shampoo, Aveda Damage</li>
            <li>and this really worked..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that much breakage anymore</li>
            <li>My hair is much healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li>DIDNT REALLY SEE A CHANGED IN MY HAIR</li>
            <li>DOESNT REALLY SEEM TO WORK FOR ME</li>
            <li>In conjunction with the oil, the biotin helps stimulate results faster and make the hair that is growing or has grown in much stronger.</li>
            <li>IT IS GROWING MY HAIR OUT FAST IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WILDGROWTH OIL AND STRAIGHT UP CASTOR OIL.</li>
            <li>Really works</li>
            <li>I have hair covering my whole head  --</li>
            <li>My hair is short and chemical free</li>
            <li>thank you so much Amazon.</li>
            <li>This oil really soothes my eyes if I apply it before bedtime.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gloopy product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stimulate your scalp, or increase circulation, and the ingredients don&#x27;t block DHT or 5-alpha reductase, responsible for hair loss.</li>
            <li>It really does work and does what it claims.</li>
            <li>and I already know its the real deal..</li>
            <li>Haha the smell doesnt effect me at all.</li>
            <li>Much much to say.</li>
            <li>It will hydrate and your roots will feel very moisturised.</li>
            <li>So therefore your roots will become much stronger.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much of it to achieve  moisture.</li>
            <li>but it can be too much if you use a lot.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>it really really works people so go out and order it.</li>
            <li>like the smell,  it is very think,  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li>I am one to only speak of my own personal experience</li>
            <li>The finer hair is toward the top and front of my head, while the coarser hair is near the back.  </li>
            <li>It stimulates the scalp very well and after the first use it feels normal on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle i recieved within a matter of 3 days super fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>My mother, who has very straight and coarse hair, absolutely loves it and uses it more regularly.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li>I have read other reviews and the consumers are pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>hope this work better than the other items I am now using.</li>
            <li>I will buy another bottle when the other 1 is finished :)</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product from other Amazon contractors and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>this is another great product for my natural hair regimen, still have over half a bottle left from over a month</li>
            <li>I just bought two more bottles for $15 on here because this 4oz bottle didn&#x27;t last me barely two months...</li>
            <li>My edges are filling back in nicely, my hair feels so strong and thick.</li>
            <li>have fine red (natural) hair and now it feels fab!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed an increase in the amount of new growth I have and very well defined too.  </li>
            <li>I am a fan of all things natural, organic, and chemical-free, so I have been using Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Oil since 2008.</li>
            <li>Well, at least I enjoyed and fell in love with the Red Pimento Oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet.</li>
            <li>not worth the money...there are othjer products that you can use that are so much better</li>
            <li>The first time I used this oil it made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>will cause a full on allergic reaction instantly.</li>
            <li>This surprised me SO MUCH!  </li>
            <li>The smell is different but not bad in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I experienced a slight tingling on the scalp the first few times I used it but not now.</li>
            <li>This product has boost my confidence in hair growth,  I am eager to see new growth soon and very soon</li>
            <li>hair is already much thicker than it was about two weeks ago using these tactics, and before when I had about twenty hairs fall out in the shower on my hands, I see maybe 1-3 fall out at the max after a shower, and new hair comes in every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far my edges have come in strong and I have new growth in all areas of my head that I initially had issues with.</li>
            <li>I like the black castor oil alot better than this.  </li>
            <li>I would not buy this particular line of products again.</li>
            <li>only thing, the smell is ok, but i think it should be a bigger bottle/more oz for the price.</li>
            <li>I my hair is a decent length...</li>
            <li>As for growth, I think it is growing at a steady pace.</li>
            <li>first time using this red pimento oil I have not seen results because this is my first time using it so I will keep amazon posted</li>
            <li>/&gt;Think I need something a bit more potent and expensive for hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Sections parting the hair down the middle massage therapy, your be very pleased</li>
            <li>I WILL BUY AGAIN AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>no product s highly recommend this product for anyone</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I achieve salon-quality results without the high prices.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMEND .</li>
            <li>It washes out easily and does not weigh my hair down too much, but I can tell if I used it too often it would cause build up.  </li>
            <li>I am typically skeptical about products promising so much, but it is amazing how fast my hair has grown with consistent use.  </li>
            <li>its a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I need to use a little longer to see more results.</li>
            <li>Plus for my super dry hair, this really gets the blood flowing and seals in my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>( USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION)I would use a small old toothbrush and massage a dime size amount in my hair mainly my edges and my nape area.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t find the smell offensive or strong as stated by other users.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I would mist my edges with water or aloe vera juice for moisture, and then gently massage the Red Pimento Oil into my scalp and lightly coat the damaged edge areas with the same oil.</li>
            <li>I would mist my edges with water or aloe vera juice for moisture, and then gently massage the Red Pimento Oil into my scalp and lightly coat the damaged edge areas with the same oil.</li>
            <li>I am natural and have very kinky/coily hair ranging from 3&#x27;s to the 4&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Maybe my scalp was just too sensitive for this product, but I&#x27;ve had to stop using it because I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;ll lose a whole loc or something.</li>
            <li>My have is very kinky but soft</li>
            <li>Remedy Restructuring Shampoo, Phytospecific Intense Nutrition Mask (conditioner) or Phytospecific Vital Force Cream Bath (conditioner).  </li>
            <li>I have caucasian hair and it seemed to be an overly heavy oil (as opposed to the bhringaraj which is lighter and has a better fragrance, in my opinion)</li>
            <li>In my case, however, it dried hair and scalp, increased damage, and the hair was breaking more.</li>
            <li>About 2 weeks later I noticed the wig clips pretty much pulled my hair out in those area.</li>
            <li>I have been using the oil everyday for almost a month now and will order so more once i finish the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I will review the product again in a few weeks to see if I have any more results.</li>
            <li>Has a thick consistency and a nice smell..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thick in the bottle, kind of like petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>Not as expected but really makes you hair grow strong in a slow manner, You will be satisfied after&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I can say about it is that it smells totally fine (contrary to some other reviews I&#x27;ve read).</li>
            <li>Did not see significance hair growth, but did experience a healthier scalp, and silky soft hair that was less frizzy, and more manageable.</li>
            <li>After going through all the products i decided to try the Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth oil especially with the reviews that it got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second review for Tropic Isle strong Roots Red Pimento Oil.</li>
            <li>I only use this mixed in my hair grease now because its too strong on my scalp alone.</li>
            <li>and yes, my hair actually is having a growth spurt right now.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the plain castor oil.</li>
            <li>but i do add some to my deep conditioner right before i steam my hair.</li>
            <li>and now she said she sees new growth with a &amp;#34;pepper&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but for a new person thinking about trying it</li>
            <li>strengthened my roots and new growth</li>
            <li>After that I began using the oil to nourish my new growth</li>
            <li>this oil made my hair look as if I didnt even have new growth.</li>
            <li>MY NEW GROW SPROUTING OUT</li>
            <li>But I also wanted to incorporate oils into my new regiment.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser even noticed new growth in my temple area.</li>
            <li>can already tell that my hair is thicker, and new hairs are sprouting by using this twice a week.</li>
            <li>I see some new hair in places where it was falling out and thinning.</li>
            <li>You will not grow new hair.</li>
            <li>but I do see new hair growth.</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s my new routine...</li>
            <li>They appeal to people because it&#x27;s a new approach.</li>
            <li>I purchased Pure Emu Oil, the Professional Salon Hair Steamer, and Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil, and Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Treatment Mask (all from Amazon).  </li>
            <li>If I am going to apply any to my hair (not the scalp), I only dab a dime sized amount in my hands, rub my hands together, and then lightly coat my actual hair shafts in sections.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased the Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil - 4oz on June 15th, 2013 and have used it daily for 1 month so far.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair, mainly 3c/4a hair texture.</li>
            <li>The Tropic Isle Red Pimento is the only oil I&#x27;m comfortable applying to my scalp.</li>
            <li>This oil has been decent so far.</li>
            <li>My hair is moisturized and very soft.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair very soft and assist with breakage and mositure as well.  </li>
            <li>i use it in my hot oil treaments weekly, and it makes my hair super soft and gives my scalp a slight tingle..</li>
            <li>Right now my hair ranges to 9&#x27;-9 1/2&#x27; all over my head, but I will do official checks to have a clear starting</li>
            <li>it as a hot oil treatment in addition to using it as a daily regime.</li>
            <li>I use it as a way to combat dandruff and dryness in my scalp, and as a hot oil treatment prior to cleansing my hair.</li>
            <li>So, it can be a great product, a good product, or a terrible product depending on your individual hair type.</li>
            <li>It only itched the first 3 times I used it, now my scalp doesnt itch anymore.</li>
            <li>I used it only once and combined it with more coconut oil (it contains coconut oil and other ingredients).</li>
            <li>I started using this combination after using only the Pet Coat Rebuilder for the first week.</li>
            <li>and I am always looking for natural products to get to the root and help make my hair voluminous!</li>
            <li>it started make my hair comes out more  than usual.</li>
            <li>also still use it as a hot oil treatment whenever i do deep condition my hair</li>
            <li>It is bearable and upon first use I definitely &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; an affect on my scalp but now seems as if my scalp is already use to</li>
            <li>Love this product, I not sure about hair growth</li>
            <li>This is one of those products that show its potential from the first use.</li>
            <li>This was a little too strong for my roots.</li>
            <li>I had to open the product and clean it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The oil is light weight and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>It said that for natural hair use daily or often but with relaxed hair that is stressed from chemicals to apply it as a hot oil treatment only and to leave the hot oil in your hair covered for 15-20 min, so I did just that.</li>
            <li>, these products are necessary if your on that natural hair high like most of us black women.</li>
            <li>We have not noticed any new hair growth but it is early yet.  </li>
            <li>I have been natural now for about 2 months and have an inch of new growth.  </li>
            <li>My mom and sister also made a comment about my hair growing long right around the time I started to notice it.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it helped growth, but it was a nice product that made my hair feel terrific.  </li>
            <li>I read plenty of solid, positive reviews of this product</li>
            <li>When my hair dried, I was amazed how soft, manageable and full they looked!</li>
            <li>White male with semi long hair, was looking to find something that would thicken it without giving any more volume.</li>
            <li>I Squeeze a quarter size amount in the palm of my hand 2x and massage the Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil - 4oz throughout my hair and then comb my hair with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine to me, plus it disappears after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Although I have heard of castor oil, I wasn&#x27;t familiar with Jamaican black castor oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendation: Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Masque, a hot oil treatment (Emu Oil makes my hair feel really soft) and a hair steamer!  </li>
            <li>the smell isnt bad it actually kind of smell like a light lavender oil.</li>
            <li>But after 2 days I decided to use it on my whole head only because of how soft it made my kinky hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Now, as far as a hair growth stimulant.</li>
            <li>a natural</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is attributing to hair growth or not, but I have natural (un-relaxed) hair</li>
            <li>so I have to try to get it soft again</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to read the label, though.</li>
            <li>I just started using this product so its a bit early to tell whether it works on not.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft now too.</li>
            <li>This product make my 4c hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>... MUST SAY ITS A STAPLE SO FAR..</li>
            <li>HOW SOFT IT FEEL</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer putting perms or chemicals in my hair, so I have gone natural.</li>
            <li>So even if it doesn&#x27;t completely stop it, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will wait and see how it works on my hair so far nothing yet.</li>
            <li>Do not waste money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like simple.</li>
            <li>Too early to see if there is any re-growth.</li>
            <li>After my hair dries, it is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I use it about three times a week directly on my scalp.</li>
            <li>but anything that is all natural and promotes hair growth with no harmful side effects I will give a try</li>
            <li>have just recently started using it very often, it&#x27;s probably the closest thing to a cure for baldness out there, although I also throw propecia, rogaine, b, e, d vitamins, biotin, niacin to fight my hair loss.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll definitely notice a real difference.</li>
            <li>It cleared up my itchy scalp and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Product arrived as described, but did not notice any real improvement in my hair even though I used the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>It also make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I dont have any breakage and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>but it is making my hair feel so soft and luxurious</li>
            <li>My hair  is so soft but is was thinning out</li>
            <li>so I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li>hahaha, i never read the direction of how it is to be applied, i just apply it in my hair and leave it in as a regular oil.</li>
            <li>just in 3 months of going natural</li>
            <li>So one day I took my professional clippers and shaved my head without a guard to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I did experience some breakge when I was transitioning to natural and was advised by my hair care specialist not to use the product until after I went completely natural.</li>
            <li>volume to hair,definitely not,maybe thickens instead of adding volume unless you are natural and have hair that loves grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to love this product but the smell sucks.</li>
            <li>I used this for three weeks straight on my fading edges and then stopped using it daily.</li>
            <li>I have a fuller, thicker head of hair than I&#x27;ve had since I was 25 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to use it another time to see how it functions on natural hair.</li>
            <li>I didnt really use it because I was experiences with something at the same time</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not instantaneous) but working, I use on my 5 &amp; 10 yr old girls &amp; hubby notices the difference  as well</li>
            <li>Once I rinse the oil out, my hair is so soft and tangles literally fall out.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still to early to see a difference.</li>
            <li>It does makes you hair really soft after washing it out.</li>
            <li>and I like it because it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is undesirable but I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Hmmm I used this directly on my thin/balding areas as a man and in 2 days after headaches all the baby hairs in that area had fallen out.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s an old bald joke)</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this oil and received it in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>It works far as keeping dandruff build up.</li>
            <li>Everytime I use this product my scalp feels alive.</li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite product because it can be use daily on the hair and it does not leave a heavy build up.</li>
            <li>this product slowly but surely works.</li>
            <li>My hair is already thick and I am relaxed but are using this product for more growth along the way as I am stretching  relaxers for about 3 months and soon may be 4 months.</li>
            <li>My hairline use to look bald and slick but my loctician was able to put new locs there only a couple of days ago.</li>
            <li>I got this product last month, and within the 1st week I noticed tiny little hairs standing up on the top of my head, it was new growth!</li>
            <li>My scalp used to be dry &amp; itchy but that stopped after my first use.  </li>
            <li>The Jamaican Black Castor Oil, The Tropic Isle Living strong roots red pimento hair growth oild, and the castor oil hair food.</li>
            <li>if it really worked wonders on someone please tell me how long it takes to really see the the difference otherwise am really starting to think it wont work.</li>
            <li>With the second bottle I haven&#x27;t been so consistent with using it and putting on my scalp so naturally the problems are back</li>
            <li>I also own an 8oz Jamaican Black Castor Oil that I use to seal my wet hair only after my weekly wash and condition.</li>
            <li>I apply this oil to my scalp after installing mini twist my roots and hair was soft for like 5 days this oil does moisturize, and then the new growth starting coming .</li>
            <li>maybe i should give it more time but so far, i have been using it for maybe a little over a month and the difference is almost minimal.</li>
            <li>WOW, all these products work very well for dry damaged hair, if you hair is thirsty this oil is one of the products to buy and it smells ooooooh</li>
            <li>When I see that my bottle is half empty I promptly order two more.</li>
            <li>I have used it about 4 times (once a week is recommended) and the bottle is pretty much empty.  </li>
            <li>normal routine included washing with both the Phytospecific and the Aveda shampoo&#x27;s mentioned above.  </li>
            <li>The smell takes a little getting use to but fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell very good, it probably requires a constant usage to give the promised results, which i didn&#x27;t do because of the bad smell on my head.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am super excited about any product with that type of results.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my wife and we can actually can see new hair growth.</li>
            <li>And I only notice this \\&quot;itching\\&quot; where I see new hair growing.</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t get any flaking or itching in the areas of my head that did not have new growth) or if the the red pimento caused an allergic-type reaction when applied to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I am using the Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil mixed with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil as a scalp treatment 2x a week.</li>
            <li>In particular, the high frequency generator I bought for $20 has produced an absolute miracle in only a few times of using it.</li>
            <li>so that costs little fortunately because for me it was a waste of money, the smell is very strong to let it stand one day to another, is very fatty</li>
            <li>I only used this 3 times and my hair completely stopped falling!</li>
            <li>I didnt however experience anything i would consider a major growth or length change</li>
            <li>When I had it relaxed, I noticed such fullness on my hairline that I was completely amazed!</li>
            <li>I used it on my scalp every other day and used as a hot oil treatment every two weeks.</li>
            <li>If you have very dry and very corse hair</li>
            <li>Apparently this stuff causes major shedding and hence my problem.</li>
            <li>This product is a little thin (runny) for my taste, but effective nonetheless!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed additional positive results from this product including thicker, softer strands that are well moisturized (even my usually dry, coarse hair).  </li>
            <li>You may notice some shedding if you rub it into your hair the first couple times, that is just weak hair follicles being tossed out by new hair follicles that are much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have not used this item long enough to see any real results.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had product long enough to give it a 5, but I do like it and really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to several people that I know who have gone Natural and have damaged and breakage around the edges and Temple of their hair.</li>
            <li>I will repurchase the product and try it on my  natural hair, It might work differently</li>
            <li>I will try Biotin next, and I will create my hair growth oil mixture Jojoba oil,castro oil, sulfur, and mega-tek, so far on my list.</li>
            <li>but I have not really used it much</li>
            <li>but after deep conditioning and conditioning my hair came back to normal.</li>
            <li>My hair was thin on top of my scalp and looking&lt;</li>
            <li>It is definitely not cheap but worth trying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any way to determine, but, all in all, it&#x27;s not a bad product and why not give it a try?</li>
            <li>You can feel it in your scalp after a couple minutes and you can see the results within the first couple days of how your hair feels and less then 2 weeks to see some growth and shine.  </li>
            <li>YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT, IT CAN BE ADDED TO ANY SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER, CAN ALSO BE USED AS A HOT OIL TREATMENT !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young and have really thick hair, but in the last few years, my hair has been falling out much more than normal.</li>
            <li>The problem for me is that the bottle is super small</li>
            <li>However, I am super lazy and never remember to use it for scalp treatments like I</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people swear by it, so it&#x27;s worth trying, especially since it&#x27;s such a cheap price, but it didn&#x27;t slow down hair loss, help my hair to grow in, or make my hair grow longer.</li>
            <li>What I mean is it just doesn&#x27;t spread as easy, and I mixed with olive oil</li>
            <li>Other than that I really did like it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had that much relief from any other products like I have from this hair growth oil.</li>
            <li>the next time about a month later after the thinning hairs had grown back in some I used it before the shampoo and put the plastic cap on for 20 minutes and washed as normal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 34 year old white male.</li>
            <li>I use this product Red Pimento on my hair and it never work for me,i use this for about one year and got no reSults for my hair,so i went back to my old products,so i rate this product</li>
            <li>At first I used this oil at my edges because they&#x27;re thinning a little.  </li>
            <li>It tingled a little but was not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>, so hope that will help with further new growth and long term</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle and within less than a month I had an inch of hair back.</li>
            <li>At first I was afraid the pimento oil might be a bit strong for my scalp and make it burn.</li>
            <li>Feels good but the smell is pretty bad!</li>
            <li>He was really upset as he is only 36, the doctors said to expect it due to the stress and trauma his body went through...</li>
            <li>I suggest running the bottle under hot water for a few minutes before applying.</li>
            <li>and it was pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>It will take a serious shampoo and dry..and the next day shampoo to free yourself)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a different type of smell its hard to describe perhaps sweet or fruity type of smell.</li>
            <li>Well like everyone I bought this prduct along with the oil, how ever the first product which was the Jamaican Black caster oil, was fine, however the strongroot my hair started falling out an got very thin, an i had a pretty good grade of hair Thick but not super thick.</li>
            <li>I am natural and HAD a problem with my scalp being dry.</li>
            <li>black castroil oil didnt do much for me..</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, I saw a difference from the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tired Strong Roots for two txt now.</li>
            <li>The things I didn&#x27;t like about this oil is that it smells funky, and it&#x27;s very runny, if you put a little too much it runs down your face.</li>
            <li>I also noticed some new growth (not a whole lot, but definitely noticeable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so much about Red Pimento and Black Castor Oil ,I had to give it a go to see what all the talk was about.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>I purchased in hopes of using it to help my fine, thin Caucasian wavy hair grow a bit healthier.</li>
            <li>have also been taking much more care of my hair of late such as using a cooler temperature to wash the hair, not rubbing it roughly with a towel to dry ( I dab it and then leave it in a towel for some time)</li>
            <li>Does live up to the hype or all the gloating from other customers.</li>
            <li>It does have an odd smell which is not too bad, but it is good for me!</li>
            <li>This is a good hair product, however I get bad breakouts on my hairline and forehead.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t good or bad.</li>
            <li>This happens to be a good one out of a normally bad bunch.</li>
            <li>I have nothing bad to say about this product and nothing good either.</li>

            <li> It feels great on my scalp, kind of warming and relaxing.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do any good for me</li>
            <li> It seems to be really good, it seems like my hair has grow longer, if that is even possible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> this  product it leaves your hair feel very strong and I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell to it</li>
            <li> it also has a very strong smell so i would prefer applying it to your scalp at night</li>
            <li> I tried it because I&#x27;d been using Bhringaraj oil with great success.</li>
            <li> I sure hope it&#x27;s effective...</li>
            <li> Wow, this is great for growing a beard!</li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, exactly like allspice (which is what Jamaican &#x27;pimento&#x27; is), so it&#x27;s not offensive smelling if you want to use it as a hair grooming oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> My beautician recommended this product and it works fine!  </li>
            <li> Feels and looks so healthy, shinny and strong!</li>
            <li> the feeling and the smell very light.</li>
            <li> it very nice and helps me very very much.</li>
            <li> It has kind of a strong smell</li>
            <li> This was amazing and worked great for my hair and my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I love love love it .....</li>
            <li> This oil is much, much better than the plan JBCO.  </li>
            <li> It shipped to me fast and in great condition also.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not oily or greasy like most hair oil products.</li>
            <li> I am sure this product works wonders for some people.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt that this product works, I just wish you got more for what it costs.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Ok I used it on my scalp and it gives a tingling feeling</li>
            <li> LOVE THE CONSISTANCY</li>
            <li> However, I love the way it makes my scalp feel tingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give more details in about a month.</li>
            <li> I think it is mostly the castor oil itself that has been helping my hair to grow and be stronger, so instead of two containers, I will just stick with my JBCO to seal and moisturize since I do not mind its thicker consistency and save my money.</li>
            <li> Asked for more.</li>
            <li> hope product work as well as what i read about it if work i will be ordering more just give it time to work.</li>
            <li> I  love the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> is to put more hair.</li>
            <li> The edges get more wear and tear because I wrap my hair at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product about 3 times now, and I love the feeling it provides.  </li>
            <li> it with your favorite lotion if you decide to use on skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that my beer is fuller thicker and all around better looking and feeling this product</li>
            <li> I guess I was expecting a better result.</li>
            <li> Recently, I can tell Tropic Isle has adjusted the formula to lighten the fragrance of the oil (before it used to be VERY strong) but the effectiveness and quality are in no way diminished!!!</li>
            <li> BUT i use so many products</li>
            <li> ,  I LOVE it and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> and I must say that I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I must say I am so glad I did</li>
            <li> The hair on the top and front of my head is getting stronger.</li>
            <li> OK LET ME SAYS THIS</li>
            <li> OK,I WILL GIVE IT SOME MORE TIME,</li>
            <li> and I will surely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Regardless of whether I notice any growth I&#x27;m going to get more of this oil.  </li>
            <li> Her hair has now stopped shedding and never looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> my hair would show an inch or more in growth.</li>
            <li> I can feel fullness in my hair and it feels more silky, stronger, and it&#x27;s falling out at a slower rate.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>

            <li> which is stunning.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Most hair oils give me breakouts</li>
            <li> The results have been astonishing.  </li>
            <li> Hair is thinner on top still</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> the product is ok but they need to improve the package</li>
            <li> But either way I was not that satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Love it and the smell.</li>
            <li> I will buy more of this.</li>
            <li> Be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> Most times, I&#x27;ll sit under a heating cap.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and so does my hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff...</li>
            <li> but i love the smell and what it does to my hair when i apply it.  </li>
            <li> but i am really in love wih this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is okay, but the Argan oil works wonders.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> make sure you wash it out.</li>
            <li> I can tolerate tea tree oil better than this.</li>
            <li> The more ways you take care of your hair, the better off it will be.</li>
            <li> but if you leave it in just use a moisturizer that smells better.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love the way it stimulates my scalp but seen no differences in the length or thickness of my hair</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> So far so good !</li>
            <li> The product is ok , smells so good and for hot oil mascara work great&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!!  </li>
            <li> I ran across the reviews for Tropic Isle Strong Roots Oil and was astonished by how many folks said this works, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> You better have strong roots to withstand this growth oil.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell; it&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> Tablets + Hair Growth Essentials - 60 capsules - Promotes Hair Growth, Healthy Skin, and Strong Nails]].</li>
            <li> I lightly dab across sections of my scalp and massage with my fingers for nice, light even application.</li>
            <li> I have fine caucasian hair, so it may work better on thicker or curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and clean!</li>
            <li> I think this may be more for ethnic hair, I have brown, fine hair and this just is not a product I will use again.</li>
            <li> Make sure you also use some good shampoo, shampoo with black castor oil is great, and a conditioner with shea butter is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear my hair in locs &amp; it gives my new growth a very nice sheen.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this helps my hair grown, but it sure makes it silky and very, very shinny!!</li>
            <li> I will re-visit this review in a couple of months, so I can give a more accurate and descriptive write about this product.  </li>
            <li> Great on sensitive scalps as well</li>
            <li> This product was not for me - I am sure it is my chemical make up - because most of the reviews are great - it simply didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> wow this is a great product i use this twice a week</li>
            <li> So happy i found something to make my hair thicker and grow that is natural.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR BOTH NATURAL AND RELAXED HAIR.</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old BF who has experienced hair loss since I was 39.  </li>
            <li> (It smells wonderful by the way, then again I&#x27;ve always been partial to the spice fragrance notes)</li>
            <li> I love the smell, which is very distinct.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, the smell is not the best, but I do not find it offensive.  </li>
            <li> Which means anybody could easily make this themselves.</li>
            <li> This growth oil keeps your hair clean and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because it has a spout for easy application.</li>
            <li> I do like that it has an easy pour spout, it washes out easily, and you get quite a bit of oil.</li>
            <li> cells that block the hair follicle pores are zapped away and the hair&lt;br /&gt;can grow very quickly and uninhibited.</li>
            <li> Just the simple, &#x27;your hair looks great&#x27;, or &#x27;I love your hair&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and does make my hair seem thicker when I use it.</li>
            <li> it would be so easy to get the hair I&#x27;ve been wanting.</li>
            <li> I used many many products and had marginal success with Growganics and Hairfinity vitamins  among others.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is strong and it truly works.</li>
            <li> Strong warning:  </li>
            <li> The smell is strong but it doesnt bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Strong smell</li>
            <li> Tropic Isle Strong Roots</li>
            <li> The scent can be strong, but that does not bother me.</li>
            <li> Smells to strong for my liking</li>
            <li> everyone seemed to talk about how it had a strong smell and what not.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that a product has magical properties and makes something as nice or better than what it was, but this oil definitely surprised me!</li>
            <li> and the way my scalp tingles in a refreshing cool (not burning) way.&lt;br /&gt;Since applying it to my hair each evening, I have noticed a significant reduction in hair loss when I shower and brush and there seems to be more baby hairs growing around my hair line.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the cool tingling feeling it gives when applying it to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I warm the bottle in hot water for a minute, then use a shower cap.</li>
            <li> First of all i would like to say that i purchase this product with my own money</li>
            <li> it actually smells good in a way but very strong.</li>
            <li> seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> awesome product, I&#x27;m on a 30 day challenge Jamaican black castor oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Marley twist just wasn&#x27;t  for my fine curly hair.</li>

            <li> So far it seems pretty okay!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I seriously am never disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> i just wanna let ppl know that red pimento oil is pretty good!</li>
            <li> Although it smells funcky, it is all worth it !</li>
            <li> After using this product once a week for 3 weeks, I had a less than pleasant allergic reaction known as Contact Dermatitis!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the results after 3-month after using this product.</li>
            <li> He is was so excited that I bought him the shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product but only 4OUNCES for that much money, is killing my money in great size.</li>
            <li> However, I decided to incorporate a hot oil treatment and to try a more moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be sure to be consistent.</li>
            <li> before I ordered it I researched it further on the Internet how to use it safely and effectively on relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I thought more natural ingredients would be better.</li>
            <li> Massage it into my clean scalp and put on a shower cap for 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I used this product only once and was pleasantly supprised  that it did what is said.  </li>
            <li> the oils smells nice and it comes in a wonderful bottle that makes it easy to apply to the hair and scalp, but when I applied it my eyes got irritated, may be its because I left on for a long time or because I used too much</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li> The product came quicker than expected which is great.</li>
            <li> As nice as this product is, it would be FAR cheaper to make it than buy it.</li>
            <li> The smell, everybody says the smell is unbearable, not SO true.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it really does work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking a lot of supplements, vitamins, Rogaine, and anything that has had good reviews to grow back my hair without subcombing to hair implants.</li>
            <li> My hair loves it, it is very moisturizing and healthy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing true results.</li>
            <li> Love the smell it really did make  </li>
            <li> I then rinse with cool water and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love it because it stopped my scalp from itching so much.</li>
            <li> I need to give it more time, but it did leave my scalp very itchy.</li>
            <li> (I use a natural remedy, Saw Palmetto, which is extremely effective), in combination with this.</li>
            <li> This stuff has an odor that, while it&#x27;s not really bad can seem cloying after a while.</li>
            <li> i liked it for the fact that my hair felt super soft after i washed it out.</li>
            <li> Other than this, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to the other products from this compant I have tried.</li>
            <li> KEEPS HAIR AND SCALP FRESH, CLEAN, SHINE, SOOTHES AND CALMS THE SCALP</li>
            <li> Personally, I think the smell is ok, not too strong and not too light.</li>
            <li> The pimento oil makes my scalp tingle &amp; it has a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> BUT MY BAGS AREA YOU COULD SAY THEY WERE SOME WHAT BOLD</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a healthier and more vibrant hair.</li>
            <li> is until you finally find what really works for your hair)and for me, finding a GREAT REGIMEN  </li>
            <li> and now you have a super growth formula going on.</li>
            <li> Does seem to relieve pain quickly..</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and it did arrive quickly and well</li>
            <li> Before I did my research about this product I was wearing a quick weave, however, I do not like weave, so</li>
            <li> It grows and thickens the hair quickly..</li>
            <li> Super product and looking forward to hearing about the super growth that will happen in Kenya.</li>
            <li> During my most recent visit to the salon, my stylist suggested that I incorporate more moisturizing products into my regimen.  </li>
            <li> About 14 months ago, I exerienced massive hair loss -- the top completely, most of the front and some on both sides.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels healthy and vibrant.</li>
            <li> other than the finer strands in the front of my head had a very smooth and nicely defined wave pattern.  </li>
            <li> It recommends using it 2 times a week with a hot cap, or under a hair dryer, but I just wrap my hair in a light towel or cap and turn on the blow dryer for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> what I do is take a very hot towel and put it on my head.</li>
            <li> in all, I am very pleased with this product and definitely plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it so much that I am now oiling my hair every night!</li>
            <li> Primarily use it for a hot oil treatment after coloring and washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use my oil and Dominican deep conditioners and loving the quick growth of my hair my scalp feel clean and nurtured</li>
            <li> I use the strong root pimento oil along with Jamaican black castor oil &amp; I have seen good hair growth results.</li>
            <li> But I tried many different topical hair growth formulas and this one seemed to be the most effective.</li>
            <li> effect meaning many folicles are opening and came to surface which means new hair is coming.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed a lot more baby hairs which means that it is helping me grow new hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my new favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> ( more thickness than new growth).</li>
            <li> It was so strong that I decided it was ready for some color</li>
            <li> It may be too strong for sensitive scalp, fine hair and edges.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, strong roots</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and much better than the expensive hot oil treatments you buy.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this and his hair stopped falling out after a week of consistent use!</li>
            <li> It seem like it was working well the first day or two , and than i notice my hair was just coming out!  </li>
            <li> I am a new user to this product, initially when used as directed I experienced a lot of shedding.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the pure castor oil from same company.</li>
            <li> in all this is a lovely oil to use that is easy to shampoo out in the morning and gives a nice condition to the hair due to the natural oil.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this stuff and let me tell you this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Hope you will enjoy using it as much as I am.</li>
            <li> worked nice wish they had bigger bottle</li>
            <li> Worth trying.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use this yet, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> He continues to use with success in scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try if you are not prone to breakouts on your skin.</li>
            <li> If you have ever smelled Jamaican Allspice in the grocery store, then this oil smells similar to that but more light.</li>
            <li> Okay I know the old saying anything with the word growth dont believe .</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It definitely gives the hair a boost of volume and nice shine.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff and the way it feels on my natural 4b/4c hair.  </li>
            <li> I also love the natural smell.</li>
            <li> I love that all the ingredients are natural and there are no artificial perfumes.</li>
            <li> Love the product for my natural hair</li>
            <li> I hoped that I would have success in growing out my hairline</li>
            <li> Oh well, worth a try I guess.</li>
            <li> I use Tropic Hair Growth directly on my scalp which grows my hair and keeps it healthy, I also mix it with Jamaican&lt;br /&gt;Black</li>
            <li> i love this stuff better than the other brands.</li>
            <li> I must say, it is a bit itchy the first minute or so after you apply it, but it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> Delivery was pretty quick, I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I noticed on the directions that you have to rinse it out</li>
            <li> It straight up smells like pimento....if you&#x27;re familiar with that scent.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work right away.</li>
            <li> then I go right over it</li>
            <li> YOU GOT THE RIGHT</li>
            <li> When you apply the oil to the scalp,&lt;br /&gt;you can feel it start to zing right away.</li>
            <li> right now.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Yeah you read that right.</li>
            <li> I put it on right before I go to bed and then wash it out in the morning.</li>
            <li> If it will help with hair loss, too early to say, but manageability, healthy shine and fulness - yes, that&#x27;s what I got after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells very natural, though for some people the smell may be too strong.</li>
            <li> The other ingredients (Jamaican black castor oil, wheat germ oil and coconut oil) are all very good at promoting healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will order lots more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not sure if the flakes I experienced are a byproduct of the growth</li>
            <li> My roots in the front part of my hair have grown and I am so happy, my friend recommended castor oil for my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> It was my first time trying it, and got results right away..</li>
            <li> This makes for easy dispensing and application directly to the roots of the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I saw this product when purchasing Jamaican Black Castor Oil so since I loved that by Tropic Isle Living, I assumed I would like this also.</li>
            <li> This item really works, my hair is growing back nicely and thicker as well.</li>
            <li> Buying a larger bottle would be more economical if you like how it works.</li>
            <li> I guess time and regular use will tell just how effective this product really is</li>
            <li> /&gt;For even better chances of success, use a oral supplement such as biotin-</li>
            <li> hands down one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I leave in my hair 20 mins with a cap right before shampooing and my hair is much more thicker I definitely notice growth.  </li>
            <li> I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> Very very gooey.</li>
            <li> Most people use a hair regrowth formula and ignore the other important things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied a mild texturizer to my hair during the second month and a week after I resumed application of the product to my scalp, I started getting a strong case of the \\&quot;itchies.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> It was an easy process, high marks all around, highly recommend and will buy again...</li>
            <li> So far i have not seen a HUGE change in my edges</li>
            <li> and I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I first learned about the Tropic Isle JBC products when i say my co-worker using them and deciced that i would try them after hearing that they worked for her  </li>
            <li> i plan to take my braids out soon and continue using the product as both a hot oil treatment and on my scalp every 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope this current review helps.. :-)</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product use it as a hot oil treatments</li>
            <li> I use this about once a week as a hot oil massage.  </li>
            <li> I have about 2 more uses left in my bottle and have been using it maybe about two months.  </li>
            <li> I was speechless on how fast my hair grew !</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 starts because this product did exactly what it said it would</li>
            <li> IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li> I NEED TO SAVE UP AND BUY A WHOLE BATCH TO BE SHIPPED OVER!  </li>
            <li> this is my first purchase ...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using this product.</li>
            <li> However when I first used the product, it did make my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I USE IT AS A HOT OIL TREATMENT</li>
            <li> This product started working the first time she used it.</li>
            <li> so it could be used as a hot oil treatment and the coconut oil as a pre-shampoo treatment.  </li>
            <li> and I already started yesterday with my challenge when i recieved the pimento oil first.</li>
            <li> hot oil</li>
            <li> And the delivery is fast so I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair first because I use lots of cosmetic products on my hair to make it look fuller.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a spicy type of smell to it, and from I can tell, only healthy and helpful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again, but won&#x27;t need to for a decade since it goes really far for my light use.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a hot oil treatment for my hair</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t forget to give yourself a hot oil treatment with this and sit under a hair steamer(haven&#x27;t done this)</li>
            <li> I can only imagine it would add more results.</li>
            <li> ( I threw the first bottle away)</li>
            <li> The first time was to oil my scalp</li>
            <li> I use it as a weekly hot oil treatment.  </li>
            <li> I usually do a Hot oil treatment, biweekly</li>
            <li> It practically cleared my dandruff issues when I was on the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I love and will only use this stuff.</li>
            <li> You can really feel the effects as it is absorbed into the scalp.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what the sellers said it would.</li>
            <li> It is not runny and it will do exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what the label said it would do.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE SEVERAL BALD SPOTS IN TBE TOP.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> (my hair reaches just below the top of my back) and I flat-ironed.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like white and not liquids</li>
            <li> first time using this Imixed it with my shae butter and just used as an oil for my scalp</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was so pleased with the protein treatment by the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ususally there is a cycle where it comes out in the top and grows back.  </li>
            <li> You can tell the difference the first time that you use it.  </li>
            <li> first the scent was so overpowering that it gagged me.</li>
            <li> what I do is use it as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Too hot.</li>
            <li> I steam my hair first...</li>
            <li> I applied it to my scalp every night I find that if im consistent with using my products i don&#x27;t get results</li>
            <li> i did exactly that</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice but was satisfied with the immediate results......</li>
            <li> OK product a little to strong for my hair problem would reorder</li>
            <li> However, it is great to use as a daily scalp moisturizer, as my scalp is usually pretty dry.</li>
            <li> If this stuff pumps up my fine hair without weighing it down, Im sure it will work for pretty much any hair type.</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t that pleasant which is why I usually apply it a day or two before my wash day.  </li>
            <li> I have just purchased my seond bottle even though the first is more than half full.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft anc clean scalp.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it&#x27;ll thicken my hair and get it back growing back good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relaxed ( 7 weeks post) and my hair came out nice and soft after I washed and deep conditioned.  </li>
            <li> this is a must if you want to see a different in the feel and texture of your hair love it now everyone in the house wants to use it</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if it has to do with the Castro oil, the coconut oil or this red pimento oil that is making my hair grow at this fast rate, but i know for sure</li>
            <li> Well, I just picked up this product, so this is an initial review, but I can definitely feel the oil perking up my scalp when I apply it, and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> I am still trailing the product, so I can&#x27;t give it five stars as of yet, but I am anticipating positive results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on a positive review.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice results the first month I used it,</li>
            <li> but my hair grows pretty fast any way.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty much bald in two spots and I saw a difference within a couple of weeks of massaging the oil in those areas.</li>
            <li> At this point, my hair feels really soft and full of moisturize.  </li>
            <li> My hair was shiny, soft and full of body...</li>
            <li> I was upset about the 2 car garage forming at the top of my scalp and searched high and low for product.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong as you do smell the red pimento</li>
            <li> The only con is the smell wayyyy to strong</li>
            <li> One thing I do want you to know is that you can get Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair</li>
            <li> I do not use for Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil 4 Ounce, I had any Laser Comb Therapy treatment hair loss, promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li> but with STRONG ROOTS RED PIMENTO OIL, the experience was one of the BEST!MY 4C HAIR BECAME</li>
            <li> Tropic Isle Living Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil is what it say it is.</li>
            <li> Tropic strong roots red pimento hair-</li>
            <li> Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil, 4 Ounce (Misc.)  </li>
            <li> Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil has already grown my hair in those bald</li>
            <li> In February 2014 i began using Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil.  </li>
            <li> Strong tingling feeling, plus, you only need to leave it in for 20-60 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been rubbing it into my eyebrows and eyelashes and should have taken before and after photos as I am certain my eyebrows are filling in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I now use 100% Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> THIS OIL IS VERY STRONG, RICH, THICK</li>
            <li> It is like I have found a new love and respect for my hair and wish to take care of it as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Take a DHT blocker daily, make sure to get plenty of food, B vitamins, omega 3&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s, plenty of sleep on a consistent basis, and buy some shampoos and conditioners that have some tea tree oil as well as other remedies that are good for the hair, and let your hair air dry after a shower.</li>
            <li> Its my first time using this particular product</li>
            <li> I liked it a little.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff...</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> the difficulty in getting it out of my hair is a deterrent, really)</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and my hair has thinned so much because of food intolerances</li>
            <li> My hairdresser looked at my scalp at the beginning and then again after several weeks and confirmed that my folicles are showing activity.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the smell of the product that resembles a tropical cinnamon type of scent.  </li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> but it really hasn&#x27;t gotten any longer.  </li>
            <li> I used this regime for about 4 months straight</li>
            <li> I used this regime for about 4 months straight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had and used this product for over 2 weeks, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really done anything.</li>
            <li> To my surprise this product really made my hair shine for days.</li>
            <li> I really like this product...</li>
            <li> I have very course hair - 4-C hair.</li>
            <li> Growth Oil - 4oz much cheaper at your Beauty Supply Store.</li>
            <li> You can really smell the pimento in this oil .</li>
            <li> but I think I will just stick with my vitamins because it&#x27;s so much of a hassle to use every week.</li>
            <li> Cant really say if I like it or not.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.  </li>
            <li> I have always had really thing hair</li>
            <li> and I never had that much hair too.</li>
            <li> this product really works for me.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t get much out of this product and will not re-order.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel really moisturized.</li>
            <li> My daughter was diagnosed with seborrhea of the scalp, and the red pimento worked wonders for her scalp, and her bald spots filled in too.</li>
            <li> Thanks you so much I will keep in touch with you....</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> The top of my hair (center) is where it was the thinnest and around</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect anything to happen for that area</li>
            <li> The whole truth and nothing but the truth I&#x27;ve had my twist in for 2wks and 4 days</li>
            <li> but I just gently use my finger tips.</li>
            <li> My hair grows much faster.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to spread out.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely keep using.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t really care for the smell.</li>
            <li> and I really like the applicator bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really did not like this product at all.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very moisturized and</li>
            <li> There is a real sense that it is feeding the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I was often in a rush to get ready and would tear a brush through it</li>
            <li> i absolutely loveeee the smell of this oil.</li>
            <li> I tell you that it really promotes hair growth.  </li>
            <li> idk if this really works I&#x27;ll keep but probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> It really is helping my hair grow</li>
            <li> No one can tell me this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li> And also hoped it would really make it grow faster.</li>
            <li> I really did not care for this product.</li>
            <li> IT MADE MY HAIR VERY GREASY</li>
            <li> My staple products are Phytospecific Intense Nutrition Shampoo, Aveda Damage</li>
            <li> and this really worked..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that much breakage anymore</li>
            <li> My hair is much healthier and stronger.</li>
            <li> DIDNT REALLY SEE A CHANGED IN MY HAIR</li>
            <li> DOESNT REALLY SEEM TO WORK FOR ME</li>
            <li> In conjunction with the oil, the biotin helps stimulate results faster and make the hair that is growing or has grown in much stronger.</li>
            <li> IT IS GROWING MY HAIR OUT FAST IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WILDGROWTH OIL AND STRAIGHT UP CASTOR OIL.</li>
            <li> Really works</li>
            <li> I have hair covering my whole head  --</li>
            <li> My hair is short and chemical free</li>
            <li> thank you so much Amazon.</li>
            <li> This oil really soothes my eyes if I apply it before bedtime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gloopy product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stimulate your scalp, or increase circulation, and the ingredients don&#x27;t block DHT or 5-alpha reductase, responsible for hair loss.</li>
            <li> It really does work and does what it claims.</li>
            <li> and I already know its the real deal..</li>
            <li> Haha the smell doesnt effect me at all.</li>
            <li> Much much to say.</li>
            <li> It will hydrate and your roots will feel very moisturised.</li>
            <li> So therefore your roots will become much stronger.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much of it to achieve  moisture.</li>
            <li> but it can be too much if you use a lot.</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> it really really works people so go out and order it.</li>
            <li> like the smell,  it is very think,  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am one to only speak of my own personal experience</li>
            <li> The finer hair is toward the top and front of my head, while the coarser hair is near the back.  </li>
            <li> It stimulates the scalp very well and after the first use it feels normal on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle i recieved within a matter of 3 days super fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> My mother, who has very straight and coarse hair, absolutely loves it and uses it more regularly.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and great price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews and the consumers are pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> hope this work better than the other items I am now using.</li>
            <li> I will buy another bottle when the other 1 is finished :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product from other Amazon contractors and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li> this is another great product for my natural hair regimen, still have over half a bottle left from over a month</li>
            <li> I just bought two more bottles for $15 on here because this 4oz bottle didn&#x27;t last me barely two months...</li>
            <li> My edges are filling back in nicely, my hair feels so strong and thick.</li>
            <li> have fine red (natural) hair and now it feels fab!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed an increase in the amount of new growth I have and very well defined too.  </li>
            <li> I am a fan of all things natural, organic, and chemical-free, so I have been using Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Oil since 2008.</li>
            <li> Well, at least I enjoyed and fell in love with the Red Pimento Oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet.</li>
            <li> not worth the money...there are othjer products that you can use that are so much better</li>
            <li> The first time I used this oil it made my hair soft.</li>
            <li> will cause a full on allergic reaction instantly.</li>
            <li> This surprised me SO MUCH!  </li>
            <li> The smell is different but not bad in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I experienced a slight tingling on the scalp the first few times I used it but not now.</li>
            <li> This product has boost my confidence in hair growth,  I am eager to see new growth soon and very soon</li>
            <li> hair is already much thicker than it was about two weeks ago using these tactics, and before when I had about twenty hairs fall out in the shower on my hands, I see maybe 1-3 fall out at the max after a shower, and new hair comes in every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far my edges have come in strong and I have new growth in all areas of my head that I initially had issues with.</li>
            <li> I like the black castor oil alot better than this.  </li>
            <li> I would not buy this particular line of products again.</li>
            <li> only thing, the smell is ok, but i think it should be a bigger bottle/more oz for the price.</li>
            <li> I my hair is a decent length...</li>
            <li> As for growth, I think it is growing at a steady pace.</li>
            <li> first time using this red pimento oil I have not seen results because this is my first time using it so I will keep amazon posted</li>
            <li> /&gt;Think I need something a bit more potent and expensive for hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Sections parting the hair down the middle massage therapy, your be very pleased</li>
            <li> I WILL BUY AGAIN AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> no product s highly recommend this product for anyone</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to grow their hair out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I achieve salon-quality results without the high prices.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMEND .</li>
            <li> It washes out easily and does not weigh my hair down too much, but I can tell if I used it too often it would cause build up.  </li>
            <li> I am typically skeptical about products promising so much, but it is amazing how fast my hair has grown with consistent use.  </li>
            <li> its a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I need to use a little longer to see more results.</li>
            <li> Plus for my super dry hair, this really gets the blood flowing and seals in my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> ( USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION)I would use a small old toothbrush and massage a dime size amount in my hair mainly my edges and my nape area.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t find the smell offensive or strong as stated by other users.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I would mist my edges with water or aloe vera juice for moisture, and then gently massage the Red Pimento Oil into my scalp and lightly coat the damaged edge areas with the same oil.</li>
            <li> I would mist my edges with water or aloe vera juice for moisture, and then gently massage the Red Pimento Oil into my scalp and lightly coat the damaged edge areas with the same oil.</li>
            <li> I am natural and have very kinky/coily hair ranging from 3&#x27;s to the 4&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Maybe my scalp was just too sensitive for this product, but I&#x27;ve had to stop using it because I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;ll lose a whole loc or something.</li>
            <li> My have is very kinky but soft</li>
            <li> Remedy Restructuring Shampoo, Phytospecific Intense Nutrition Mask (conditioner) or Phytospecific Vital Force Cream Bath (conditioner).  </li>
            <li> I have caucasian hair and it seemed to be an overly heavy oil (as opposed to the bhringaraj which is lighter and has a better fragrance, in my opinion)</li>
            <li> In my case, however, it dried hair and scalp, increased damage, and the hair was breaking more.</li>
            <li> About 2 weeks later I noticed the wig clips pretty much pulled my hair out in those area.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil everyday for almost a month now and will order so more once i finish the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I will review the product again in a few weeks to see if I have any more results.</li>
            <li> Has a thick consistency and a nice smell..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick in the bottle, kind of like petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Not as expected but really makes you hair grow strong in a slow manner, You will be satisfied after&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I can say about it is that it smells totally fine (contrary to some other reviews I&#x27;ve read).</li>
            <li> Did not see significance hair growth, but did experience a healthier scalp, and silky soft hair that was less frizzy, and more manageable.</li>
            <li> After going through all the products i decided to try the Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth oil especially with the reviews that it got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second review for Tropic Isle strong Roots Red Pimento Oil.</li>
            <li> I only use this mixed in my hair grease now because its too strong on my scalp alone.</li>
            <li> and yes, my hair actually is having a growth spurt right now.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the plain castor oil.</li>
            <li> but i do add some to my deep conditioner right before i steam my hair.</li>
            <li> and now she said she sees new growth with a &amp;#34;pepper&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but for a new person thinking about trying it</li>
            <li> strengthened my roots and new growth</li>
            <li> After that I began using the oil to nourish my new growth</li>
            <li> this oil made my hair look as if I didnt even have new growth.</li>
            <li> MY NEW GROW SPROUTING OUT</li>
            <li> But I also wanted to incorporate oils into my new regiment.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser even noticed new growth in my temple area.</li>
            <li> can already tell that my hair is thicker, and new hairs are sprouting by using this twice a week.</li>
            <li> I see some new hair in places where it was falling out and thinning.</li>
            <li> You will not grow new hair.</li>
            <li> but I do see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s my new routine...</li>
            <li> They appeal to people because it&#x27;s a new approach.</li>
            <li> I purchased Pure Emu Oil, the Professional Salon Hair Steamer, and Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil, and Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Treatment Mask (all from Amazon).  </li>
            <li> If I am going to apply any to my hair (not the scalp), I only dab a dime sized amount in my hands, rub my hands together, and then lightly coat my actual hair shafts in sections.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil - 4oz on June 15th, 2013 and have used it daily for 1 month so far.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair, mainly 3c/4a hair texture.</li>
            <li> The Tropic Isle Red Pimento is the only oil I&#x27;m comfortable applying to my scalp.</li>
            <li> This oil has been decent so far.</li>
            <li> My hair is moisturized and very soft.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very soft and assist with breakage and mositure as well.  </li>
            <li> i use it in my hot oil treaments weekly, and it makes my hair super soft and gives my scalp a slight tingle..</li>
            <li> Right now my hair ranges to 9&#x27;-9 1/2&#x27; all over my head, but I will do official checks to have a clear starting</li>
            <li> it as a hot oil treatment in addition to using it as a daily regime.</li>
            <li> I use it as a way to combat dandruff and dryness in my scalp, and as a hot oil treatment prior to cleansing my hair.</li>
            <li> So, it can be a great product, a good product, or a terrible product depending on your individual hair type.</li>
            <li> It only itched the first 3 times I used it, now my scalp doesnt itch anymore.</li>
            <li> I used it only once and combined it with more coconut oil (it contains coconut oil and other ingredients).</li>
            <li> I started using this combination after using only the Pet Coat Rebuilder for the first week.</li>
            <li> and I am always looking for natural products to get to the root and help make my hair voluminous!</li>
            <li> it started make my hair comes out more  than usual.</li>
            <li> also still use it as a hot oil treatment whenever i do deep condition my hair</li>
            <li> It is bearable and upon first use I definitely &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; an affect on my scalp but now seems as if my scalp is already use to</li>
            <li> Love this product, I not sure about hair growth</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that show its potential from the first use.</li>
            <li> This was a little too strong for my roots.</li>
            <li> I had to open the product and clean it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The oil is light weight and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> It said that for natural hair use daily or often but with relaxed hair that is stressed from chemicals to apply it as a hot oil treatment only and to leave the hot oil in your hair covered for 15-20 min, so I did just that.</li>
            <li> , these products are necessary if your on that natural hair high like most of us black women.</li>
            <li> We have not noticed any new hair growth but it is early yet.  </li>
            <li> I have been natural now for about 2 months and have an inch of new growth.  </li>
            <li> My mom and sister also made a comment about my hair growing long right around the time I started to notice it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it helped growth, but it was a nice product that made my hair feel terrific.  </li>
            <li> I read plenty of solid, positive reviews of this product</li>
            <li> When my hair dried, I was amazed how soft, manageable and full they looked!</li>
            <li> White male with semi long hair, was looking to find something that would thicken it without giving any more volume.</li>
            <li> I Squeeze a quarter size amount in the palm of my hand 2x and massage the Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil - 4oz throughout my hair and then comb my hair with a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine to me, plus it disappears after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Although I have heard of castor oil, I wasn&#x27;t familiar with Jamaican black castor oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommendation: Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Masque, a hot oil treatment (Emu Oil makes my hair feel really soft) and a hair steamer!  </li>
            <li> the smell isnt bad it actually kind of smell like a light lavender oil.</li>
            <li> But after 2 days I decided to use it on my whole head only because of how soft it made my kinky hair feel.  </li>
            <li> Now, as far as a hair growth stimulant.</li>
            <li> a natural</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is attributing to hair growth or not, but I have natural (un-relaxed) hair</li>
            <li> so I have to try to get it soft again</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to read the label, though.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product so its a bit early to tell whether it works on not.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft now too.</li>
            <li> This product make my 4c hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> ... MUST SAY ITS A STAPLE SO FAR..</li>
            <li> HOW SOFT IT FEEL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer putting perms or chemicals in my hair, so I have gone natural.</li>
            <li> So even if it doesn&#x27;t completely stop it, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I will wait and see how it works on my hair so far nothing yet.</li>
            <li> Do not waste money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like simple.</li>
            <li> Too early to see if there is any re-growth.</li>
            <li> After my hair dries, it is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it about three times a week directly on my scalp.</li>
            <li> but anything that is all natural and promotes hair growth with no harmful side effects I will give a try</li>
            <li> have just recently started using it very often, it&#x27;s probably the closest thing to a cure for baldness out there, although I also throw propecia, rogaine, b, e, d vitamins, biotin, niacin to fight my hair loss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll definitely notice a real difference.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my itchy scalp and makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described, but did not notice any real improvement in my hair even though I used the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> It also make my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I dont have any breakage and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> but it is making my hair feel so soft and luxurious</li>
            <li> My hair  is so soft but is was thinning out</li>
            <li> so I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li> hahaha, i never read the direction of how it is to be applied, i just apply it in my hair and leave it in as a regular oil.</li>
            <li> just in 3 months of going natural</li>
            <li> So one day I took my professional clippers and shaved my head without a guard to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I did experience some breakge when I was transitioning to natural and was advised by my hair care specialist not to use the product until after I went completely natural.</li>
            <li> volume to hair,definitely not,maybe thickens instead of adding volume unless you are natural and have hair that loves grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to love this product but the smell sucks.</li>
            <li> I used this for three weeks straight on my fading edges and then stopped using it daily.</li>
            <li> I have a fuller, thicker head of hair than I&#x27;ve had since I was 25 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to use it another time to see how it functions on natural hair.</li>
            <li> I didnt really use it because I was experiences with something at the same time</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not instantaneous) but working, I use on my 5 &amp; 10 yr old girls &amp; hubby notices the difference  as well</li>
            <li> Once I rinse the oil out, my hair is so soft and tangles literally fall out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still to early to see a difference.</li>
            <li> It does makes you hair really soft after washing it out.</li>
            <li> and I like it because it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> The smell is undesirable but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> Hmmm I used this directly on my thin/balding areas as a man and in 2 days after headaches all the baby hairs in that area had fallen out.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s an old bald joke)</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this oil and received it in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> It works far as keeping dandruff build up.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this product my scalp feels alive.</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite product because it can be use daily on the hair and it does not leave a heavy build up.</li>
            <li> this product slowly but surely works.</li>
            <li> My hair is already thick and I am relaxed but are using this product for more growth along the way as I am stretching  relaxers for about 3 months and soon may be 4 months.</li>
            <li> My hairline use to look bald and slick but my loctician was able to put new locs there only a couple of days ago.</li>
            <li> I got this product last month, and within the 1st week I noticed tiny little hairs standing up on the top of my head, it was new growth!</li>
            <li> My scalp used to be dry &amp; itchy but that stopped after my first use.  </li>
            <li> The Jamaican Black Castor Oil, The Tropic Isle Living strong roots red pimento hair growth oild, and the castor oil hair food.</li>
            <li> if it really worked wonders on someone please tell me how long it takes to really see the the difference otherwise am really starting to think it wont work.</li>
            <li> With the second bottle I haven&#x27;t been so consistent with using it and putting on my scalp so naturally the problems are back</li>
            <li> I also own an 8oz Jamaican Black Castor Oil that I use to seal my wet hair only after my weekly wash and condition.</li>
            <li> I apply this oil to my scalp after installing mini twist my roots and hair was soft for like 5 days this oil does moisturize, and then the new growth starting coming .</li>
            <li> maybe i should give it more time but so far, i have been using it for maybe a little over a month and the difference is almost minimal.</li>
            <li> WOW, all these products work very well for dry damaged hair, if you hair is thirsty this oil is one of the products to buy and it smells ooooooh</li>
            <li> When I see that my bottle is half empty I promptly order two more.</li>
            <li> I have used it about 4 times (once a week is recommended) and the bottle is pretty much empty.  </li>
            <li> normal routine included washing with both the Phytospecific and the Aveda shampoo&#x27;s mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> The smell takes a little getting use to but fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good, it probably requires a constant usage to give the promised results, which i didn&#x27;t do because of the bad smell on my head.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am super excited about any product with that type of results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife and we can actually can see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> And I only notice this \\&quot;itching\\&quot; where I see new hair growing.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t get any flaking or itching in the areas of my head that did not have new growth) or if the the red pimento caused an allergic-type reaction when applied to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am using the Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil mixed with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil as a scalp treatment 2x a week.</li>
            <li> In particular, the high frequency generator I bought for $20 has produced an absolute miracle in only a few times of using it.</li>
            <li> so that costs little fortunately because for me it was a waste of money, the smell is very strong to let it stand one day to another, is very fatty</li>
            <li> I only used this 3 times and my hair completely stopped falling!</li>
            <li> I didnt however experience anything i would consider a major growth or length change</li>
            <li> When I had it relaxed, I noticed such fullness on my hairline that I was completely amazed!</li>
            <li> I used it on my scalp every other day and used as a hot oil treatment every two weeks.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry and very corse hair</li>
            <li> Apparently this stuff causes major shedding and hence my problem.</li>
            <li> This product is a little thin (runny) for my taste, but effective nonetheless!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed additional positive results from this product including thicker, softer strands that are well moisturized (even my usually dry, coarse hair).  </li>
            <li> You may notice some shedding if you rub it into your hair the first couple times, that is just weak hair follicles being tossed out by new hair follicles that are much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have not used this item long enough to see any real results.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had product long enough to give it a 5, but I do like it and really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to several people that I know who have gone Natural and have damaged and breakage around the edges and Temple of their hair.</li>
            <li> I will repurchase the product and try it on my  natural hair, It might work differently</li>
            <li> I will try Biotin next, and I will create my hair growth oil mixture Jojoba oil,castro oil, sulfur, and mega-tek, so far on my list.</li>
            <li> but I have not really used it much</li>
            <li> but after deep conditioning and conditioning my hair came back to normal.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin on top of my scalp and looking&lt;</li>
            <li> It is definitely not cheap but worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any way to determine, but, all in all, it&#x27;s not a bad product and why not give it a try?</li>
            <li> You can feel it in your scalp after a couple minutes and you can see the results within the first couple days of how your hair feels and less then 2 weeks to see some growth and shine.  </li>
            <li> YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT, IT CAN BE ADDED TO ANY SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER, CAN ALSO BE USED AS A HOT OIL TREATMENT !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young and have really thick hair, but in the last few years, my hair has been falling out much more than normal.</li>
            <li> The problem for me is that the bottle is super small</li>
            <li> However, I am super lazy and never remember to use it for scalp treatments like I</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people swear by it, so it&#x27;s worth trying, especially since it&#x27;s such a cheap price, but it didn&#x27;t slow down hair loss, help my hair to grow in, or make my hair grow longer.</li>
            <li> What I mean is it just doesn&#x27;t spread as easy, and I mixed with olive oil</li>
            <li> Other than that I really did like it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had that much relief from any other products like I have from this hair growth oil.</li>
            <li> the next time about a month later after the thinning hairs had grown back in some I used it before the shampoo and put the plastic cap on for 20 minutes and washed as normal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 34 year old white male.</li>
            <li> I use this product Red Pimento on my hair and it never work for me,i use this for about one year and got no reSults for my hair,so i went back to my old products,so i rate this product</li>
            <li> At first I used this oil at my edges because they&#x27;re thinning a little.  </li>
            <li> It tingled a little but was not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> , so hope that will help with further new growth and long term</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle and within less than a month I had an inch of hair back.</li>
            <li> At first I was afraid the pimento oil might be a bit strong for my scalp and make it burn.</li>
            <li> Feels good but the smell is pretty bad!</li>
            <li> He was really upset as he is only 36, the doctors said to expect it due to the stress and trauma his body went through...</li>
            <li> I suggest running the bottle under hot water for a few minutes before applying.</li>
            <li> and it was pretty heavy.</li>
            <li> It will take a serious shampoo and dry..and the next day shampoo to free yourself)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a different type of smell its hard to describe perhaps sweet or fruity type of smell.</li>
            <li> Well like everyone I bought this prduct along with the oil, how ever the first product which was the Jamaican Black caster oil, was fine, however the strongroot my hair started falling out an got very thin, an i had a pretty good grade of hair Thick but not super thick.</li>
            <li> I am natural and HAD a problem with my scalp being dry.</li>
            <li> black castroil oil didnt do much for me..</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, I saw a difference from the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired Strong Roots for two txt now.</li>
            <li> The things I didn&#x27;t like about this oil is that it smells funky, and it&#x27;s very runny, if you put a little too much it runs down your face.</li>
            <li> I also noticed some new growth (not a whole lot, but definitely noticeable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so much about Red Pimento and Black Castor Oil ,I had to give it a go to see what all the talk was about.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> I purchased in hopes of using it to help my fine, thin Caucasian wavy hair grow a bit healthier.</li>
            <li> have also been taking much more care of my hair of late such as using a cooler temperature to wash the hair, not rubbing it roughly with a towel to dry ( I dab it and then leave it in a towel for some time)</li>
            <li> Does live up to the hype or all the gloating from other customers.</li>
            <li> It does have an odd smell which is not too bad, but it is good for me!</li>
            <li> This is a good hair product, however I get bad breakouts on my hairline and forehead.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t good or bad.</li>
            <li> This happens to be a good one out of a normally bad bunch.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product and nothing good either.</li>
            <li> While I like it for occasional use, it is generally too heavy for my fine strand, thick volume 2a/b curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white 36 year old with hair loss due to a hormonal imbalance.</li>
            <li> After using this periodically from time to time without a heating cap, I did notice that it does have an effect on regrowing hair, especially around the hairline, and I could see new follicles coming in, where previously they were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I basically use this product every other day, applying it directly to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Hair that is long gone likely won&#x27;t come back, but if you&#x27;re just starting to lose your hair, get this</li>
            <li> I did notice a little bit of new growth after about 2 months of using this product religiously.</li>
            <li> and when I use a comb, I comb very gently and slowly from the ends up.</li>
            <li> Castor Oil to thin out the Black castor Oil to put on my hair rather than my scalp which keeps my hair healthy and promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use any other the other Red Pimento hair oils marketed because we are highly suspicious of their ingredients.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t use any other the other Red Pimento hair oils marketed because we are highly suspicious of their ingredients.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works.  </li>
            <li> 4 oz goes a long way when using just for your edges it should last me 6 mo if not longer.</li>
            <li> however I will get my hair flat ironed at the end on feb.</li>
            <li> I massage it into my scalp and leave it on for as long as possible</li>
            <li> I had long frizzy and almost damaged hair, after I had my son I was constantly losing my hair!</li>
            <li> If I leave it in too long, it actually causes my scalp to itch (guessing that is the pimento in it).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my eye lashes which have gone from stubby to long and curly in the last month.</li>
            <li> It is greasy so when you are going to lay down, use an old pillow case.</li>
            <li> It weighed down my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little early to see all the results that have been reported.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> The fact is there is no quick fix, although I am on prednisone right now, but there is no easy way to get rid of the redness and swollenness from my scalp and my face .&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> I must say this is the only product that has worked for my dry, itchy, damaged scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not like it smell like garbage, but the spice and weird smell is too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would advise using only a little for the first few nights, until you get used to the smell.</li>
            <li> I for a long time have been dealing with extremely dry coarse hair!</li>
            <li> always when working towards hair growth it take work in the inside (biotin vitamins) and the outside hair growth aids such as this oil and other hair growing products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell by any means, it&#x27;s just very, very strong.</li>
            <li> need Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo gentle cleans after using Black Castor oil massage on hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> As always a little goes a long way as it can weigh your hair down if you use too much.</li>
            <li> It seems that this is something that you must use long term to see those types of results.</li>
            <li> Thank God it got noticed but not fast enough my hair was bra strap length an</li>
            <li> It also is not as heavy or greasy as the Wild Growth Hair Oils a lot of women rave about.</li>
            <li> I used this product daily when my hair is wet...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product enough to use it continuously by itself, but I have mixed it in my deep conditioning mask, and hair milk, because I don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m trying to experiment with long hair styles.</li>
            <li> am telling you ladies who are natural this stuff works and it does not make your hair heavy.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re a man, dont apply this as a oil and leave in for long periods or it will bald you.  </li>
            <li> But this product is worth a try if you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> prior to using this oil my hair was rough, dry &amp; wouldn&#x27;t hold any moisture.  </li>
            <li> I use red pimento hair growth oil twice a week on my edges, along with Jamaican black castor oil and my edges are starting to fill in.</li>
            <li> Back story: I&#x27;m &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;, rather your typical American mutt.</li>
            <li> It hast been long enough for me yet, not consistently using it yet.</li>
            <li> oil is not real heavy on the hair as you only need a small amout.  </li>
            <li> , so i went from 2x daily to every other day once a day.</li>
            <li> I also believe that it will help thicken up the other hairs that have made their way back to my head.</li>
            <li> Used as part of a receipe for short natural hair that has been hard to grow.</li>
            <li> or there&#x27;s a very strange coincidence going on.</li>
            <li> It is making the scalp with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My stylist suggested that I try the Aveda Dry Remedy</li>
            <li> Then I apply the Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Treatment Masque and sit under the Hair Steamer for another 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I saw no real results product greasy as expected with oil, and  no lasting mositure.</li>
            <li> It made me wonder if there is a lot of hype surrounding it to bring revenue to a country with limited resources?</li>
            <li> I think I will just stick with the brand&#x27;s Castor Oil, the extra dark formulation.  </li>
            <li> Then I thoroughly rinsed and washed my hair with an all natural shampoo that I usually use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product actually grows hair because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it at night after my Just Natural Organinc leave in conditioner and the oil helps seal in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and but mean while keep your hair moisturized.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT TO LOOSE</li>
            <li> these are the two main ingredients behind the red pimento.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft, shiny and manageable and those are results that very few products give my hair.</li>
            <li> To use on my hair, I just open the applicator sprout slightly, about halfway rather than all the way.</li>
            <li> The size is 4 ounces and it typically lasts me about 4-6 months with regular use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times in the last week an a half and already see 85% improvement in my hair fallout.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product along with actual black castor oil, and a detangling spray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that there is way less hair in the drain after I shower - it is definitely helping with hair fallout.</li>
            <li> The mixture of the red pimento with the Jamaican Black Castor oil, coconut oil and wheat germ rejuvenat the scalp.  </li>
            <li> However you can make this product yourself for the overall price, Just get some black castor oil and add the pepper</li>
            <li> To style my hair, I blow-dried and applied a dime-size of Morrocan Oil and half of a dime-size of Emu Oil to my entire head</li>
            <li> This product contains: Jamaican red pimento oil, Jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil, and wheat germ.</li>
            <li> I put it on about a half hour before I shampoo and massage it into my scalp extra well.</li>
            <li> my hair is usually very dry</li>
            <li> The weather in Ga  has been very dry this summer</li>
            <li> Unlike the other &amp;#34;Doctor&amp;#34; brand, this doesn&#x27;t burn or cause any strange tingling sensations.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it did no more than my normal black castor oil</li>
            <li> I have braids in my hair and the red pimento tingles a little but soothes the scalp.</li>
            <li> THEN IN THE SAME WEEK I TAKE A LITTLE AND MASSAGE MY SCALP WITH IT</li>
            <li> A little warning that the red pimento gives this oil a bit of a spicy fragrance</li>
            <li> It only takes a little to prep my scalp.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like red pepper, so</li>
            <li> I have not really noeticed any hair growth buet I can say that after the second use my hair did stop shedding and it has gotten a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a hairsylist and what I will say is that healthy hair starts from the inside but putting moisture and vitamins on your roots isn&#x27;t a bad idea.  </li>
            <li> So between the overwhelming smell (which isn&#x27;t bad but it lasts for hours) and the price, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.  </li>
            <li> i would recommend for anyone who is trying to go natural to buy a steamer or at least get your hair steamed at a saloon once in a while, it will help with your hair growth.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have been using this for the last few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have 4b hair type and my hair never really shines.</li>
            <li> SO IF YOUR CURIOUS BOUT BUYING IT</li>
            <li> now on, I would never put anything on my face and on my scalp without to conduct a careful skin test first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance REALLY is NOT bothersome at all.</li>
            <li> I Only used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> After a while of using it, I saw absolutely no growth or no difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is working on the growth side of things (have only been using a few weeks)</li>
            <li> I do not really like this product cause</li>
            <li> It will be a staple of mine for my edges as they are growing faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I tired this product and for some reason it made the spots where I applied it to turn into very tight tiny frizzy curls, but I have straight hair.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need alot, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> but after using this several times I noticed my hair isnt as dry and dull as it used to be.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a serious amount of new growth, it was sparse and not very strong, so I can&#x27;t tell you if it was from the oil or the vitamins.</li>
            <li> As to how it makes my hair feel i&#x27;m not sure as yet as i currently have in braids.</li>
            <li> and I use the oil to moisturize my scalp every other day.</li>
            <li> It re grew parts of my hairline where it was bald due to a micro braid being yanked out, and it also contributed to some of my hair growth.</li>
            <li> and i feel that its helping to grow my edges with my other hair treatment.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I rub it on my edges and crown areas because thats where my thinning is every other night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased JBCO oil in the past and decided to give the Red Pimento oil a chance.  </li>
            <li> Extremely oily</li>
            <li> Works well with other hair growth products</li>
            <li> (check other reviews) but it definetely helps my hair.</li>
            <li> I order other items, but I never used it.  </li>
            <li> I am still using other items</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done anything for hair growth, but I will continue to use it for its other properties.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product(and other castor oils) and decided I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I used it about every other day to every 3 days along with my other oil mix for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have tried other things a dermatologist prescribed for me but those didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> (I feel like swinging my hair around like on the TV ads, but alas, it is not long enough yet!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used other Tropic Isle products with no problems.  </li>
            <li> IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER PRODUCTS THAT CAN HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM PLEASE HELP.</li>
            <li> With all the other Tropic Isle products I&#x27;m using, I could have done without this one or done without something else for this one.</li>
            <li> but i am going to try other products from Jamaican oil company.</li>
            <li> Before using this oil I used other oils as well and other hair growing products.</li>
            <li> I use the product every other day just on my hairline.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re reading this, please check out my other reviews to learn about things that have worked miracles for me.</li>
            <li> hope some of my other reviews can guide you to things that have worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Check my other reviews.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the hair growth potential of this product yet, as I do not use it faithfully twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about getting it at first coz</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for the past 2 months</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not too bad, but strong.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle  few years ago (this oil didn&#x27;t go rancid) but only started using the oil few months ago.</li>
            <li> When I was younger it was a lot thicker, but over the years and lots of straightening its now starting to thin.</li>
            <li> It only takes a dot on the length of my hair to tame it and condition it!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not sure what my hair type is as i&#x27;m mixed with black and indian.</li>
            <li> and my hair feels so soft to the tough.</li>
            <li> The Red Pimento Oil is thick though and a little goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> I used it sometimes daily and at least three times a week on my daughter and</li>
            <li> I opened one and the product was dark in color and smelled like used motor oil.</li>
            <li> As far as thickness goes, I&#x27;m not sure because my hair is already thick.</li>
            <li> Good , but smells TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I believe I am protein sensitive and the oil just made it worse</li>
            <li> &amp; I apply it to my edges at least 3 times a week mixed with Jamaican black castor/argon oil &amp; my hair</li>
            <li> This way, the oil also doesn&#x27;t weigh down my 3a/3b bra-strap length hair.</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvement, plus it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to use, and finishes quickly</li>
            <li> It does seem to harden in colder temperatures due to the fact that it has coconut oil in it, but i just let the bottle sit in some warm/hot water for a few seconds and then applied to my scalp.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The smell is less pungent, and the oil is less thicker than the JBCO.  </li>
            <li> This product consists of Jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil, allspice oil and wheat germ oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try it and because it has black castor oil in it..</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because the black castor oil worked so well</li>
            <li> and this product contains black castor oil.</li>
            <li> And also my hair is healthier than previous....</li>
            <li> the Jamaican Black Castor Oil and the itching stops.</li>
            <li> BUT I WANTED A CHANGE)MY HAIR IS ALMOST A JET BLACK</li>
            <li> edges(they call it cow licked)LOL!</li>
            <li> (increase in length, although this also works to thicken as well) and found that Jamaican black castor oil was suggested.  </li>
            <li> My hair also seems to be shedding less.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would give this product a try since I like their black castor oil.</li>
            <li> Jamaican black castor oil on my edges.</li>
            <li> Hair feels healtier with less breakage.</li>
            <li> There is less hair in the trashcan now.  </li>
            <li> ive been using it on my slightly receding hairline and...</li>
            <li> Tropic Isle Jamacain Black Cast.</li>
            <li> I must say it have a slight smell to it</li>
            <li> I also mix this product with Jamaican black castor oil, tea tree oil and argon oil.</li>
            <li> Re-grew my edges in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> We tried this products along with black castor oil and it have did wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> I put this oil on my 3c/4a hair when it&#x27;s slightly damp and will cover my hair with a shower cap.</li>
            <li> It arrive half of bottle</li>
            <li> But when I do use it my scalp feels less itchy and it does not cause any product build up.</li>
            <li> less hair in tub after shampooing and a relaxed scalp.</li>
            <li> I just hated the very strong smell.</li>
            <li> My hair grows on average 1/2 inch a month or a little over depending on protective styles.</li>
            <li> But this product gave my scalp a little bust and promoted my hair to grow longer than average growth per month.  </li>
            <li> , that was not true.</li>
            <li> Over the past few years I noticed my blonde hair was thinning excessively.</li>
            <li> morning my hair was a greasy mess</li>
            <li> I was a mess</li>
            <li> At one point I had no edges from having a style in too tight.</li>
            <li> I read the \\&quot;rave reviews\\&quot; about this product and how it miraculously grew a few reviewers hair so extremely long and thick</li>
            <li> My hair breakage has been little to none when I comb or brush my hair since using these combined products.</li>
            <li> I use it around my edges but am grateful that my edges HAVE gotten a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> so maybe I just need to use it a little longer to see results.</li>
            <li> I like the product,a little dab is all u need.</li>
            <li> Makes your scalp itch a little</li>
            <li> but i do see it just a little bit.</li>
            <li> To give a little background...</li>
            <li> I put a lot of it into my hair and it felt a little tingly and didn&#x27;t make my hair that greasy.</li>
            <li> Just a little on the scalp.</li>
            <li> If you are woman losing her hair, ANY little thing that can bring hope is a blessing.</li>
            <li> a little tingling comes along with</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker and a little stronger</li>
            <li> It also came on time but the bottle was bent a little at the bottom.</li>
            <li> when combing hair, little to no breakage is in comb.</li>
            <li> I DO SOME LITTLE HAIR GROWTH</li>
            <li> It strengthened my hair a little bit, but if you&#x27;re like me and you want something that will fix a receding hairline, this might not be your answer.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t tolerate my hair smelling like an auto mechanic&#x27;s shop and being matted down to my hair with oil!)</li>
            <li> This really helped to grow my hair back in after I stupidly caused it to fall out</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer</li>
            <li> I put it on a few hours before showering and my hair stopped falling.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Its been a few days over a month.</li>
            <li> Just a few days into using this oil &amp; my hair is noticeably softer &amp; feels stronger.  </li>
            <li> I would walk out of the shower with handfuls of hair left behind.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and been using different products all my life to prevent fall out and encourage growth.</li>
            <li> I had my hair micro twisted in Atlanta by Natural Hair By Rinah(BEAAAUTIFUL!no extensions added).</li>
            <li> This was an abject waste of money.</li>
            <li> It makes it feel like the dead</li>
            <li> I have been using this product weekly, I apply it all over my scalp and message in a few hours before shampooing.</li>
            <li> Too Heavy, not for me.</li>
            <li> My hair had a heavy feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I like the product because it is used as a treatment for a few minutes, then wash out, but you can still feel the calming and cooling sensation awhile afterward the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Not to heavy.  </li>
            <li> and it curdles after a few months.</li>
            <li> I will update results in a few months.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve listed below a few things for you to do and try&lt;br /&gt;1.)</li>
            <li> ,I have a few gray strands and didn&#x27;t buy it for this purpose</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS VERY SHORT AND THIN.</li>
            <li> especially for my thin, wavy hair</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re missing edges, give it a month</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR A FEW WEEKS</li>
            <li> After a few days, it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing I noticed which I found a bit strange was that regular JBCO made my hair itch like crazy after a few days of use, but since using the Pimento Oil, my scalp has not itched one bit</li>
            <li> This stuff like all castor oil is very thick but this stuff isn&#x27;t as thick as the regular black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I hardly use this oil, the few times I used it, it dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> I have just made an order of raw B vitamins and Biotin on Amazon</li>
            <li> I am caucasian and have thin dry hair.</li>
            <li> USE A LITTLE BEFORE BLEACHING , COLORING OR PERMING YOUR HAIR !</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for my VERY dry, very slow growing hair.  </li>
            <li> Benefits out weigh the smell and the smell isn&#x27;t bad really it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It made so much of my hair shed that it matted badly and there were parts I couldn&#x27;t even comb.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> and now my edges are past my shoulders (again.)</li>
            <li> and now my edges are past my shoulders (again.)</li>
            <li> (it is an oil) and style as usual.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is speeding up anything.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I usually use it when I have braids</li>
            <li> and I have small acne like bumps on my scalp, which I have never had before.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to go overboard with it.</li>
            <li> will , this product is what I used when I was having some problems with my hair during this past summer of 2014.</li>
            <li> There was no magic hair growth what are people talking about?</li>
            <li> Still not sure whether I like it or not.</li>
            <li> edges (not saying it&#x27;s excessive-</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s growing my hair or not</li>
            <li> My hair has some length to it already so I am not sure if your hair will grow from its use.  </li>
            <li> Sorry it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> so I plan to attempt a purchase from one of the contractors I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> ,SOME PEOPLE SAID CASTOR OIL ,AND IT&#x27;S VERY VERY HEAVY STICKY AND SOME SAID THAT</li>
            <li> This product works but is very heavy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had almost a half inch of hair growth!!</li>
            <li> I have a few spots that seem to be a little on the thin side, so</li>
            <li> if I was you I will buy this product ASAP if you want strong thick hair !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and it was hard</li>
            <li> It took 3 hours to get through it plus it felt hard.</li>
            <li> The problem for me is that the product should be an oil but is jelled up and hard and no instructions came with it.</li>
            <li> Well after applying, I noticed itching in my problem area and believe it or not there were little hairs sprouting up in this thin area.</li>
            <li> I started using this in late spring</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate just yet because I just recieved it and it should take at least 6 months to a year before I notice any results</li>
            <li> Stuff feels icky and greasy, and I don&#x27;t think it even helped me for hair growth.</li>
            <li> but I have not seen negative results either.</li>
            <li> I actually scissored my way through my hair cutting at least 4 or 5 inches.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issues I had were that It can be sticky and it geta waxy when it&#x27;s cold.</li>
            <li> Products like rogaine never come through but this oil seems to be doing the trick, at least in my results.</li>
            <li> helping slowly............</li>
            <li> It is a slow process.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick consistency</li>
            <li> otherwise the liquid will slowly drip.</li>
            <li> SLOWLY</li>
            <li> when i received this product i noticed a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> AND HOW THICK ITS GETTING...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting, but it is pepper, and I fried my scalp and it shed with thick pieces of dandruff skin for a week or two.</li>
            <li> This was so thick that I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the container.  </li>
            <li> In two weeks the garage is a non factor and my hair is filling in thick.</li>
            <li> i dont like the smell and it too thick for my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick waist length hair.</li>
            <li> your looking to hair bra stap length hair and your hair grows slow and you ALREADY KNOW THIS</li>
            <li> It will make your hair thick so there may be &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; growth results or &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; results.</li>
            <li> I appreciate it when it cools down and gets thick!!</li>
            <li> I mean all the way out</li>
            <li> I MEAN</li>
            <li> Hydrates hair beautifully but the smell is annoying and nasty.</li>
            <li> It would probably be awful for someone with fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> SO LAST YEAR I DECIDED TO GET HIGHLIGHTS(VERY BAD IDEA</li>
            <li> but im throwing the bottle away my hair is just touches my shoulder now, not a good feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Wash your hands afterwards, so when you rub your eyes, it won&#x27;t be irritating.</li>
            <li> I do see thickness where it was thin</li>
            <li> Chose this to help fortify my hair, but the smell is outrageous and it leaves a very oily texture to the hair.</li>
            <li> , my hair is thin</li>
            <li> and my hair looks thicker in those thin places</li>
            <li> Other than making my hair smell bad</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, didn&#x27;t work for me, after reading other comments, I looked for tingling never happen</li>
            <li> Sadly, I developed a horrible, ugliest skin rashes on my scalp to my face and all over my body.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend was in a very bad motorcycle accident and his hair was falling out by the handful weeks later.</li>
            <li> I washighly skeptical any beard growth products.</li>
            <li> item was said to help with hair growth with alopicia, but unfortunately it didnt help me in that area..</li>
            <li> But I only gave it 4 stars because it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> It broke my heart to see her so sad.  </li>
            <li> so I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Dont take it to the plane, after 9 hrs flight it became dense, so unfortunately I cannot use it anymore</li>
            <li> (sorry fellas</li>
            <li> Lame joke, I know,</li>
            <li> they are very thin.</li>
            <li> This product sucks!!!</li>
            <li> Not too crazy of the smell, however, would buy again.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my hair shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> But I like the cold feeling I experience when I apply this product to my hair.</li>
            <li> so whenever I try growing it, I end up cutting it.</li>
            <li> Stinks.</li>
            <li> It just stinks.</li>
            <li> say, if you are desperate like I was to stop your hair from falling out-</li>
            <li> Made my hair shed like crazy</li>
            <li> and my was falling out like crazy.  </li>

            <li> If you get this product applied this oil to the base of the hair roots and massage though out the hair line.</li>
            <li> It also can get a bit annoying when squeezing the bottle and trying to get the oil to come out.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> helping slowly............</li>
            <li> worked nice wish they had bigger bottle</li>
            <li> I been wearing braids and weaves all my life and in recent years my edges fell out I mean all the way out but I been growing them back for about a year I have used everything baby don&#x27;t be bald,dr miracle,vitamin e oil,olive oil never has anything moisturize my edges like this stayed hydrated over 24 hours I love love love it .....</li>
            <li> i will give this proudct a 10 and feel it will be helpful in the care of my hair treamet.</li>
            <li> this substance gave me allergies and  blisters in my body DO NOT BUY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff... It has a therapeutic smell and just a dab will do. I have applied this to my psoriasis patch within my scalp, talk about instant relief! Although I just started using this product, I can definitely tell it is stimulating my roots. African American/relaxed hair..</li>
            <li> This oil is much, much better than the plan JBCO.  The smell is less pungent, and the oil is less thicker than the JBCO.  It smooths nicely on the hair, its not clingy like.  For some reason the JBCO is clingy.  What I mean is it just doesn&#x27;t spread as easy, and I mixed with olive oil and I still did not like it.  Well, at least I enjoyed and fell in love with the Red Pimento Oil.  And I would buy it again, and again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to wash out. I tried it because I&#x27;d been using Bhringaraj oil with great success. This stuff has an odor that, while it&#x27;s not really bad can seem cloying after a while. I have caucasian hair and it seemed to be an overly heavy oil (as opposed to the bhringaraj which is lighter and has a better fragrance, in my opinion) I didn&#x27;t get any of the \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; comments heard by others. Now, as far as a hair growth stimulant. I really can&#x27;t say. I started using this in late spring and yes, my hair actually is having a growth spurt right now. Is it seasonal, the time of year for such things? Or, is it this forumula? I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any way to determine, but, all in all, it&#x27;s not a bad product and why not give it a try? UPDATED - after using this product off and on (the smell, the difficulty in getting it out of my hair is a deterrent, really) this stuff WORKS - it actually W-O-R-K-S - or there&#x27;s a very strange coincidence going on. When I use this, my hair goes into a growth spurt that lasts a month or so. Worth trying. Definitely. (but have the time and endurance to get through getting it out of your hair. It will take a serious shampoo and dry..and the next day shampoo to free yourself)</li>
            <li> i like it, waiting to see if it works. hope it does, because my hair is falling out. thank you.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and felt really good on my scalp. I think it helped to condition my scalp and hair and I will definitely buy more. It shipped to me fast and in great condition also.</li>
            <li> I am chosing 5 stars because this product is working.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and my hair has thinned so much because of food intolerances etc.  I am caucasian and have thin dry hair. This was my last resort before having to spend a fortune on the big companies for hair replacement.  I have only been using it about a month and can see a difference.  My hairdresser looked at my scalp at the beginning and then again after several weeks and confirmed that my folicles are showing activity.  Example:  She could only see few folicles that were very spaced and areas where she saw no folicle in beginning and now she said she sees new growth with a &amp;#34;pepper&amp;#34; effect meaning many folicles are opening and came to surface which means new hair is coming.  I also really like the smell of the product that resembles a tropical cinnamon type of scent.  I use the product 2 times a week with shower cap under heated cap for about 30 minutes each time.  There is nothing I dislike about the product.  I recommend this to anyone with thinning hair but you have to keep using it regularly.  A little goes a long way and great price on Amazon.  I will add another update in several weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this product only once and was pleasantly supprised  that it did what is said.  Will buy it again when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> I like this product!!!  I have braids in my hair and the red pimento tingles a little but soothes the scalp.</li>
            <li> I first learned about the Tropic Isle JBC products when i say my co-worker using them and deciced that i would try them after hearing that they worked for her  and she like the way the JBC hair food made her hair feel and look. After going through all the products i decided to try the Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth oil especially with the reviews that it got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a natural and i&#x27;m not sure what my hair type is as i&#x27;m mixed with black and indian. i have used the product 3 times since i have received it and i have to say i like the way it feels on my scalp. i also like the fact that it absorbs well into my hair and scalp and it&#x27;s not oily or greasy like most hair oil products. The smell is a bit strong as you do smell the red pimento but i don&#x27;t have a problem with that as it reminds me of mint and spice mixed together. As to how it makes my hair feel i&#x27;m not sure as yet as i currently have in braids. i plan to take my braids out soon and continue using the product as both a hot oil treatment and on my scalp every 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i start to do this i will take note of how my hair looks and feel and also the health of my scalp and i will  come back and update my current review after a month of using the product this way. hope this current review helps.. :-)</li>
            <li> I am sure this product works wonders for some people. In my case, however, it dried hair and scalp, increased damage, and the hair was breaking more.Very  disappointing :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is attributing to hair growth or not, but I have natural (un-relaxed) hair and I used before washing my hair as directed on the packaging and my hair was noticeably softer.</li>
            <li> I read the \\&quot;rave reviews\\&quot; about this product and how it miraculously grew a few reviewers hair so extremely long and thick so I decided to use it on my thinning parts in my hair, so before I ordered it I researched it further on the Internet how to use it safely and effectively on relaxed hair. It said that for natural hair use daily or often but with relaxed hair that is stressed from chemicals to apply it as a hot oil treatment only and to leave the hot oil in your hair covered for 15-20 min, so I did just that. When I washed it out my hair looked like a knot ball and it was hard so I used my regular shampoos and conditioners to soften it and stop the breaking, You see what it did was strip alot of the relaxer out of my hair so I have to try to get it soft again and for it not to break anymore. I tried to use it on my sister thinking since her texture of hair is a lot different than mine it might work well for her but it did not at all. I would not buy this particular line of products again.</li>
            <li> This product comes in a nice bottle that has a twist up tip on it. This makes for easy dispensing and application directly to the roots of the hair and scalp. It smells great, exactly like allspice (which is what Jamaican &#x27;pimento&#x27; is), so it&#x27;s not offensive smelling if you want to use it as a hair grooming oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to read the label, though. This product consists of Jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil, allspice oil and wheat germ oil. Great ingredients. No silicones thank god. No garbage ingredients. Which means anybody could easily make this themselves. That&#x27;s what I intend on doing next time. Making it. As nice as this product is, it would be FAR cheaper to make it than buy it. That&#x27;s probably why the ingredients aren&#x27;t listed in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints with the product, though. Even the bottle is great. It didn&#x27;t leak at all, so it would be great to travel with.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use this yet, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent. I sure hope it&#x27;s effective...especially since it&#x27;s smelly and pricey. After I start using it and see results, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> I have not used this item long enough to see any real results.  The problem for me is that the bottle is super small so it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I have used it about 4 times (once a week is recommended) and the bottle is pretty much empty.  It has kind of a strong smell but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  I actually kind of like it.  I don&#x27;t doubt that this product works, I just wish you got more for what it costs.</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvement, plus it&#x27;s very uncomfortable to use, and finishes quickly</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product use it as a hot oil treatments</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My roots in the front part of my hair have grown and I am so happy, my friend recommended castor oil for my fine thin hair.  I use this about once a week as a hot oil massage.  I heat it in a small pot of hot water and then I rub it into my scalp.  I leave it on overnight and wash it out with shampoo the next morning.  I am a firm believer this product slowly but surely works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to try it and because it has black castor oil in it.. Ok I used it on my scalp and it gives a tingling feeling which I like.. but I don&#x27;t think it did no more than my normal black castor oil.. I will try something once with or with out reading a review about it because I think in order to find out if it will work for you gotta try it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate just yet because I just recieved it and it should take at least 6 months to a year before I notice any results but I will come back and rewrite if necessary.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while back from Sams 24/7.  I also bought the JBCO.  I decided to use this to give my hair growth a boost.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with shedding etc, but wanted to see if it could make my hair grow longer faster.  It seems that this is something that you must use long term to see those types of results. I have about 2 more uses left in my bottle and have been using it maybe about two months.  I use it before shampooing with a plastic cap and then wash it out.  My hair gets some good growth - so I honestly can&#x27;t say whether or not it has helped me to achiever even greater hair growth goals.  I will say that the oil does smells nice and has a really great consistency for pre-pooing.</li>
            <li> I use the strong root pimento oil along with Jamaican black castor oil &amp; I have seen good hair growth results. The pimento oil makes my scalp tingle &amp; it has a mild fragrance. It is a slow process.</li>
            <li> THIS OIL IS VERY STRONG, RICH, THICK YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT, IT CAN BE ADDED TO ANY SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER, CAN ALSO BE USED AS A HOT OIL TREATMENT !&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS ONE OF MY TOP 5 HAIR OILS !  KEEPS HAIR AND SCALP FRESH, CLEAN, SHINE, SOOTHES AND CALMS THE SCALP&lt;br /&gt;LEAVING IT HEALTHY !  USE A LITTLE BEFORE BLEACHING , COLORING OR PERMING YOUR HAIR !</li>
            <li> LOVE THE CONSISTANCY AND IT REALLY WORKS. THANK YOU TROPIC ISLE</li>
            <li> I just started using this product so its a bit early to tell whether it works on not. However, I love the way it makes my scalp feel tingly. I would imagine that it&#x27;s helping the circulation. I&#x27;ll give more details in about a month.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked wonders to my hair, it made my hair thich and stopped my hair from shedding</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and in good condition. I am African American and I use the oil to moisturize my scalp every other day. The oil is light weight and does not weigh down my hair. The smell is fine to me, plus it disappears after a few hours. It has been doing a good job moisturizing my hair since I&#x27;ve been using it. I also own an 8oz Jamaican Black Castor Oil that I use to seal my wet hair only after my weekly wash and condition. My hair breakage has been little to none when I comb or brush my hair since using these combined products. I think it is mostly the castor oil itself that has been helping my hair to grow and be stronger, so instead of two containers, I will just stick with my JBCO to seal and moisturize since I do not mind its thicker consistency and save my money.</li>
            <li> Used two to three times per week for 20min with heat cap and did not see any difference with my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I&#x27;m so excited. A year ago I put so extensions in my hair and during reinstalling and uninstalling, I damaged my hair to a severe bald spot in the back of my head. So embarrassing. I bought my first bottle and within less than a month I had an inch of hair back. Great on sensitive scalps as well and if you use heat on your hair often. My hair is so soft now too. I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I seriously am never disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> OK product a little to strong for my hair problem would reorder</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my brother about a year ago. He continues to use with success in scalp treatment. Asked for more. This time I sent him 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> Third bottle I think that says a lot!!</li>
            <li> just got the merchandise yesterday hope product work as well as what i read about it if work i will be ordering more just give it time to work.</li>
            <li> Well like everyone I bought this prduct along with the oil, how ever the first product which was the Jamaican Black caster oil, was fine, however the strongroot my hair started falling out an got very thin, an i had a pretty good grade of hair Thick but not super thick. Thank God it got noticed but not fast enough my hair was bra strap length an i wanted to get my edges fuller an man i got the opposite effect. I say if you are using it an it works God Bless u but for a new person thinking about trying it Don&#x27;t It wasn&#x27;t cheap but im throwing the bottle away my hair is just touches my shoulder now, not a good feeling at all.</li>
            <li> This is a good hair product, however I get bad breakouts on my hairline and forehead.  I just use it on my ends and the back of my head.  I  love the smell of this.  It is worth a try if you are not prone to breakouts on your skin.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work right away. It took almost a month to see results. It re grew parts of my hairline where it was bald due to a micro braid being yanked out, and it also contributed to some of my hair growth. Must follow directions. I never washed out. Nice tingly sensation. Great Product! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> so that costs little fortunately because for me it was a waste of money, the smell is very strong to let it stand one day to another, is very fatty so I came out is to put more hair. I did not like</li>
            <li> This growth oil keeps your hair clean and more manageable. It aids in hair growth and is great  for routine care. It&#x27;s now a must have for me</li>
            <li> I bought this oil as part of my hair growth journey.  Since March my hair has grown 4 1/2 inches YAY.. The edges get more wear and tear because I wrap my hair at night. I massage this oil into my edges, and my hair is filling in and looks great!  Has a thick consistency and a nice smell.. Wash your hands afterwards, so when you rub your eyes, it won&#x27;t be irritating. Get it if thinner edges is your issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product about three times but it requires you to sit under a dryer for maximum conditioning.  I HATE sitting under the dryer, so I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again.  However, it does seem to have helped improve the growth of my hair roots.</li>
            <li> i just wanna let ppl know that red pimento oil is pretty good! i use it in my hot oil treaments weekly, and it makes my hair super soft and gives my scalp a slight tingle..i like.  i&#x27;ve noticed some growth, but nothing outrageous yet. only thing, the smell is ok, but i think it should be a bigger bottle/more oz for the price.</li>
            <li> After using Red Pimento I saw rapid growth ! I was speechless on how fast my hair grew ! Although it smells funcky, it is all worth it ! the smell didn&#x27;t stop me or my hair from growing ! if I was you I will buy this product ASAP if you want strong thick hair !!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was not for me - I am sure it is my chemical make up - because most of the reviews are great - it simply didn&#x27;t work for me. Everything is not for every one!</li>
            <li> WOW, all these products work very well for dry damaged hair, if you hair is thirsty this oil is one of the products to buy and it smells ooooooh so good!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product burned my scalp. I guess I must be allergic to some of its contents. I will not be using this item again. I trashed it. The smell was horrible as well.</li>
            <li> wow this is a great product i use this twice a week and it has made hair grow on my hair line that i thought would never grow i cant recall when i brought this but its almost finished i will order another one next week. it does work on thinning hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product about 3 times now, and I love the feeling it provides.  I get a tingling sensation during the pre-shampoo process.  Not too crazy of the smell, however, would buy again.  It&#x27;s a thick consistency so you don&#x27;t need alot, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This hair growth oil gave my scalp that tingling sensation it needed in order to wake up my hair follicles. It does have an odd smell which is not too bad, but it is good for me! I love this product and will order lots more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I am a new user to this product, initially when used as directed I experienced a lot of shedding.  I now have figured a way to use for my hair and I&#x27;m very pleased, will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> works well! strengthened my roots and new growth but it has a STRONGGGGGG SMELL!  ;(</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 starts because this product did exactly what it said it would do.&lt;br /&gt;I used it both on hair and skin and it grow hair in both places!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m having to wax my legs quicker than 6 weeks .. lol ..&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;Mix it with your favorite lotion if you decide to use on skin.&lt;br /&gt;Use it as a hot oil treatment in addition to using it as a daily regime.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOD! IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS ON THE TIN!  I USED IT ONCE DURING A DEEP CONDITION AND OH MY GOD. SHEDDING STOPPED LITERALLY OVER NIGHT!! I NEED TO SAVE UP AND BUY A WHOLE BATCH TO BE SHIPPED OVER!  SO IMPRESSED. I WILL BUY AGAIN AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> This product was great! I washighly skeptical any beard growth products. But this one actually works I have been using it for a couple weeks now and I have noticed that my beer is fuller thicker and all around better looking and feeling this product isn&#x27;t a miracle but no product s highly recommend this product for anyone</li>
            <li> Great scalp &amp;#34;grease&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am looking for some oil which is not only functional but with some medicinal and health benefits. This one, along with the others that I have ordered, fits the criteria. Very good to use externally, pleasant and soothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day for over a month.  I do see thickness where it was thin but it really hasn&#x27;t gotten any longer.  I use it around my edges but am grateful that my edges HAVE gotten a little thicker.  I guess I was expecting a better result.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of all things natural, organic, and chemical-free, so I have been using Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Oil since 2008. With that being said, I can honestly say this classic Caribbean staple for hair growth and hair health works! Unlike the other &amp;#34;Doctor&amp;#34; brand, this doesn&#x27;t burn or cause any strange tingling sensations. It also is not as heavy or greasy as the Wild Growth Hair Oils a lot of women rave about. (I tried these two and I couldn&#x27;t tolerate my hair smelling like an auto mechanic&#x27;s shop and being matted down to my hair with oil!) The Red Pimento Oil is thick though and a little goes a long way!!! I use it as a way to combat dandruff and dryness in my scalp, and as a hot oil treatment prior to cleansing my hair. The applicator tip is wonderful since it help regulate how much oil one uses. To use on my hair, I just open the applicator sprout slightly, about halfway rather than all the way. I lightly dab across sections of my scalp and massage with my fingers for nice, light even application. This way, the oil also doesn&#x27;t weigh down my 3a/3b bra-strap length hair. If I am going to apply any to my hair (not the scalp), I only dab a dime sized amount in my hands, rub my hands together, and then lightly coat my actual hair shafts in sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aroma is very pleasant and it has an almost cinnamon-like spice to it. If you have ever smelled Jamaican Allspice in the grocery store, then this oil smells similar to that but more light. Recently, I can tell Tropic Isle has adjusted the formula to lighten the fragrance of the oil (before it used to be VERY strong) but the effectiveness and quality are in no way diminished!!! The size is 4 ounces and it typically lasts me about 4-6 months with regular use. I especially apply this to my edges since I am a bun, ponytail, protective-style wearing addict. At one point I had no edges from having a style in too tight. My hair went from being mid-back length to about 3 inches in length, that&#x27;s how bad the damage was! I would mist my edges with water or aloe vera juice for moisture, and then gently massage the Red Pimento Oil into my scalp and lightly coat the damaged edge areas with the same oil. I used this regime for about 4 months straight and now my edges are past my shoulders (again.) It&#x27;s a staple in my house for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My family and I are Caribbean and so this is the genuine thing. We don&#x27;t use any other the other Red Pimento hair oils marketed because we are highly suspicious of their ingredients., that&#x27;s how bad the damage was! I would mist my edges with water or aloe vera juice for moisture, and then gently massage the Red Pimento Oil into my scalp and lightly coat the damaged edge areas with the same oil. I used this regime for about 4 months straight and now my edges are past my shoulders (again.) It&#x27;s a staple in my house for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.

            <li> I&#x27;ve had and used this product for over 2 weeks, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really done anything. I&#x27;m still shedding a lot...But when I do use it, I can feel my scalp get warmer so maybe I just need to use it a little longer to see results.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle i recieved within a matter of 3 days super fast delivery!  The only con is the smell wayyyy to strong i cover it a good smelling conditioner.  I leave in my hair 20 mins with a cap right before shampooing and my hair is much more thicker I definitely notice growth.  Will continue using.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have been using this for the last few weeks.  It is making the scalp with dry skin.  It is making the hair itself healthier.  We have not noticed any new hair growth but it is early yet.  This product also absorbs well into the skin.  Not greasy like you would think it would be.  Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I put it on a few hours before showering and my hair stopped falling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any benefits from using this in my hair BUT i use so many products maybe it was overpowered by one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because the black castor oil worked so well and this product contains black castor oil. I thought more natural ingredients would be better. I this case, that was not true. This product makes my hair shed like crazy. It smells horrible. I never felt any tingling. It was a waste of money. Now I have to start my hair regrowth process all the way over. So sad!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, it has a eucalyptus smell but not too overpowerimg. I leave this in and wash out the next day and i feel that its helping to grow my edges with my other hair treatment. Will purchase again 4 oz goes a long way when using just for your edges it should last me 6 mo if not longer. GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 4 stars because of how the product was when I received it.  It arrived on time, as promised.  But the oil was leaking from the bottle as I read in another review.  I had to open the product and clean it at the same time.  Other than that,  I LOVE it and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Amaizing product .......  I had lot of hair fall  when i started using this 90% of my hair fall  controlled ...this is my first purchase ...and I will buy again .... I had  hair fall because of OCP use .even after i stop using OCP  my hairfall dint stop. But  to my surprise when i started using this product 90% of my hair fall controlled.... And also my hair is healthier than previous.... Thank you for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I am using this product. But I like the cold feeling I experience when I apply this product to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have 4b hair type and my hair never really shines. I tried this product because it has a spout for easy application. To my surprise this product really made my hair shine for days. I do not know if it helps your hair grow but your hair will definately shine.</li>
            <li> I like to use this occasionally, especially in the winter, as a deep conditioning treatment.  It feels great on my scalp, kind of warming and relaxing.  As other reviewers have said, the smell is not the best, but I do not find it offensive.  It washes out easily and does not weigh my hair down too much, but I can tell if I used it too often it would cause build up.  While I like it for occasional use, it is generally too heavy for my fine strand, thick volume 2a/b curly hair.  My mother, who has very straight and coarse hair, absolutely loves it and uses it more regularly.  It would probably be awful for someone with fine, thin hair.  So, it can be a great product, a good product, or a terrible product depending on your individual hair type.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and I must say that I am pleased. I saw this product when purchasing Jamaican Black Castor Oil so since I loved that by Tropic Isle Living, I assumed I would like this also. I brought this for my thinning hair. I rub it on my edges and crown areas because thats where my thinning is every other night. I can see that its working already. Some people says it has a bad smell but the smell doesnt bother me. However when I first used the product, it did make my scalp itch. I apply the Pimento Hair Oil on my scalp then I go right over it w/the Jamaican Black Castor Oil and the itching stops. It only itched the first 3 times I used it, now my scalp doesnt itch anymore. I have tried everything that I possibly could and this and the JBCO seems to be the only 2 things that are helping me w/my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Hello Seller,&lt;br /&gt;This item was said to help with hair growth with alopicia, but unfortunately it didnt help me in that area..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased JBCO oil in the past and decided to give the Red Pimento oil a chance.  I must say I am so glad I did I&#x27;ve really noticed an increase in the amount of new growth I have and very well defined too.  This oil will remain a staple in my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about two weeks. Doubt there is any growth yet, but I like the smell and thickness.</li>
            <li> Other than making my hair smell bad it didn&#x27;t do any good for me</li>
            <li> Have not seen results yet, but the cap is perfect for application!</li>
            <li> I tired this product and for some reason it made the spots where I applied it to turn into very tight tiny frizzy curls, but I have straight hair. I&#x27;m Latina btw, I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference since it says for all different hair types.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil - 4oz on June 15th, 2013 and have used it daily for 1 month so far.  There is a difference in the texture of my hair.  My hair on my temples feel stronger. The hair on the back of my head feels stronger. The hair on the top and front of my head is getting stronger. I really like this product...You do not need to squeeze a lot of this product on your hair.. otherwise the liquid will slowly drip. I have very course hair - 4-C hair. I used this product daily when my hair is wet... I Squeeze a quarter size amount in the palm of my hand 2x and massage the Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil - 4oz throughout my hair and then comb my hair with a wide tooth comb. I have recommended this product to several people that I know who have gone Natural and have damaged and breakage around the edges and Temple of their hair. I am Telling You There is a Difference in the Texture of my Hair.  One thing I do want you to know is that you can get Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil - 4oz much cheaper at your Beauty Supply Store. I bought another one and paid $8.99.  You will pay $15.00 bucks through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Okay I know the old saying anything with the word growth dont believe . I actually purchase this oil for the pimento oil . You can really smell the pimento in this oil . Im a kinky curly 4a(b) texture hair type. I apply this oil to my scalp after installing mini twist my roots and hair was soft for like 5 days this oil does moisturize, and then the new growth starting coming . After that I began using the oil to nourish my new growth this oil made my hair look as if I didnt even have new growth. this oil does work .</li>
            <li> This product make my 4c hair soft and manageable I&#x27;ve seen growth but Idk if it&#x27;s from the oil cause I&#x27;m also taking hairfinity. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> This stuff worked wonders on my hairline. I put just a fingertip amount on my hairline and I don&#x27;t rinse it out. My hairline use to look bald and slick but my loctician was able to put new locs there only a couple of days ago. Needless to say I am super excited about any product with that type of results. But I only gave it 4 stars because it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> OK LET ME SAYS THIS IF YOU WANT TO LOOSE YOU HAIR YOU GOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT.OK SO LAST YEAR I DECIDED TO GET HIGHLIGHTS(VERY BAD IDEA,I KNOW I KNOW,BUT I WANTED A CHANGE)MY HAIR IS ALMOST A JET BLACK,SHE BLEACHED MY HAIR 3 TIME FOR ME TO GET A LIGHT SHADE ,BAD IDEA I KNOW,MY HAIR WAS ALL MESSED UP,NOTHING PROTIEN TREATMENT COULDN&#x27;T FIX BUT MY BAGS AREA YOU COULD SAY THEY WERE SOME WHAT BOLD,SOME PEOPLE SAID CASTOR OIL ,AND IT&#x27;S VERY VERY HEAVY STICKY AND SOME SAID THAT THE BEST I COULS DO AND BY SOME I MEAN 90%OF THE REVIEWS,SHINY HAIR,SOFT HAIR,FRIZZ FREE HAIR TRY NO HAIR, I STARTED USING IT ONE A DAY FOR A MONTH,NO CHANGE OK,I WILL GIVE IT SOME MORE TIME,GUESS WHAT MY HAIR STRATED FALL IN ALLOVER THE PLACE,I LOST MORE HAIR FROM THE TEMPLES,I HAVE ALMOST BOLD SPOTS ALL OVER MY HEAD,AND MIND YOU I DIDN&#x27;T CHANGE ANYTHING IN MY HAIR ROUTINE,I RUN TO THE HEATH STORE,GOT SOME CASTOR OIL,AAAAAHHHHH(HALLO)IT&#x27;S GROWING BACK NOW SLOWLY BUT IT&#x27;S COMING BACK,,DO NOT NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS OIL,,,GGGGRRRREEEE,SO MAD</li>
            <li> I really liked this, however, the smell always made me think twice about using it. It was still an awesome product though and I will surely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product October 10, 2013 based off the reviews i read. when i received this product i noticed a thick consistency. i began to apply this to my scalp 2x daily and i instantly felt a tingle. i never washed it out.( USE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION)I would use a small old toothbrush and massage a dime size amount in my hair mainly my edges and my nape area. i noticed after 2 weeks that my hair began to grow. The smell isn&#x27;t to pleasant and i noticed how oily it is, so i went from 2x daily to every other day once a day. this stuff is strong and it truly works. i&#x27;am going to get several bottles of this. i love this stuff, my hair is growing and the thickness of it is awesome...</li>
            <li> SO I ONLY BEEN USEING THE OIL ALITTLE OVER 2WEEKS NOW..  I USE IT AS A HOT OIL TREATMENT THEN WASH OUT WITH SULFATE FREE SHAMPOO.. THEN IN THE SAME WEEK I TAKE A LITTLE AND MASSAGE MY SCALP WITH IT... MUST SAY ITS A STAPLE SO FAR.. MY NEW GROW SPROUTING OUT ALREADY AND IT ONLY BEEN 2 WEEKS WHEN I DO MY MASSAGES I NOTICE A DIFFERENCE HOW SOFT IT FEEL AND HOW THICK ITS GETTING... OH YEA I&#x27;VE TRIED EVERYTHING TO THICKING MY HAIR AND I MUST SAY THIS RED PIMENTO OIL IS A BEAST 0_o IM LOVING IT. SO IF YOUR CURIOUS BOUT BUYING IT TO GROW OR THICKEN YOUR HAIR DONT HESITATE GET IT:-)!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this oil about 8 months ago and finally just ran out. I use about 2-3 table spoons on my scalp 2 times a week under a blow dryer. It recommends using it 2 times a week with a hot cap, or under a hair dryer, but I just wrap my hair in a light towel or cap and turn on the blow dryer for 20 minutes. During my usage, I was also taking Country Life Maxi Hair Vitamins. I did notice a little bit of new growth after about 2 months of using this product religiously. It wasn&#x27;t a serious amount of new growth, it was sparse and not very strong, so I can&#x27;t tell you if it was from the oil or the vitamins. It didn&#x27;t grow rapidly or get any stronger.  The things I didn&#x27;t like about this oil is that it smells funky, and it&#x27;s very runny, if you put a little too much it runs down your face. I do like that it has an easy pour spout, it washes out easily, and you get quite a bit of oil. I have fine caucasian hair, so it may work better on thicker or curly hair. I like the product but I think I will just stick with my vitamins because it&#x27;s so much of a hassle to use every week.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair and left it on for hours. Warning!!!!! It doesn&#x27;t sting, but it is pepper, and I fried my scalp and it shed with thick pieces of dandruff skin for a week or two. Now I&#x27;m scared of it.</li>
            <li> Cant really say if I like it or not. Its been a few days over a month. Using this along with megatek however I will get my hair flat ironed at the end on feb. So I will come back and rate this product in regards to hair growth and filling in thinning areas. A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product. Was packaged well. Would repurchase</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results.</li>
            <li> This is a great product not too oily, and I am noticing thinning areas filling out as a result of using it.</li>
            <li> Just a few days into using this oil &amp; my hair is noticeably softer &amp; feels stronger.  I wear my hair in locs &amp; it gives my new growth a very nice sheen.  At first I used this oil at my edges because they&#x27;re thinning a little.  But after 2 days I decided to use it on my whole head only because of how soft it made my kinky hair feel.  A little warning that the red pimento gives this oil a bit of a spicy fragrance but it&#x27;s definitely manageable.  Regardless of whether I notice any growth I&#x27;m going to get more of this oil.  I only wish I discovered it earlier in the winter -- prior to using this oil my hair was rough, dry &amp; wouldn&#x27;t hold any moisture.  This was a best buy for my hair.</li>
            <li> THIS HELP GROW AREAS BACK AT THE FRONT OF MY HAIR LINE THAT BEEN THERE FOR YEARS  I PUT IT ON ABOUT 5 TIMES AND I SAW THE HAIR GROWING BACK IN..</li>
            <li> Strong warning:  I only used this product twice hope it would promote my hair growth.  Sadly, I developed a horrible, ugliest skin rashes on my scalp to my face and all over my body.  I can&#x27;t tell you how unbearable the itchiness was that I couldn&#x27;t sleep for three nights.  The fact is there is no quick fix, although I am on prednisone right now, but there is no easy way to get rid of the redness and swollenness from my scalp and my face .&lt;br /&gt;From now on, I would never put anything on my face and on my scalp without to conduct a careful skin test first.&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame that  the company didn&#x27;t put a warning on their label.</li>
            <li> This product really does work.  My daughter&#x27;s hair was constantly shedding.  It broke my heart to see her so sad.  Thank goodness I found this product in the internet.  This product started working the first time she used it. Her hair has now stopped shedding and never looked so healthy. I truly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a healthier and more vibrant hair. I used it only once and combined it with more coconut oil (it contains coconut oil and other ingredients). So far, so good ...been a week since received. I love the smell and the cool tingling feeling it gives when applying it to my scalp. I warm the oil so it could be used as a hot oil treatment and the coconut oil as a pre-shampoo treatment.  I&#x27;m no longer putting perms or chemicals in my hair, so I have gone natural. I will re-visit this review in a couple of months, so I can give a more accurate and descriptive write about this product.  I have read other reviews and the consumers are pleased with this item. I&#x27;m hoping by June my hair would show an inch or more in growth.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Helps my hair with moisture, shine, and also helps it soften.&lt;br /&gt;Have yet to see growth though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young and have really thick hair, but in the last few years, my hair has been falling out much more than normal. I would walk out of the shower with handfuls of hair left behind. Although I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, I saw a difference from the first time. I don&#x27;t believe that a product has magical properties and makes something as nice or better than what it was, but this oil definitely surprised me! I can feel fullness in my hair and it feels more silky, stronger, and it&#x27;s falling out at a slower rate. So even if it doesn&#x27;t completely stop it, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good, it probably requires a constant usage to give the promised results, which i didn&#x27;t do because of the bad smell on my head. Personally, I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired Strong Roots for two txt now. It seems to be really good, it seems like my hair has grow longer, if that is even possible.&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed how fast the delivery was.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any effects of strong root, and the smell is not that good.I won&#x27;t recommend it to my friend.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have always had really thing hair and I never had that much hair too. All my hair could be wrapped around my pinky. SInce using this product, my hair has become thicker than before that now i need my hair doesnt fit if I wrap it around my pinky!! My hair is softer and has grown longer. I have also noticed a lot more baby hairs which means that it is helping me grow new hair. Even my mom and hairdresser has noticed an improvement in my hair. I only use it about 3 times a week and i leave it on for about 20 minutes before I shower. I use this product with Avalon Organics Biotin Shampoo which also helps my hair. The smell is strong but it doesnt bother me at all.I definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product is a life changer ! I recently suffered from so hair loss in my crown and was searching for a product to help restore that area. I came across this product after doing some research on Red Pimento Seeds and hair growth. I&#x27;m so glad I did. Within weeks I saw results! I would definitely re come d this product.</li>
            <li> This was so thick that I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the container.  I ended up sending it back and getting a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it short and sweet. I was upset about the 2 car garage forming at the top of my scalp and searched high and low for product. I ran across the reviews for Tropic Isle Strong Roots Oil and was astonished by how many folks said this works, so I tried it. It works..hands down one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in a long time. In two weeks the garage is a non factor and my hair is filling in thick. Thank you...Thank you...</li>
            <li> Only used the oil twice! Extremely oily and it kinda runs , doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.  I will wait and see how it works on my hair so far nothing yet.</li>
            <li> the oils smells nice and it comes in a wonderful bottle that makes it easy to apply to the hair and scalp, but when I applied it my eyes got irritated, may be its because I left on for a long time or because I used too much</li>
            <li> I do not use for Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil 4 Ounce, I had any Laser Comb Therapy treatment hair loss, promotes hair growth. Do not waste money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need Jamaican Black Castor Oil Shampoo gentle cleans after using Black Castor oil massage on hair and scalp. Damaged &amp; dry and fizzy hairs and loss protein, I need to use Protein Hair Conditioner repairing hair luster and good healthy.</li>
            <li> Works well with other hair growth products</li>
            <li> I like the product,a little dab is all u need. The smell is ok. this product really works for me.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money. I have not seen an results at all and I&#x27;ve tried every way that was mentioned. Not buying this product again. And it smells AWFUL!!</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!!  I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> i liked it....i used it with coconut hair oil n also vitamin E-cap..... expecting more to buy n use for grt result</li>
            <li> UPDATE 9/12/13: Official recived both my items, the castor oil and the red pimento oil! and I already started yesterday with my challenge when i recieved the pimento oil first. follow my journey here. [...]&lt;br /&gt;Hey everyone I just ordered this item recently on a Saturday which was 9/7/13. And I&#x27;m going to start off with a 5 star rating just for the hype. I am going to do a hair growth challenge, and I will be using this castor oil and I will be using their pimento oil. I am natural and have very kinky/coily hair ranging from 3&#x27;s to the 4&#x27;s. I my hair is a decent length...but shrinkage is a betch, but sometimes I love it. I just want my hair to be at my shoulders but curly with shrinkage and all. My hair grows on average 1/2 inch a month or a little over depending on protective styles. I notice that my hair does well when I keep my hair in twist under a wig haha. So I will be wearing wigs, for my challenge. I&#x27;m also going to try to come up with a routine for me to do and follow. I have never been on a regiment for my hair. I really like simple. But I also wanted to incorporate oils into my new regiment. Never done it before, but I think that will change the health of my hair in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Routine:&lt;br /&gt;Wash hair every week&lt;br /&gt;  hot oil treatment(olive oil)&lt;br /&gt;  deep conditioning/protein treatment(egg mixed with deep conditioner)&lt;br /&gt;Split my hair into sections&lt;br /&gt;Apply castor/pimento oil to scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Detangle each section&lt;br /&gt;Twist each section&lt;br /&gt;Put wig cap on and wig&lt;br /&gt;Then repeat every week&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the week I will be applying the castor/pimento oil to my scalp where I have the plaited sections from my twist every night and sleep with a silk bonnet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Length Checks: Will be every month. Right now my hair ranges to 9&#x27;-9 1/2&#x27; all over my head, but I will do official checks to have a clear starting point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goals: Want softer/stronger/healthier hair, and I want to maximize hair growth. I want to have grown/retained 6 inches in 6 months. And that would be perfect for Spring break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be making future YouTube videos, and when I do will give the links. But you can also find me on instagram: AshleyNicoleCollins to see pictures of me and my wigs(protective styles)If you have any questions also you can contact me there. And I may make a separate instagram just for this challenge, and when/if I do I will let you guys know.I will be making future YouTube videos, and when I do will give the links.

            <li> I really didn&#x27;t get much out of this product and will not re-order.  I think I will just stick with the brand&#x27;s Castor Oil, the extra dark formulation.  I will continue to use since I still have some of the product; but don&#x27;t think I will re-order.  It may be for you; just not for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is alright. I love the smell, which is very distinct. I didn&#x27;t like the product enough to use it continuously by itself, but I have mixed it in my deep conditioning mask, and hair milk, because I don&#x27;t want to waste it. I was hoping it would aid in the process of thickening up my edges, maybe I need to do continual treatments with it. Eh.</li>
            <li> Hate the smell, cant even use it for that. It´s not like it smell like garbage, but the spice and weird smell is too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;I do not if it works.</li>
            <li> Works really good. Makes my hair feel really moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for my hair. I use it every week and massage it into my scalp and my hair is growing out. I&#x27;m so pleased with it! And the delivery is fast so I will buy again!</li>
            <li> S far I&#x27;m pleased with it.Its convient with the spout top makes it easier to put to you scalp and hair. Hopefully it&#x27;ll thicken my hair and get it back growing back good.Anyway sure trying it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> please please sell products that work...not looking for a miracle just real and honest results.  not worth the money...there are othjer products that you can use that are so much better</li>
            <li> Love the smell and love my hair.  My hair is improving a lot with the combination of items I am using.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sent this as gifts to 3 friends/family members, and they all love it. My sister&#x27;s hair began to grow back when utilizing the product after she was diagnosed with alopecia. My daughter was diagnosed with seborrhea of the scalp, and the red pimento worked wonders for her scalp, and her bald spots filled in too.</li>
            <li> this product took my hair out did not like it at all the smell is so bad will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and been using different products all my life to prevent fall out and encourage growth. I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times in the last week an a half and already see 85% improvement in my hair fallout.  Too early to see if there is any re-growth. I wash my hair first because I use lots of cosmetic products on my hair to make it look fuller.  Massage it into my clean scalp and put on a shower cap for 20 minutes.  Wash thoroughly (it is an oil) and style as usual.  I would highly recommend.  Linda</li>
            <li> Wow, this is great for growing a beard!</li>
            <li> Did not see significance hair growth, but did experience a healthier scalp, and silky soft hair that was less frizzy, and more manageable.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a light weight hair growth oil, this is your product. I must say, it is a bit itchy the first minute or so after you apply it, but it wears off quickly. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife and we can actually can see new hair growth. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> SO OILY and does not go away when I rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do not like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sd s  s sfa e efa</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now, while I&#x27;m on my hair vacation I use this oil every night before I go to bed and my hair feels so soft to the tough.</li>
            <li> I purchased in hopes of using it to help my fine, thin Caucasian wavy hair grow a bit healthier. However, I am super lazy and never remember to use it for scalp treatments like I should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I use it after every shower, spreading a couple of drops in my finger tips and applying to my ends. After my hair dries, it is not heavy or greasy. I like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a spicy type of smell to it, and from I can tell, only healthy and helpful ingredients. I would buy this again, but won&#x27;t need to for a decade since it goes really far for my light use.</li>
            <li> Please be sure that you don&#x27;t have any underlying allergies to clover/Red Pimento!! After using this product once a week for 3 weeks, I had a less than pleasant allergic reaction known as Contact Dermatitis! My ears and scalp became severely inflamed, itchy, red, and bumpy. Later, I was diagnosed with Contact Dermatitis and prescribed a steroid and Benadryl in order to relieve my symptoms. In the future, I will only purchase their castor oil.</li>
            <li> I rub about a &#x27;dime size&#x27; amount post showers. Started to work about 2-3 weeks. Hair is stronger and shinier. One bottle lasted me 4 months / using daily. I have short hair.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for my VERY dry, very slow growing hair.  The fragrance REALLY is NOT bothersome at all.</li>
            <li> This item really works, my hair is growing back nicely and thicker as well.</li>
            <li> This was amazing and worked great for my hair and my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. It is greasy so when you are going to lay down, use an old pillow case.</li>
            <li> Thanks you so much I will keep in touch with you....and I will also spread the word...see you next time</li>
            <li> It smells great. I love having it on my hair and I love the feeling of my hair after I wash it. I&#x27;m a guy btw and I&#x27;m trying to experiment with long hair styles. my hair is usually very dry so whenever I try growing it, I end up cutting it. but after using this several times I noticed my hair isnt as dry and dull as it used to be. As for growth, I think it is growing at a steady pace. I&#x27;m not sure if it is speeding up anything. (check other reviews) but it definetely helps my hair. They recommend you use a heating cap or steam cap would be better. I don&#x27;t have any so what I do is take a very hot towel and put it on my head. seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> This is great for your scalp, especially if it&#x27;s itchy.  I have great results and also use it as a leave in.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if ti did anything. I used the whole bottle. I would put in on my roots and leave it up for 40 min. I  didn&#x27;t note any noticeable improvement in my hair,  *** I wrote that a year ago.  This stuff def works. My hairdresser even noticed new growth in my temple area. I&#x27;m a fan for life</li>
            <li> I use this product as a hot oil treatment for my hair and it&#x27;s wonderful! It detangles and gives my hair an excellent sheen.</li>
            <li> I am one to only speak of my own personal experience and I HAVE 4C TYPE HAIR. And all of you NATURALS well know that this is one of the hardest types of hair to moisturize.(that is until you finally find what really works for your hair)and for me, finding a GREAT REGIMEN  took years. but with STRONG ROOTS RED PIMENTO OIL, the experience was one of the BEST!MY 4C HAIR BECAME SOOoo SOFT!!!I would love to, but I can&#x27;t say that about a lot of products. The relaxer years left me with chemical burns which left its battle scars. The top of my hair (center) is where it was the thinnest and around the edges(they call it cow licked)LOL! Well after applying, I noticed itching in my problem area and believe it or not there were little hairs sprouting up in this thin area. and MY SCALP itches a lot only when it grows. And I only notice this \\&quot;itching\\&quot; where I see new hair growing. My \\&quot;Cowlicks\\&quot; were even thicker.(and I really didn&#x27;t expect anything to happen for that area it&#x27;s been that way all my life-it grows JUST a tad then break off) All this in a month&#x27;s use. I will repost after another month or so.  And btw, I don&#x27;t use it as the directions states. But I switch it up.(the way I use it)I&lt;br /&gt;always say \\&quot;If you find what works for you stick with it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so much about Red Pimento and Black Castor Oil ,I had to give it a go to see what all the talk was about.&lt;br /&gt;Much to my surprise it all that reviews say it&#x27;s about!!!! I have natural hair, mainly 3c/4a hair texture. I had my hair micro twisted in Atlanta by Natural Hair By Rinah(BEAAAUTIFUL!no extensions added). The weather in Ga  has been very dry this summer so this was my perfect opportunity to try it out. The whole truth and nothing but the truth I&#x27;ve had my twist in for 2wks and 4 days and I&#x27;ve had almost a half inch of hair growth!! The smell, everybody says the smell is unbearable, not SO true. Benefits out weigh the smell and the smell isn&#x27;t bad really it isn&#x27;t. You want to get around the smell just add a bit of rosemary or peppermint oil and now you have a super growth formula going on. BUT, I decided NOT to use those two oils because I wanted to see how it worked all by itself. Would definitely purchase this product again and again. Also, don&#x27;t forget to give yourself a hot oil treatment with this and sit under a hair steamer(haven&#x27;t done this) I can only imagine it would add more results. Some people use the toothbrush thingy to massage it into the scalp but I just gently use my finger tips. Buying a larger bottle would be more economical if you like how it works. Good luck and give it a try!</li>
            <li> My daughter says it smells like oatmeal.  I guess it&#x27;s the pimento that reminds her of nutmeg and cinnamon.  Love it for her hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product when I had chemically treated hair. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair condition while using the product. . It wasn&#x27;t good or bad. I will repurchase the product and try it on my  natural hair, It might work differently ( I threw the first bottle away)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use this twice on my thinning African American hair. The first time was to oil my scalp and I definitely felt the tingle and had to adjust to the earthy smell. The second time as a pre-poo/hot oil treatment. It definitely gives the hair a boost of volume and nice shine.</li>
            <li> i think this is a good product besides my hair itches like hell , and i love the smell ... it is and i can say is better than auto -gro made my hair shed alot but it did get thicker thou . but will not using that any more i will keep yall updated .</li>
            <li> help my daughters hair grow</li>
            <li> I did a search online to see what products work to promote hair growth (increase in length, although this also works to thicken as well) and found that Jamaican black castor oil was suggested.  Although I have heard of castor oil, I wasn&#x27;t familiar with Jamaican black castor oil so I was a bit skeptical.  I figured I would search for a product containing it on Amazon and found several results.  I purchased this product along with actual black castor oil, and a detangling spray.  I basically use this product every other day, applying it directly to my scalp.  I also use the detangling spray, concentrating it on my scalp as well.  Within three weeks, I noticed a difference in length by almost an inch.  My mom and sister also made a comment about my hair growing long right around the time I started to notice it.  I am typically skeptical about products promising so much, but it is amazing how fast my hair has grown with consistent use.  I also feel as though my hair appears thicker as well.  Obvious to say, I am extremely happy with this product and the results I have achieved.  I would highly recommend it to anyone trying to grow their hair out.</li>
            <li> It ok with me i dont like the smell and it too thick for my hair i dont like that too</li>
            <li> This is my second review for Tropic Isle strong Roots Red Pimento Oil. Again I will say that I love this oil. I like it better than the plain castor oil. I have noticed more hair growth, thicker and longer since using this oil. I use it about three times a week directly on my scalp. I never run out. When I see that my bottle is half empty I promptly order two more. I am an Arfican American with 4b hair if this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Chose this to help fortify my hair, but the smell is outrageous and it leaves a very oily texture to the hair.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the pure castor oil from same company. That stuff had my beard and hair growing faster. But this stuff isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I order other items, but I never used it.  I am still using other items hope this work better than the other items I am now using.</li>
            <li> This was an abject waste of money. It did nothing. No tingling, no growth, nothing. Just snake oil. will not recommend</li>
            <li> first time using this red pimento oil I have not seen results because this is my first time using it so I will keep amazon posted but anything that is all natural and promotes hair growth with no harmful side effects I will give a try</li>
            <li> i liked it for the fact that my hair felt super soft after i washed it out. i did not see any extra hair growth. but i loved the softness of my hair after.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for adding shine and moisture to my hair. It does have a strong spicy smell, but not too bold. It almost reminds me of a nutmeg/cinnamon blend. As far as thickness goes, I&#x27;m not sure because my hair is already thick. It hasn&#x27;t done anything for hair growth, but I will continue to use it for its other properties.</li>
            <li> Stuff feels icky and greasy, and I don&#x27;t think it even helped me for hair growth. Good luck on getting better results if you try this out.</li>
            <li> After using this periodically from time to time without a heating cap, I did notice that it does have an effect on regrowing hair, especially around the hairline, and I could see new follicles coming in, where previously they were not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have MPB (male pattern baldness) in my family, this product works fantastically when used about 3x / week for ~30 minutes with a heating cap....you should definitely use it with a heating cap. Using a hairdryer and having to hold that for 30 minutes is not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can already tell that my hair is thicker, and new hairs are sprouting by using this twice a week. You may notice some shedding if you rub it into your hair the first couple times, that is just weak hair follicles being tossed out by new hair follicles that are much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have just recently started using it very often, it&#x27;s probably the closest thing to a cure for baldness out there, although I also throw propecia, rogaine, b, e, d vitamins, biotin, niacin to fight my hair loss. Make sure you also use some good shampoo, shampoo with black castor oil is great, and a conditioner with shea butter is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll definitely notice a real difference.</li>
            <li> Great! I Only used it for a few weeks and I saw a huge growth in my hair, it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
            <li> This is great. My hair looks and feels fuller after I used it for a while. I put it on with a shower cap for 30 minutes in the morning before I shower. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much. When you apply the oil to the scalp,&lt;br /&gt;you can feel it start to zing right away. It makes it feel like the dead&lt;br /&gt;skin cells that block the hair follicle pores are zapped away and the hair&lt;br /&gt;can grow very quickly and uninhibited. Love the product. I will purchase&lt;br /&gt;again when I run out of this one. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it really does work I use it twice a week and it smells so good..like cinnamon Christmas candy :-) and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy feeling :-)</li>
            <li> Yes it works! It felt like it stripped cleanness to the roots!!! My hair looks shiny and clean! It grew as well, I solely recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and already love it. It cleared up my itchy scalp and makes my hair shiny and soft. I&#x27;ve also noticed that there is way less hair in the drain after I shower - it is definitely helping with hair fallout. I suggest running the bottle under hot water for a few minutes before applying.</li>
            <li> Bought this in conjunction with the jamaican castor oil, and the red pimento irritated my scalp every time i used it. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying it, and got results right away..I would recommend it for sure. Per ordering my next bottle</li>
            <li> I mix several drops of this product with either Mega Tek Pet Coat Rebuilder or Mega Tek Hoof Mane &amp; Tail. I massage it into my scalp and leave it on for as long as possible them rinse it out. I started using this combination after using only the Pet Coat Rebuilder for the first week. Adding this oil accelerates the hair growth process. You must consider WHY you have hair loss. You may be on medication that prevents re-growth from happening. Don&#x27;t blame the product(s) because they do work!</li>
            <li> I will preface my comments by saying, as with any product, it may not work for everyone.  I have a 4a/b head of textured African-American hair.  The finer hair is toward the top and front of my head, while the coarser hair is near the back.  I applied this product to my scalp once per week, a day or two before my wash day.  I really didn&#x27;t notice results the first month I used it, other than the finer strands in the front of my head had a very smooth and nicely defined wave pattern.  I applied a mild texturizer to my hair during the second month and a week after I resumed application of the product to my scalp, I started getting a strong case of the \\&quot;itchies.\\&quot;  When parting my scalp, noticed some flaking in the area where my scalp was itching.  I also noticed some new growth (not a whole lot, but definitely noticeable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By month three, I am more than half-way through the bottle and I&#x27;ve noticed additional positive results from this product including thicker, softer strands that are well moisturized (even my usually dry, coarse hair).  I have also incorporated scalp massages after application of this product and when I brush my hair (using a Denman brush) into a bun, I get a really nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very pleased with this product and definitely plan to repurchase. I will warn you... the smell isn&#x27;t that pleasant which is why I usually apply it a day or two before my wash day.  Also, I&#x27;m not sure if the flakes I experienced are a byproduct of the growth (I didn&#x27;t get any flaking or itching in the areas of my head that did not have new growth) or if the the red pimento caused an allergic-type reaction when applied to the scalp.  The other ingredients (Jamaican black castor oil, wheat germ oil and coconut oil) are all very good at promoting healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff and the way it feels on my natural 4b/4c hair.  Great product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work,  used for 6 months</li>
            <li> I have seen a great change in my hair texture since using this product.  My hair and scalp is healthier.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!  I use it as a weekly hot oil treatment.  My scalp used to be dry &amp; itchy but that stopped after my first use.  I will definitely reorder from this retailer.</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful! i saw result in my daughter&#x27;s hair and mine also within 2wks...my hair is thicker, stronger at the roots and healthy! ive been on Castor oil for yr and my hair has never been more healthy thank it is now...ive use the the pimento oil for 2months and it has the same effect as the Jamaican oil just a bit faster in hair growth. i love this product and will continue to use them on my family hair.</li>
            <li> Great hot oil treatment. great for thinning hair and bald spots.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me.  After a while of using it, I saw absolutely no growth or no difference so it didn&#x27;t work for me at all</li>
            <li> Really good stuff. My hair grows much faster. I see some new hair in places where it was falling out and thinning. Smell feels ok to me. It smells very natural, though for some people the smell may be too strong. I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product hardens I have to put in microwave to use.  I don&#x27;t understand why. Was not in product description</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing! Smells greats, give my hair manageability, volume.&lt;br /&gt;My shedding stops and hair regrowth took place in no time!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this awesome powerhouse product to everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer :-)</li>
            <li> Stinks. Greasy as bacon grease.....but works well. You will not grow new hair. It will however make your hair healthy and good looking. Works like garbage on the beard however (heh, had to try).</li>
            <li> It def doesn&#x27;t smell good! but I can honestly say that when I used this product, my hair stopped falling! but I don&#x27;t know if it actually helps with hair growth or not though</li>
            <li> This oil works for me and I&#x27;m on my way to another bottle</li>
            <li> Does seem to relieve pain quickly..</li>
            <li> Used it three times.  does seem to have slowed the hair falling out.  I warm the bottle in hot water for a minute, then use a shower cap.</li>
            <li> I use this in my hair about one hour before washing.  I have not noticed any difference in growth but I have not seen negative results either.</li>
            <li> awesome product, I&#x27;m on a 30 day challenge Jamaican black castor oil treatment. A little bit goes a long ways. Sections parting the hair down the middle massage therapy, your be very pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the feeling and the smell very light. on the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 34 year old white male. Over the past few years I noticed my blonde hair was thinning excessively. I&#x27;ve been taking a lot of supplements, vitamins, Rogaine, and anything that has had good reviews to grow back my hair without subcombing to hair implants. I heard about this product(and other castor oils) and decided I had nothing to lose. I put this on the front of my hairline, my temples, and where I part my hair at night. It doesn&#x27;t take much to spread out. it does have a pleasing scent, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to be walking around all day with it. I leave it on over night or for an hour before rinsing. I&#x27;ve been very pleased; I&#x27;ve noticed new baby hairs growing in these areas. I also believe that it will help thicken up the other hairs that have made their way back to my head. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff my hair is growing fast</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described, but did not notice any real improvement in my hair even though I used the entire bottle. I will not reorder.&lt;br /&gt;D.Williams</li>
            <li> I like this hair oil. The smell is different but not bad in my opinion. Hopefully it works like it says it does!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product.  It great could itchy scalp.  The price is great!</li>
            <li> This hair oil is very nice, I have fine hair and I am always looking for natural products to get to the root and help make my hair voluminous! This stuff does the trick. I use this stuff once a week and can notice the difference for the rest of the week. I also love the natural smell. If this stuff pumps up my fine hair without weighing it down, Im sure it will work for pretty much any hair type.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought 2, I love this oil, keeps my hair sealed and hydrated.. will buy again.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; is actually semi solid at room temperature so you cant just squeeze it out of the nozzle. You have to heat it up to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;It has a different type of smell its hard to describe perhaps sweet or fruity type of smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product weekly, I apply it all over my scalp and message in a few hours before shampooing. I see a tiny difference in the hairs around the edges of my hairline. I will absolutely keep using. I do like this hair growth oil. My hair also seems to be shedding less.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it helps keeps your scalp hydrated. I started using this product over  the summer while I was wearing braids, and My hair grew 1 inch within the 2 month period I had my hair braided.  It also make my hair soft.  I love it.  I usually do a Hot oil treatment, biweekly and then I wash it out using a follicle cleanser of my EMU Shampoo and Conditioner.  It works.</li>
            <li> Works well and I&#x27;ve seen hair growth.</li>
            <li> This was a little too strong for my roots. I experienced breakage in the areas I applied it. Maybe my scalp was just too sensitive for this product, but I&#x27;ve had to stop using it because I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;ll lose a whole loc or something.</li>
            <li> Too Heavy, not for me.</li>
            <li> It just made my hair oily and I dont see or feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I use this product Red Pimento on my hair and it never work for me,i use this for about one year and got no reSults for my hair,so i went back to my old products,so i rate this product one star,because it never work for me</li>
            <li> Bought if for my brother who was in denial of his hair loss, he says its been working well</li>
            <li> I personally love this oil!! Although I don&#x27;t really care for the smell. Other than that I really did like it. It does seem to harden in colder temperatures due to the fact that it has coconut oil in it, but i just let the bottle sit in some warm/hot water for a few seconds and then applied to my scalp. I usually use it when I have braids and I would defiantly purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and it did arrive quickly and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to the letter. Applied it to my hair in the morning and let it set for 20 minutes under heat. Then I thoroughly rinsed and washed my hair with an all natural shampoo that I usually use. My hair had a heavy feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;This morning my hair was a greasy mess and I have small acne like bumps on my scalp, which I have never had before. I do not have sensitive skin so I find it interesting I had a bad reaction to this product.&lt;br /&gt;This might work great for others. I think this may be more for ethnic hair, I have brown, fine hair and this just is not a product I will use again.</li>
            <li> I noticed the texture of my hair change instantly! My hair feels and looks fuller.</li>
            <li> Its my first time using this particular product and I really like the applicator bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It came in on time and I&#x27;m glad it was packaged well because some of the oil spilled in transit.all in all, a good buy.</li>
            <li> I just recently received the oil, been wanting to try it since my hair are falling out and I tried everything but nothing helped. I put it on my scalp and hair and massaged, and left it on for about an hour, and washed it after. When my hair dried, I was amazed how soft, manageable and full they looked! This is a big progress for my hair, I don&#x27;t know yet If it will help with hair loss, too early to say, but manageability, healthy shine and fulness - yes, that&#x27;s what I got after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;I will be using it 3 times a week and will post my progress in a month.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would give this product a try since I like their black castor oil. I really did not like this product at all. The smell was very overwhelming and I would get a headache from the smell of it. Honestly after using it once I was crazy to use it again a second time which was just to give it another chance. I only gave it one star because I can&#x27;t give it a zero otherwise I would. I wouldn&#x27;t even give this to my enemy. This product sucks!!!</li>
            <li> Tropic Isle Living Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil is what it say it is. My scalp felt like it was coming back to life the minute I massaged it onto my scalp. It smells like herbal medicine. Its mixed with castor oil which means, speedy hair growth. My scalp felt stimulated in seconds. My hair grew 1-inch per month with castor oil. I&#x27;m excited to see the results after 3-month after using this product. It made my hair very moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand makes excellent products for the hair. All their products encourages speedy hair growth. I will makes this product my staple.</li>
            <li> I just received all three products. The Jamaican Black Castor Oil, The Tropic Isle Living strong roots red pimento hair growth oild, and the castor oil hair food. I love all three products. I can already tell a difference in the texture of my hair. I dont have any breakage and my hair is so soft. I am prayering the castor oil makes my eyebrows grow...they are very thin. I am very pleased with the feedback from these products. So happy i found something to make my hair thicker and grow that is natural.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders. I had great growth while using this product with my braids. I will be buying another bottle soon. I used it about every other day to every 3 days along with my other oil mix for my scalp. Jamaican black castor oil on my edges. Love it.</li>
            <li> Improving hair thickness and manageablity. Keeps hair moist between shampoos. Hair feels healtier with less breakage. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I soooo happy love this product this oil is the best not to greasy. Smell is tolerable GREAT STUFF</li>
            <li> I started using this because I have REALLY bad dandruff this is for dandruff. I have tried other things a dermatologist prescribed for me but those didn&#x27;t work. I am on my second bottle of this stuff and let me tell you this stuff is amazing. It practically cleared my dandruff issues when I was on the first bottle. With the second bottle I haven&#x27;t been so consistent with using it and putting on my scalp so naturally the problems are back but they aren&#x27;t so bad. I mostly just use it on my edges and a couple of bald spots I have since this is also good for hair growth. When I would put it all over my scalp I would use it twice a week. Don&#x27;t want to go overboard with it. This stuff like all castor oil is very thick but this stuff isn&#x27;t as thick as the regular black castor oil. It also has a very nice lemony spice smell to it. I love and will only use this stuff.</li>
            <li> This was a mess&lt;br /&gt;I opened the too big box for a 4oz bottle,&lt;br /&gt;there was puffed plastic to keep it from breaking&lt;br /&gt; I reached in to get the bottle and had oil all over my hand, the bottle,&lt;br /&gt;and bottom of the box theres no seal&lt;br /&gt;on the bottle and it had leaked</li>
            <li> been using for a while in my hair and have seen no improvement at all</li>
            <li> The mixture of the red pimento with the Jamaican Black Castor oil, coconut oil and wheat germ rejuvenat the scalp.  You can really feel the effects as it is absorbed into the scalp.  There is a real sense that it is feeding the scalp.  I like the product because it is used as a treatment for a few minutes, then wash out, but you can still feel the calming and cooling sensation awhile afterward the shampoo.  I feel that my roots are stronger than before!  There is less hair in the trashcan now.  I&#x27;m saving my hair!</li>
            <li> I like the black castor oil alot better than this.  I hardly use this oil, the few times I used it, it dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> Not as expected but really makes you hair grow strong in a slow manner, You will be satisfied after&lt;br /&gt;a month or so. Makes your scalp itch a little but it is not to worry because it simply means that your&lt;br /&gt;hair is growing. So, be happy when you feel the itch if you are looking for longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;evelyne r roche</li>
            <li> Like the smell and the thickness of the oil.  Too soon to tell if it works.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is working on the growth side of things (have only been using a few weeks) but it is making my hair feel so soft and luxurious (I feel like swinging my hair around like on the TV ads, but alas, it is not long enough yet!)&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it twice a week and rubbing into my scalp then leaving for about 1/2 an hour. The smell is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine red (natural) hair and now it feels fab!</li>
            <li> I brought this oil a month. I used it sometimes daily and at least three times a week on my daughter and I. I saw no real results product greasy as expected with oil, and  no lasting mositure. My daughter has soft hair not very kinky. My have is very kinky but soft the oil wears off by the end of the day. The good thing is it did not cause hair loss. I will not purchase this product again. I will try Biotin next, and I will create my hair growth oil mixture Jojoba oil,castro oil, sulfur, and mega-tek, so far on my list.</li>
            <li> I used this as a prepoo per the bottle directions. I haven&#x27;t experienced any adverse reactions to it.No burning, excess shedding or any irritation.  I&#x27;m relaxed ( 7 weeks post) and my hair came out nice and soft after I washed and deep conditioned.  I can&#x27;t wait to see if my hair grows more after 60/90 days. I&#x27;ll updated again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update; 4/19/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stpopped using this becuase I just hated the very strong smell. I purchased wheat germ oil and mixed with a jar of JBCO ...these are the two main ingredients behind the red pimento.  I use it as a prepoo and my hair has thickened up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am using it for 3 week now and I notice big results into my  2nd week. I am also using the caribbean hair growth vitamins.</li>
            <li> Rotate this with my emu oil and can see improvement on my edges will continue to use and hopefully my edges will grow back</li>
            <li> I do not really like this product cause it started make my hair comes out more  than usual.My hair  is so soft but is was thinning out so I wanted something to work but this product was making it worst</li>
            <li> I want to give credit for seeing some hair growth improvement and say this is part of my solution, but can&#x27;t credit just this topical product for seeing benefits.  In addition to this topical product which I use liberally on my scalp before bed, I&#x27;m taking Andrew Lessman&#x27;s product&lt;br /&gt;Skin, Hair and Nails plus additional biotin. But I tried many different topical hair growth formulas and this one seemed to be the most effective. It&#x27;s only been a month but I do see new hair growth. I&#x27;m caucasian, female age 69.  My hair was thin on top of my scalp and looking&lt;br /&gt;better right now.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> Love this, have had problem with hair since Chemo, thanks to this product, it growing strong...</li>
            <li> Feels good but the smell is pretty bad!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this helps my hair grown, but it sure makes it silky and very, very shinny!!</li>
            <li> I have thick waist length hair. So when I read the reviews about this product could not wait to try. Finally did and I love it. It does exactly what the sellers said it would. I would definitely recommend this product and repurchase it again</li>
            <li> I love this for EVERYTHING!! Got burned, rubbed some on and it soothed the pain. Sore muscles, rub into sore area, instant relief. Plus for my super dry hair, this really gets the blood flowing and seals in my moisturizer. Great to use before steaming as well.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! and the way my scalp tingles in a refreshing cool (not burning) way.&lt;br /&gt;Since applying it to my hair each evening, I have noticed a significant reduction in hair loss when I shower and brush and there seems to be more baby hairs growing around my hair line. I have been rubbing it into my eyebrows and eyelashes and should have taken before and after photos as I am certain my eyebrows are filling in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been taking much more care of my hair of late such as using a cooler temperature to wash the hair, not rubbing it roughly with a towel to dry ( I dab it and then leave it in a towel for some time) and when I use a comb, I comb very gently and slowly from the ends up. It is like I have found a new love and respect for my hair and wish to take care of it as much as possible. I was often in a rush to get ready and would tear a brush through it (oh the shame!) to get the tangles out. Never again. I have just made an order of raw B vitamins and Biotin on Amazon, so hope that will help with further new growth and long term strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a lovely oil to use that is easy to shampoo out in the morning and gives a nice condition to the hair due to the natural oil. I love that all the ingredients are natural and there are no artificial perfumes. I enjoy using it so much that I am now oiling my hair every night! I don&#x27;t use a ton, but enough to get the scalp covered and to run the remainder through the ends. Hope you will enjoy using it as much as I am.</li>
            <li> I had long frizzy and almost damaged hair, after I had my son I was constantly losing my hair! I was in tears and so upset! I couldn&#x27;t take any vitamins since I was breastfeeding so I wanted something natural. I only used this 3 times and my hair completely stopped falling! Feels and looks so healthy, shinny and strong! It was so strong that I decided it was ready for some color so I dyed it and it looks awesome!</li>
            <li> this oil smell divine. My hair loves it, it is very moisturizing and healthy. I use it after i wash and deep condition my hair. I am transitioning and this oil help with detangling and breakage. I love it</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and much better than the expensive hot oil treatments you buy.  You will love it! It is not runny and it will do exactly what it says it will.  It will condition your scalp, strengthen your hair and your hair will be shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> this is a must if you want to see a different in the feel and texture of your hair love it now everyone in the house wants to use it</li>
            <li> i kinda like the smell. it smells like... sorrel. the drink. i think its working. ive been using it on my slightly receding hairline and... i believe that the hair is a bit thicker there. good product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was pretty quick, I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I noticed on the directions that you have to rinse it out and I have in braids .. I thought it was just a oil.. But I&#x27;ll see once I take my hair out... Has anyone used it without rinsing it out? I gave it a 5 star rating because of the ingredients that&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> You better have strong roots to withstand this growth oil.  It may be too strong for sensitive scalp, fine hair and edges.  I have used other Tropic Isle products with no problems.  This definitely was not forumlated for my hair texture.  Use sparingly if you dare!</li>
            <li> hahaha, i never read the direction of how it is to be applied, i just apply it in my hair and leave it in as a regular oil. i absolutely loveeee the smell of this oil. just in 3 months of going natural ( I cut all my hair in December) my hair is now shoulder length when i stretch it. i don&#x27;t know if it has to do with the Castro oil, the coconut oil or this red pimento oil that is making my hair grow at this fast rate, but i know for sure im keeping this three product in my hair regimen. i don&#x27;t wash it out and im not planing on doing so but i do add some to my deep conditioner right before i steam my hair. i would recommend for anyone who is trying to go natural to buy a steamer or at least get your hair steamed at a saloon once in a while, it will help with your hair growth.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is amazing.  I tell you that it really promotes hair growth.  I had been stressed and my hair began to shed a lot and fall out in areas.  So one day I took my professional clippers and shaved my head without a guard to the scalp.  Before I did my research about this product I was wearing a quick weave, however, I do not like weave, so I wore that style for to months but my hair grows pretty fast any way.  But this product gave my scalp a little bust and promoted my hair to grow longer than average growth per month.  I highly recommend this product and but mean while keep your hair moisturized.  Love it, and I do plan to purchase another 2 bottles of this product.</li>
            <li> Hydrates hair beautifully but the smell is annoying and nasty. It stays on hair and clothing. The product came quicker than expected which is great. Seeing results but not 100% please with products itself.</li>
            <li> This product really works! It grows and thickens the hair quickly.. This product provides a tingling sensation when heat Is applied, its nourishes the scalp...I&#x27;ve noticed a change for the better. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> idk if this really works I&#x27;ll keep but probably won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Great product!!  Does exactly what the label said it would do.  My beautician recommended this product and it works fine!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Not to heavy.  Nicely scented.</li>
            <li> The every best item for your hair, I love using it in my hair and how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Super product and looking forward to hearing about the super growth that will happen in Kenya. The ladies will be pleased I am sure. A friend of mines wife will be using this at her salon.</li>
            <li> Tingles good on scalp.  Used as part of a receipe for short natural hair that has been hard to grow.</li>
            <li> Not sure it helped growth, but it was a nice product that made my hair feel terrific.  A good price and amount.</li>
            <li> There is nothing special about this product. It just stinks. But a good mostirizer. I haven&#x27;t seen any hair change personally soo yea</li>
            <li> I am using the Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil mixed with the Jamaican Black Castor Oil as a scalp treatment 2x a week. I massage it on my scalp and in my hair in the morning and leave it in for about 30 minutes before co washing. I have been natural now for about 2 months and have an inch of new growth.  My hair is moisturized and very soft. As always a little goes a long way as it can weigh your hair down if you use too much. I experienced a slight tingling on the scalp the first few times I used it but not now. Also, I don&#x27;t find the smell offensive or strong as stated by other users.&lt;br /&gt;*** A word of caution I would not use this product on relaxed or textured hair. The pimento does not interact well with chemically treated hair.I did experience some breakge when I was transitioning to natural and was advised by my hair care specialist not to use the product until after I went completely natural. Good advice! Love the product for my natural hair and I will be a repeat buyer of the product line.</li>
            <li> I CAN ALREADY SEE  RESULTS WITH MY HAIR GROWTH  I HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WHICH CAUSED MY HAIR TO BREAK OUT I HAVE SEVERAL BALD SPOTS IN TBE TOP. IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER PRODUCTS THAT CAN HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM PLEASE HELP.</li>
            <li> It really is helping my hair grow and my friend i only being using it for a month now but will let you know in a couple of months if it is still working.</li>
            <li> With all the other Tropic Isle products I&#x27;m using, I could have done without this one or done without something else for this one. It straight up smells like pimento....if you&#x27;re familiar with that scent.</li>
            <li> Strong smell, I learned that I would not put it in my hair and leave the house...I could smell it all day.  Primarily use it for a hot oil treatment after coloring and washing my hair.  In 24 hours the smell is gone</li>
            <li> This product made my hair look and feel like it was just a big grease ball. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who are looking for regular use or if smells bother you.</li>
            <li> So far i have not seen a HUGE change in my edges but i do see it just a little bit. I will keep using though...sometimes i use it just to oil my hair and not wash it out... also still use it as a hot oil treatment whenever i do deep condition my hair but i am going to try other products from Jamaican oil company. Give it a try,things work different for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this once so I can&#x27;t say that it helped with hair growth, my hair is thin I purchased this and another product to use together but did not use it again because it took more time than i wanted to use. I will give both products another try.</li>
            <li> this is another great product for my natural hair regimen, still have over half a bottle left from over a month and I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was in a very bad motorcycle accident and his hair was falling out by the handful weeks later. He was really upset as he is only 36, the doctors said to expect it due to the stress and trauma his body went through...that didn&#x27;t make it any easier. With all the medication he was on I didn&#x27;t want to add another chemical to his body so through multiple legs of research I ordered this and his hair stopped falling out after a week of consistent use! He is was so excited that I bought him the shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed an increased thickness in my edges and hair overall. This product is a little thin (runny) for my taste, but effective nonetheless!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS FOR MY HAIR WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> Tropic strong roots red pimento hair- will , this product is what I used when I was having some problems with my hair during this past summer of 2014. I was a mess and I needed some help. I went on the inter net and did some research on about hair lost and about hair roots. And, also about psoriasis. This product helped me to get my hair  roots in control and I notice the change In my roots started to grow back because of the scalp problem.  My roots are stronger and hair started to grow again. Now, I do not know if this will help you but it did me. If you get this product applied this oil to the base of the hair roots and massage though out the hair line.</li>
            <li> used several months, no change. and it curdles after a few months.</li>
            <li> 5.0 out of 5 stars Quality Product, October 20, 2014  By dlam  Verified Purchase(What&#x27;s this?)  This review is from: Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil, 4 Ounce (Misc.)  I like it. My edges are filling back in nicely, my hair feels so strong and thick. No one can tell me this is not the real deal. I appreciate it when it cools down and gets thick!! That&#x27;s coconut oil all day! I love the smell,tingle and consistency of this product. It only takes a little to prep my scalp. I mix it with conditioner apply to my scalp sometime 2 times a day. I wrap my hair with plastic to encourage moisture and sleep and again in the morning before work without wrapping. Do a protective style and I&#x27;m good. I just started using it for my eyebrows and lashes in the evenings. I will update results in a few months. Happy growing all</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite product because it can be use daily on the hair and it does not leave a heavy build up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all, didn&#x27;t work for me, after reading other comments, I looked for tingling never happen, I guess I was looking for a miracle</li>
            <li> Good for scalp and body oil!</li>
            <li> I use it for my children.....I apply it while shampooing the hair. within a week I saw their hair growing. I saw length and fullness. I like it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product but only 4OUNCES for that much money, is killing my money in great size. I only use it for prepooing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;m seeing true results. I have been using it on my temple area and the area directly above my temples. Reason I&#x27;m using it there is because I constructed a wig and it had a lot of hair and it was pretty heavy. I felt it pulling but I didn&#x27;t pay it any mind. About 2 weeks later I noticed the wig clips pretty much pulled my hair out in those area. This Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil has already grown my hair in those bald spots!!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Megatek and MN7 Challenge BUT Tropic Isle products work the best. I now have a reg that I use with this product and I kid you not ladies, these products are necessary if your on that natural hair high like most of us black women. Please try these products ladies.&lt;br /&gt;*****************************************F.Y.I*************************************************&lt;br /&gt;If your looking to hair bra stap length hair and your hair grows slow and you ALREADY KNOW THIS; I&#x27;ve listed below a few things for you to do and try&lt;br /&gt;1.) Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil&lt;br /&gt;2.) Tropic Isle Jamacain Black Cast. Oil&lt;br /&gt;3.) Drinking LOTS of water&lt;br /&gt;4.) Megatek (You must combain this is oils and deep conditioners in basting bottle)&lt;br /&gt;5.) Multi-viatmins, B12 and Biotin (I&#x27;ll soon be trying Hairfinity but it&#x27;s not in my buget right now)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you all have any questions, please feel free to list them below and I&#x27;ll answer them in the same day.</li>
            <li> White male with semi long hair, was looking to find something that would thicken it without giving any more volume. And also hoped it would really make it grow faster. Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing that, but it&#x27;s definitely making it thicker and stronger. Will continue using either way.</li>
            <li> However you can make this product yourself for the overall price, Just get some black castor oil and add the pepper and there you have your own bottle. Also you can add coconut oil to it as well. I have used this product for about two weeks. I part my hair and oil my scalp with it. It will make your hair thick so there may be &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; growth results or &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; results. My hair is already thick and I am relaxed but are using this product for more growth along the way as I am stretching  relaxers for about 3 months and soon may be 4 months. I recommend getting two bottles if you are going to use it on a weekly basis so you can definitely tie this product to some length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Prevent dandruff and conditions scalp could be true.&lt;br /&gt;Adds volume to hair,definitely not,maybe thickens instead of adding volume unless you are natural and have hair that loves grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slows graying hair,I have a few gray strands and didn&#x27;t buy it for this purpose however gray hair is determine by the pigment of that hair shaft so don&#x27;t even think that would matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to love this product but the smell sucks. It is bearable and upon first use I definitely &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; an affect on my scalp but now seems as if my scalp is already use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think I need something a bit more potent and expensive for hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always when working towards hair growth it take work in the inside (biotin vitamins) and the outside hair growth aids such as this oil and other hair growing products. Before using this oil I used other oils as well and other hair growing products. But this product is worth a try if you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Since I have received this product, I have used it twice. Twice! I cannot believe how many compliments I have received on my hair. Just the simple, &#x27;your hair looks great&#x27;, or &#x27;I love your hair&#x27;. Really! You noticed? It&#x27;s obviously too soon to see any hair growth but just for the conditioning purposes at this point, it&#x27;s awesome. It&#x27;s gooey when you put it on, I don&#x27;t have a heat cap just a plastic bag and then a towel, but it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> There was no magic hair growth what are people talking about? It is oily but okay I gues best used for like a hot oil treatment weekly.</li>
            <li> I had hair loss around my temples and I think this oil helped it grow back in faster than it would have on it&#x27;s own. I was pretty much bald in two spots and I saw a difference within a couple of weeks of massaging the oil in those areas. I didnt however experience anything i would consider a major growth or length change and I did use it on my entire head.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with the JBCO. I&#x27;m currently in the process of repairing my damaged hair and scalp. I read plenty of solid, positive reviews of this product so I decided to give it a shot. So far, its good. I have no complaints. I guess time and regular use will tell just how effective this product really is</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s easy to use and does make my hair seem thicker when I use it. I won&#x27;t know for a while if I&#x27;m actually growing thicker hair but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This stuff works on my hair, because of the castor oil and castor oil makes your hair grow. Thanks, strong roots</li>
            <li> Good , but smells TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> I am still trailing the product, so I can&#x27;t give it five stars as of yet, but I am anticipating positive results.</li>
            <li> I really did not care for this product. It seem like it was working well the first day or two , and than i notice my hair was just coming out!  How i knew it was this product /because i put the product on three places on my head and my hair was falling out  on those spots. Will never /ever use again , i threw the bottle in the trash. SO BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THE TISRRP HAIR OIL, BUT DO TO THE BOTTLE BEING DAMAGED THE OIL SPILLED. I RETURNED IT FOR CREDIT.  I WAS ABLE TO BUY IT ATA STORE. NO I DO NOT LIKE IT MY HAIR IS VERY SHORT AND THIN. IT MADE MY HAIR VERY GREASY AND I DO NOT LIKE THE SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;SOME PRODUCTS ARE BETTER BOUGHT IN PERSON THAN ORDERED.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S A GOOD TO CHECK OUT STORES FIND IT AND CHECK IT OUT AND IF YOU LIKE IT.  ORDER FROM A COMPANY THAT YOU TRUST, BY ALL MEANS DO SO.</li>
            <li> I just received it 2 days ago so I won&#x27;t see results for a minute. I must say it have a slight smell to it but then I realized I should only put it on my hair the day before I wash it once a week.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS FOR MY HAIR ...</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT,IT WORKS WELL. HAIR STARTS TO GROW BACK AFTER ABOUT 3 USES. WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Love the smell it really did make  my hair  grow after all the bad decision I made for hairstyle.Marley twist just wasn&#x27;t  for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> To give a little background...I&#x27;m African-American and I have relaxed hair.  I use the Phytospecific relaxer and I relax every 3 months.  I only visit a salon for relaxer touchups and trims.  During my most recent visit to the salon, my stylist suggested that I incorporate more moisturizing products into my regimen.  My staple products are Phytospecific Intense Nutrition Shampoo, Aveda Damage Remedy Restructuring Shampoo, Phytospecific Intense Nutrition Mask (conditioner) or Phytospecific Vital Force Cream Bath (conditioner).  My stylist suggested that I try the Aveda Dry Remedy products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My normal routine included washing with both the Phytospecific and the Aveda shampoo&#x27;s mentioned above.  Then I would apply one of the Phytospecific conditioners mentioned above and sit under the hair dryer for about 20 minutes.  Rinse and style.  I achieved excellent results with this process.  However, I decided to incorporate a hot oil treatment and to try a more moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s my new routine...I purchased Pure Emu Oil, the Professional Salon Hair Steamer, and Tropic Isle Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil, and Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Treatment Mask (all from Amazon).  I apply the Emu Oil and Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil to my hair and scalp and then I sit under the Hair Steamer for 15-20 minutes.  I then wash with my Phytospecific and Aveda Shampoo.  Then I apply the Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Treatment Masque and sit under the Hair Steamer for another 20 minutes.  At this point, my hair feels really soft and full of moisturize.  I then rinse with cool water and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:  The results are still excellent, however, I did notice a difference in the level of moisture in my hair.  To style my hair, I blow-dried and applied a dime-size of Morrocan Oil and half of a dime-size of Emu Oil to my entire head (my hair reaches just below the top of my back) and I flat-ironed.  My hair was shiny, soft and full of body...definitely salon-quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Aveda Dry Remedy Moisturizing Masque, a hot oil treatment (Emu Oil makes my hair feel really soft) and a hair steamer!  I&#x27;m constantly receiving compliments on my hair!  I want my hair to always look like I just stepped out of the salon; however, I can&#x27;t afford to go to the salon every week, and with my hair regimen I don&#x27;t have to!  I wash my hair once a week and I achieve salon-quality results without the high prices.</li>
            <li> Not only have I seen improvement but I feel the blood rushing to my scalp when I have it under the heated cap. Its grown 11/2 in in two months and I have used everything I could get my hands on (my hair genetics are awful!!) and this really worked.. I just bought two more bottles for $15 on here because this 4oz bottle didn&#x27;t last me barely two months... just leave it on overnight and in the morning heat under a cap and wash out.. really amazing!! especially for my thin, wavy hair</li>
            <li> Yeah you read that right. I followed the directions. Left in 20 min with a cap, massaged my hair and rinsed. Apparently this stuff causes major shedding and hence my problem. It made so much of my hair shed that it matted badly and there were parts I couldn&#x27;t even comb. I actually scissored my way through my hair cutting at least 4 or 5 inches. It took 3 hours to get through it plus it felt hard. This has never happened to my hair and I&#x27;m highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> This oil has stopped a lot of my hair loss. It&#x27;s also great for messaging the scalp. I use it after every shampoo. I am a female but my boyfriend also uses it and it has helped with his hair loss too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issues I had were that It can be sticky and it geta waxy when it&#x27;s cold. Other than this, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> The seller did great with the purchasing and delivery. The problem for me is that the product should be an oil but is jelled up and hard and no instructions came with it.</li>
            <li> I used this for three weeks straight on my fading edges and then stopped using it daily. My hair, however, did not stop growing. When I had it relaxed, I noticed such fullness on my hairline that I was completely amazed! I&#x27;ve started using it on my daughter and her hair is growing like wildflowers. This is really good stuff. Just be sure to be consistent.</li>
            <li> I read that this oil was great for growing hair and for hair shedding.  I have not really noeticed any hair growth buet I can say that after the second use my hair did stop shedding and it has gotten a little thicker.  I have been using the oil everyday for almost a month now and will order so more once i finish the bottle.  EThe oil is not real heavy on the hair as you only need a small amout.  the smell isnt bad it actually kind of smell like a light lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I just received it today and I just would like to say that it&#x27;s not red it&#x27;s more like white and not liquids it&#x27;s thick in the bottle, kind of like petroleum jelly. It smells like mint and kind of pepper. I put a lot of it into my hair and it felt a little tingly and didn&#x27;t make my hair that greasy. I still have yet to give an update on the results. So far it seems pretty okay!!</li>
            <li> THIS ACTUALLY WORKS. You will feel a itchy sensation after you apply it, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s working. Appreciate that itch. If you&#x27;re missing edges, give it a month and you&#x27;ll have edges again. I kid you not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many oils before but none of them compared to this one. The first time I used this oil it made my hair soft. I don&#x27;t have that much breakage anymore and my hair seems to be getting thicker. I&#x27;m not too big on the smell of it but I can deal with it. I also love it because it stopped my scalp from itching so much. Haven&#x27;t had that much relief from any other products like I have from this hair growth oil. I definitely would buy this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> First of all i would like to say that i purchase this product with my own money and I love it.  this  product it leaves your hair feel very strong and I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Great great great oil. I ordered this based on a positive review. I love the smell; it&#x27;s not too strong. It will be a staple of mine for my edges as they are growing faster than I expected. I use this along with my sublime sulfur oil mix and it&#x27;s absolutely AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR BOTH NATURAL AND RELAXED HAIR. I NEED A REFIL LOL. I USE THE PRODUCT AFTER I WASH MY HAIR. I APPLY AROUND THE EDGES OF MY ENTIRE HEAD AND ON THE ENDS.</li>
            <li> It does a really good job</li>
            <li> This product has worked wonders for my hair. My hair is much healthier and stronger. I truly recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> DIDNT REALLY SEE A CHANGED IN MY HAIR DOESNT REALLY SEEM TO WORK FOR ME.. IDK MAYBE IT WILL WORK FOR YOU GUYS... WOULDNT PAY FOR THIS AGAIN..</li>
            <li> I like this product. I need to give it more time, but it did leave my scalp very itchy. Being a JBCO user this was not a surprise.</li>
            <li> A lot of these off the wall products never have results. They appeal to people because it&#x27;s a new approach. This happens to be a good one out of a normally bad bunch. Products like rogaine never come through but this oil seems to be doing the trick, at least in my results. I have a fuller, thicker head of hair than I&#x27;ve had since I was 25 years old which is stunning. The Tropic Isle Red Pimento is the only oil I&#x27;m comfortable applying to my scalp. It works from the nitty gritty to get things up and running in your hair follicles once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For even better chances of success, use a oral supplement such as biotin- [[ASIN:B00BYNGI5I Free Natrol Biotin - 10,000 mcg Tablets + Hair Growth Essentials - 60 capsules - Promotes Hair Growth, Healthy Skin, and Strong Nails]]. In conjunction with the oil, the biotin helps stimulate results faster and make the hair that is growing or has grown in much stronger.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had product long enough to give it a 5, but I do like it and really like the smell.</li>
            <li> While this product didn&#x27;t make my scalp tingle as I thought it would, using it on as an oil treatment prior to washing my braids left my scalp and hair well oiled, and my braid hair shiny.  I would use it on a regular basis with braids.  I&#x27;d have to use it another time to see how it functions on natural hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with item, is that I wish it came in a larger size. Great Product/Great Results.</li>
            <li> It was an easy process, high marks all around, highly recommend and will buy again... keep up the great work!</li>
            <li> I have celiacs disease and any and all hair/skin product will cause a full on allergic reaction instantly. This was horrific and made my hair fall out in chunks. There should be a warning on this bottle!</li>
            <li> I liked it a little. It gave alright results and the smell was overwhelming. It itch overwhelmingly. I never purchased it again.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMEND . THIS STUFF IS THE TRUTH. IT IS GROWING MY HAIR OUT FAST IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WILDGROWTH OIL AND STRAIGHT UP CASTOR OIL. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This product contains: Jamaican red pimento oil, Jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil, and wheat germ. The directions on the bottle state that you apply to your scalp and massage, then use with heat for 20 mins, wash and style. I applied it overnight and washed my hair in the morning. At first I was afraid the pimento oil might be a bit strong for my scalp and make it burn. It tingled a little but was not uncomfortable. Hopefully this will help my hair and dandruff.</li>
            <li> Helpful in making hair stronger..</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful and is doing its job.  This is a great addition to the other products from this compant I have tried.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product per the reviews. I hoped that I would have success in growing out my hairline and I must say after 3 weeks of use I can honestly say it works. I use the product every other day just on my hairline. I also mix this product with Jamaican black castor oil, tea tree oil and argon oil.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Great to stimulate hair growth!</li>
            <li> I for a long time have been dealing with extremely dry coarse hair! I got this product last month, and within the 1st week I noticed tiny little hairs standing up on the top of my head, it was new growth! Almost immediately! Now let me tell you about the softness I have now, amazing! It only takes a dot on the length of my hair to tame it and condition it! I had no idea it would be so easy to get the hair I&#x27;ve been wanting. I have decided to get this for my mother as a gift , she has been complaining about thinning hair,  I believe this will help her too. I will never not have this product , I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product, I not sure about hair growth but it feel great on my scalp, and I like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> The smell takes a little getting use to but fades quickly.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> first time using this Imixed it with my shae butter and just used as an oil for my scalp&lt;br /&gt; I plan on buying it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I was having severe problems with my scalp. I had changed my shampoo, conditioner, hair regimen, and hair gel. My scalped improved, but after several weeks it had not cleared up. I ordered this because I was so pleased with the protein treatment by the same brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This product did not do well as a leave-in for me. If I leave it in too long, it actually causes my scalp to itch (guessing that is the pimento in it).&lt;br /&gt;2. Smells a little like red pepper, so I let this sit on my scalp for about 10 to 20 minutes before I shampoo my hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. The applicator tip is very handy.</li>
            <li> Very good for the scalp and hair. Just a little on the scalp. You&#x27; ll see results after using regularly</li>
            <li> REALLY GOOD STUFF FOR YOUR HAIR  JUST DONT PUT A LOT OF IT IN YOUR HEAD BUT I WILL BUY TI AGAIN</li>
            <li> I love this!!! Really works</li>
            <li> Re-grew my edges in less than 2 weeks. I still apply it daily and brush it in. It doesn&#x27;t bother my skin either. Most hair oils give me breakouts but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old BF who has experienced hair loss since I was 39.  Ususally there is a cycle where it comes out in the top and grows back.  About 14 months ago, I exerienced massive hair loss -- the top completely, most of the front and some on both sides.  My hair looked like Bozo the Clown -- bald except for the sides and back.  I used many many products and had marginal success with Growganics and Hairfinity vitamins  among others.  In February 2014 i began using Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil.  The results have been astonishing.  I have hair covering my whole head  -- I see no bald spots when I look in the mirror from the front.  Hair is thinner on top still but this is great considering it had been bald like the palm of my hand.  I love the smell.  It is a bit greasy as I used it almost every day direcly on my scalp and leave it in..  My hair is short and chemical free so that is not a problem for me.  I recommend this to anyone who has hair loss. This is without question the fastest working and all around best hair growth product I have used. I have just purchased my seond bottle even though the first is more than half full.  I don&#x27;t plan on running out!!!!!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR A FEW WEEKS AND MY HAIR IS NOTICABLY THICKER. WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN. LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for someone else and I tried it on my hair.  I like it!</li>
            <li> Not any noticeable changes to the condition of my hair.  Does live up to the hype or all the gloating from other customers.</li>
            <li> this did not help me for my hair</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use this product as a prepoo once a week before washing my hair. it makes my hair soft anc clean scalp. thank you so much Amazon. ill be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> The product is ok , smells so good and for hot oil mascara work great&lt;br /&gt;but come spout for all over ... the product is ok but they need to improve the package</li>
            <li> You can tell the difference the first time that you use it.  It stimulates the scalp very well and after the first use it feels normal on the scalp.  It promotes hair growth and it is noticable after two or three weeks.</li>
            <li> This produce was received as described, Product received as described, great product, timely shipment.  Product works as described...great product!!!! Works as described.</li>
            <li> We tried this products along with black castor oil and it have did wonders for my hair. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I didnt really use it because I was experiences with something at the same time so choose not to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle  few years ago (this oil didn&#x27;t go rancid) but only started using the oil few months ago. It makes my hair soft &amp; manageable. I&#x27;ve also used it on my eye lashes which have gone from stubby to long and curly in the last month. This oil really soothes my eyes if I apply it before bedtime. I find this oil also works for knee &amp; stomach pains. The smell of the oil doesn&#x27;t bother me. Will definitely buy this again once I finish my current bottle of oil</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews however, I did not have any results with it and didn&#x27;t like the burning sensation after rubbing it in to my scalp. I also  misread the directions and reapplied it on my scalp after washing. But either way I was not that satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Love it and the smell. 💜💗❤ it very nice and helps me very very much.😘😘it&#x27;s my new favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Then this is it.  You can feel it in your scalp after a couple minutes and you can see the results within the first couple days of how your hair feels and less then 2 weeks to see some growth and shine.  This surprised me SO MUCH!  Happy I tried it and it&#x27;s my 3rd time buying it!</li>
            <li> It works, does what it says it will do for me! I use my oil and Dominican deep conditioners and loving the quick growth of my hair my scalp feel clean and nurtured</li>
            <li> Great product, reached on time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gloopy product. Still not sure whether I like it or not. Perseverance is possibly the key to this product...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this product did anything for me at all. I know a lot of people swear by it, so it&#x27;s worth trying, especially since it&#x27;s such a cheap price, but it didn&#x27;t slow down hair loss, help my hair to grow in, or make my hair grow longer. It doesn&#x27;t stimulate your scalp, or increase circulation, and the ingredients don&#x27;t block DHT or 5-alpha reductase, responsible for hair loss. I&#x27;m a white 36 year old with hair loss due to a hormonal imbalance. I tried this product out of desperation, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first the scent was so overpowering that it gagged me. I would advise using only a little for the first few nights, until you get used to the smell. It&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell by any means, it&#x27;s just very, very strong. After a few days, it didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the downsides for me was the consistency of the product. It has chunks of -something- in it, and that put me off a bit. The bottle says that allspice is the only herbs native to Jamaica. It made me wonder if there is a lot of hype surrounding it to bring revenue to a country with limited resources? But that is just speculation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say, if you are desperate like I was to stop your hair from falling out- give it a try! It&#x27;s cheap, and a lot of people swear by it. But if you&#x27;re reading this, please check out my other reviews to learn about things that have worked miracles for me. In particular, the high frequency generator I bought for $20 has produced an absolute miracle in only a few times of using it. My hair starting falling out 1/10th of what it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope some of my other reviews can guide you to things that have worked wonders for me. If you are woman losing her hair, ANY little thing that can bring hope is a blessing. Something that can produce results is a miracle. Pass on the blessing when you find yours!</li>
            <li> Love it! It really does work and does what it claims. Whether you leave it in or wash it out, it really is best to apply at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too bad, but strong.  It will vanish from hair by morning. Very good product for hair growth!</li>
            <li> So far so good I definitely feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> wonderful product I  will be ordering this product again great price.</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that show its potential from the first use. Just used it today and I already know its the real deal.. Haha the smell doesnt effect me at all.</li>
            <li> Did good for my temple hair growth</li>
            <li> Dont take it to the plane, after 9 hrs flight it became dense, so unfortunately I cannot use it anymore it doesn&#x27;t flow from the bottle.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing it reminds me of herbal tea and it&#x27;s so soothing and relaxing on my scalp. I will buy more of this.</li>
            <li> My growth is off the chain, Growing so rapidly. Be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> Smells very good stimulates hair growth a little tingling comes along with it guess that means it&#x27;s medicating scalp I would buy again</li>
            <li> It has a tingly sensation when you apply this to your scalp.  Makes your hair very soft and assist with breakage and mositure as well.  Will buy again.  This is a mixture of several oil in one.  Also has castor oil in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so so so loving this stuff...I will be very honest, I&#x27;ve been using this product for 1 month now &amp; I definitely see results!! I currently have individual braids &amp; I apply it to my edges at least 3 times a week mixed with Jamaican black castor/argon oil &amp; my hair is def sprouting around them edges (not saying it&#x27;s excessive-it&#x27;s not instantaneous) but working, I use on my 5 &amp; 10 yr old girls &amp; hubby notices the difference  as well</li>
            <li> This makes my scalp feel so good. I leave it in my hair while I sleep. You have to get used to the smell. its a little overwhelming. but all in all its a good product</li>
            <li> this oil is the best i have lots of new growth and thickness( more thickness than new growth). Its works wonders in just a short length of time i noticed improvement within 2 weeks. I used it on my scalp every other day and used as a hot oil treatment every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product yo help with hair growth and I came across this oil. I use red pimento hair growth oil twice a week on my edges, along with Jamaican black castor oil and my edges are starting to fill in. The bottle is small but a little bit goes a long way. It is definitely not cheap but worth trying. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, so what I do is use it as a hot oil treatment. And leave it in for about 20 min with a heating cap and then wash it out. I have been using it for two weeks now I haven&#x27;t seen know results yet. Maybe  it takes time see u soon in to weeks if I get some results.</li>
            <li> As stated in my title, I cannot attest to the value of this product as a growth aid. I do not use it as such and have not monitored any areas of my hair since using this. I will say, however, that this product gives my hair better results than any of the supposed best oils for hair shaft penetration (coconut, olive, avocado). I put this oil on my 3c/4a hair when it&#x27;s slightly damp and will cover my hair with a shower cap. Most times, I&#x27;ll sit under a heating cap. Sometimes, however, I&#x27;ll just leave my hair covered with a shower cap, hide the cap with a scarf and go about my day. Once I rinse the oil out, my hair is so soft and tangles literally fall out. I love this stuff and so does my hair. It keeps my hair soft, shiny and manageable and those are results that very few products give my hair.</li>
            <li> Good results...great scent also.He was happy with this product...made more growth.</li>
            <li> maybe i should give it more time but so far, i have been using it for maybe a little over a month and the difference is almost minimal. maybe i have stubborn hair i dont know. if it really worked wonders on someone please tell me how long it takes to really see the the difference otherwise am really starting to think it wont work.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. There is not one bad thing I have to say about it. I am natural and HAD a problem with my scalp being dry. For the record I style my hair with braids and twist for protective styling. I must say this is the only product that has worked for my dry, itchy, damaged scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am telling you ladies who are natural this stuff works and it does not make your hair heavy. I leave it in and it has sealed the frizz that I HAD. This is one thing you can not cheat your self on, invest and get it and you wont be sorry:)</li>
            <li> So far so good ! I just started using this product about 3 days ago I put all over my scalp and do a braid and cover with a shower cap for bed. It has a very strong smell to it but it&#x27;s bearable it actually smells good in a way but very strong. My hair feels thicker and a little stronger it&#x27;s still to early to see a difference. I will review the product again in a few weeks to see if I have any more results.</li>
            <li> Smell is not to bad but you can&#x27;t go out after using it.  Not sure if it really works.  Still waiting on that growth spurt....</li>
            <li> Very very gooey. Must massage in hair for awhile. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s made a difference in hair length, but it does require you to put heat on it while it&#x27;s in your hair. Heating cap is a must! It does makes you hair really soft after washing it out.</li>
            <li> very good product to help in the hair growing..it stimulates the hair roots</li>
            <li> Much much to say. It did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I recieved it and I like it because it makes my hair feel soft. I put it on right before I go to bed and then wash it out in the morning. My hair feels healthy and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Back story: I&#x27;m &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;, rather your typical American mutt. Irish, French, Spanish, and Native American. My hair has always been... Ethnic. It&#x27;s fine, wavy, and frizzy. When I was younger it was a lot thicker, but over the years and lots of straightening its now starting to thin. That&#x27;s how I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week but am on my third application already. I put it on about a half hour before I shampoo and massage it into my scalp extra well. Then apply it to my ends and comb it through. (It smells wonderful by the way, then again I&#x27;ve always been partial to the spice fragrance notes) I then shampoo with vitatress biotin shampoo and do not condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guess who has hair like silk now? My hair when letting it dry naturally forms the most picture perfect frizz tangle free waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give the product 5 stars but I haven&#x27;t read or experienced definitive hair regrowth yet.</li>
            <li> It hast been long enough for me yet, not consistently using it yet. Too hot. Will get back to you....</li>
            <li> Great product! Seeing results!</li>
            <li> It arrive half of bottle i was going to send it back just did not have the time</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff...not sure if it&#x27;s growing my hair or not but i love the smell and what it does to my hair when i apply it.  I steam my hair first...then i apply this to my scalp.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry and very corse hair this is for you. It will hydrate and your roots will feel very moisturised. So therefore your roots will become much stronger.</li>
            <li> This product is really good my hair is growing and its not to oily .. I will buy another bottle when the other 1 is finished :)</li>
            <li> Oils well and it doesn&#x27;t take much of it to achieve  moisture. The smell is undesirable but I like it so far. I would buy again.....</li>
            <li> My daughter lost her hair and started using this 6 weeks ago! Thank the Lord she has significant hair growth now!!!</li>
            <li> very pleased with the way it makes my hair looks and grows.</li>
            <li> Made my hair shed like crazy and then I noticed a lot of breakage. I believe I am protein sensitive and the oil just made it worse but after deep conditioning and conditioning my hair came back to normal. I like the smell but it can be too much if you use a lot. It smells kind of like cedar wood and spices. It does make my scalp feel a warm sort of sensation but nothing to noticeable. I only use this mixed in my hair grease now because its too strong on my scalp alone. It also came on time but the bottle was bent a little at the bottom.</li>
            <li> This product makes your scalp feel wonderful.  My hair has some length to it already so I am not sure if your hair will grow from its use.  However, your scalp will feel wonderful.  The Red Pimento stimulates your scalp.  The scent can be strong, but that does not bother me.</li>
            <li> This product has boost my confidence in hair growth,  I am eager to see new growth soon and very soon</li>
            <li> Very helpful. Will provide guaranteed results !</li>
            <li> i love this stuff better than the other brands. it really really works people so go out and order it. \&lt;br /&gt;the black castroil oil didnt do much for me.. but i am really in love wih this stuff. i wish they had a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This product works but is very heavy. Use as a deep conditioner and rinse hair afterwards. It weighed down my natural hair. I now use 100% Pure Argan Oil. Check my other reviews. This is okay, but the Argan oil works wonders.</li>
            <li> like the smell,  it is very think,  but I have not really used it much</li>
            <li> love this stuff.  Saw some reviews on this, so I thought Id try it and yeppers it works.  when combing hair, little to no breakage is in comb.</li>
            <li> Hmmm I used this directly on my thin/balding areas as a man and in 2 days after headaches all the baby hairs in that area had fallen out.  :-(  I was mad as hell and then I read the label and realized it was meant to be used pre-shampoo not left on all day.  That was my mistake, but the typing on the side of the bottle could be a bit bigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next time about a month later after the thinning hairs had grown back in some I used it before the shampoo and put the plastic cap on for 20 minutes and washed as normal.  Its a month later and my hair looks thicker in those thin places so I think it may be doing something now that I am using it correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a man, dont apply this as a oil and leave in for long periods or it will bald you.  make sure you wash it out.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell. I can tolerate tea tree oil better than this. In giving it one star because it came leaking out and spilled.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair after using this product. it also has a very strong smell so i would prefer applying it to your scalp at night so the smell can be lighter in the morning. Didn&#x27;t see any growth with this product. I applied it to my scalp every night I find that if im consistent with using my products i don&#x27;t get results i did exactly that and i didn&#x27;t see any results. I have nothing bad to say about this product and nothing good either. So i wont be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Well, I just picked up this product, so this is an initial review, but I can definitely feel the oil perking up my scalp when I apply it, and that&#x27;s a good thing. It seems to awaken the hair follicles. Strong tingling feeling, plus, you only need to leave it in for 20-60 minutes. A perfect product to use at night. The only thing is, I forgot to get a heating cap, but I&#x27;ll buy a hair dryer and use a winter beanie and it should work just the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you have thinning hair, this product should restore fullness. If you&#x27;re a chromedome (sorry fellas I know it&#x27;s an old bald joke), it probably won&#x27;t work for you. Hair that is long gone likely won&#x27;t come back, but if you&#x27;re just starting to lose your hair, get this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you should get a DHT blocker!!! (I use a natural remedy, Saw Palmetto, which is extremely effective), in combination with this. The more ways you take care of your hair, the better off it will be. It will want to stay on your head. Take a DHT blocker daily, make sure to get plenty of food, B vitamins, omega 3&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s, plenty of sleep on a consistent basis, and buy some shampoos and conditioners that have some tea tree oil as well as other remedies that are good for the hair, and let your hair air dry after a shower. Tackle hair thinning on all fronts, and you&#x27;ll see results. Most people use a hair regrowth formula and ignore the other important things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is already much thicker than it was about two weeks ago using these tactics, and before when I had about twenty hairs fall out in the shower on my hands, I see maybe 1-3 fall out at the max after a shower, and new hair comes in every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, this product is good for your hair, and if you don&#x27;t want to lose your hair, you should treat it like a king with a crown, because kings wear crowns on top of their heads. Lame joke, I know, but you&#x27;ll see results when you try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells to strong for my liking</li>
            <li> I am not sure of the hair growth potential of this product yet, as I do not use it faithfully twice a day. But when I do use it my scalp feels less itchy and it does not cause any product build up. I have natural hair so I tend to use this on my edges as well to help w/thinning edges. Again, I can&#x27;t say that this is helping to grow my edges back but I like it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this oil and received it in a very timely manner. I have only used it twice but was satisfied with the immediate results......less hair in tub after shampooing and a relaxed scalp. I only gave it 4 stars because it is a little early to see all the results that have been reported.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product actually grows hair because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see results. What I can say about it is that it smells totally fine (contrary to some other reviews I&#x27;ve read). I&#x27;m caucasian so I don&#x27;t think this product was meant for my texture of hair but I don&#x27;t mind. It definitely makes your root greasy when it&#x27;s on so I wouldn&#x27;t go out or anything but for at-home-use, totally fine. I&#x27;m also a hairsylist and what I will say is that healthy hair starts from the inside but putting moisture and vitamins on your roots isn&#x27;t a bad idea.  The concept makes sense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this product three stars because I have not noticed a change yet.  However, it is great to use as a daily scalp moisturizer, as my scalp is usually pretty dry.</li>
            <li> YES YES YES!!!! That is all I can say about this oil. I was skeptical about getting it at first coz everyone seemed to talk about how it had a strong smell and what not. Personally, I think the smell is ok, not too strong and not too light. It does fade away after a while though...well it did for me. So far my edges have come in strong and I have new growth in all areas of my head that I initially had issues with. Another thing I noticed which I found a bit strange was that regular JBCO made my hair itch like crazy after a few days of use, but since using the Pimento Oil, my scalp has not itched one bit and I mean not itched at all!!!!!!!!!! I usually apply it at night after my Just Natural Organinc leave in conditioner and the oil helps seal in the moisture. So far so good and I am super happy with this oil.</li>
            <li> It works far as keeping dandruff build up. But I just bought another bottle but the content of the oil is different than before.It even smells different. I DO SOME LITTLE HAIR GROWTH</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for stimulating your roots. You can feel the sensation. I need to use a little longer to see more results.</li>
            <li> This oil has been decent so far. It strengthened my hair a little bit, but if you&#x27;re like me and you want something that will fix a receding hairline, this might not be your answer. It also can get a bit annoying when squeezing the bottle and trying to get the oil to come out. I almost always end up having to take the cap off just to get the oil out.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this product my scalp feels alive. I would definitely recommend. I have to reorder. Sorry it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for hair growth, thickening and moisturing your hair. I purchased this product and after one week I started seeing results. I use this product as a deep conditioner and then rinse out because I am not fond of the smell but if you leave it in just use a moisturizer that smells better. I bought this product for my mom as well because I was so happy with the results and she tok loves it! She leaves the oil in she doesnt rinse out. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I heard it was a good product so i ordered it and it seems to work well...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for the past 2 months and I haven&#x27;t noticed it make any difference in the quality of my hair.  I have a few spots that seem to be a little on the thin side, so I thought I&#x27;d used this stuff and it hasn&#x27;t helped strengthen or regrow those areas at all.  So between the overwhelming smell (which isn&#x27;t bad but it lasts for hours) and the price, I won&#x27;t be buying this again.  Oh well, worth a try I guess.</li>
            <li> This is just one of the items I have in my hair growth arsenal. This really helped to grow my hair back in after I stupidly caused it to fall out</li>
            <li> Started noticing hair growth after 3 weeks of applying daily. I had a baby and my was falling out like crazy.  You could actually see bald spots in the front. This oil did fill out the bald spots but did not stop the hair loss. Mining my hair was still falling out I just had hair growing back. So for the hair loss I&#x27;m using Crec c max, that I also got in amazon and for hair re growth I&#x27;m using this oil. Love it</li>
            <li> I use Tropic Hair Growth directly on my scalp which grows my hair and keeps it healthy, I also mix it with Jamaican&lt;br /&gt;Black Castor Oil to thin out the Black castor Oil to put on my hair rather than my scalp which keeps my hair healthy and promotes hair growth.</li>
            <li> Love the way it stimulates my scalp but seen no differences in the length or thickness of my hair</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 bottles from Ameritex Linen and received 2 of 4 bottles leaking. I opened one and the product was dark in color and smelled like used motor oil. I notified Amazon and returned the product. I did inquire on the Tropical Isle website if there there was a change in their product but received no response. I have purchased this product from other Amazon contractors and have always been satisfied. I love this product so I plan to attempt a purchase from one of the contractors I have used in the past.</li>
