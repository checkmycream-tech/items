            <li> Kind of difficult to put the tools away and get them out</li>
            <li> I rated this a five star because it is sleek, sharp, and necessary for every human with nails.  </li>
            <li> Also, the case for everything arrived crushed and unusable.</li>
            <li> and some don&#x27;t seem as sharp as they should be.</li>
            <li> Sharp point</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of $12ish.</li>
            <li> The tweezers are so thin and frail that you can&#x27;t even pull a single hair out with them.</li>
            <li> This product completely failed to meet my expectations in every way possible.</li>
            <li> All of the cuticle pushers and other sharpened or blunt instruments were misshapen, deformed, or poorly tooled.</li>
            <li> The clipper are dull.</li>
            <li> The tools are dull and don&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> On every pair of clippers/snippers, the cutting edges were not alligned and had sharp jagged edges which will leave your nails in worse condition than when you started.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone that has tough nails like I do.</li>
            <li> Weird feeling.</li>
            <li> Just uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and it makes it dangerous to reach around your nails.</li>
            <li> Metal in clippers and nail file were junk nail file was crude.</li>
            <li> The scissor is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It leaves you with bloody fingers.</li>

            <li> I like the case and quality of the tools.  I would recommend these to anyone that has tough nails like I do.</li>
            <li> Kind of &amp;#34;chintzy&amp;#34; packaging, but the tools inside are of really quality materials!  If you need a heavy-duty clipper (scissors-style), this is a great kit...has everything you would need in it.</li>
            <li> Very Nice set,  seems to be good quality, large selection of tools in one case and nice carrying case....exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I wanted a complete set of tools, and this is it.  I haven&#x27;t used everything in it, yet, but I will.</li>
            <li> comes with the nice carrying case. all the gadgets do what they are intended to do, that is clip and snip</li>
            <li> Metal in clippers and nail file were junk nail file was crude. Nice looking not sharp tools. Would not recommend for use except as emergency tools.</li>
            <li> I got this because of its value and it serves as an extra kit to have when &amp;#34;yours doesn&#x27;t get returned in a timely manner&amp;#34;. :-)</li>
            <li> Every item is quality &amp; great!  Makes manicuring your own hands &amp; nails like a breeze.  Compact &amp; everything needed!</li>
            <li> I rated this a five star because it is sleek, sharp, and necessary for every human with nails.  You are encouraged to buy the product.  It was exactly as pictured and described by the distributor.</li>
            <li> Love love love this kit love to look and love the feel</li>
            <li> I amnot happy because the instruments are dull</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. The set is really cheap for a reason. The clipper are dull. The case doesn&#x27;t shut well. The tools are dull and don&#x27;t work well. The trimming tool cuts way to deep and jagged. It leaves you with bloody fingers. Pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Wow. This product completely failed to meet my expectations in every way possible. Every piece in the set is made with low grade steel. On every pair of clippers/snippers, the cutting edges were not alligned and had sharp jagged edges which will leave your nails in worse condition than when you started. All of the cuticle pushers and other sharpened or blunt instruments were misshapen, deformed, or poorly tooled. The cuticle clippers won&#x27;t even open and have jagged burrs sticking off the tip. The nail file does not work. You&#x27;d be better off dragging a spoon across the sidewalk and using that as a nail file. The tweezers are so thin and frail that you can&#x27;t even pull a single hair out with them. You can buy a 10X better pair at dollar tree. I know. I have around six pairs of tweezers from there. Also, the case for everything arrived crushed and unusable. In short, don&#x27;t buy this garbage. It&#x27;s a waste of $12ish. On the bright side though, the clippers have smiley faces on them! They get 1 star for that. (Albeit begrudgingly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, I forgot to mention. The good reviews of this product... Created by the seller to trick you into buying their stuff. Don&#x27;t believe me? At least at the time of my purchase, not one single good review was a \\&quot;verified amazon purchase\\&quot;! Which means, they didn&#x27;t even buy the product. I wish I had noticed that before I bought it.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it.. good at price</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Kind of difficult to put the tools away and get them out and some don&#x27;t seem as sharp as they should be. The case looks nice, but doesn&#x27;t always line up with the latch. It has several tools I don&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> The scissor is very disappointing. Sharp point and it makes it dangerous to reach around your nails. The nail clipper does its job but it is very &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; cut. Weird feeling. Don&#x27;t ask me to describe it. Just uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Dreamy House is on point, Great product, my wife loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much! I would recommend anyone to use Dreamy House</li>
