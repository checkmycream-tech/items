    <ol>
            <li>Nexxus has changed the formula of this formerly wonderful product.</li>
            <li>When I released the trigger, I had a PERFECT ringlet!!!</li>
            <li>GREAT!</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>Works perfect with my fine curly hair!!!!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent mousse.</li>
            <li>It smells good too!  </li>
            <li>Smells great, holds well, works as described.</li>
            <li>Have been using happily for years.  </li>
            <li>It works very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>this is a good moouse</li>
            <li>SUPER happy with this product!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>First off, this stuff smells GREAT!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>So far the product is great!</li>
            <li>at most I will use 4 (shampoo/conditioner/hairspray/mousse).</li>
            <li>Nexxus is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Most of the mousse products I have used have provided that body &amp; volume that I wanted, but some also made my hair feel sticky/crunchy.</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job for light firmness.</li>
            <li>Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair was quicker to curl and actually had MEGA curls for the VERY first time EVER!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I like hair gel better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for many years along with a gel.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite for my hair texture</li>
            <li>I decided to splurge, though, and i&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product washes out easily</li>
            <li>I used it for many years on my long hair with great</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s alcohol free, but it still contains stuff I was trying to avoid in my hair products.</li>
            <li>results- gave body and free flowing fullness with smooth manageability.</li>
            <li>The result is shiny, smooth, volumized hair that lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t tangle</li>
            <li>if you can find the good old nexxus mousse.</li>
            <li>Its very gentle on the hair and most of all, there are no parabens in the product.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased the travel size version of this to take on a vacation</li>
            <li>This mousse really helps reduce the static in my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Nexxus feels very light, well, really, you can&#x27;t feel it at all.</li>
            <li>This mousse is nothing special.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll last a good while.</li>
            <li>Until the old formula returns, I would not expect as many good results and good reviews unless you are lucky to get some of the last remaining stock of the old formula.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave hair \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and stiff, smells wonderful, provides smooth, shiny volume that lasts all day (even on super fine/thin hair like mine) and is useful to finish a straight style with to smooth any flyaways.</li>
            <li>The volume it gives is absolutely amazing, better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New formula is pinkish copper toned canister and top.</li>
            <li>Now, it didn&#x27;t last just ALL day, but it did for the most of it!</li>
            <li>For a product that works this well, though, for me it&#x27;s still worth using.</li>
            <li>P.S.- old formula had a grey top on a more gold toned canister.</li>
            <li>OK,  the curl stayed in big time!!!</li>
            <li>&amp; I liked it so much that I went back 2 days later and bought the full size</li>
            <li>and the can is large</li>
            <li>then this will not provide much hold.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to drop much $ on mousse or hairspray because those products, to me, are those that don&#x27;t vary too much from one brand to another.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This product provides body and helps keep a curl in my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>It dried really quickly in my hair!  </li>
            <li>New product creates a sticky and stiff feeling and reduces ability to run a brush smoothly through the hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve ever found a mousse that works as well as this one on my hair, so hard to find, but i love it.</li>
            <li>(Loreal Everstrong thickening tonic at the roots, Giovanni Direct Leave-in from mid-shaft to the ends, and One n Only argan oil serum at the very tips to seal off frizziness...</li>
            <li>It sorta felt like \\&quot;something\\&quot; was in it, but really not heavy at ALL.  </li>
            <li>I will report back later on this for a complete review!!!  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY mousse that has helped so far.</li>
            <li>The extra few dollars are worth it imo</li>
            <li>I prefer some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried better in the past, but for the price it added some extra volume.</li>
            <li>I then blowdry with a large tourlamine round brush and finish off by straightning just the few sections that didn&#x27;t straighten all the way and finish off with smoothing a TINY bit of this over the top of the hair to seal down flyways and manage frizz.</li>
            <li>I use mousse to provide volume &amp; body to my fine thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, but the little bit I do have is neat all day thanks to Nexxus...</li>

            <li> Does not leave your hair feeling hard, but offers lots of body.</li>
            <li> I use very little because I have short hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 4 other brands of mousse (Pantene, Dove, Herbal Essences, and Garnier).</li>

            <li> This product provides body and helps keep a curl in my fine, limp hair.  Hopefully this product will not be discontinued which seems to happen to products which work!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased the travel size version of this to take on a vacation &amp; I liked it so much that I went back 2 days later and bought the full size version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of my hair products serve a purpose, I don&#x27;t use a million things, at most I will use 4 (shampoo/conditioner/hairspray/mousse). I use mousse to provide volume &amp; body to my fine thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 4 other brands of mousse (Pantene, Dove, Herbal Essences, and Garnier). Nexxus is my favorite. Most of the mousse products I have used have provided that body &amp; volume that I wanted, but some also made my hair feel sticky/crunchy. Nexxus feels very light, well, really, you can&#x27;t feel it at all. The volume it gives is absolutely amazing, better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s alcohol free, but it still contains stuff I was trying to avoid in my hair products. For a product that works this well, though, for me it&#x27;s still worth using.</li>
            <li> Nexxus has changed the formula of this formerly wonderful product. It is not what it used to be. I used it for many years on my long hair with great results- gave body and free flowing fullness with smooth manageability. Not any more. New product creates a sticky and stiff feeling and reduces ability to run a brush smoothly through the hair. Check Nexxus website and read the 100% negative reviews of this formula change. Until the old formula returns, I would not expect as many good results and good reviews unless you are lucky to get some of the last remaining stock of the old formula. Very sorry to see old formula go. P.S.- old formula had a grey top on a more gold toned canister. New formula is pinkish copper toned canister and top. Good luck if you can find the good old nexxus mousse.</li>
            <li> This mousse is nothing special. It works, but there are products that work just as well for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> This mousse really helps reduce the static in my fine hair. Would definitely reccommend</li>
            <li> So far the product is great! Once you shake it, the foam appears.  I use very little because I have short hair.  The hair does not clump together.  It does a nice job for light firmness. Its very gentle on the hair and most of all, there are no parabens in the product.  It smells good too!  Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> WOW! I LOVE this product! Here is why:  My hair is VERY thin, VERY fine and VERY hard to curl much less KEEP the curl in!  First off, this stuff smells GREAT! I put a golf ball size amount, like the  directions say, in my hand and rubbed my hands together and then finger combed it through DRY hair.  It dried really quickly in my hair!  My hair did NOT feel sticky, or gooey, or greasy. It sorta felt like \\&quot;something\\&quot; was in it, but really not heavy at ALL.  Then, I used my Miracurl styler, also from Amazon. OMG! When I released the trigger, I had a PERFECT ringlet!!! AND in less time too!!! My hair was quicker to curl and actually had MEGA curls for the VERY first time EVER!!!!!! I can not sing the praises of this product enough!!! I did NOT use ANY hairspray, believe it or not! I am going to see how long the curls last with NO hairspray!!! I will report back later on this for a complete review!!!  OK,  the curl stayed in big time!!! I even got out in the wind for just a bit!!!  Now, it didn&#x27;t last just ALL day, but it did for the most of it! SUPER happy with this product! ALL this with NO HAIR  SPRAY what so ever! GREAT!</li>
            <li> this is a good moouse</li>
            <li> Great product!! Works perfect with my fine curly hair!!!! It does not make my hair feel heavy but gives the lift I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> I have thin and limp hair. This is the ONLY mousse that has helped so far. I love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve ever found a mousse that works as well as this one on my hair, so hard to find, but i love it. Does not leave your hair feeling hard, but offers lots of body.</li>
            <li> This is a product that I use every day to give my hair volume and style.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, but the little bit I do have is neat all day thanks to Nexxus...</li>
            <li> I like hair gel better. I feel like this creates a mess to try and get a decent amount the mousse in your hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 10.6oz bottle of the Nexxus mouse plus at $9.99.&lt;br /&gt;I received a 2oz bottle (travel size) which I could have purchased locally for under $3.00.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I find that the product is considered &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; and therefore non-returnable.&lt;br /&gt;This the first complaint I&#x27;ve ever had with Amazon, but it will definitely make me think twice about ordering anything in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for many years along with a gel.  My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it and I find that if I combine the two products they give my hair enough body do style as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;If you like to be that guy that runs his fingers through his hair to fix it, then you will like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will not feel gummy, gooey, and gross&lt;br /&gt;The product washes out easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair then this will not provide much hold.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer a mousse that hardens but can UN-harden when I put my hands through or use water to fix my hair.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite for my hair texture - I gave it to my daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li> Smells great, holds well, works as described. Have been using happily for years.  Would recommend this product for anyone looking for mousse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to drop much $ on mousse or hairspray because those products, to me, are those that don&#x27;t vary too much from one brand to another. I decided to splurge, though, and i&#x27;m glad I did. This is an excellent mousse. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and stiff, smells wonderful, provides smooth, shiny volume that lasts all day (even on super fine/thin hair like mine) and is useful to finish a straight style with to smooth any flyaways. I apply this to damp hair and comb thru after I put in my other leave-in products (Loreal Everstrong thickening tonic at the roots, Giovanni Direct Leave-in from mid-shaft to the ends, and One n Only argan oil serum at the very tips to seal off frizziness...I have thin wavy/curly caucasian hair that doesn&#x27;t like to stay straight and tangles and gets stringy when straight if you look at it). I then blowdry with a large tourlamine round brush and finish off by straightning just the few sections that didn&#x27;t straighten all the way and finish off with smoothing a TINY bit of this over the top of the hair to seal down flyways and manage frizz. The result is shiny, smooth, volumized hair that lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t tangle had I not used this in combo with the other products mentioned. The extra few dollars are worth it imo and the can is large and you don&#x27;t need to use tons, so it&#x27;ll last a good while. Just a few tips for you ladies who have difficult hair like mine :)</li>
            <li> The only mousse I&#x27;ll use in my long, curly hair.  Is light and doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;stickiness&amp;#34; behind.</li>
            <li> It works very nicely.  I just bought another.</li>
            <li> It worked well! I prefer some of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried better in the past, but for the price it added some extra volume. I felt like it took this product plus their gel and their hairspray to get it to work like it should!</li>
