            <li> so Iknow it will get dirty pretty soon.</li>
            <li> Iordered it just to hold a few makeup essentials for when I sleep out or to carry with me</li>

            <li> It is spacious for the look and seems durable but the material is slightly thin.</li>
            <li> Feels expensive.</li>

            <li> This is a cute well made bag. I use it to keep my stuff (mints, lip gloss, nursing pads, etc.) together in my diaper bag since my son can&#x27;t get into zippered bags yet. It looks exactly like the picture and the dimensions are accurate. Love it!</li>
