            <li>the best fragrance this side of Heaven</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched for frankincense and this is the best I&#x27;ve found!  </li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and house filling.</li>
            <li>Could be packaged in a prettier container, but still a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>but the fragrance is exquisite.</li>
            <li>This candle is great, it throws an excellent scent and is great for travel.</li>

            <li>These Zum candles are long-burning and have a great scent that lasts.  </li>

            <li>This candle smells great of course.</li>

            <li>A very strong, wonderful scent that burns cleanly.</li>
            <li>I do wish the container were a bit more attractive, but honestly that&#x27;s just me being picky.</li>
            <li>I love to find good soy candles because with the dwindling bee population I try not to buy bees wax candles anymore.  </li>
            <li>It also gives a touch of rose petal smell to it as well.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, but very, very strong.  </li>
            <li>but it was almost flowery and very strong.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is very strong.</li>
            <li>enjoy!</li>
            <li>The Franincense and Myrrh is my favorite Zum scent.  </li>
            <li>I have never payed more than $2.00 for a candle this size and I can&#x27;t for the life of me</li>
            <li>see any way to justify it being $16.00 or more</li>

            <li>I LOVE the smell of this...</li>
            <li>I love this candle.</li>

            <li>(different seller) Loved it!</li>
            <li>I love the rich smell when you enter the Church.</li>
            <li>Very Nice fragrance, long lasting and a very good price</li>
            <li>Sometimes when you buy a candle it really doesn&#x27;t smell up the room as advertised but this one does and burns nicely.</li>
            <li>frank and myrrh is a fabulous combination.</li>
            <li>One day I&#x27;ll light it.</li>
            <li>--I got the Zum Frankincense sample pack (available on amazon)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need to light it to have it permeate the air.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed the smell of frankincense and myrrh---it was different, but good.  </li>
            <li>It smells very good (subjective, right?) and seems to last.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect combination of complex ingredients.</li>
            <li>The seller got it here quickly.</li>
            <li>It burned for hours making our house smell amazing and when I blew it out it had barely made a dent in the candle.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Candle smells good but too expensive to not be able to use more of it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product in comparison to other scented candles I have tried before.</li>
            <li>This candle is done right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  My candle burned pretty fast and it won&#x27;t light anymore</li>
            <li>I love the little snippets of organic things on the top</li>
            <li>This has an amazingly strong fragrance for a natural product.</li>
            <li>I believe  the ingredients are first rate.  </li>
            <li>Frankincense is definitely a heady favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find a pretty bowl to put it</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase and just received my second order today!</li>
            <li>but when I got it it was damaged with a large dent.</li>
            <li>and I loved every single thing in it, especially the soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I like the scent a lot, but if it&#x27;s too much at times, the lid does keep it contained.</li>
            <li>the scent is too much.</li>
            <li>a very ancient scent by the way....</li>
            <li>Not sure about the little pieces of something on top of the candle,... guess that&#x27;s what helps make it smell good when mixed with the hot wax (</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anything by Zum.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for all natural candles that actually had a scent, so I was excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>Great candle not impressed with customer service!</li>
            <li>I got one as a Christmas gift and lit it in the kitchen for our New Years Party.  </li>
            <li>It has little dried flower pieces on top that melt into the wax making it very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I tend to be sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I dont know the slightest thing about candle making but for the price i paid for this little guy, I&#x27;d like the fast burning candle to smell like frank and myrrh</li>

            <li> I cannot give this as a gift because whoever packed it did a crummy job and put thick tape sloppily over the top, along the side and to the bottom.</li>

            <li> I payed extra money for packaging but when I got it it was damaged with a large dent. I would like payment for my (and my elderly mother&#x27;s) disappointment please.</li>
            <li> I have no issue with the candle itself, but it is not the candle I ordered. I emailed seller - no response. I got one last year at this time (different seller) Loved it! Great candle not impressed with customer service!</li>
            <li> The best smelling candle ever! Very slow burning. I got one as a Christmas gift and lit it in the kitchen for our New Years Party.  It burned for hours making our house smell amazing and when I blew it out it had barely made a dent in the candle.  I love to find good soy candles because with the dwindling bee population I try not to buy bees wax candles anymore.  enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m online to find other scents...this has a fragrant smell and seems to burn evenly.  I love the little snippets of organic things on the top (I don&#x27;t know what they are -- but they add to the smell, so they must be actual frankincense and myrrh...lol).  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> these candles smell wonderful</li>
            <li> It smells very good (subjective, right?) and seems to last. Recommended...</li>
            <li> Am always searching for frankincense and myrrh.  It&#x27;s a smell that when done right cleanses the room and amps the good vibes.  When it&#x27;s done wrong it smells fake and leaves a bad residue in the air.  This candle is done right.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> These Zum candles are long-burning and have a great scent that lasts.  Give off quite a bit of fragrance while burning unlike some candles that just sort of smell like burning wax when lit.  The Franincense and Myrrh is my favorite Zum scent.  I especially like the soap along with the candles.</li>
            <li> the best fragrance this side of Heaven</li>
            <li> Sometimes when you buy a candle it really doesn&#x27;t smell up the room as advertised but this one does and burns nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this candle as a gift for someone who had requested a Frankincense scented candle. I cannot give this as a gift because whoever packed it did a crummy job and put thick tape sloppily over the top, along the side and to the bottom. There was no way to take off the ugly tape without damaging the the candle on the top and side! If the person had taken a little more time and took CARE to wrap the tape around the lid area only, I would not be stuck with an expensive candle that looks like a dollar store reject. I also still have to go FIND a candle for this person&#x27;s gift! I cringed at the $16.00 price tag, but took the plunge since it was for a gift :/ I have never payed more than $2.00 for a candle this size and I can&#x27;t for the life of me see any way to justify it being $16.00 or more especially when they aren&#x27;t even going to be careful when packaging it!</li>
            <li> I guess I associate Frankencense with Mass. I love the rich smell when you enter the Church. I thought this would be a similar smell but it was almost flowery and very strong. I tend to be sensitive to smells so I couldn&#x27;t keep burning this.</li>
            <li> I love this candle. I&#x27;ve searched for frankincense and this is the best I&#x27;ve found!  Fragrance is very strong.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this...it literally makes me happy...however...i have tried everything to get it to burn evenly and it just won&#x27;t do it....so I&#x27;m either going to have wasted wax or I&#x27;m going to have to make a candle out of the leftovers.</li>
            <li> This candle smells great of course. frank and myrrh is a fabulous combination. hard to screw it up. BUT when lighting this candle, you smell the frank and myrrh, then it seems like an unscented candle for the next five minutes, AND THEN you get the frank and myrrh back. It seems as if the oils used to perfume the candle didnt mix well with the soy was..?? i have no idea. I dont know the slightest thing about candle making but for the price i paid for this little guy, I&#x27;d like the fast burning candle to smell like frank and myrrh the entirety of it&#x27;s lit life.</li>
            <li> Actually, I haven&#x27;t burned it yet! It&#x27;s sitting in my bathroom sheerly for the heavenly fragrance emanating from it. One day I&#x27;ll light it.</li>
            <li> Very Nice fragrance, long lasting and a very good price</li>
            <li> I love this candle. The scent is wonderful and house filling. The seller got it here quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells so yummy! I just love it.</li>
            <li> This candle is great, it throws an excellent scent and is great for travel. Although not large it fills my room with it&#x27;s perfect combination of complex ingredients. I love all the zum products. The scent is just perfection in a great tin with top that allows for useage anywhere with convenience. It is a great addition to zum soap &amp; lotion. I believe  the ingredients are first rate.  I use the Zum laundry too.</li>
            <li> This is a good product in comparison to other scented candles I have tried before. The smell of myrrh and frankincense is subtle and creates a calming ambiance. It also gives a touch of rose petal smell to it as well. Overall a good purchase and just received my second order today!</li>
            <li> I HAVE NOT USE IT YET. BUT IT SMELLS GREAT.</li>
            <li> Received my ZUM GLOW Frankincense and Myrrrh candle today.  It smells really good.  Not sure about the little pieces of something on top of the candle,... guess that&#x27;s what helps make it smell good when mixed with the hot wax (soy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  My candle burned pretty fast and it won&#x27;t light anymore but there is a lot of wasted candle on the sides.  Candle smells good but too expensive to not be able to use more of it.  They need to make them deeper.</li>
            <li> This candle smells wonderous! Frankincense is definitely a heady favorite. I do wish the container were a bit more attractive, but honestly that&#x27;s just me being picky. I&#x27;ll find a pretty bowl to put it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way--I got the Zum Frankincense sample pack (available on amazon) and I loved every single thing in it, especially the soap. I highly recommend anything by Zum. It&#x27;s a good company with quality stuff.</li>
            <li> This has an amazingly strong fragrance for a natural product. I like the scent a lot, but if it&#x27;s too much at times, the lid does keep it contained.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I am a fan of all ZUM products.  I had been looking for all natural candles that actually had a scent, so I was excited to try this.  I enjoyed the smell of frankincense and myrrh---it was different, but good.  Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> A very strong, wonderful scent that burns cleanly. Could be packaged in a prettier container, but still a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Expensive but the fragrance is exquisite.</li>
            <li> Good quality candle.  It has little dried flower pieces on top that melt into the wax making it very pretty.  The fragrance is nice, but very, very strong.  You don&#x27;t even need to light it to have it permeate the air.  When it is lit, I can only keep it burning for a short time otherwise the scent is too much.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CANDLE Purchased for a present opened the box and the aroma was so incredible that i purchased three more</li>
            <li> If you love Frankincense and Myrrh....a very ancient scent by the way....this is THE bomb!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of frankincense and this candle does not disappoint. The smell lingers and the candle is fragrant without being lit, with just the cover off.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Frankincense and Myrrh candle, but what I received was Frankincense and Lavender (which is a terrible combination, by the way-- it smells awful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> This product is advertised as 100% essential oil.  When I opened the lid it smelled nothing like frankincense or myrrh.  I turned it over to see the words \\&quot;fragrance oil\\&quot;.  This means they are using toxic fragrance oils and erroneously marketing their product as natural.</li>
