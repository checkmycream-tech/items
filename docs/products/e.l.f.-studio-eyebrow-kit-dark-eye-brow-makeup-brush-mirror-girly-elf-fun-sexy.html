            <li>its amazing on my eyebrows</li>
            <li>IT FILLS YOUR BROWS PERFECTLY TO THE POINT ITS VERY NATUR AS L LOOKING.</li>
            <li>Was shipped quickly &amp; works great .</li>
            <li>This product looks very beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li>I have very fine eyebrows, at 47 they don&#x27;t grow in the way they used to.  </li>
            <li>Love the color but it smudges very easily.</li>
            <li>Love this eyebrow kit...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a eyebrow product that worked for me again.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow kit.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a wax-based product and a powder.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I need some more practice because you are using a brush not a liner.  </li>
            <li>Delivered fast but the product itself is not that great</li>
            <li>It is so much better than using a pencil to fill in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s certainly better ones.</li>
            <li>After, it lookedlike it was freshly done!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend the anastacia brow kit because it is more accurate regarding matching colors of the brows.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>It is easy to wash off or edit but stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and it fits my eyebrow shade perfect making it just a smidge darker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked E.L.F products, I&#x27;ve bought so many and they come out better than expensive products, the brow kit is awesome compared to the prestige one I bought, the elf one blends well without leaving powder all over like the prestige</li>
            <li>I loved the old product that was just pigmented wax to define my eyebrows and fill in sparse areas.</li>
            <li>I rarely use the lighter brown powder but the dark brown gel is excellent</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s super easy to apply on and if you&#x27;re always on the move</li>
            <li>I need to practice with it a bit more as I over did it with the powder the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>does, when I use it I have to clean up all over my face because of the powder</li>
            <li>First ELF is awesome, not only are their products affordable, but they work really well.</li>
            <li>Great eyebrow kit I also got in faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>In general it is nice but it just didnt fit my brow color.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this set is its price.</li>
            <li>The kit itself is cool</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to build-up your make-up and make-up tool&#x27;s, use ELF, they are just full of quality make-up brushes, blushers, mascara, and zit zapper, which works like a charm.</li>
            <li>thanks for an awesome product E.L.F, low budgeted girls like me appreciated.</li>
            <li>color was perfect on my African American brown brows...</li>
            <li>it works better then some high end products.</li>
            <li>the powder makes your brows look more natural after using the gel, and it stays on all day!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, however, I am finding it hard to get it</li>
            <li>Worth the $6 something I paid for it.</li>
            <li>but honestly it&#x27;s not the absolute best one out there</li>
            <li>is so much more natural looking.  </li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>color has very strong red undertones and will look unnatural almost on everyone.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural, it&#x27;s also feasible and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The color works great on my brown , african american complexion.</li>
            <li>I have very dark ash toned brown hair and fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this, must use a light hand or it will turn up too dark.</li>
            <li>Definitely gonna purchase again :)</li>
            <li>Will order more in future.</li>
            <li>Guess how much the BeneFit product is!?  </li>
            <li>The outcome color is exactly what i need to my brows.</li>
            <li>I have brown almost black hair and the dark is perfect.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s too light on my eyebrows and is obvious</li>
            <li>It works as well as my pencil and with the powder it really fills the eyebrow in fully.</li>
            <li>Really like this eyebrow kit</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m better off with a regular angled brush for $1 and dark brown eye-shadow, gives a more natural looking coloration.</li>
            <li>I have dark brows and the was pleased that the color worked well.</li>
            <li>I love that there are different colors because all eyebrows are not created equally.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised that there was no brush!!</li>
            <li>The product is great just a little too dark for me.</li>
            <li>this is a great match for my very dark brown/nearly black eyebrows to fill in gaps</li>
            <li>I use the gel to fill and set my brows and it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Looks REALLY natural and stays in place all day!</li>
            <li>If used properly it looks very realistic.</li>
            <li>This helps fill in the spots that are a little light  and also helps shape my brows.</li>
            <li>The consistency is creamy and sometimes glues my eyebrow hair together, the little light brown powder broke</li>
            <li>I find the powder to be a little too light for my hair color, so I use that side for powder liner, but never on my brows.  </li>
            <li>do wish that the angled brush for the wax/gel was a bit stiffer, but I can always use my old brush from Benefit instead.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and stays all day</li>
            <li>This is a must have for any young lady who want to enhance their eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The wax/gel part provides a little less coverage and hold than my old eyebrow product, but it is good enough to use alone if I want to.</li>

            <li> Also included is a double-ended applicater with a small stiff brush on one end for the gel and a softer, larger-bristled brush on the other for the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Read my full review on Jennbizzle.com:[...]</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Used to only use Smashbox and now have become addicted to this.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The wax is hard to apply and uneven.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to fill in without going overboard and ELF did just that...</li>
            <li> I have always used pencils in the past and this look with the gel and brush</li>
            <li> Brush is small and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> The brush it brings was not good at all.</li>
            <li> The powder was completely broken up and destroyed when I received this.</li>
            <li> Brush is very small and somewhat difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> but it was useless anyways.</li>
            <li> Made it very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> The brushes are awful.</li>
            <li> That is completely insane and I will never buy anything else.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this eyebrow kit... Great addition to my morning make up routine...Just wanted to fill in without going overboard and ELF did just that...color was perfect on my African American brown brows...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT. IT FILLS YOUR BROWS PERFECTLY TO THE POINT ITS VERY NATUR AS L LOOKING. I&#x27;M HOOKED.</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow kit I also got in faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> The product it is nice but not the best.I would recommend the anastacia brow kit because it is more accurate regarding matching colors of the brows.In general it is nice but it just didnt fit my brow color.I am dark blonde.</li>
            <li> I got on the Browzing wagon in 2002. I loved the old product that was just pigmented wax to define my eyebrows and fill in sparse areas. When Benefit stopped making the wax only version of their eyebrow product I was concerned that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find a eyebrow product that worked for me again. I have been afraid to spend the money on their new 2 step product, so I tried e.l.f.&#x27;s similar lower cost product instead. The wax/gel part provides a little less coverage and hold than my old eyebrow product, but it is good enough to use alone if I want to. I was concerned that the powder would be too light and that I wouldn&#x27;t end up using it; however, it works wonderfully as a filler for sparse spots. I need to practice with it a bit more as I over did it with the powder the first time.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that the angled brush for the wax/gel was a bit stiffer, but I can always use my old brush from Benefit instead.</li>
            <li> Love this, must use a light hand or it will turn up too dark. If used properly it looks very realistic.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have dark brown hair and it fits my eyebrow shade perfect making it just a smidge darker. This helps fill in the spots that are a little light  and also helps shape my brows.I will be purchasing this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this set is its price. I won&#x27;t be crying for too long about thrown away money.&lt;br /&gt;Its color has very strong red undertones and will look unnatural almost on everyone. The wax is hard to apply and uneven. The powder crumbles and sets everywhere under your brow except on the brow. The brushes are awful.</li>
            <li> Great stuff perfect dupe for benefit brow zings. Definitely gonna purchase again :) it works better then some high end products.</li>
            <li> The color works great on my brown , african american complexion. Will order more in future. I am done with pencils.</li>
            <li> I buy this product now instead of BrowZings by BeneFit.  It is just as good and it is $3.00.  Guess how much the BeneFit product is!?  It is $30.00!  That is completely insane and I will never buy anything else.  I have brown almost black hair and the dark is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow kit. I love that it comes with a wax-based product and a powder. I love that there are different colors because all eyebrows are not created equally. Read my full review on Jennbizzle.com:[...]</li>
            <li> Works great. Brush is small and hard to work with. I so prefer the gel over the powder --it&#x27;s too light on my eyebrows and is obvious</li>
            <li> Love the color but it smudges very easily. Worth the $6 something I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t convenient to use. Made it very difficult to apply. In addition, the gel didn&#x27;t apply well. Tried to apply it thicker but it wouldn&#x27;t stay on. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. the powder makes your brows look more natural after using the gel, and it stays on all day! definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I had no idea the brown color was gel alike. The brush it brings was not good at all. Great product though..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t k now how to use it. But the colors are on point. The kit itself is cool just wish I knew how to use it</li>
            <li> The product is great just a little too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I rarely use the lighter brown powder but the dark brown gel is excellent</li>
            <li> I loved this product ! Was shipped quickly &amp; works great . Looks amazing ! Plus they send you a little thank you card with the package (: definitely will be ordering from here again ! Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it... Get the work done. Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I like it. It looks very natural, it&#x27;s also feasible and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have very fine eyebrows, at 47 they don&#x27;t grow in the way they used to.  This is a very good product, however, I am finding it hard to get it just right.  I need some more practice because you are using a brush not a liner.  Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast but the product itself is not that great</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this.  It is so much better than using a pencil to fill in my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Looks REALLY natural and stays in place all day! Love it!</li>
            <li> Used to only use Smashbox and now have become addicted to this. perfect filler for brows. Looks natural and stays all day</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and matches perfectly.  It does not have a red or gray tint when applied.</li>
            <li> This product I received didn&#x27;t come with an applicator brush. I had to go out and buy a pack separately.</li>
            <li> The powder was completely broken up and destroyed when I received this. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Perfect item!&lt;br /&gt;I makes my eyebrows look thicker. I don&#x27;t wear make-up often, but this is my go to eyebrow kit when I want to spice things up.</li>
            <li> First ELF is awesome, not only are their products affordable, but they work really well. I use this to fill in my brows and they look more natural as opposed to harsh and fake.  If you are looking to build-up your make-up and make-up tool&#x27;s, use ELF, they are just full of quality make-up brushes, blushers, mascara, and zit zapper, which works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much good one nice to work with helpful cooperative good material I like it I appreciate it</li>
            <li> It works as well as my pencil and with the powder it really fills the eyebrow in fully. I have dark brows and the was pleased that the color worked well. I did find I needed to still use my brow brush as a finishing step.</li>
            <li> I love this product...its amazing on my eyebrows and I get compliments always. This product looks very beautiful and natural. This is a must have for any young lady who want to enhance their eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked E.L.F products, I&#x27;ve bought so many and they come out better than expensive products, the brow kit is awesome compared to the prestige one I bought, the elf one blends well without leaving powder all over like the prestige does, when I use it I have to clean up all over my face because of the powder leftover(prestige one)...thanks for an awesome product E.L.F, low budgeted girls like me appreciated.</li>
            <li> this is a great match for my very dark brown/nearly black eyebrows to fill in gaps</li>
            <li> I have received mine today the package was very good but I was surprised that there was no brush!!</li>
            <li> Great tool for beginners who are learning how to fill in their eyebrows for a fuller appearance! I love it it&#x27;s easy to use and it is just as picture is shown, I get compliments from men and women on my eyebrows</li>
            <li> The outcome color is exactly what i need to my brows.</li>
            <li> Packaging was perfect! Applied it to eyebrows that was trimmed for a week. After, it lookedlike it was freshly done!! Can&#x27;t wait to use again.</li>
            <li> Really like this eyebrow kit but honestly it&#x27;s not the absolute best one out there, there&#x27;s certainly better ones. However, it&#x27;s super easy to apply on and if you&#x27;re always on the move and you just want your eyebrows to look semi-perfect... then this eyebrow kit would be the one that you would want to look into.</li>
            <li> I love it came before time nd fits my complexion PERFECTLY !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I&#x27;ve been using it for over two months but I would not repurchase it. The consistency is creamy and sometimes glues my eyebrow hair together, the little light brown powder broke but it was useless anyways. Brush is very small and somewhat difficult to work with. I think I&#x27;m better off with a regular angled brush for $1 and dark brown eye-shadow, gives a more natural looking coloration.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I use this product every day! It&#x27;s the only brow kit I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have very dark ash toned brown hair and fair skin.  I use the gel to fill and set my brows and it looks very natural.  I find the powder to be a little too light for my hair color, so I use that side for powder liner, but never on my brows.  I have always used pencils in the past and this look with the gel and brush is so much more natural looking.  It can be tricky for me to find a good brow product with the combination of fair skin and almost-black hair, but I feel this does a really nice job.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It comes with a dark gel to shape and lighter powder to set.  Also included is a double-ended applicater with a small stiff brush on one end for the gel and a softer, larger-bristled brush on the other for the powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can manage the intensity with the amount of gel you choose to use. It is easy to wash off or edit but stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will be happy!</li>
