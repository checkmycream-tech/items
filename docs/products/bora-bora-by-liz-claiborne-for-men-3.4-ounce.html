            <li>This is a great product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>very light, &amp;#34;up-in-the-air&amp;#34; spritz recommended.</li>

            <li>Love this smell.</li>
            <li>Smell is refreshing and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li>but look like Liz Claiborne has downgraded strength so they can sell more.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this cologne and i love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>

            <li>glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li>Bora Bora has been my signature scent for many years.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten as many compliments about the way I smell as I do when wearing this cologne.</li>

            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>bought this for my husband its his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance...</li>
            <li>Curve Appeal and Curve Crush are better choices.</li>
            <li>I buy this for my boyfriend because I love how he smells when wearing this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of an aggressive \\&quot;going</li>
            <li>you like more of the Brut or Stetson Sierra stuff</li>
            <li>Used to be able to find easily in stores like TJ Maxx but not any more.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing lasts all day great buy definitely gonna order more when I run out</li>
            <li>and I was so happy to be able to find it at such an amazing price.</li>
            <li>and it had pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is a good daily cologne.  </li>
            <li>BOX IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM ORIGINAL BUT SMELLS GREAT!</li>
            <li>Just a cheap knock-off but ok for the price.</li>
            <li>Great long the smell, the taste of unprecedented nature.</li>
            <li>Bora Bora sounded exotic and it was cheap</li>
            <li>Bora Bora is a wonderful scent that is a little spicy, but with many hints of citrus.  </li>
            <li>I brought this after I had great experience of same product I brought 7 years ago, but this product does not smell as strong as it used to, and it is not holding fragrance for more than 15 minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My order came very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very mild maybe I am not spot on about the garden.</li>
            <li>Way to strong.</li>
            <li>nice, clean and fresh</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>the try small investment for a great product smells good</li>
            <li>That is huge in \\&quot;my book\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>and I was worried that I might be getting a cheap knock off -</li>
            <li>This fabulously smelling man is off the market.</li>
            <li>It is under-rated in the cologne arena, a great value, and I definitely recommend adding it to your collection.</li>
            <li>but i would still smell fantastic</li>
            <li>Most people commented on how fresh it smelled.  </li>
            <li>The Bottle I received was Genuine, I went online to Cosmetic check.com</li>
            <li>cheap smell, Dont buy.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend didnt like it and told me it was a cheap cologn.</li>
            <li>The transaction went as smooth as could be..</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good, pretty cheap as well.</li>
            <li>so I could get the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>You have created a great photo of the product and it was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>Smells great and hard to find In Stores and more so happy I found it and at such a great price Definetly will buy more after looking in several stores</li>
            <li>Great price, long lasting with great comments no matter where I choose to wear it.</li>
            <li>While definitely unique, it is comparable or a mix between Diesel (Original - Fuel for Life..) and Versace Pour</li>
            <li>Very,Very Fresh Fragrance,but still manly type cologne!.</li>
            <li>so he was really excited when I gave it to him as a gift.</li>
            <li>I bought women&#x27;s version first,  wasn&#x27;t as satisfied,  </li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>And so far this is my very favorite.</li>
            <li>Clean smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>It starts of with notes of citrus and finishes off with the clean you shaved type smell.</li>
            <li>Clean, soapy, uncluttered.</li>
            <li>I loved it, genius smells great an last long</li>
            <li>About $20 on sale can&#x27;t be beat by many other good colognes.  </li>
            <li>Very good worth the money,delivery was very fast, smell lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Not to strong not to weak just perfect.</li>
            <li>Comes in a cool bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a real bargain for an exotic smelling cologne for men.</li>
            <li>Smells good but is don&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good value.</li>
            <li>It last a good while so two sprays is my recommendation.</li>
            <li>, we could not find it at such a good price anywhere else (if we could find it at all).  </li>
            <li>got it for my boyfriend he used to use it when he was younger he loved it</li>
            <li>Not too sweet and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>i could still the sweet smell</li>
            <li>Always nice fragrance, soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>Most people have told me that they like it but might be too strong for people with sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty strong too, I spray two shots on my skin</li>
            <li>Strong scent at first (not overly musky) but</li>
            <li>turns into a clean fresh scent that will last a good part of the day.  </li>
            <li>Its a clean fresh smell</li>
            <li>Bora is a clean and fresh fragrance with a mild spice undertone.  </li>
            <li>Such a delight to find a product, at a terrific price, and receive great service!  </li>
            <li>The real one can be sprayed in the morning and go all day smelling great and still smell it the next day on your clothes.</li>
            <li>There is simply no other cologne that attracts the women liked this one.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t going to turn heads, it&#x27;s just a light, average, but pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Not very fruity or musky, just a pleasant, clean, fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>I just received my new scent today (Villian) and hope it lives up to its expectation better than this one did.</li>
            <li>The spay smells good but it doesn&#x27;t hold very long.</li>
            <li>Being a musician it really helps to have a cool scent on a smooth jazz set.</li>
            <li>reviews generally consider the following areas: price/value, appeal/smell, \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), longevity, uniqueness, best time of year worn or occasion, and easy on the nose (and bottle on the eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its not too strong where everyone in a room knows your smelling it but enough to where if you give a girl a hug they will smell it and love it.</li>
            <li>This is a crisp clean smell that is not over powering.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like a cheap air freshener or crappy aftershave, and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a fresh and alluring scent</li>
            <li>it was because of the price I figured it was worth</li>
            <li>Nice enough scent but not at all long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>I made him promise that if any other women swarm him because of how great he smells, he has to be sure to tell them his future wife gave it to him (smile).  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a good value when purchased from Amazon and worth the money spent!</li>
            <li>The cologne was stored in the right temperature because it didn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;aged&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice...kinda sweet cologne.</li>
            <li>I think it has been discontinued &amp; was surprised to find it on Amazon &amp; at such a good price.</li>
            <li>i was happy to find this online, this is the cologne my husband wears and in town i have found it in only one place, next time</li>
            <li>it goes away super fast even after like 10 sprays I get an hour iff</li>
            <li>It does take several additional sprays versus that of what I was used to (mostly Armani).  </li>
            <li>This cologne is unbelievable, I stumbled upon it several years ago and was immediately impressed.</li>
            <li>Arrived as advertised, thanks!</li>
            <li>First of all let me say I take responsibility for buying a cologne from Amazon without smelling it first.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Its similar to Coolwater but better.</li>
            <li>this is my first time trying Bora Bora..</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the pricing I only paid 1/3 what I would&#x27;ve paid in a local store:-)</li>
            <li>When I first met him</li>
            <li>I love smelling this on my fianc&amp;eacute; this is the only cologne that he will wear</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like it, but it grew on me quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic and I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is somewhat exotic - maybe slightly spicy.</li>
            <li>It has a well balanced scent with sweet and bitter fragrance that makes it more masculine than a scent that is too sweet.</li>
            <li>This product cologne is pretty good especially for just running daily errands.</li>
            <li>It does take a lot of spray&#x27;s and if you spray it on your body before you put on your undershirt, it will actually last much longer (or at least that&#x27;s what I found that works best).  </li>
            <li>Okay, smells like grey flannel.</li>
            <li>At first I though that I might be getting a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;, but it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>as usual if i look it up on amazon 9 times out of 10 i will find it and at a really good price.</li>
            <li>It lasts a very long time and is accompanied with many comments.</li>
            <li>It is an average smell, nothing major, but for the price, this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Plus the price has gone down significantly!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more positive feedback regarding this cologne than just about any other I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars instead of five because it didn&#x27;t have a real woodsy smell as in the description.</li>
            <li>real beauty of Bora Bora is the price/value.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>i am very thankful of amazon.com and its staffs.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but i couldnt smell this cologne very well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Smell is very subjective.</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li>a real commenter buy something else .. smells like maple syrup and alcohol..</li>
            <li>Expected more from a cologne.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed it for 5 minutes before I really smelled anything, and that is just not what I am use to.  </li>
            <li>Bora Bora has a very soothing smell.  </li>
            <li>Just wanted to let people know that this is the real deal</li>
            <li>Top notes I could smell lemon and kiwi, which is pretty blah to me, but then it soon dies down to reveal a bit of musk and a bit of lavender as well.</li>
            <li>It smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My officemate can&#x27;t smell it unless she&#x27;s standing right next to me, which is exactly what you&#x27;d want.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nowhere near as strong nor does it smell the same as the bottle I purchased at a department store.</li>
            <li>i am not charming or good looking but with this stuff that dosen&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>I bought this cologne because i had ran out of the normal stuff i use (Love&amp;Luck) and needed some cologne fast.</li>
            <li>My personal preference/favorite in cologne is Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After an hour or two of wearing it, the sweet smell subdued and ended up have a more subtle balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is long lasting &amp; is good for evening or social wear.</li>
            <li>I got this years ago at Ross Dress for Less on a whim and after I put it on I got so many compliments from women, people I have never met, friends, and family.</li>
            <li>Got this for my babe over the holidays at a super low price</li>
            <li>Amazon rarely disappoints and this is one of the purchases that keeps me coming back, the reviews, the prices and fast delivery times are reliable.</li>
            <li>it will last for a good few hours.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is OK, not exotic, but decent for under $20.00!</li>
            <li>... i wanted a cologne that is fresh and unmistakably male.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big cologne guy and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money and this one sounded right.  </li>
            <li>The product came in unopened package - new as described.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering from a new supplier.  </li>
            <li>Smelled old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the cheapest in price that I&#x27;ve came across.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received was either really old or was a knock off.</li>
            <li>He was so surprised when he opened his gift.  </li>
            <li>This product i recommend it to any guy who wants to get female attention!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it resembles Curve Chill only with a presense of lime, the sandlewood doesn&#x27;t really grab me either.</li>
            <li>Lasting power is average, it morphs shortly after you apply it, not unlike many others we have used.</li>
            <li>But for the much lower price, a few extra squirts are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and arrived when expected.</li>
            <li>The musk is a bit synthetic, but not bad--it is a sweet musk that stays on my skin for a few hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m coming back for more hard to find Smell Goods.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting to try a new cologne out.</li>
            <li>The smell was overpowering and was liked by a few people but not many.</li>
            <li>It has a kind of metallic smell to it(sounds weird.</li>
            <li>A very masculine, long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>I ended up using this cologne for the first few weeks of school</li>
            <li>Bora Bora is by far one of the smoothest, long lasting men&#x27;s fragrances that is not over powering but leaves everyone wondering who is wearing it and how can I keep experiencing it.</li>
            <li>Has a sweet smell of cedarwood and lime with a subtle hint of sandalwood.</li>

            <li> I love this cologne, still love it after using it for years!</li>

            <li> Smell is refreshing and rejuvenating.</li>

            <li> My husbands favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li> Bora Bora has been my signature scent for many years.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten as many compliments about the way I smell as I do when wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed it</li>
            <li> I Buy this for My Husband &amp; 3 Sons, they LOVE this Cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m telling you ladies love this.</li>

            <li> bought this for my husband its his favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance...</li>
            <li> Curve Appeal and Curve Crush are better choices.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my boyfriend because I love how he smells when wearing this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of an aggressive \\&quot;going</li>
            <li> you like more of the Brut or Stetson Sierra stuff</li>
            <li> Used to be able to find easily in stores like TJ Maxx but not any more.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing lasts all day great buy definitely gonna order more when I run out</li>
            <li> and I was so happy to be able to find it at such an amazing price.</li>
            <li> and it had pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is a good daily cologne.  </li>
            <li> BOX IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM ORIGINAL BUT SMELLS GREAT!</li>
            <li> Just a cheap knock-off but ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Great long the smell, the taste of unprecedented nature.</li>
            <li> Bora Bora sounded exotic and it was cheap</li>
            <li> Bora Bora is a wonderful scent that is a little spicy, but with many hints of citrus.  </li>
            <li> I brought this after I had great experience of same product I brought 7 years ago, but this product does not smell as strong as it used to, and it is not holding fragrance for more than 15 minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My order came very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very mild maybe I am not spot on about the garden.</li>
            <li> Way to strong.</li>
            <li> nice, clean and fresh</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> the try small investment for a great product smells good</li>
            <li> That is huge in \\&quot;my book\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> and I was worried that I might be getting a cheap knock off -</li>
            <li> This fabulously smelling man is off the market.</li>
            <li> It is under-rated in the cologne arena, a great value, and I definitely recommend adding it to your collection.</li>
            <li> but i would still smell fantastic</li>
            <li> Most people commented on how fresh it smelled.  </li>
            <li> The Bottle I received was Genuine, I went online to Cosmetic check.com</li>
            <li> cheap smell, Dont buy.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend didnt like it and told me it was a cheap cologn.</li>
            <li> The transaction went as smooth as could be..</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, pretty cheap as well.</li>
            <li> so I could get the free shipping.  </li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> You have created a great photo of the product and it was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> Smells great and hard to find In Stores and more so happy I found it and at such a great price Definetly will buy more after looking in several stores</li>
            <li> Great price, long lasting with great comments no matter where I choose to wear it.</li>
            <li> While definitely unique, it is comparable or a mix between Diesel (Original - Fuel for Life..) and Versace Pour</li>
            <li> Very,Very Fresh Fragrance,but still manly type cologne!.</li>
            <li> so he was really excited when I gave it to him as a gift.</li>
            <li> I bought women&#x27;s version first,  wasn&#x27;t as satisfied,  </li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> And so far this is my very favorite.</li>
            <li> Clean smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> It starts of with notes of citrus and finishes off with the clean you shaved type smell.</li>
            <li> Clean, soapy, uncluttered.</li>
            <li> I loved it, genius smells great an last long</li>
            <li> About $20 on sale can&#x27;t be beat by many other good colognes.  </li>
            <li> Very good worth the money,delivery was very fast, smell lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Not to strong not to weak just perfect.</li>
            <li> Comes in a cool bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a real bargain for an exotic smelling cologne for men.</li>
            <li> Smells good but is don&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good value.</li>
            <li> It last a good while so two sprays is my recommendation.</li>
            <li> , we could not find it at such a good price anywhere else (if we could find it at all).  </li>
            <li> got it for my boyfriend he used to use it when he was younger he loved it</li>
            <li> Not too sweet and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> i could still the sweet smell</li>
            <li> Always nice fragrance, soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> Most people have told me that they like it but might be too strong for people with sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty strong too, I spray two shots on my skin</li>
            <li> Strong scent at first (not overly musky) but</li>
            <li> turns into a clean fresh scent that will last a good part of the day.  </li>
            <li> Its a clean fresh smell</li>
            <li> Bora is a clean and fresh fragrance with a mild spice undertone.  </li>
            <li> Such a delight to find a product, at a terrific price, and receive great service!  </li>
            <li> The real one can be sprayed in the morning and go all day smelling great and still smell it the next day on your clothes.</li>
            <li> There is simply no other cologne that attracts the women liked this one.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t going to turn heads, it&#x27;s just a light, average, but pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Not very fruity or musky, just a pleasant, clean, fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> I just received my new scent today (Villian) and hope it lives up to its expectation better than this one did.</li>
            <li> The spay smells good but it doesn&#x27;t hold very long.</li>
            <li> Being a musician it really helps to have a cool scent on a smooth jazz set.</li>
            <li> reviews generally consider the following areas: price/value, appeal/smell, \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), longevity, uniqueness, best time of year worn or occasion, and easy on the nose (and bottle on the eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not too strong where everyone in a room knows your smelling it but enough to where if you give a girl a hug they will smell it and love it.</li>
            <li> This is a crisp clean smell that is not over powering.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like a cheap air freshener or crappy aftershave, and lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a fresh and alluring scent</li>
            <li> it was because of the price I figured it was worth</li>
            <li> Nice enough scent but not at all long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> I made him promise that if any other women swarm him because of how great he smells, he has to be sure to tell them his future wife gave it to him (smile).  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a good value when purchased from Amazon and worth the money spent!</li>
            <li> The cologne was stored in the right temperature because it didn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;aged&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice...kinda sweet cologne.</li>
            <li> I think it has been discontinued &amp; was surprised to find it on Amazon &amp; at such a good price.</li>
            <li> i was happy to find this online, this is the cologne my husband wears and in town i have found it in only one place, next time</li>
            <li> it goes away super fast even after like 10 sprays I get an hour iff</li>
            <li> It does take several additional sprays versus that of what I was used to (mostly Armani).  </li>
            <li> This cologne is unbelievable, I stumbled upon it several years ago and was immediately impressed.</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised, thanks!</li>
            <li> First of all let me say I take responsibility for buying a cologne from Amazon without smelling it first.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Its similar to Coolwater but better.</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying Bora Bora..</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the pricing I only paid 1/3 what I would&#x27;ve paid in a local store:-)</li>
            <li> When I first met him</li>
            <li> I love smelling this on my fianc&amp;eacute; this is the only cologne that he will wear</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it, but it grew on me quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is somewhat exotic - maybe slightly spicy.</li>
            <li> It has a well balanced scent with sweet and bitter fragrance that makes it more masculine than a scent that is too sweet.</li>
            <li> This product cologne is pretty good especially for just running daily errands.</li>
            <li> It does take a lot of spray&#x27;s and if you spray it on your body before you put on your undershirt, it will actually last much longer (or at least that&#x27;s what I found that works best).  </li>
            <li> Okay, smells like grey flannel.</li>
            <li> At first I though that I might be getting a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;, but it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> as usual if i look it up on amazon 9 times out of 10 i will find it and at a really good price.</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time and is accompanied with many comments.</li>
            <li> It is an average smell, nothing major, but for the price, this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Plus the price has gone down significantly!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more positive feedback regarding this cologne than just about any other I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars instead of five because it didn&#x27;t have a real woodsy smell as in the description.</li>
            <li> real beauty of Bora Bora is the price/value.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> i am very thankful of amazon.com and its staffs.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but i couldnt smell this cologne very well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Smell is very subjective.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li> a real commenter buy something else .. smells like maple syrup and alcohol..</li>
            <li> Expected more from a cologne.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it for 5 minutes before I really smelled anything, and that is just not what I am use to.  </li>
            <li> Bora Bora has a very soothing smell.  </li>
            <li> Just wanted to let people know that this is the real deal</li>
            <li> Top notes I could smell lemon and kiwi, which is pretty blah to me, but then it soon dies down to reveal a bit of musk and a bit of lavender as well.</li>
            <li> It smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My officemate can&#x27;t smell it unless she&#x27;s standing right next to me, which is exactly what you&#x27;d want.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nowhere near as strong nor does it smell the same as the bottle I purchased at a department store.</li>
            <li> i am not charming or good looking but with this stuff that dosen&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because i had ran out of the normal stuff i use (Love&amp;Luck) and needed some cologne fast.</li>
            <li> My personal preference/favorite in cologne is Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After an hour or two of wearing it, the sweet smell subdued and ended up have a more subtle balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is long lasting &amp; is good for evening or social wear.</li>
            <li> I got this years ago at Ross Dress for Less on a whim and after I put it on I got so many compliments from women, people I have never met, friends, and family.</li>
            <li> Got this for my babe over the holidays at a super low price</li>
            <li> Amazon rarely disappoints and this is one of the purchases that keeps me coming back, the reviews, the prices and fast delivery times are reliable.</li>
            <li> it will last for a good few hours.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is OK, not exotic, but decent for under $20.00!</li>
            <li> ... i wanted a cologne that is fresh and unmistakably male.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big cologne guy and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money and this one sounded right.  </li>
            <li> The product came in unopened package - new as described.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering from a new supplier.  </li>
            <li> Smelled old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the cheapest in price that I&#x27;ve came across.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was either really old or was a knock off.</li>
            <li> He was so surprised when he opened his gift.  </li>
            <li> This product i recommend it to any guy who wants to get female attention!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it resembles Curve Chill only with a presense of lime, the sandlewood doesn&#x27;t really grab me either.</li>
            <li> Lasting power is average, it morphs shortly after you apply it, not unlike many others we have used.</li>
            <li> But for the much lower price, a few extra squirts are well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> The musk is a bit synthetic, but not bad--it is a sweet musk that stays on my skin for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m coming back for more hard to find Smell Goods.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting to try a new cologne out.</li>
            <li> The smell was overpowering and was liked by a few people but not many.</li>
            <li> It has a kind of metallic smell to it(sounds weird.</li>
            <li> A very masculine, long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I ended up using this cologne for the first few weeks of school</li>
            <li> Bora Bora is by far one of the smoothest, long lasting men&#x27;s fragrances that is not over powering but leaves everyone wondering who is wearing it and how can I keep experiencing it.</li>
            <li> Has a sweet smell of cedarwood and lime with a subtle hint of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I would spray myself 4 times and only have a faint smell which worked fine until it seemed to kick in later.</li>
            <li> The product last a long time.</li>
            <li> Affordable &amp; long lasting.</li>
            <li> but the scent does not last very long</li>
            <li> I feel it had been sitting on a shelf to long.</li>
            <li> Smells just like Grey Flannel.</li>
            <li> I have worn fragrances since my late teens and now am middle aged, I have bought much more expensive colognes but few get the consistent complements that this one brings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to think all the talk of Amazon having either defect or fake fragrances, is true.</li>
            <li> - Will try same maker&#x27;s other brand scent-Claibourne Sport for men.</li>
            <li> that their other fragrances have similar characteristics, the nose knows.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised and earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> It lasts s long time too!</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne as a gift for my father who generally tends to go through a bottle in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It is sweet and forgettable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find it brings back memories, I went to the mall different fragrance counters and all I could find was oils,</li>
            <li> Secondary to the price, is the \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> my baby dog seems to appreciate it; she tries to lick it off.</li>
            <li> and I had to ask what he had on because it smell so great,when he told he I ask the lady behind the counter how much and when she said the $$$$$</li>
            <li> I was like no thanks</li>
            <li> no surprises...exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Cant believe I spent money on this not kidding</li>
            <li> smells good but very weak and does not last very long even if you use lots of it &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; disappointed</li>
            <li> My cologne collection has extended to the point where I wear Bora Bora once every other month.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I smelled on a man along with other family members at Christmas dinner,  we all purchased.  </li>
            <li> ONE FOR ME AND THE OTHER FOR MY POPS.</li>
            <li> So Lady&#x27;s, if you want your man to smell extremely well, this is the scent to get him.</li>
            <li> but I have bought this cologne quite abit from other stores.</li>
            <li> A few sprays goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Beware that Liz Claiborne products for men all use the same base,[many manufacturers use a common base]so</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I will use for the past few years</li>
            <li> I had been using David Beckham Instinct Eau de Toilette since 2011, but became bored with it and also was bothered by the fact that it seemed to last only a few hours.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> It was kinda pricey, and it smells a little too &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; to me...</li>
            <li> this one seams to be a little on the watery side, maybe its just me</li>
            <li> Although i&#x27;m a fan of Polo green cologne.</li>
            <li> I just wasted $18 bucks.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a heavy sprayer.  </li>
            <li> Bought this as a change up from my usual cologne</li>
            <li> It is not exotic.</li>
            <li> I feel like I just got out of the shower even after 4 or 5 hours have past by.</li>
            <li> Not a favorite.</li>
            <li> Each time it is worn, I receive at least one compliment from a woman.  </li>
            <li> Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I do agree it does have a lime scent to it and is subtle.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> , I think she&#x27;s addicted.</li>
            <li> This a citrusy, fruity fragrance that anchors its masculinity due to a leathery base.</li>
            <li> know whats wrong.</li>
            <li> that sorry liz u got a fluke.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid with Bora Bora</li>
            <li> /&gt;i even put my dirty shirt(bora bora apllied)  among dirty clothes even after a week taking them out for washing them</li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> and I personally hated it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this cologne, still love it after using it for years!</li>
            <li> Clean smelling cologne. I work 12-14 hour days and put one spray on and it lasted all day. I gave it four stars instead of five because it didn&#x27;t have a real woodsy smell as in the description. I would still recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> It is what I wanted at a great price....</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this on him.</li>
            <li> smells great but the scent does not last very long - Will try same maker&#x27;s other brand scent-Claibourne Sport for men.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with the scent, it smelled very cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a throwback cologne that I always liked; had to get it.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my wife she says it smells great on her and I agree this product is great for both men and women.</li>
            <li> could not find this anywhwere! my hubby loves it!</li>
            <li> This Cologne smell nice . Not to strong not to weak just perfect. I do recommend cologne.</li>
            <li> The spay smells good but it doesn&#x27;t hold very long. As soon as it is spayed on the smell fades away like 10 minutes later. I would not buy this cologne again.</li>
            <li> Got this for my babe over the holidays at a super low price and I was worried that I might be getting a cheap knock off - well it&#x27;s not! It&#x27;s fantastic and I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is somewhat exotic - maybe slightly spicy. I love it on him and he enjoys wearing it. I would definitely recommend this for anyone wanting to try a new cologne out.</li>
            <li> Most people have told me that they like it but might be too strong for people with sensitive sense of smell.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. It smells great and a little goes a long way. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I call &amp;#34;a drug store cologne.&amp;#34;  Stetson, Curve, any number of &amp;#34;celebrity scents.&amp;#34;  But I received it as a gift and it&#x27;s fine.  It smells good and is a good daily cologne.  My officemate can&#x27;t smell it unless she&#x27;s standing right next to me, which is exactly what you&#x27;d want.  And it lasts all day.  If you&#x27;re expecting Chanel or Gucci, you&#x27;re not going to find it at this price.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Just awesome!</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne for men</li>
            <li> Excellent on all levels.  Prompt and timely delivery.  My fianc&amp;eacute; loved it - great product, and I love the way it smells on him.  I made him promise that if any other women swarm him because of how great he smells, he has to be sure to tell them his future wife gave it to him (smile).  This fabulously smelling man is off the market.</li>
            <li> completely satisfied with product and shipping.</li>
            <li> Bora Bora is by far one of the smoothest, long lasting men&#x27;s fragrances that is not over powering but leaves everyone wondering who is wearing it and how can I keep experiencing it. Being a musician it really helps to have a cool scent on a smooth jazz set. If you are looking for a fresh and alluring scent Bora Bora is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0045K709A Liz Claiborne COLOGNE SPRAY 1.7 OZ]]</li>
            <li> Most attractive sent on the market with lightening quick delivery!!! Perfect price too!!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Smelled old. I did not care for it. I feel it had been sitting on a shelf to long. Bad</li>
            <li> Bora Bora by Liz Claiborne smells great and is a \\&quot;steal of a deal\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bora Bora is a clean and fresh fragrance with a mild spice undertone.  While definitely unique, it is comparable or a mix between Diesel (Original - Fuel for Life..) and Versace Pour Homme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reviews generally consider the following areas: price/value, appeal/smell, \\&quot;wow factor\\&quot; (compliments), longevity, uniqueness, best time of year worn or occasion, and easy on the nose (and bottle on the eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real beauty of Bora Bora is the price/value.  For the money, it cannot be passed-up to add to your collection.  Secondary to the price, is the \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot;.  My cologne collection has extended to the point where I wear Bora Bora once every other month.  Each time it is worn, I receive at least one compliment from a woman.  That is huge in \\&quot;my book\\&quot;.  Bora Bora also scores well with longevity.  I am especially fond of applying a moderate amount of any fragrance in the morning prior to work and it lasting the day without reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are into defining an occasion to wear B/B, I would think it works well for any season, time of day, or event.  After the initial application, the essence smoothes out to an easygoing fragrance without being overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Bora Bora 4.60 stars, out of 5.  It is under-rated in the cologne arena, a great value, and I definitely recommend adding it to your collection.</li>
            <li> Did some research and found that this was a good deal on cologne. They offered a varied selection of cologne&#x27;s. Shipped in a timely manner. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> i am not charming or good looking but with this stuff that dosen&#x27;t matter.  if a girl had to choose me with bora bora or brad pitt she would take brad pitt but i would still smell fantastic</li>
            <li> Best prices ever, cheaper than department stores</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne i have ever purchased. Its not too strong where everyone in a room knows your smelling it but enough to where if you give a girl a hug they will smell it and love it. Comes in a cool bottle. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in 2011, and I sprayed like one spray once a day. And it&#x27;s now 2013, I still have 1/4 of the bottle. My brother liked the man smell he smells from me, and ordered one for himself.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a change up from my usual cologne and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back. My girlfriend keeps nuzzling my shoulder where I spray it, I think she&#x27;s addicted. Can&#x27;t blame her, I think I am too</li>
            <li> It is OK, not exotic, but decent for under $20.00! Lasting power is average, it morphs shortly after you apply it, not unlike many others we have used. Beware that Liz Claiborne products for men all use the same base,[many manufacturers use a common base]so that their other fragrances have similar characteristics, the nose knows. Bora Bora is probably the pick of the litter when compared to all the Curve variations! It is definitely a good value when purchased from Amazon and worth the money spent! Forget Retail!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more positive feedback regarding this cologne than just about any other I&#x27;ve had.  It does take a lot of spray&#x27;s and if you spray it on your body before you put on your undershirt, it will actually last much longer (or at least that&#x27;s what I found that works best).  It does take several additional sprays versus that of what I was used to (mostly Armani).  But for the much lower price, a few extra squirts are well worth it.  Most people commented on how fresh it smelled.  I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this smell. Got this from my father in law several years ago.</li>
            <li> The Bottle I received was Genuine, I went online to Cosmetic check.com Entered The Batch Code,and was a Match along with The Manufacturing Date. Now for The Smell,This is now one of My personal favorites for Price point,and smell! This smell better,and better as it stays on Your skin through out The day,or Evening! Very,Very Fresh Fragrance,but still manly type cologne!.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it! Smell is refreshing and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li> I brought this after I had great experience of same product I brought 7 years ago, but this product does not smell as strong as it used to, and it is not holding fragrance for more than 15 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know whats wrong. but look like Liz Claiborne has downgraded strength so they can sell more.</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT cologne.  My wife loves the smell of it on me. It is great.  This is a real bargain for an exotic smelling cologne for men.</li>
            <li> excellent very good good protection wonderful and very nice soft scent</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne and i love the way it smells on him. he ran out some time ago and we couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. as usual if i look it up on amazon 9 times out of 10 i will find it and at a really good price.</li>
            <li> Smells good but is don&#x27;t last at all</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing. Just a cheap knock-off but ok for the price.</li>
            <li> Great price, long lasting with great comments no matter where I choose to wear it. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Great seller and I love the product.</li>
            <li> My brother said they stopped producing this at one point...so he was really excited when I gave it to him as a gift. Gotta love online shopping!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is perfect for men and women.  I smelled on a man along with other family members at Christmas dinner,  we all purchased.  I bought women&#x27;s version first,  wasn&#x27;t as satisfied,  didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy men&#x27;should cologne.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a very reasonable price. It&#x27;s by far the cheapest in price that I&#x27;ve came across. And the quality isn&#x27;t compromised. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A very masculine, long lasting scent. I have received numerous compliments wearing this cologne. Overall, it is a good value.</li>
            <li> Great long the smell, the taste of unprecedented nature.</li>
            <li> This cologne is unbelievable, I stumbled upon it several years ago and was immediately impressed. I have worn fragrances since my late teens and now am middle aged, I have bought much more expensive colognes but few get the consistent complements that this one brings. It last a good while so two sprays is my recommendation.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. Good product!</li>
            <li> It was kinda pricey, and it smells a little too &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; to me...</li>
            <li> hi everyone,  i have to tell u guys that this cologne is one of the best colognes i have purchased from amazon.com.  it has some of the greatest scents.  i can&#x27;t name them all but when u buy it, it will tell u everything about it.  the bottle is also very nice and stylish.  the delivery was on time as well. i am very thankful of amazon.com and its staffs. A+</li>
            <li> I got this years ago at Ross Dress for Less on a whim and after I put it on I got so many compliments from women, people I have never met, friends, and family. I have been ordering it for years now. It&#x27;s a very good cologne. Of course everybody bodies chemistry is different so you have to try it out and see for yourself. Ross only had it for a short time so after Ross I have been ordering it on Amazon and it&#x27;s actually a better price on Amazon than it was at Ross. :) Very happy customer!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne and I was so happy to find this on line since its no longer in stores.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing lasts all day great buy definitely gonna order more when I run out</li>
            <li> An overpowered stink bomb of &#x27;fragrance juices&#x27; with no trace of cedarwood, lime or sandalwood-maybe notable 50ft away. This no return item will be deposited immediately in the trash. Big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Bora Bora is a wonderful scent that is a little spicy, but with many hints of citrus.  Its a cologne that will leave a plesent scent with you from morning thru evening.  I will be buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was either really old or was a knock off. The scent is nowhere near as strong nor does it smell the same as the bottle I purchased at a department store. I&#x27;m starting to think all the talk of Amazon having either defect or fake fragrances, is true.</li>
            <li> I am a regular with this cologne.I have no complaints from other.nothing but good compliment.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby, it is one of only two colognes that he and I both like. This is my second purchase from Amazon for this cologne and my husband and I both agree this is a great buy, we could not find it at such a good price anywhere else (if we could find it at all).  Amazon rarely disappoints and this is one of the purchases that keeps me coming back, the reviews, the prices and fast delivery times are reliable.</li>
            <li> I love the way this fragrance smells on my husband.  Its refreshing.  My order came very quickly.  I am completely pleased!</li>
            <li> The women are all over me with this stuff. Well, maybe that is an over statement but it does smell good and my baby dog seems to appreciate it; she tries to lick it off.</li>
            <li> Really is a great every day scent!!</li>
            <li> Arrived as advertised, thanks!</li>
            <li> The product came in unopened package - new as described. Fast shipping. The cologne was stored in the right temperature because it didn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;aged&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> It was what I excepted I was p;eased with the service will look to buy more when this runs out</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite.</li>
            <li> Okay, smells like grey flannel.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne because i had ran out of the normal stuff i use (Love&amp;Luck) and needed some cologne fast. I read some reviews on this cologne and figured for the price it would suffice. I ended up using this cologne for the first few weeks of school and I personally hated it. Maybe im loosing my sense of smell but i couldnt smell this cologne very well. I would spray myself 4 times and only have a faint smell which worked fine until it seemed to kick in later. The smell was overpowering and was liked by a few people but not many. I personally did not like the way this smelled but for the price i cant complain. I just received my new scent today (Villian) and hope it lives up to its expectation better than this one did.</li>
            <li> I was standing next to a man in the store and I had to ask what he had on because it smell so great,when he told he I ask the lady behind the counter how much and when she said the $$$$$ I was like no thanks came to my favorite site amazon and the price yes I had to have it and love when my husband wears it he smells so sexy to me 😉</li>
            <li> I had been using David Beckham Instinct Eau de Toilette since 2011, but became bored with it and also was bothered by the fact that it seemed to last only a few hours. I read a bunch of reviews and decided to give Bora Bora a shot.  I&#x27;m not a big cologne guy and didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money and this one sounded right.  So far so good.  My wife likes it a lot more than Instinct and it lasts all day. Not very fruity or musky, just a pleasant, clean, fresh smell.  I am well satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.M. Tepper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  February 2014. Still liking this a lot and just bought my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;p.p.s. November 2015.  Bought #3</li>
            <li> Bora Bora &amp; Mambo are my go to scents. I have found Liz Claiborne cologne to be the best bet.</li>
            <li> I do agree it does have a lime scent to it and is subtle. But the scent lasts on me for maybe 1 hour and this is supposed to be cologne?</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne. At first I though that I might be getting a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;, but it is the real deal. The price is great and I will be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> ORDERED 2. ONE FOR ME AND THE OTHER FOR MY POPS. BOX IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM ORIGINAL BUT SMELLS GREAT!</li>
            <li> This product cologne is pretty good especially for just running daily errands. nice, clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I always get lots of compliment when wearing this cologne</li>
            <li> FOR THE COST ITS A GREAT SCENT</li>
            <li> No good. Although i&#x27;m a fan of Polo green cologne. I wanted to try sandalwood. This cologne smells more like a woman&#x27;s perfume NOT MANLY AT ALL. It DOES NOT have the sandalwood smell and i was embarrassed walking through my local gym smelling like a girl and no i don&#x27;t spray on cologne before i head to the gym i just couldn&#x27;t get it off. I just wasted $18 bucks.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves the scent and I do as well. Not over powering but it will wear off after a time.</li>
            <li> My Wife, Purchased A Gift Set Of This Scent, 3 Yrs. Ago &amp; I Received Nothing But Complainants On It. I&#x27;ve been looking for it ever since I ran out. So Lady&#x27;s, if you want your man to smell extremely well, this is the scent to get him. And men, if your shopping for your self, this scent is the best I&#x27;ve ever worn. Not a day goes by that I don&#x27;t get asked what I am wearing. From make &amp; female&#x27;s. But mostly female&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Always nice fragrance, soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and got my husband hooked on it. He always gets comments like who smells so good?&lt;br /&gt;What cologne are you using? It smells wonderful and lasts all day. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I loved it, genius smells great an last long</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts all day long. Has a sweet smell of cedarwood and lime with a subtle hint of sandalwood. This is a daytime fragrance for me and one I tend to wear more during the winter months. It lasts a very long time and is accompanied with many comments. I have been wearing this for years and stumbled upon it here on Amazon and fell in love with it all over again. Occasionally I will shower the next morning after wearing Bora Bora and will smell it as if I had just sprayed a couple of spritzs. For the price Bora Bora can&#x27;t be beat. Go out and get yourself a lady. Don&#x27;t be afraid with Bora Bora you have the confidence of a thousand hungry lions. You feel invisible from morning to night!</li>
            <li> First of all let me say I take responsibility for buying a cologne from Amazon without smelling it first. Bora Bora sounded exotic and it was cheap so I rolled the dice. It is not exotic. Bora Bora smells like an inexpensive generic men&#x27;s cologne you might get from Walmart. It is sweet and forgettable. That&#x27;s just my opinion of course. Smell is very subjective. On the plus side my bottle of cologne arrived on time and in good condition.    My advice is to smell Bora Bora at a department store before ordering it.</li>
            <li> cheap smell, Dont buy. I bought it cause of price and it had pretty good reviews. My girlfriend didnt like it and told me it was a cheap cologn. I agree</li>
            <li> IT WAS  PERFECT I LIKE  IT TNK</li>
            <li> Bora Bora is by far the best mens colone ever made. Very light, sweet, pleasant scent!! Plus the price has gone down significantly!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents for my husband.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product. You have created a great photo of the product and it was more than I expected. I am so very pleased and would recommend your company and the product to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I love Bora Bora Cologne. I cannot find it in stores anymore. I think it has been discontinued &amp; was surprised to find it on Amazon &amp; at such a good price. I have used Bora Bora for years. The scent is long lasting &amp; is good for evening or social wear.</li>
            <li> At this price it could a staple in any collection. It starts of with notes of citrus and finishes off with the clean you shaved type smell. The product last a long time. I can&#x27;t imagine many people not liking this sent.</li>
            <li> You wanna have girls around you? You need Bora Bora!</li>
            <li> Bora Bora is okay! Clean, soapy, uncluttered. This is a good safe frag and a safe, not-too-expensive gift. This a citrusy, fruity fragrance that anchors its masculinity due to a leathery base. Top notes I could smell lemon and kiwi, which is pretty blah to me, but then it soon dies down to reveal a bit of musk and a bit of lavender as well. The musk is a bit synthetic, but not bad--it is a sweet musk that stays on my skin for a few hours. It is an average smell, nothing major, but for the price, this is a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I love it and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! I still receive many compliment and it seems to never go out of style.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend enjoys the scent of this cologne.  It&#x27;s not too strong, yet it has a very exotic citrus scent.  The scent weakens as the day goes on, but the smell will stick to clothing throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I keep buying Bora Bora for men and after all these years I´m still impress with how good it smells. I feel like I just got out of the shower even after 4 or 5 hours have past by. Great stuff if you are planning to go out on a date or just to have some good time!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is fantastic!  I&#x27;ve given it to my spouse, son and friends, and EVERYONE loves it!  Such a delight to find a product, at a terrific price, and receive great service!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED this product. It is one of my husbands favorites and I was so happy to be able to find it at such an amazing price.</li>
            <li> Smell great. Last about 1-2 hours</li>
            <li> I order this from channel one i never got this but they took my money do not shop with them but the Cologne itself is good I had it before and it smells great</li>
            <li> got it for my boyfriend he used to use it when he was younger he loved it</li>
            <li> I love this cologne!!! I was very happy and found the scent to be nice and lasts for a while!!</li>
            <li> it has a very pleasant earthy smell that lasts</li>
            <li> i was happy to find this online, this is the cologne my husband wears and in town i have found it in only one place, next time he needs a refill I will buy it here.</li>
            <li> smells good but very weak and does not last very long even if you use lots of it &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; disappointed</li>
            <li> This is a very nice...kinda sweet cologne. The transaction went as smooth as could be..no surprises...exactly as expected. Will shop again!</li>
            <li> Its similar to Coolwater but better. It has a kind of metallic smell to it(sounds weird. Its a clean fresh smell, All age range for this one.</li>
            <li> the man I gave it to loved it and I love it on him.</li>
            <li> es perfecto para un hombre jovial y dinamico  de la actualidad , economico y de una fragancia sin igual , gracias</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 13 years now, it&#x27;s my favorite cologne. It&#x27;s pretty strong too, I spray two shots on my skin and I&#x27;m good to go for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne. Smells pretty good, pretty cheap as well. Its nice to have to a change of pace.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves the smell.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying Bora Bora.. it was because of the price I figured it was worth the try small investment for a great product smells good I have a nice collection of Cologne in this fits in nicely. I will be wearing it and probably will buy it again when the bottle of goes out thank you</li>
            <li> One of Liz best cologne ...Very lovely fragrance</li>
            <li> Smells great on my husband</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised and earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> Cant believe I spent money on this not kidding im a real commenter buy something else .. smells like maple syrup and alcohol.. it goes away super fast even after like 10 sprays I get an hour iff that sorry liz u got a fluke.</li>
            <li> its a great smelling product. this one seams to be a little on the watery side, maybe its just me but I have bought this cologne quite abit from other stores. it will last for a good few hours.</li>
            <li> Nice enough scent but not at all long-lasting.  Expected more from a cologne.  Giving it four stars, however, because the price is low.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the pricing I only paid 1/3 what I would&#x27;ve paid in a local store:-)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find it brings back memories, I went to the mall different fragrance counters and all I could find was oils, glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li> This was a gift.  But, the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> This just is not the Bora Bora I had before.  I sprayed it for 5 minutes before I really smelled anything, and that is just not what I am use to.  I will be ordering from a new supplier.  This was just water and seemed like a lot of it</li>
            <li> Bora Bora has been my signature scent for many years. I have never gotten as many compliments about the way I smell as I do when wearing this cologne. My nieces and nephews remark &amp;#34;This smells like Uncle Howie&amp;#34;. This is a crisp clean smell that is not over powering.  I always buy several bottles at a time so I never run out !!</li>
            <li> Way to strong. Smells just like Grey Flannel. Not a favorite.</li>
            <li> Get alot of compliments!</li>
            <li> Very good worth the money,delivery was very fast, smell lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I had one of these about 3 years ago grandpa gave it to me I really enjoyed it my girlfriend loved it!</li>
            <li> I Buy this for My Husband &amp; 3 Sons, they LOVE this Cologne. I&#x27;ve been buying it for Many Years &amp; the Price was WONDERFUL for this Size. My Item Came on Time as Stated!</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell of overpowering colognes.  Bora Bora has a very soothing smell.  I would recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li> now this is some good stuff here  Guys I&#x27;m telling you ladies love this. every time I ware this I get more atten, than I need.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this cologne when I ordered it.  To be honest with you I added it to another order so I could get the free shipping.  I like it a lot.  It&#x27;s a great day time cologne and lasts all morning and afternoon.  It has a well balanced scent with sweet and bitter fragrance that makes it more masculine than a scent that is too sweet.</li>
            <li> I asked my friend at work what cologne he was wearing so I could get some for myself and he told me about Bora Bora. Great scent. Not too sweet and lasts all day. I get compliments ALL THE TIME. He pays $50 for it. I got it on Amazon for $17. I even bought one for my dad. I&#x27;m a cologne and watch guy in my mid 30&#x27;s. Trust me. You have to add it to your collection. At this price, it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne I will use for the past few years and I honestly couldn&#x27;t count how many compliments I get. Smells amazing and I refuse to buy anything else!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my friend.  When I first met him I commented him on his cologne and asked him what he was wearing.  Then I noticed that he wasn&#x27;t wearing it any longer and he told me that he couldn&#x27;t find it any longer.  The store he was buying it at wasn&#x27;t going to carry it any longer.  He was so surprised when he opened his gift.  Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t last long and I will surprise him again with another purchase.  It smells wonderful!!</li>
            <li> My gift to myself love it great smelling fragrance!!! Good price also!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great and hard to find In Stores and more so happy I found it and at such a great price Definetly will buy more after looking in several stores</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this on a man.  I would recommend buying this for any man in your life!</li>
            <li> One of my favs.  Always get lots of compliments win I wear Bora Bora.  Great value.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the fragrance it should carry</li>
            <li> Product as listed.  Prompt shipping</li>
            <li> I took a gamble on this one, and it paid off.  I haven&#x27;t bought a Liz Claire Bourne cologne I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> The malls didn&#x27;t have this. But you did with a good price. I&#x27;m coming back for more hard to find Smell Goods.</li>
            <li> ... i wanted a cologne that is fresh and unmistakably male.  got just what i wanted with this scent.  very light, &amp;#34;up-in-the-air&amp;#34; spritz recommended.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in our area.  My husband loves it and I think it smells great. Would recommend for any man.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last at all. The real one can be sprayed in the morning and go all day smelling great and still smell it the next day on your clothes. i also noticed the bottle didn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;Claiborne&amp;#34; around the BORA BORA name on the front of the bottle like it should.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I have a collection of about 9 colognes and counting. And so far this is my very favorite. Kinda reminds me of walking threw a country garden smelling a mixture of all kinds of flowers. Very mild maybe I am not spot on about the garden. But it reminds me of flowers. I think it can be a unisex fragrance. Just my opinion.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband its his favorite cologne. Used to be able to find easily in stores like TJ Maxx but not any more. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and it smells great on my guy.  What a great price for this too... It came in just in time for a gift.</li>
            <li> I brought this cologne as a gift for my father who generally tends to go through a bottle in just a few weeks.  He&#x27;s a heavy sprayer.  However I&#x27;ve noticed this bottle has lasted him 4 months now and still going.  A few sprays goes a long way.  Strong scent at first (not overly musky) but turns into a clean fresh scent that will last a good part of the day.  The price is another pro of this product.  About $20 on sale can&#x27;t be beat by many other good colognes.  Great Value! The reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 starts instead of 5 is because this is not the best I&#x27;ve tried.  My personal preference/favorite in cologne is Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water.</li>
            <li> good price for a nice cologne</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance...</li>
            <li> Great scent. Affordable &amp; long lasting.</li>
            <li> I get nothing but compliments for my Bora Bora.</li>
            <li> There is simply no other cologne that attracts the women liked this one. They will stop you and ask what you&#x27;re wearing. Promise!</li>
            <li> This product i recommend it to any guy who wants to get female attention!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i did not buy it to get any but man this does work i applied it in the morning and till afternoon i could still the sweet smell&lt;br /&gt;i even put my dirty shirt(bora bora apllied)  among dirty clothes even after a week taking them out for washing them i still could feel the good smell of bora bora....</li>
            <li> I love smelling this on my fianc&amp;eacute; this is the only cologne that he will wear</li>
            <li> Just wanted to let people know that this is the real deal I almost forgot how good bora bora smelled</li>
            <li> Loved the price bought for my husband</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t going to turn heads, it&#x27;s just a light, average, but pleasant scent. I think it resembles Curve Chill only with a presense of lime, the sandlewood doesn&#x27;t really grab me either. Curve Appeal and Curve Crush are better choices.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a great men&#x27;s cologne.  Price it around - you won&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> Tried it, aroma just didn&#x27;t suit me. Too medicinal chemical aroma for me.</li>
            <li> A great smell for guys! I buy this for my boyfriend because I love how he smells when wearing this. It lasts s long time too!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it, but it grew on me quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an hour or two of wearing it, the sweet smell subdued and ended up have a more subtle balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It certainly doesn&#x27;t smell like a cheap air freshener or crappy aftershave, and lasts quite a while. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of an aggressive \\&quot;going out\\&quot; fragrance than something to wear at the office, although you could probably get away with both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like more of the Brut or Stetson Sierra stuff, this probably isn&#x27;t for you, but I&#x27;d say this is a good contrast from a Stetson-like cologne. I personally prefer Pierre Cardin.</li>
