            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite so far!</li>
            <li>This works great... but just be careful to not use too much.</li>
            <li>It really leaves hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>I tried Marc Anthony beach waves as there was a rebate to try it for free in my local Walgreens, and this has worked better than anything with no &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; hair or buildup.</li>
            <li>Curlesque, the newish version, is not as good in performance in genreal for my particular needs as the old products were, but this one is actually a bit better than the Curls Rock leave-in poduct.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is the bomb..especially for people like me who have a lot of thick, hair with a fair amount of curl, this product helps keep it from being unruly ..love it!</li>
            <li>after trying tons of other things, these are what works best for my hair type, which is long and curly.</li>
            <li>This is a nice leave-in for my frizzy dry curls!  </li>
            <li>Keeps my curls smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>I use this product first and then apply the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product, combined with the TIGI curls rock amplifier, work really well!</li>
            <li>This works great for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>I feel like this worked pretty well for a couple weeks but then stopped having an effect.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I buy a Catwalk one</li>
            <li>And very resistant to humidity in Florida!</li>
            <li>but, most importantly, it does NOT weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>This is a product made for my type of hair, smells sooo good, leaves my curls soft and loose, no crunchy texture</li>
            <li>I used about a pump&#x27;s worth and worked it all through my short, color treated, fine, permed hair from root to tip as the directions state.</li>
            <li>It goes on clean and gives my natural curl the boost it needs.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to apply the necessary amount because if you apply too much it will leave your hair crunchy.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Curls Rock Amplifier - it seems to work pretty well at keeping my hair from becoming too dry.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair which I keep permed; but because my hair is also fragile, sometimes the perm gets frizzy.  </li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner really works for me.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair very manageable as well.</li>
            <li>if I want the wet look, I add more.</li>
            <li>Then I scrunched my hair really well after finger combing it here and there.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really helps define my curls, which aren&#x27;t very uniform.</li>
            <li>It really did work wonders.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works really well for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>If I put in the leave-in conditioner and Amplifier without blow-drying, my hair has less body, but the curls are more defined and maintain much longer.    </li>
            <li>It is not heavy or sticky and my hair looks shiny and feels super soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair less frizzy and more controllable.</li>
            <li>If I blow-dry, my hair has body, is super soft, and the curls hold for most the day unless I&#x27;m rough on them (running my hands through them, pulling my hair back in a ponytail repeatedly, etc).     </li>
            <li>It really did stop the frizz, and it really did make my hair unbelievably soft to touch, bouncy</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>no flakes, I highly recommend this leave-in conditioner, I&#x27;d like to try the mousse along with it.</li>
            <li>This product will keep layers from flying away and will tame static electricity too.  </li>
            <li>so I can live with it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard but nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>cuts down on the fur look my naturally curly hair loves to sport and makes it soft and healthy looking</li>
            <li>My hair is usuall a poofy, crazy, mess, and this stuff gives my hair the most beautiful natural wave without ANY heat</li>
            <li>Be sure to use only about a dime&#x27;s worth at most (or less for short hair) on towel dried hair.  </li>
            <li>This product fits the bill as it leaves her hair soft and not bushy in the humid area we live.</li>
            <li>With my other products just mentioned, I had a lot more shine to my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>It does not cause hair to separate once it is combed through, but if you want your curls defined, then leave them au natural after application.  </li>
            <li>The curls came out softly defined.  </li>
            <li>curly but not an afro, my hair is really soft.</li>
            <li>It leave a my hair so soft</li>
            <li>It came out pretty well once dry.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much, you will have flat, almost stringy hair.</li>
            <li>After wrapping a microfiber turban around my sopping wet hair for about 15 minutes, I took the turban off and first put in some HSI</li>
            <li>I have wavy full fluffy hair.</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner is very light, but I still only use a pea-size amount for my shoulder-length thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have curly, course hair that cannot be brushed when it is dry, so this helps when I put this in my hair right after my shower.</li>
            <li>I always touch up my perm with a 3/8&amp;#34; curling iron either right when dry or the next day.  </li>
            <li>Bonacure Moisture Kick Spray Conditioner, but this Tigi product is much better suited heavier uses/needs - like after a day at the beach or in the pool, rather than a daily spray to tame frizzies, especially on fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li>And I am starting to have serious faith in this brand. :)</li>
            <li>If you use just A LITTLE, then you will have exactly what you want-- soft, bouncy waves (or curls, too..</li>
            <li>It smells like old, generic hand lotion to</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell you how much money I&#x27;ve spent finding &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this product on curly permed long hair, as well as medium and long straight hair.</li>

            <li> My hair is usuall a poofy, crazy, mess, and this stuff gives my hair the most beautiful natural wave without ANY heat</li>
            <li> Be sure to use only about a dime&#x27;s worth at most (or less for short hair) on towel dried hair.  </li>
            <li> This product fits the bill as it leaves her hair soft and not bushy in the humid area we live.</li>
            <li> With my other products just mentioned, I had a lot more shine to my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It does not cause hair to separate once it is combed through, but if you want your curls defined, then leave them au natural after application.  </li>
            <li> The curls came out softly defined.  </li>
            <li> curly but not an afro, my hair is really soft.</li>
            <li> It leave a my hair so soft</li>
            <li> It came out pretty well once dry.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much, you will have flat, almost stringy hair.</li>
            <li> After wrapping a microfiber turban around my sopping wet hair for about 15 minutes, I took the turban off and first put in some HSI</li>
            <li> I have wavy full fluffy hair.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner is very light, but I still only use a pea-size amount for my shoulder-length thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly, course hair that cannot be brushed when it is dry, so this helps when I put this in my hair right after my shower.</li>
            <li> I always touch up my perm with a 3/8&amp;#34; curling iron either right when dry or the next day.  </li>
            <li> Bonacure Moisture Kick Spray Conditioner, but this Tigi product is much better suited heavier uses/needs - like after a day at the beach or in the pool, rather than a daily spray to tame frizzies, especially on fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li> And I am starting to have serious faith in this brand. :)</li>
            <li> If you use just A LITTLE, then you will have exactly what you want-- soft, bouncy waves (or curls, too..</li>
            <li> It smells like old, generic hand lotion to</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how much money I&#x27;ve spent finding &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on curly permed long hair, as well as medium and long straight hair.</li>
            <li> I recently got a perm, and the first few days it was a frizzy mess as I tried several different products to get moisture back into the hair.</li>
            <li> One bottle usually lasts me 3 months, so the price is really reasonable.</li>
            <li> It keeps hair soft and less damaged from chlorine and sun.</li>
            <li> Gives it just enough moisture to avoid dry and brittle curls.</li>
            <li> It keeps my haor soft but helps my curls stayand less frizz.</li>
            <li> Overall I think I need to use this after several shampoos to make a recommendation one way or the other.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it is not heavy</li>
            <li> If your hair is oily, just use on long and layered ends..  </li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly and naturally blonde hair that I occasionally get highlighted.</li>
            <li> Also, the product doesn&#x27;t seem that different from a regular conditioner just slightly thinned out.</li>
            <li> Then I let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly and dry and this leaves my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> purchase price was very reasonable compared to normal retail, so this wasn&#x27;t a very expensive lesson....</li>
            <li> Use on wet hair then crunch.</li>
            <li> again a little goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leaves my hair crunchy like other products do.</li>
            <li> and I get very minimal frizzies.</li>
            <li> After that I put some Curlesque Amplifier in my hair (this is applied halfway down hair to tips).  </li>
            <li> I have 3c curly hair and a lot of leave-ins weigh it down</li>
            <li> so doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> It helps keep down the frizz and conditions curly hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It holds it down and maintains the waves.</li>
            <li> Have tried other products, but this is the one for me!</li>
            <li> It was also half the price compared to buying in the store.</li>
            <li> And along with those 3 products, I put a little bit of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s thickener for definition and body.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, curly and very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Apply to wet/towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to manage my curls.</li>
            <li> Does not make my hair feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few months.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> I use a small amount after every shampoo and it does not make my hair heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Too bad I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  </li>
            <li> only for thin hair!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly thin hair and this product does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have caucasian hair, thick and wavy/frizzy.</li>
            <li> I will recommend it to anyone with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> A waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, it left her hair both crispy and frizzy at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Applied approximately nickel size amount to palm and rub together.</li>
            <li> Not real sure why, but disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointment after disappointment until I tried this one.</li>
            <li> Nasty smell to this product...don&#x27;t recommend</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent seller, product works great</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the pin-point pump dispenser that doesn&#x27;t come with a lid. Also, the product doesn&#x27;t seem that different from a regular conditioner just slightly thinned out. I was looking for something to replace Schwarzkopf BC Bonacure Moisture Kick Spray Conditioner, but this Tigi product is much better suited heavier uses/needs - like after a day at the beach or in the pool, rather than a daily spray to tame frizzies, especially on fine/thin hair.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner is great for curly hair. You can put it in and not have to worry about rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> Good detangler. I don&#x27;t think it does much to manage frizz, but it works to make my hair more manageable. I have curly, course hair that cannot be brushed when it is dry, so this helps when I put this in my hair right after my shower.</li>
            <li> the TIGI catwalk is excelent for curly hair. My daughter have the hair so curly and bloond . This product is super for that kind of hair. I used all the TIGI product for curly hair. They are so awesome.</li>
            <li> Does an okay job of enhancing curls.</li>
            <li> This is the best curl conditioner I have ever used.  I have straight, fine hair which I keep permed; but because my hair is also fragile, sometimes the perm gets frizzy.  But this product tames the frizz and gives my hair well-formed curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly thin hair and this product does not weigh my hair down. Very happy! :)</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner really works for me. I use it in combination with regular conditioner, not to replace it. By doing this, my frizz is down to a minimum and my curls are happy.</li>
            <li> My package that was to be delivered on the 13th, still hasn&#x27;t found me on the 19th.</li>
            <li> One of my very favorite things about the [now defunct] Curls Rock line from CatWalk was the scent of each and every product, especially the conditioner.  They were all amazing.  Curlesque, the newish version, is not as good in performance in genreal for my particular needs as the old products were, but this one is actually a bit better than the Curls Rock leave-in poduct.  Too bad I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  It smells like old, generic hand lotion to me.&lt;br /&gt;The purchase price was very reasonable compared to normal retail, so this wasn&#x27;t a very expensive lesson....</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It defines the curl patterns as well as leave your hair non greasy and full of luster.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard but nice and soft.  It leaves your hair very manageable as well.</li>
            <li> Works great to get tangles out especially after swimming!  It keeps hair soft and less damaged from chlorine and sun.</li>
            <li> This is a nice leave-in for my frizzy dry curls!  I use a small amount after every shampoo and it does not make my hair heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and I highly recommend it&#x27;s use. It&#x27;s great for knocking out the *frizzies on my colored hair.  Apply to wet/towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> This works great... but just be careful to not use too much. If you use too much, you will have flat, almost stringy hair. If you use just A LITTLE, then you will have exactly what you want-- soft, bouncy waves (or curls, too.. but my hair is on the more wavy side).</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair. Keeps my curls smooth, and soft. if I want the wet look, I add more.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on curly permed long hair, as well as medium and long straight hair. It works great on every length.  Be sure to use only about a dime&#x27;s worth at most (or less for short hair) on towel dried hair.  Rub hands together then distribute through hair beginning at ends.  If your hair is oily, just use on long and layered ends..  This product will keep layers from flying away and will tame static electricity too.  It does not cause hair to separate once it is combed through, but if you want your curls defined, then leave them au natural after application.  Just scrunch the curls.  I highly recommend this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> TIGI Catwalk Curl Collection Curlesque Leave-in Conditioner is the only leave-in conditioner that works for me.  This is a trusted brand, regardless of which product you try.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff last night after shampooing and conditioning my hair.  After wrapping a microfiber turban around my sopping wet hair for about 15 minutes, I took the turban off and first put in some HSI Leave-in Argon Oil.  Then I put the Curlesque Leave-in conditioner in my hair.  I used about a pump&#x27;s worth and worked it all through my short, color treated, fine, permed hair from root to tip as the directions state. (Longer layers, about ear length all around.) After that I put some Curlesque Amplifier in my hair (this is applied halfway down hair to tips).  Then I scrunched my hair really well after finger combing it here and there.  Then I let it air dry.  It came out pretty well once dry.  The curls came out softly defined.  One thing I didn&#x27;t notice is any additional shine to my hair.  I did touch up my bangs with a curling iron, and they are nice and shiny.  Overall I think I need to use this after several shampoos to make a recommendation one way or the other.  Before I got Curlesque products, I used HSI Argon oil, Matrix Color Care Miracle Treat Lotion Spray, and It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Silk Leave-in.  And along with those 3 products, I put a little bit of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s thickener for definition and body.  With my other products just mentioned, I had a lot more shine to my dry hair.  I always touch up my perm with a 3/8&amp;#34; curling iron either right when dry or the next day.  So I&#x27;ll be interested to see if the curls hold better, are more humidity resistant, and last longer.  If they do, I will update this review with further observations.</li>
            <li> Mistakenly purchased the wrong product but it is okay.</li>
            <li> the best product for my hair. curly but not an afro, my hair is really soft. only for thin hair!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I&#x27;ve been using it for ~5 years.</li>
            <li> I was well satisfied with the delivery and quality of the product</li>
            <li> I love this. Makes my hair less frizzy and more controllable. I use it everyday to manage my curls. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Does not make my hair feel heavy.  Great as a styling agent.  I use nothing but TIGI and Bed Head products.. after trying tons of other things, these are what works best for my hair type, which is long and curly.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few months. I have long, fine, curly/wavy hair. It keeps my hair hydrated and in great shape. No split ends.</li>
            <li> First time using this, and so far so good......again a little goes a long way.....good product, will pruchase this again</li>
            <li> After trying this line of products, I still have frizzy hair. I have thick wavy hair. I tried Marc Anthony beach waves as there was a rebate to try it for free in my local Walgreens, and this has worked better than anything with no &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; hair or buildup.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product.  We have been having issues finding something she likes to use, to manage her curls.  This product fits the bill as it leaves her hair soft and not bushy in the humid area we live.</li>
            <li> Nasty smell to this product...don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> cuts down on the fur look my naturally curly hair loves to sport and makes it soft and healthy looking</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the Curlesque Curls Rock Amplifier for almost a year.    This leave-in conditioner is very light, but I still only use a pea-size amount for my shoulder-length thick hair. I make sure to get it on my ends so they stay healthy and moisturized.    I use this product first and then apply the [[ASIN:B0007506U2 TIGI Catwalk Curl Collection Curlesque Curls Rock Amplifier, 5.07 Ounce]] and love the results. If I blow-dry, my hair has body, is super soft, and the curls hold for most the day unless I&#x27;m rough on them (running my hands through them, pulling my hair back in a ponytail repeatedly, etc).     If I put in the leave-in conditioner and Amplifier without blow-drying, my hair has less body, but the curls are more defined and maintain much longer.    Either way, I love this product and my hair seems healthier from using it.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the bomb..especially for people like me who have a lot of thick, hair with a fair amount of curl, this product helps keep it from being unruly ..love it!</li>
            <li> This product, combined with the TIGI curls rock amplifier, work really well! I have caucasian hair, thick and wavy/frizzy. Straightens well but gets frizzy if at all humid outside. This combination of products allows my hair to dry on its own, and move freely throughout the day without being crunchy, and controls the frizz beautifully. Gives me the body and wave that I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> Good for my hair, I love it!</li>
            <li> My hair never looked better.  Controls my frizz without making my hair crunchy.The scent is light and unnoticable.  It was also half the price compared to buying in the store.</li>
            <li> I use this every day in my curly hair and love it. It is not heavy or sticky and my hair looks shiny and feels super soft.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really nice stuff! Works great in my hair. :D</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for curly hair or even really wavy hair! My hair is usuall a poofy, crazy, mess, and this stuff gives my hair the most beautiful natural wave without ANY heat what so ever!!! WILL BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> This is the best leave-in conditioner I have tried - and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of leave-ins. I have 3c curly hair and a lot of leave-ins weigh it down but this one doesn&#x27;t. Gives it just enough moisture to avoid dry and brittle curls. One bottle usually lasts me 3 months, so the price is really reasonable.</li>
            <li> Catwalk is a great product. A little goes a long way and it is not heavy so doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> This works great for my thick curly hair. It keeps my haor soft but helps my curls stayand less frizz. Can&#x27;t beat amazons price either.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Curls Rock Amplifier - it seems to work pretty well at keeping my hair from becoming too dry. I haven&#x27;t used it just by itself, but as a combo product it does as advertised. And I am starting to have serious faith in this brand. :)</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly and naturally blonde hair that I occasionally get highlighted. It tends to be frizzy and finding products that work is a hassle. I can&#x27;t even tell you how much money I&#x27;ve spent finding &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; for my hair. This leave-in might be a keeper! It leave a my hair so soft and I get very minimal frizzies. It really helps define my curls, which aren&#x27;t very uniform. I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell, though. It&#x27;s the smell companies give to water, which makes sense since TIGI describes it as an ocean scent. It isn&#x27;t that strong though so I can live with it. I sorta wish it had a cap, but I&#x27;d just lose it anyway. I recommend this for anyone trying to find that perfect leave-in for frizzy curls.</li>
            <li> The only choice for someone with curly hair.  I have tried it all.</li>
            <li> This is a product made for my type of hair, smells sooo good, leaves my curls soft and loose, no crunchy texture no flakes, I highly recommend this leave-in conditioner, I&#x27;d like to try the mousse along with it. My hair doesn&#x27;t tolerate too much protein, but this is a wonderful product, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This works great, it accentuates my curls and makes them super soft, not to mention product washes out of hair easier when this is applied first.</li>
            <li> I recently got a perm, and the first few days it was a frizzy mess as I tried several different products to get moisture back into the hair. Disappointment after disappointment until I tried this one. It really did work wonders. It really did stop the frizz, and it really did make my hair unbelievably soft to touch, bouncy and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
            <li> I feel like this worked pretty well for a couple weeks but then stopped having an effect.  Not real sure why, but disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is great leave-in conditioner!  Not only does it have a great fragrance and leave my hair smooth but, most importantly, it does NOT weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This product is a winner to use alone or before curls amplifier. It really leaves hair so smooth. I will recommend it to anyone with thick curly hair. The price is very good in comparison with other sellers.</li>
            <li> It helps keep down the frizz and conditions curly hair without weighing it down. It&#x27;s works well with the curling cream.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair in different types of weather conditions. Definitely recommend it to anyone with curly hair. People also compliment me on how nice it smells.</li>
            <li> I always buy leave in products to my hair from differents companies. This is the first time I buy a Catwalk one and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> It was not the Curlesque conditioner that my wife ordered.  It was TIGI Catwalk brand but definitely NOT Curlesque.</li>
            <li> Best leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smell great but I don&#x27;t think it does anything for the curls</li>
            <li> Love this product. Label has changed,but product remains the same. I have wavy full fluffy hair. Applied approximately nickel size amount to palm and rub together. Use on wet hair then crunch. It holds it down and maintains the waves.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works really well for my hair. I apply it every time after I take a shower, it is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite ones, together with the Redken leave in. My hair is shine and with no volume. And very resistant to humidity in Florida!</li>
            <li> doesnt control frizz at all - I notice no difference whether I use or not !  waste of money</li>
            <li> Been using TIGI Curl Leave-In Conditioner for a number of years now. It goes on clean and gives my natural curl the boost it needs.  Have tried other products, but this is the one for me!</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in conditioner it&#x27;s my favorite so far! My hair is curly and dry and this leaves my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;I apply [[ASIN:B0007506U2 TIGI Catwalk Curl Collection Curlesque Curls Rock Amplifier, 5.07 Ounce]] after this product to hold my curls,&lt;br /&gt;it enhances my 3b curls and it doesn&#x27;t leaves my hair crunchy like other products do. Be sure to apply the necessary amount because if you apply too much it will leave your hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter who has curly hair and was excited based off its good reviews.  I&#x27;m very disappointed, it left her hair both crispy and frizzy at the same time.  A waste of money!!</li>
            <li> great light conditioner that eaves hair soft not stiff</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, curly and very dry hair.  Nothing seems to work until I tried this leave-in conditioner.  It leaves my hair feeling silky and it definitely highlights my curls without the over-drying look.  It&#x27;s light weight and a keeper.  I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering it again.</li>
