            <li>You can shop any where and get the foam soap , but it may not smell as nice .</li>
            <li>but the aroma doesn&#x27;t seem as nice, and the soap doesn&#x27;t lather up as well.  </li>
            <li>I added a splash of Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid baby mild soap in the foaming pump dispenser along with this soap and it works great now - sudses up much better, and smells heavenly.  </li>

            <li>You can reuse their pump many times before it needs to be replaced.    </li>

            <li>This one is my favorite scent, and true &amp;#34;grapefruit bergamot&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>other fragrances are available and get excellent reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is available on Amazon but cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li>It is also important to me that it is a cruelty-free product.</li>
            <li>It also seems like the soap doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling as clean and residue free, which is one of the main things I liked about this product.  </li>
            <li>Original review:    </li>
            <li>Feels clean.</li>
            <li>Iuse the Mandarin Ginger as it is a unisex fragrance and is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this foaming soap (which I originally discovered at a local boutique in the packaging with pump dispenser), however they appear to have changed the formulation and</li>
            <li>Very pleasant aroma and the only source of Grapefruit Bergamot foam soap since the other guys disappeared from the scene.</li>
            <li>I wish the dispenser gave 50% larger serving size, but I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Overpriced as it is necessary to use more to get the lather.</li>
            <li>So glad they finally have refills.  </li>
            <li>and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The grapefruit/bergamot scent is refreshing and such a nice change from the typical overpowering scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got super sensitive skin, and am allergic to everything.  </li>
            <li>The grapefruit bergamot smell is pleasant and actually makes your hands feel cleaner due to the feedback from the scent.</li>
            <li>very nice...had to substitute for Kiss My Face which I am not finding anymore.  </li>
            <li>Really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Refillable dispenser with big refill bottles available.</li>
            <li>Obviously would prefer if this product worked better right out of the bottle, but hopefully this tip is helpful to anyone else having the same problem.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean, unlike many natural soaps that leave a residue, and it doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin when I have to wash my hands over and over again, such as when I&#x27;m cooking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it from three different retailers now (Amazon, Diapers.com, Drugstore.com) and all three have been filled with an extremely watery formulation that does not suds up or clean at all, even when used in the original Deep Steep foaming pump dispenser as it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I moved to New Orleans and got the little 8 ounce hand bottle and fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>the new one is a dud.  </li>
            <li>Was really disappointed when I found it was no longer available at my local Whole Foods; very glad to have found the refills here!</li>
            <li>It is heavily watered down ... but am using it anyway as the fragrance is what I&#x27;d hoped for good.</li>
            <li>It also removes faceprint quite well and as far as cleaning your hands leave no reside or stickiness like some soaps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m concerned that this version is leaving my hands feeling dry, but it&#x27;s too early to tell.  </li>

            <li> The refill fills the hand soap dispenser 2 times and you can even stretch it to 3 with a little water.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;ve got super sensitive skin, and am allergic to everything.  It rinses clean, unlike many natural soaps that leave a residue, and it doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin when I have to wash my hands over and over again, such as when I&#x27;m cooking.  This one is my favorite scent, and true &amp;#34;grapefruit bergamot&amp;#34;.  I use the rosemary-mint as well, and like it, but could not actually call it rosemary-scented.</li>
            <li> I wish the dispenser gave 50% larger serving size, but I love this stuff.  Cleans very well, including grease and smells good afterward.</li>
            <li> We use this soap in all our bathrooms and have for sometime. Great price and on time delivery are just added bonuses.</li>
            <li> I use this in the bathroom.  It is not antibacterial, which I like because I have grandchildren and I have had cancer, so I feel it is good product for our family.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this foaming soap (which I originally discovered at a local boutique in the packaging with pump dispenser), however they appear to have changed the formulation and the new one is a dud.  I&#x27;ve ordered it from three different retailers now (Amazon, Diapers.com, Drugstore.com) and all three have been filled with an extremely watery formulation that does not suds up or clean at all, even when used in the original Deep Steep foaming pump dispenser as it is supposed to be.  Very disappointed.

            <li> I love this product line, all the products I&#x27;ve used are excellent.  This has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using deep steep for a while now... I like the fact that I can refill my foamer, save money, save the environment a teensy bit and enjoy a great product!</li>
            <li> Really good foam soap.  Very pleasant aroma and the only source of Grapefruit Bergamot foam soap since the other guys disappeared from the scene.</li>
            <li> I like a thicker product. Overpriced as it is necessary to use more to get the lather. I used to buy another product at Anthropologie that they no longer carry Pure and Good from Canada . It was superior in all ways. I finally found it at Target under the name Caldrea. Iuse the Mandarin Ginger as it is a unisex fragrance and is clean and fresh. other fragrances are available and get excellent reviews on Amazon. It is available on Amazon but cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li> smells so fresh and clean, love the grapefruit smell! wish it were cheaper, but, it&#x27;s a great value. Quality product.</li>
            <li> SOAP REFILL IS A MUST BECAUSE YOU&#x27;LL NEED IT!!!!!  IT SMELLS THAT GOOD.</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed when I found it was no longer available at my local Whole Foods; very glad to have found the refills here!</li>
            <li> very nice...had to substitute for Kiss My Face which I am not finding anymore.  Really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is heavily watered down ... but am using it anyway as the fragrance is what I&#x27;d hoped for good.</li>
            <li> My wife and I moved to New Orleans and got the little 8 ounce hand bottle and fell in love with the smell.

            <li> Five stars for the product , great scent !! The cost is soooo not worth it . You can shop any where and get the foam soap , but it may not smell as nice . I don&#x27;t mind the sacrifice of a great scent !!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this soap! It reminds me of fruit loop cereal.</li>
            <li> Best hand soap EVER. Delightfully subtle and natural scent. Not cheap, but since it&#x27;s foaming, I dilute 50/50 with water when refilling--works every bit as well as full-strength, lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit/bergamot scent is refreshing and such a nice change from the typical overpowering scents. It is also important to me that it is a cruelty-free product.</li>

            <li> Arrived on time, smells great...not too sweet!</li>
            <li> UPDATE 11/29/14 - The batch of refills I just bought are clearly different.  It seems they have changed the formulation.  \\&quot;Infusion of organic herbs\\&quot;, the second ingredient, has been removed; glycerin is now glycerin (vegan); rosemary leaf extract has been added towards the end (perhaps the part of the infusion of herbs they kept); and tocopherol (vitamin E) has been removed.    I&#x27;ve only been using it one day but the aroma doesn&#x27;t seem as nice, and the soap doesn&#x27;t lather up as well.  It also seems like the soap doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling as clean and residue free, which is one of the main things I liked about this product.  I&#x27;m concerned that this version is leaving my hands feeling dry, but it&#x27;s too early to tell.  I&#x27;ll report back after I&#x27;ve used it for a few days.    -----  Original review:    I&#x27;ve been using this one for 6 years.  So glad they finally have refills.  You can reuse their pump many times before it needs to be replaced.    Great smell, easy on hands with frequent washes, and cleans well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for liquid hand soap since Kiss My Face quit selling it&#x27;s grapefruit bergamot foaming soap. Finally found Deep Steep and it is exactly what I wanted. Refillable dispenser with big refill bottles available.</li>
