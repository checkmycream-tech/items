            <li>Very sweet perfume, stay the whole day</li>
            <li>Brand new :)</li>
            <li>very much, i love this fragrance, very nice smell, arrive a lil bit slow!</li>
            <li>but none I enjoy as much as this one.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day, definitely worth the price, I wish I could buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your quick delivery of the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I used to sell Mary Kay and that&#x27;s how I first ran across Belara.</li>
            <li>When I used to use the whole combo it lasted ALL DAY!</li>
            <li>will be ordering more once my bottle gets low.</li>
            <li>she wore it when I first met her</li>
            <li>I love this parfume the sent just doesnt last like it used to</li>
            <li>I am pleased to have this back in my life.</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast too</li>
            <li>It has a light and fresh fragrance that lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>this product is working very well</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>I ordered the perfume for my mom and she really loves it.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and fast service.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>just as described, thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li>It smells like granny perfume in the bottle, but you know it&#x27;s worth the price because it smells different on every person.</li>
            <li>However the TWO bottles I ordered STINK, they are either old or a knock off.  </li>
            <li>If it was one of the two I would lean towards old...</li>
            <li>It is old and I cannot use it.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft scent and seems to remind me of Europe.</li>
            <li>But even now it still last a long time, but the smell does seem to calm after 5-6 hours</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only sent i have worn for the past 7 years and every where I go people love it on me.  </li>
            <li>Took a little longer than expected, but when it arrived, it was as described, new out of the box, and is original quality at a lower price.</li>
            <li>Next time I will go with my instinct and purchase perfume directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>The size of the lettering on the bottle is not the same as my old bottle.  </li>
            <li>It is either a knock off or old - unlike the original that we could smell all day long on my skin, this bottle was less fragrant and did not last at all (no smell by mid morning).</li>

            <li> Took a little longer than expected, but when it arrived, it was as described, new out of the box, and is original quality at a lower price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> this product is working very well, I&#x27;m happy with it, I&#x27;m just still in the process using it, so I&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s awesome. It smells like granny perfume in the bottle, but you know it&#x27;s worth the price because it smells different on every person. I hate it when some other floozy&#x27;s wearing my same perfume. This way, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it! Haha forreal though good stuff. Lasts all day, definitely worth the price, I wish I could buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> I ordered the perfume for my mom and she really loves it.  It has a light and fresh fragrance that lasts a long time.  I definitely would purchase this product again.  It was delivered in a timely manner and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I used to sell Mary Kay and that&#x27;s how I first ran across Belara. I couldn&#x27;t keep it in stock back in 2002 thru 2006!!! I forgot about it somehow, but now that I have it, ONG its like a people MAGNET. I feel like Cleopatra when I wear this! Men and women willbSTOP me or follow me thru stores like they are MESMERIZED by it! EVERY woman should have a COUPLE bottles if Belara stashed away safely! I&#x27;m ordering another bottle but this time I want the entire set! I want the shower gel AND lotion. When I used to use the whole combo it lasted ALL DAY! But even now it still last a long time, but the smell does seem to calm after 5-6 hours, that&#x27;s why I want the lotion.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay Belara Parfume has been the only perfume I&#x27;ve worn for 16 years.  However the TWO bottles I ordered STINK, they are either old or a knock off.  If it was one of the two I would lean towards old... but two!!??</li>
