            <li>I love the smell plus every time I got out and spay it on me</li>
            <li>Very nice fresh scent but wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>Bvlgari Blv by Bvlgari for men Eau De Toilette is very special parfum .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One of the best Eau De Toilette Sprays made has and clean and mysterious smell</li>
            <li>Same very good quality</li>
            <li>My wife thought it was great and was developed just for me.  </li>
            <li>Most of the BVLGARI fragrances that I own tend to have a clean, fresh, almost soapy scent.  </li>
            <li>It is easy on the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing like this scent out there a unique original authentic scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I believe it to be the original  although the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem as strong..</li>
            <li>and this is cheap</li>
            <li>for me it is fabulous</li>
            <li>I ws going to purchase this at a duty free on my way to Europe for $85</li>
            <li>sprayer is very easy to spray with a light touch very sensitive (on authentic bottles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too strong not too mild.  </li>
            <li>100% original.</li>
            <li>The bottle is misshapen and the packaging does not seem original-</li>
            <li>What can be said about a product you are familiar with?</li>
            <li>I originally received this product as a gift when in Guam.  </li>
            <li>Not to strong and not to weak the smell is just perfect!</li>
            <li>In the morning it helps to keep me energetic and getting ready to work.</li>
            <li>Love this, I actually wear this more then</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, with sufficient packaging that didn&#x27;t compromise the cologne at all.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful but does not last long.  </li>
            <li>this is what you want to smell like before and after a bout of wildly fantastic love-making, or pure sex.  </li>
            <li>this is my second bottle of BLV , i love the clean cool scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li>Masculine and sexy.</li>
            <li>but it is worth buying to add to your collection and the diversity of fragrances worn.  </li>
            <li>this perfume will last long and the smell is great but not that strong the makes people sneeze</li>
            <li>, right..??  </li>
            <li>stuff is amazing, wish I could find the perfume instead of the toilet water.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I love Bvlgari black, which seems smoker and better balanced than this one.</li>
            <li>A classic scent of fresh, powder, and clean soap.</li>
            <li>I bought half a dozen of my favorite fragances from Amazon and are really satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>I know this is one of the most common men perfumes in this world, but gosh, I love this fragrance!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes ever not a strong scent and the women love it.</li>
            <li>This is my personal favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>This is likely my favorite.</li>
            <li>Just like I would have purchased in store but at a much cheaper price!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I have not received any compliments, i.e. the Wow Factor, I enjoy wearing BLV and it creates confidence while wearing -</li>
            <li>Clean and Crisp and very masculine.  </li>
            <li>It is a clean masculine scent.</li>
            <li>It came on timely manner, very well wrapped and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Got it pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>But, for the few hours it&#x27;s active, you&#x27;ll smell great!</li>
            <li>I love this cologne and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>But good cologne for that guy in your life, last long</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still very noticeable.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend, I wear perfumes and cologne very well.</li>
            <li>This perfum was a gift for my son in law and he really enjoyied it.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Me and my dad really like the smell of this one.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>that is all that really matters</li>
            <li>The fragrance is unique enough to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>As with most fine fragrances, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>highly recommended to anyone .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great smelling cologne, Somebody that shall remain nameless dropped mine and broke it,</li>
            <li>i have been wearing bvlgari por homme for years and it never gets old!</li>
            <li>cuz its loud already.</li>
            <li>The fragrance offers diversity that permits acceptability for any time of year and occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the original perfume fragrance can be felt and a few days on clothes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s nice and high quality -</li>
            <li>in fact, the bottle is made so poorly, that I highly doubt that it is authentic.</li>
            <li>Still a decent scent, but not the same scent.</li>
            <li>a very nice smell,bottle is large and should last a LONG TIME (dont go crazy</li>
            <li>The blend is similar to some, but offers a uniqueness that belongs to BVLGARI.  </li>
            <li>fresh, musky, green scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this parfum following my wife&#x27;s suggestions, but I like the soft lasting smell it gives to me.</li>

            <li> The fragrance is unique enough to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> As with most fine fragrances, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> highly recommended to anyone .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne, Somebody that shall remain nameless dropped mine and broke it,</li>
            <li> i have been wearing bvlgari por homme for years and it never gets old!</li>
            <li> cuz its loud already.</li>
            <li> The fragrance offers diversity that permits acceptability for any time of year and occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the original perfume fragrance can be felt and a few days on clothes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s nice and high quality -</li>
            <li> in fact, the bottle is made so poorly, that I highly doubt that it is authentic.</li>
            <li> Still a decent scent, but not the same scent.</li>
            <li> a very nice smell,bottle is large and should last a LONG TIME (dont go crazy</li>
            <li> The blend is similar to some, but offers a uniqueness that belongs to BVLGARI.  </li>
            <li> fresh, musky, green scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this parfum following my wife&#x27;s suggestions, but I like the soft lasting smell it gives to me.</li>
            <li> A former reviewer said it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> i really like the smell and its not to hard on the nose.</li>
            <li> just wish I&#x27;d sampled before I leapt - scents are different on us all, so it&#x27;s really not the products fault ,</li>
            <li> coworkers like it too so that a plus and its not offending.&lt;br /&gt;it does stay for a long period</li>
            <li> Do not buy from Fragrance or the other perfume places as the product in my opinion is not the same.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I found is that the scent \\&quot;fades\\&quot; after just a few hours (the \\&quot;Notti\\&quot; scent does the same thing).</li>
            <li> the smell is soft and lingering and not overwhelming at all..</li>
            <li> BLV has average longevity, projection, and sillage - lasting about 6 hours on my skin and longer on my shirtsleeve.  </li>
            <li> BLV Pour Homme is no different, coming out of the gates with ginger notes then settling down to a cedarwood/juniper fragrance with tobacco as end notes.  </li>
            <li> Amazon send me a completely different product: Bvlgari Black 2.5 oz.</li>
            <li> The product is just as I expected and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Got it a day sooner than expected...</li>
            <li> It was as i expected to be .</li>
            <li> The valuation of the product is because it is the quality that is expected.</li>
            <li> I hate that people are starting to wear it more, I have been wearing this scent since 2004.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly like the one we get a Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy handed on the bass scent notes.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the same bottle of cologne from Macy&#x27;s just to confirm whether or not this cologne is fake, but until then, this product receives a flat out 1 star.</li>
            <li> It took a little while for it to get to my section of the U.S.</li>
            <li> Cant put it on heavy</li>
            <li> /&gt;This can be worn year round IMO Summer,Winter,Fall,Spring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> After 15 to 20 minutes no more odor.</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else notices these things,</li>
            <li> this could be a fake perfume or it stayed too long in the amazon stockroom.</li>
            <li> works hard creating a richness feel with it&#x27;s fragrances.  </li>
            <li> He purchases this cologne at least every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Keep on in briefcase as you&#x27;ll need to re-apply at least once/twice during the day.</li>
            <li> And for this perfume what I bought it I can say that it is false.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Not dissatisfied just a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unless someone can correct me on this, I have every reason to believe that the product I received was fake.</li>
            <li> It is a fake perfume!</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!</li>

            <li> Great smelling cologne, Somebody that shall remain nameless dropped mine and broke it, so time to buy another one!</li>
            <li> Someone bought some for my bf; the scent makes me think of baby powder and chalk and always pushes me to the brink of a migraine.</li>
            <li> Great value for a HUGE bottle....! Smaller bottle at Macy&#x27;s was 2x the price!</li>
            <li> Received the item as described. Got it pretty fast too. Thank you!!</li>

            <li> i have been wearing bvlgari por homme for years and it never gets old! i always get compliments from women and men! they are always suprised when i tell them that its a men&#x27;s fragrance too. the smell is soft and lingering and not overwhelming at all..you&#x27;ll get more people leaning in closer to you thats for sure!</li>
            <li> this could be a fake perfume or it stayed too long in the amazon stockroom. i do not recommend you buy this item</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents.  It is woody, spicy and earthy, best to use during the fall and winter.  As with most fine fragrances, a little goes a long way so don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
            <li> Same very good quality</li>
            <li> Blvgari Blv goes well with a warm sunny day. A former reviewer said it doesn&#x27;t last long. At this typing, I&#x27;ve had mine on for about 4 hours and it&#x27;s still very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied!!! The product is just as I expected and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Really good product!</li>
            <li> stuff is amazing, wish I could find the perfume instead of the toilet water.  The smell is wonderful but does not last long.  Do not buy from Fragrance or the other perfume places as the product in my opinion is not the same.  The price is also fair on Amazon</li>
            <li> this perfume will last long and the smell is great but not that strong the makes people sneeze lol.. you must buy it and this is cheap</li>
            <li> its vey good!! fast shipping and good quality! and the most good thing is that cheap!! i will purchse again at the amazon</li>
            <li> for me it is fabulous</li>
            <li> This is my personal favorite perfume. I like it. In the morning it helps to keep me energetic and getting ready to work.</li>
            <li> Got it a day sooner than expected...i started spraying in air and walkn in into it twice. Cant put it on heavy cuz its loud already.</li>
            <li> Definitely has been a very good buying, it came on time and it&#x27;s great perfume, it deserves what you paid for</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes ever not a strong scent and the women love it.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite cologne.  Clean and Crisp and very masculine.  I receive nothing by &amp;#34;you smell good&amp;#34; comments.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazon send me a completely different product: Bvlgari Black 2.5 oz. when I asked for Bvlgari Blv 3.3 oz. I tried to return it but found this message: \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com\\&quot;. I will never buy this kind of items from Amazon, ever!</li>
            <li> I often get comments on this one. I must have 50 different scents that I rotate daily. This is likely my favorite.</li>
            <li> i got this for myself when my family went on a cruise 2 years ago, i didnt no that it had tobacco leaves in it, but when i found out i just said whatever it smells good, and i knew my dad will like it because he smokes and loves the smell of tobacco</li>
            <li> Unbeatable price! 100% original.</li>
            <li> The bottle received was cracked. Was traveling so couldn&#x27;t return it. Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy handed on the bass scent notes. Personally, I love Bvlgari black, which seems smoker and better balanced than this one. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s nice and high quality - just wish I&#x27;d sampled before I leapt - scents are different on us all, so it&#x27;s really not the products fault ,</li>
            <li> Potent,LONG LASTING on the skin and clothes (you can smell it 24 hours later)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a very nice smell,bottle is large and should last a LONG TIME (dont go crazy this is POTENT)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I smell is..... Most prominent is ginger and baby powder! It also has a peculiar smell to it which I read someone compared it to &amp;#34;chalk&amp;#34; (and maybe so,but) this stuff is GREAT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing like this scent out there a unique original authentic scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer is very easy to spray with a light touch very sensitive (on authentic bottles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be worn year round IMO Summer,Winter,Fall,Spring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my TOP 5 colognes of all time!!!! Price is UNBEATABLE I ws going to purchase this at a duty free on my way to Europe for $85 but glad i didnt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent/originality 5&lt;br /&gt;Longevity 5&lt;br /&gt;Projection 5&lt;br /&gt;Price 10</li>
            <li> Excellent and big product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was as i expected to be . It&#x27;s a great perfume!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great on my boyfriend</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite fragrance. He started using it when he turned 12. It was easy to order and the best thing: I did not go to the mall!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good i got it for my bro its his favorite</li>
            <li> i really like the smell and its not to hard on the nose. coworkers like it too so that a plus and its not offending.&lt;br /&gt;it does stay for a long period but it does wear off. i would recommend to anybody</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this type of perfume for a years. And for this perfume what I bought it I can say that it is false. After 15 to 20 minutes no more odor. In the original perfume fragrance can be felt and a few days on clothes.</li>
            <li> Awesome cologne.Love it.</li>
            <li> this is what you want to smell like before and after a bout of wildly fantastic love-making, or pure sex.  it is magical, like the sex you just had, and dream about afterwards.  fresh, musky, green scent.</li>
            <li> Great smell like always and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume I love good price!</li>
            <li> Great for a good price!</li>
            <li> Love this, I actually wear this more then my boyfriend, I wear perfumes and cologne very well. But good cologne for that guy in your life, last long</li>
            <li> well .. excellent, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Everything arrived as scheduled.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this Bvlgari!</li>
            <li> The fragance is excellent this is the second time buying it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! He purchases this cologne at least every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Bvlgari Blv by Bvlgari for men Eau De Toilette is very special parfum .&lt;br /&gt;I satisfied and I love it .</li>
            <li> This perfum was a gift for my son in law and he really enjoyied it.&lt;br /&gt;A great perfum for a good price</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, with sufficient packaging that didn&#x27;t compromise the cologne at all. A classic scent of fresh, powder, and clean soap. The bottle in the pic does not justify how big it is in person. Great price for the size.</li>
            <li> Disappointingly short lasting. Very nice fresh scent but wear out quickly. Keep on in briefcase as you&#x27;ll need to re-apply at least once/twice during the day.</li>
            <li> Me and my dad really like the smell of this one. Not too strong not too mild.  Im glad amazon has this now and is way cheaper than when we buy it at the mall</li>
            <li> Unless someone can correct me on this, I have every reason to believe that the product I received was fake. The bottle is misshapen and the packaging does not seem original- in fact, the bottle is made so poorly, that I highly doubt that it is authentic. I will be purchasing the same bottle of cologne from Macy&#x27;s just to confirm whether or not this cologne is fake, but until then, this product receives a flat out 1 star.</li>
            <li> this is my second bottle of BLV , i love the clean cool scent of this cologne. you can wear this cologne in any season , specially on warm summer  . highly recommended to anyone .</li>
            <li> I bought this parfum following my wife&#x27;s suggestions, but I like the soft lasting smell it gives to me. I use during the day and in some nights too.</li>
            <li> Excellent provider, very responsible, on time. Muy buen proveedor, bastante responsable, el producto llego a tiempo sin daños. Recomendado este proveedor</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly&lt;br /&gt;Great price</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and it lasts a very long time. Even after practicing sports.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better scents (in my opinion) by Bulgari. The only problem I found is that the scent \\&quot;fades\\&quot; after just a few hours (the \\&quot;Notti\\&quot; scent does the same thing). But, for the few hours it&#x27;s active, you&#x27;ll smell great!</li>
            <li> Not exactly like the one we get a Macy&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t know why.. Still a decent scent, but not the same scent.</li>
            <li> Quantity was great buy for the money.  I believe it to be the original  although the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem as strong..&lt;br /&gt;Not dissatisfied just a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very good fragrance .&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it  friends .</li>
            <li> One of the best Eau De Toilette Sprays made has and clean and mysterious smell the Girls Love it too and The price was amazing too...</li>
            <li> I hate that people are starting to wear it more, I have been wearing this scent since 2004.  Women love it.</li>
            <li> All according to my expectations, the required product. The valuation of the product is because it is the quality that is expected. thanks</li>
            <li> I have bought this fragrance for my husband before and we both really love it. It is a clean masculine scent. The price was excellent! I got double the amount for 50% of the price at regular walk-in stores. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> My favorite for 10 years. Love this scent. Masculine and sexy. Get compliments all the time. Very light and fresh. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I know this is one of the most common men perfumes in this world, but gosh, I love this fragrance! It makes my husband much more sexier :-P It lasts the entire day.</li>
            <li> What can be said about a product you are familiar with? No surprises. I bought it because I love it, so I knew what I was going to get. It came on timely manner, very well wrapped and a very reasonable price. A kind of indulgency with myself. I bought half a dozen of my favorite fragances from Amazon and are really satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> Excelent product, Smell wonderfull, 100% recomended</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no Orginal&lt;br /&gt;you cheated me</li>
            <li> Not to strong and not to weak the smell is just perfect!</li>
            <li> I love the smell plus every time I got out and spay it on me people comments me of how good I smell ever since I Always buy it.</li>
            <li> Just like I would have purchased in store but at a much cheaper price!  Bought this as a gift and they loved it!</li>
            <li> Most of the BVLGARI fragrances that I own tend to have a clean, fresh, almost soapy scent.  BLV Pour Homme is no different, coming out of the gates with ginger notes then settling down to a cedarwood/juniper fragrance with tobacco as end notes.  The blend is similar to some, but offers a uniqueness that belongs to BVLGARI.  I like the fragrance... It is easy on the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BVLGARI works hard creating a richness feel with it&#x27;s fragrances.  You notice that immediately with the packaging and the quality (and clarity) of the bottle.  Not sure if anyone else notices these things, but I do admire quality design and packaging.  BLV has average longevity, projection, and sillage - lasting about 6 hours on my skin and longer on my shirtsleeve.  The fragrance offers diversity that permits acceptability for any time of year and occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have not received any compliments, i.e. the Wow Factor, I enjoy wearing BLV and it creates confidence while wearing - that is all that really matters, right..??  If you are a BVLGARI fan, BLV should be added to your collection.  Will I repurchase when the 1 ounce bottle is depleted - probably not - but it is worth buying to add to your collection and the diversity of fragrances worn.  If you can pick it up in the $20-$25 range, definitely jump on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I give BLV 4.0 stars out of 5.  The fragrance is unique enough to give it a shot.  Night swimming does the body good...</li>
            <li> I originally received this product as a gift when in Guam.  My wife thought it was great and was developed just for me.  It took a little while for it to get to my section of the U.S. but once here this is the only Toilette spray I use.</li>
