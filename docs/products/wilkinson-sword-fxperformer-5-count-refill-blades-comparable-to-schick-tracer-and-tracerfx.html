            <li>Fits the Schick Tracer, one of the all-time great shavers.</li>
            <li>great product and great vendor service</li>
            <li>Great blades.......</li>
            <li>the Wilkinson Sword FxPerformer fits the Schick tracer handle perfectly and gives maybe even a better shave than the Schick blades did.</li>
            <li>Every bit as good as Schick.</li>
            <li>perfect fit just what i was looking for</li>
            <li>Fit perfect on Schick FX and Tracer handles.</li>
            <li>Give a great easy shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to find that its still available from Wilkinson Sword.</li>
            <li>they fit great in my Shick FX</li>
            <li>I stick with my old Shick Tracer, and these blades work perfectly.</li>
            <li>My old Schick Tracer with these blades is still the best and easiest to use razor I have, including the 3-4-5 blade &amp;#34;newbies&#x27;!  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find out these were interchangeable for Schick Tracer -&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>My favorite blade of all-time.</li>
            <li>The Mach3 cuts better and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to buy it and tell my friends where to get the best shaving products on the market.</li>
            <li>I will be glad to recommend them and will buy them again.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more from Amazon.com</li>
            <li>Who feels that strongly about razor blades?  </li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of use in my Schick Diamond FX handle, I haven&#x27;t detected any degradation in steel performance with these new cartridges, though, to be honest, my scrutiny in that regard could be more rigorous.  </li>
            <li>These fit the Tracer handles made in the USA well.  </li>
            <li>Yep, they fit the schick tracer.  </li>
            <li>The shave is what i expected for the blades, good.</li>
            <li>Second one is ok</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old school, and I don&#x27;t like all of these new 3, 4, and more blkade razors with the swivel head.  </li>
            <li>these fit my old handle and offer a really close shave</li>
            <li>Again, thanks Wilkinson!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fd</li>
            <li>/&gt;They flex (which is valuable to some) and have only two blades which are easier to clean between by running water through them.  </li>
            <li>The wilkinson  blades are great no different from Schick blades that are hard to find.   </li>
            <li>Excellent product, sure beats the outrageous price of the tracer blades.</li>
            <li>Why does this generic brand cost MORE than the late Schick blades?  </li>
            <li>I bought these seeking a viable alternative to Schick Tracer FX blades which, being phased out, were now available for ridiculous sums.</li>
            <li>first blade I got from the pack was defective, would not fit the razor.  </li>

            <li> perfect fit just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Fit perfect on Schick FX and Tracer handles. The shave is what i expected for the blades, good. Just like the Schick blades.</li>
            <li> My favorite blade of all-time. I&#x27;m so happy to find that its still available from Wilkinson Sword. Fits the Schick Tracer, one of the all-time great shavers.</li>
            <li> Said will work for my razor. Was slightly too small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old school, and I don&#x27;t like all of these new 3, 4, and more blkade razors with the swivel head.  I stick with my old Shick Tracer, and these blades work perfectly. Also they arrived on time as advertised.</li>
            <li> Bracket is not what i thought I was gettting. Does not meet my needs. Return?? The wilkinson  blades are great no different from Schick blades that are hard to find.   The B-Que motor bracket is not what I needed.</li>
            <li> great product and great vendor service</li>
            <li> Wilkinson Sword FxPerformer, 5 Count Refill...- These fit the Tracer handles made in the USA well.  Tracer blades are no longer sold in the US, but these work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They flex (which is valuable to some) and have only two blades which are easier to clean between by running water through them.  This appears to make them last longer.  Not everyone falls for the &amp;#34;more blades&amp;#34; logic.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I don&#x27;t &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; them.  Who feels that strongly about razor blades?  I bought these seeking a viable alternative to Schick Tracer FX blades which, being phased out, were now available for ridiculous sums. Sellers tout FxPerformers as interchangeable so I bought a pack to see for myself. $8.99 seemed pricey but I went ahead just this once. Why does this generic brand cost MORE than the late Schick blades?  Is there added value? The world wonders. A visual inspection confirms no difference between these blade cartridges and the Schick Tracer FX cartridges, other than the generic-looking Wilkinson packaging.  After a couple weeks of use in my Schick Diamond FX handle, I haven&#x27;t detected any degradation in steel performance with these new cartridges, though, to be honest, my scrutiny in that regard could be more rigorous.  *** Update - Feb 2017 ***  These Wilkinson cartridges are so overpriced I switched to a Mach3 razor/cartridges.  The Mach3 cuts better and lasts longer. ☺  10 for $20.</li>
            <li> Yep, they fit the schick tracer.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference when I used these blades.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find!  My old Schick Tracer with these blades is still the best and easiest to use razor I have, including the 3-4-5 blade &amp;#34;newbies&#x27;!  and &amp;#34;vibrating&amp;#34; types! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, sure beats the outrageous price of the tracer blades.</li>
            <li> Very stupid move when Schick took the Tracer off the market. I&#x27;m glad I know I can use Google and Amazon to find things I need. the Wilkinson Sword FxPerformer fits the Schick tracer handle perfectly and gives maybe even a better shave than the Schick blades did. Thank you Wilkinson for this excellent product! I will definitely continue to buy it and tell my friends where to get the best shaving products on the market. Again, thanks Wilkinson!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fd</li>
            <li> these fit my old handle and offer a really close shave</li>
            <li> Work well in the Tracer handle</li>
            <li> These blades are very good and came as agreed.  I will be glad to recommend them and will buy them again.</li>
            <li> Great blades.......they fit great in my Shick FX</li>
            <li> Yes these blades do perform as well as the Tracer fx blades and they are not as expensive. I will be buying more from Amazon.com</li>
