            <li> Smells soooo good and is so relaxing in a foot bath</li>
            <li> This soak is great for tired and sore feel.  Feels nice after long day on my feet or working out.  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> I am famous for taking aleve after working 8 to 12 hour shifts on my feet BUT after soaking in this my feet felt better immediately, I was ache FREE!! it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item that has a great smell to it. It makes my skin so soft it feels new.  That being said I give less that a star to the price of the item. After purchasing this item on Amazon my husband purchased  it for me at the local Wal-Mart without realizing I had bought it through Amazon. I paid over 12 dollars for this item and he purchased for 3.50 at the Wal-Mart up the street. That is over 8 dollar difference which is highway robbery. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves. I have noticed this with a lot of items now and am more careful about just purchasing blindly from them.</li>
            <li> Super relaxing!!! Must have!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a family member and she loves this product. She soaks in it and it helps with minor aches and pains.</li>
            <li> very soothing and relaxing the scent fills the room and makes for a very relaxing soak.  Dead skin slides ride off.  Gross I know but that&#x27;s what you want :)</li>
            <li> Great Product -Will order again!</li>
            <li> Very soothing!!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is not your mother&#x27;s Epsom Salts. It smells great and very soothing. I would encourage anyone to try this product.</li>
            <li> I like the product. Its so soothing to be able to soak your tired feet with a product like this. Ive added it to my pedicure  regimen. I would buy again in bulk if given the opp for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and price. I highly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> Very soothing.  My husband and I both use it and love the way our feet feel afterwards.  The scent relaxes your whole body too as you breathe in.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a new product to try so i came across this product.I have tired achy feet and on my feet hrs and this product works very well.Im very pleased with the scents available its amazing.I will defiently by more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> It does what it says...........great product!</li>
            <li> I have always used epsom salts for soaking my feet, but the peppermint was a nice new touch.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> It smells great! Envigorating! Feel so nice to soak my feet in this especially since im on my feet all day!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, its refreshing but not overpowering, like sweet peppermint tea. I use this product with a conair foot bath. [[ASIN:B004D22N2E Conair True Massaging Foot Bath With Bubbles and Heat, White]] For bad calluses I add Dr Teals, plus baking soda to very warm water and soak feet for 20 minutes. Then I use this pumice stone, wet [[ASIN:B000HZ9L8K Earth Therapeutics Natural Sierra Pumice Stone]] to remove the dead skin. Next, I pat my feet dry and coat them with petroleum jelly and put on socks. It takes about an hour for jelly to absorb into my skin and voila! My dry, cracked, and callused feet are vastly improved.</li>
            <li> Unlike some reviewers, I did not find the peppermint epsom salts overpowering; however, I only used about one-half cup in a foot soaking tub.  Although I have used epsom salts for decades, this is my first experience using Dr. Teal&#x27;s and I would recommend them and I most certainly will purchase The Dr. Teal&#x27;s variety of soaking solutions again.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this foot soak. It is refreshing after a long day of running around in the summer heat and the scent isn&#x27;t too overpowering - just right.</li>
            <li> Did ok. Wasn&#x27;t very powerful relief</li>
