    <ol>
            <li>I wasnt very happy</li>
            <li>I bought this wig to cosplay Lucy from Elfen Lied and it was perfect!</li>
            <li>i cut the bangs and this became the perfect costume wig for Princess Bubblegum from &amp;#34;Adventure Time.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Best Halloween ever!</li>
            <li>This wig is perfect for a Luka cosplay.</li>
            <li>(though that seems to be an uncommon issue)&lt;br /&gt;Thinner</li>
            <li>Over all it was great.</li>
            <li>Very happy with quality and price , beautiful fun wig !</li>
            <li>which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>For Halloween or anything else, perhaps wear a hat over the top and it&#x27;ll look great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good wig, my girlfriend used it for her cosplay and she loved it and is gonna use it for more cosplays</li>
            <li>: The packaging was not as nice as the purple wig</li>
            <li>It looks kind of ratty and the wig cap is visible on the top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purple: First off, the packaging was very nice, it came in a ziplock bag and netting (the norm with wigs) as well as a hair tie to keep the wig from flying everywhere when you pull it out.</li>
            <li>tangles quite easily though so just run your fingers through it often to make sure it looks nice.</li>
            <li>so plus side: It was the length, cut, and lovely color depicted in the photo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wigs do come with hooks and has a deeper cap than most wigs</li>
            <li>but they are NOT skin top</li>
            <li>Love the wig and the length</li>
            <li>but I love it anyway.</li>
            <li>Color doesn&#x27;t look good with my skin color, but that&#x27;s not the manufacturer&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  if you&#x27;re bald and have a small head, perfect for you!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving this another star because the color was beautiful, and it came with a nice wig cap.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure you can steam it or use wig spray to fix it quickly.</li>
            <li>Met my expectations, it has great color and is easy to wear, I think it lost a star because it tangled after every time I wore it, it was simple to untangle</li>
            <li>Color and length were accurate to what was shown in picture.</li>
            <li>For the price it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m super happy that I bought it</li>
            <li>Overall i was super happy with this wig.</li>
            <li>I chose 5 stars for this wig because of its great price and for this price i think it is good quality in comparison to some more expensive costume wigs sold by halloween stores.</li>
            <li>tangled pretty easily</li>
            <li>It tangled pretty easily</li>
            <li>It was exactly the color and length in the picture and was super easy to style.</li>
            <li>think this is a great wig to get, and then cut down to a shorter size (if need be).&lt;br /&gt;Free</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how soft the wig was, also was not super shiny</li>
            <li>sure it tangles easy, its a really long wing.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, I only got this to try on for fun and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Alright, first off, I bought this wig for cosplaying Princess Bubblegum.&lt;br /&gt;Okay</li>
            <li>Pretty much the quality you&#x27;d expect for the price...was better quality than a similarly priced Halloween shop wig though.</li>
            <li>than I thought it should beâ€”parts of the white part underneath could be seen.&lt;br /&gt;Frizzed pretty easily.</li>
            <li>It tangles easily and is rather coarse.</li>
            <li>I do wish the wig was slightly thicker, but for cosplay or halloween, this is a nice choice.</li>
            <li>I really do like this wig.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and it was just what I needed for my Luka Cosplay.</li>
            <li>, It sheaded a lot and it tangled so much.</li>
            <li>For the price I really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>but that isnt much of an issue since I have hair ties.</li>
            <li>The wig is actually much duller and darker than pictured.</li>
            <li>tangle that easily just as long as you brush it after you use it.</li>
            <li>The wig itself is very soft and very long, the color is a bit more pastel than in the picture</li>
            <li>This wig is much softer and longer than you can find at most anywhere else for less than $12.</li>
            <li>Thirty minutes later the brush was removed and the whole right side looked like the spiderwebs you buy in the haloween store.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  </li>
            <li>ordered both the light pink and purple</li>
            <li>Wig was kind of messy when it arrived I have ordered several wigs online</li>
            <li>I find this wig easier to brush than the curly ones i have purchased in the past and have only experienced minor &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; with all of the wigs i have purchased from here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft!</li>
            <li>You can see the wefts through the hair in a few places and it will also tangle quite easily</li>
            <li>Also, it came in quickly just as all of the other wigs I have bought from this</li>
            <li>Only thing i really have to complain about this shipping time.</li>
            <li>so order early or get faster shippment.</li>
            <li>and this one just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut it kind of thin</li>
            <li>long, and styled like the picture (chin-length bangs, straight hair)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pretty pink.</li>
            <li>I mean I have a LOT of hair, but have found better coverage in short and close cut wigs.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> long, and styled like the picture (chin-length bangs, straight hair)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pretty pink.</li>
            <li> I mean I have a LOT of hair, but have found better coverage in short and close cut wigs.</li>
            <li> also i had to trim the bangs, there were alot of long hairs mixed in and the bottom foot of hair was brittle.</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; for my daughter to use, feels and looks like real hair, does tangle easily, i actually have real long hair and can tell you that if you have hair this long, it tangles about just as easily and is just as annoying to try to style and keep knots out of.</li>
            <li> Pros: soft, very pretty pink, hasn&#x27;t shedded at all, arrived on time along with a wig cap!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: very thin in front, could see wig cap through it.</li>
            <li> and so your regular hair (if dark) Will definitely shoe through without a wig cap.</li>
            <li> as with any long hair when brushing start from the bottom and make your life easier.</li>
            <li> this wig is EXTREMELY long I am 5&#x27;1</li>
            <li> The wig was extremely long when I received it.</li>
            <li> Too long</li>
            <li> The length is accurate but the wig is so thin, that only a few strands hang down across the back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> but it did come with a black wig cap (I suggest buying a white or skin colored cap if you want to order this wig), it also did not have the hair bands that the purple did</li>
            <li> , true-to-image pink color.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I had to cut it which is expected</li>
            <li> Maybe if you&#x27;re really careful you can wear this wig.</li>
            <li> had ordered both wigs at the same time along with a few other items and I can say that there was quite the difference between the wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I did receive what I paid for, but if I would say that if you have dark or thick hair, you may want to invest in a slightly more expensive one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thick enough to cover my back and comes down about half way down my thighs so its long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Very small, barely fit me and I have notoriously thin hair and small head.  </li>
            <li> The only cons were that it was a little thin in the back</li>
            <li> I personally have naturally thick hair,</li>
            <li> and it went down to my knees.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat thin in the back but not too bad and easy to cover up.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a black wig cap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink</li>
            <li> I recieved it in the mail, slightly tangled and tried to brush it out.</li>
            <li> came somewhat crushed in the packaging since there wasn&#x27;t a cardboard frame to protect the wig so they did have some curves and waves that went in weird ways which shows that they were either in that position for a long long time or that they were exposed to heat and molded into that position.</li>
            <li> it was a little time consuming.</li>
            <li> For me, it was so thin that I couldn&#x27;t place the locks in the back and sides without it looking so</li>
            <li> One ill sweep of the hand and it was completely tangled with the brush inside.</li>
            <li> I had to keep spraying it with a fabric softener solution I made to tame it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Sheds excessively</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit shinner than the pink wig but it doesnt tangle as bad as the pink wig in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Main disappointment is how thin the wig is; I found it to be very thin</li>
            <li> This wig is not a good choice for cosplay.</li>
            <li> I was also upset because of how thin it is, and how thick it looked in the photo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and it went past my butt!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Thin</li>
            <li> Thin.</li>
            <li> but I feel like they gave me the wrong color??</li>
            <li> and the wig is very thin.</li>
            <li> but it was very thin</li>

            <li> I purchased this wig for a Princess Bubblegum costume last year. And while I didnâ€™t get to actually wear the costume, I did try the wig on, and I currently have it in storage in case I need it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Nice, true-to-image pink color.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;Very long, and styled like the picture (chin-length bangs, straight hair)&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great wig to get, and then cut down to a shorter size (if need be).&lt;br /&gt;Free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Mine tangled pretty easily (though that seems to be an uncommon issue)&lt;br /&gt;Thinner than I thought it should beâ€”parts of the white part underneath could be seen.&lt;br /&gt;Frizzed pretty easily. I had to keep spraying it with a fabric softener solution I made to tame it.</li>
            <li> I really do like this wig. The shipping was fast and it was just what I needed for my Luka Cosplay. Only cons: It&#x27;s Thin, It sheaded a lot and it tangled so much. I give it 8/10.</li>
            <li> Wig is shipping from China took forever which i wouldnt have minded if i had been told before hand that the wig was coming from over seas. Wig was kind of messy when it arrived I have ordered several wigs online and this one just doesn&#x27;t seem to cut it kind of thin but I&#x27;m going to make it work for the cosplay costume I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars for this wig because of its great price and for this price i think it is good quality in comparison to some more expensive costume wigs sold by halloween stores. I purchased this wig for &amp;#34;playtime dress up&amp;#34; for my daughter to use, feels and looks like real hair, does tangle easily, i actually have real long hair and can tell you that if you have hair this long, it tangles about just as easily and is just as annoying to try to style and keep knots out of. as with any long hair when brushing start from the bottom and make your life easier. I find this wig easier to brush than the curly ones i have purchased in the past and have only experienced minor &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; with all of the wigs i have purchased from here. Very happy with quality and price , beautiful fun wig !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wig, my girlfriend used it for her cosplay and she loved it and is gonna use it for more cosplays</li>
            <li> Met my expectations, it has great color and is easy to wear, I think it lost a star because it tangled after every time I wore it, it was simple to untangle it was a little time consuming. Over all it was great. Delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> Alright, first off, I bought this wig for cosplaying Princess Bubblegum.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so plus side: It was the length, cut, and lovely color depicted in the photo. Also, it came in quickly just as all of the other wigs I have bought from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;The negatives: It tangles easily and is rather coarse. I was also upset because of how thin it is, and how thick it looked in the photo. I personally have naturally thick hair, I mean I have a LOT of hair, but have found better coverage in short and close cut wigs. For me, it was so thin that I couldn&#x27;t place the locks in the back and sides without it looking so obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did receive what I paid for, but if I would say that if you have dark or thick hair, you may want to invest in a slightly more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Pros: soft, very pretty pink, hasn&#x27;t shedded at all, arrived on time along with a wig cap!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: very thin in front, could see wig cap through it.

Color doesn&#x27;t look good with my skin color, but that&#x27;s not the manufacturer&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  if you&#x27;re bald and have a small head, perfect for you! Also might work with a flesh colored or white cap.  Luckily for me, I only got this to try on for fun and it was cheap. For Halloween or anything else, perhaps wear a hat over the top and it&#x27;ll look great.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how soft the wig was, also was not super shiny which is a good thing. Color and length were accurate to what was shown in picture. Main disappointment is how thin the wig is; I found it to be very thin and so your regular hair (if dark) Will definitely shoe through without a wig cap. For the price I really can&#x27;t complain.  This wig is much softer and longer than you can find at most anywhere else for less than $12. It will work well for my princess bubblegum ccostume</li>
            <li> 2 Reviews!!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered both the light pink and purple so two different reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered both wigs at the same time along with a few other items and I can say that there was quite the difference between the wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purple: First off, the packaging was very nice, it came in a ziplock bag and netting (the norm with wigs) as well as a hair tie to keep the wig from flying everywhere when you pull it out. The wig is a bit shinner than the pink wig but it doesnt tangle as bad as the pink wig in my opinion. It is somewhat thin in the back but not too bad and easy to cover up. It also comes with a black wig cap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink: The packaging was not as nice as the purple wig but it did come with a black wig cap (I suggest buying a white or skin colored cap if you want to order this wig), it also did not have the hair bands that the purple did but that isnt much of an issue since I have hair ties. The wig itself is very soft and very long, the color is a bit more pastel than in the picture and the wig is very thin. You can see the wefts through the hair in a few places and it will also tangle quite easily so I suggest detangler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wigs do come with hooks and has a deeper cap than most wigs but they are NOT skin top wigs!&lt;br /&gt;Both came somewhat crushed in the packaging since there wasn&#x27;t a cardboard frame to protect the wig so they did have some curves and waves that went in weird ways which shows that they were either in that position for a long long time or that they were exposed to heat and molded into that position.</li>
            <li> this wig is EXTREMELY long I am 5&#x27;1 and it went down to my knees. I had to cut it which is expected but it was very thin and you could see the netting in the back. I wasnt very happy but I guess for the price i can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig to cosplay Lucy from Elfen Lied and it was perfect! It was exactly the color and length in the picture and was super easy to style. For the price it was fantastic. The only cons were that it was a little thin in the back but it wasn&#x27;t noticeable at all unless you were holding it. It tangled pretty easily but I&#x27;m sure you can steam it or use wig spray to fix it quickly. Overall I&#x27;m super happy that I bought it and I will definitely buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> The wig is actually much duller and darker than pictured. The length is accurate but the wig is so thin, that only a few strands hang down across the back and shoulders. It looks kind of ratty and the wig cap is visible on the top. This wig is not a good choice for cosplay. -Josh&#x27;s girlfriend</li>
            <li> Pretty much the quality you&#x27;d expect for the price...was better quality than a similarly priced Halloween shop wig though. I do wish the wig was slightly thicker, but for cosplay or halloween, this is a nice choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft! The wig was extremely long when I received it. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; and it went past my butt!! So I cut it so that it would only go to about my waist.&lt;br /&gt;It tangles quite easily though so just run your fingers through it often to make sure it looks nice.</li>
            <li> For $10 this wig is a STEAL. sure it tangles easy, its a really long wing. also i had to trim the bangs, there were alot of long hairs mixed in and the bottom foot of hair was brittle. Overall i was super happy with this wig. Only thing i really have to complain about this shipping time. it took 1 1/2 months to get it so order early or get faster shippment. Im no pro cosplayer, just wanted to do a family halloween theme.</li>
            <li> Love the wig and the length but I feel like they gave me the wrong color?? I&#x27;m not sure but I love it anyway.</li>
            <li> I recieved it in the mail, slightly tangled and tried to brush it out. One ill sweep of the hand and it was completely tangled with the brush inside. Thirty minutes later the brush was removed and the whole right side looked like the spiderwebs you buy in the haloween store. I&#x27;m only giving this another star because the color was beautiful, and it came with a nice wig cap. Maybe if you&#x27;re really careful you can wear this wig.</li>
            <li> i cut the bangs and this became the perfect costume wig for Princess Bubblegum from &amp;#34;Adventure Time.&amp;#34; Best Halloween ever!</li>
            <li> This wig is perfect for a Luka cosplay.It does shed at first,but after brushing after each use it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick enough to cover my back and comes down about half way down my thighs so its long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t tangle that easily just as long as you brush it after you use it.</li>
            <li> Too long but it&#x27;s what I was expecting. Thin. Sheds excessively but it&#x27;s $11 so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations.  Pretty pink.</li>
