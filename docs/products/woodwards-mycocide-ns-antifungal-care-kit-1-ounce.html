            <li>I am so happy to have my healthy normal looking toenail back</li>
            <li>THE ONLY GOOD THINGS IS THAT YOU GET 2 NAIL GRINDERS AND CLIPPER,</li>
            <li>To be honest: only the xtra depth filers worked, hence the two stars</li>
            <li>I tried many things, natural and over the counter and nothing seemed to help.  </li>
            <li>Like before, I&#x27;m going to sand a little off the top of my affected 4 nails each day and apply the anti-fungal to the top and under the leading edge of the nails.  </li>

            <li>After 1&lt;br /&gt;year...if you put too much on your nails...the nail will start rounding up.&lt;br /&gt;Its not 100 effective...but does help a bit.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Pretty soon, with sanding, the nail becomes quite thin and that gives the ointment better access to the fungus</li>

            <li>The cream is light and watery, so it&#x27;s not potent enough compared to Lamasil.</li>
            <li>Ive seen changes for the better and for the worse.</li>
            <li>Even though I followed the directions, washed my feet night and day w/ white vinegar, and applied this junk, there was very little results on the first stages of my fungal infection.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yes, the box is misleading in that the pictures and labeling don&#x27;t match the directions.  However, I have had luck in the past using fungicides and sandpaper in reversing under-the-nail fungus without resorting to the doctor prescribed oral medicines which potentially can damage the liver and require tests for that.  I have had a recurrence and I&#x27;m hopeful that my old \\&quot;cure\\&quot; will work again with this product.  Like before, I&#x27;m going to sand a little off the top of my affected 4 nails each day and apply the anti-fungal to the top and under the leading edge of the nails.  Pretty soon, with sanding, the nail becomes quite thin and that gives the ointment better access to the fungus and hopefully I will again be rid of the fungus.  The product directions make no mention of the \\&quot;grinder boards\\&quot; and I&#x27;m not sure how they were intended to be used, but this what I&#x27;ve come up with before as a home remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My belief is that by constantly being on guard to control any \\&quot;athletes foot\\&quot; between the toes will keep one from getting fungus started under the nails.  I know I&#x27;ve been lax in the past in keeping after foot fungal infections and I believe that&#x27;s how I got it under the nails.</li>
            <li> Myocide is a good product. It does what it claims, not instantly. but over time. The seller was efficient in its delivery estimate.</li>
            <li> The photo implies the product works on toenails. The actual directions say it does not. Had I known that ahead of time I would not have purchased the product.</li>
            <li> ON THE BOX IT SHOW A PICTURE OF TOENAILS THAT ARE BROWN AND UGLY THAT CLEARS UP IN THE LAST PICTURE. I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE OF THE BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES OF THE TOENAILS, WHEN I READ THE DIRECTIONS ON THE BACK OF THE BOTTLE IT SAID THAT THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EFFECTIVE ON FINGERNAILS AND TOENAILS. I WAS LIKE WHAT IN THE WORLD!!! WHY HAVE BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES OF TOENAILS AND IT&#x27;S NOT USED FOR TOENAILS. THE BOTTLE STATES IT IS USED FOR RINGWORM AND ATHLETE&#x27;S FOOT. I DONT SEE WHAT THOSE 2 HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES OF NAILS. I GUESS THE ONLY GOOD THINGS IS THAT YOU GET 2 NAIL GRINDERS AND CLIPPER, WELL THATS NOT REALLY A GOOD THING BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THOSE FROM THE DOLLAR STORES. THEY SHOULD STATE ON THE BOX THAT IT IS NOT FOR NAILS OR NOT SHOW BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES OF NAILS ON THE BOX.</li>
            <li> The problem with my toenails has improved, but slowly.&lt;br /&gt;The issue is that nothing else works; so slow is better than&lt;br /&gt;no change at all.</li>
            <li> The packaging clearly shows before and after nails so you would assume that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s used for. Once you read the directions, it states not to be used on nails. How deceptive is that?</li>
            <li> The back label of this product pictured on the right reads: &amp;#34;This will not work on scalp or nails&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Easy to use</li>
            <li> The Mycocide purchased from just.otc advertised the product as including a nail clipper.  The box that I received had no nail clipper included.  I emailed the seller about the problem.  The seller did not ever respond to my email to date.  For this ignoring of my inquiry, I give this seller the lowest rating.</li>
            <li> All feet are different and some medication will work fast for some and&lt;br /&gt;slow for others... Im a lifetime jogger, which means i jog in the woods, city&lt;br /&gt; and swamppy land that means my feet have been throught lots of wet stuff.&lt;br /&gt;And that brought on fungus strains that slowy eats or deforms your nails&lt;br /&gt;and even add in different colors if not treated.  By using this product, it&lt;br /&gt;seems to have stalled or stopped the fungus on some toes. There is improvement&lt;br /&gt;but the big test will be the severely affected big toes...have to wait a few&lt;br /&gt;more weeks to see the results on those.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product that i have used that is making a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New update: Ive seen changes for the better and for the worse. Keep putting this&lt;br /&gt;stuff on between the toes and dont put too much on the nail itself. After 1&lt;br /&gt;year...if you put too much on your nails...the nail will start rounding up.&lt;br /&gt;Its not 100 effective...but does help a bit.&lt;br /&gt;If you have too much nail damage....go check with your doctor for a better&lt;br /&gt;formula.</li>
            <li> This worked great for my mother. It does take quite a while though, be patient.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for nails, however on my feet- THE BEST!!! I have a lot of trouble with my feet, and tried several products, this one is the best for my feet. Again, it does not work on nails!</li>
            <li> Good product.. Well received</li>
            <li> My toenails are infected and have greenish-yellowed, so I went to RiteAid and purchased the kit. The only reason I believed this would work because of the additional filers and nail clippers. Well, I was wrong. The nail clippers would bend the nail, but not throughly cut regardless how thin my nails were. The cream is light and watery, so it&#x27;s not potent enough compared to Lamasil. Even though I followed the directions, washed my feet night and day w/ white vinegar, and applied this junk, there was very little results on the first stages of my fungal infection. The only \\&quot;improvement\\&quot; was two weeks and half later my nails turned yellow. Do not waste your valuable earnings on this junk. To be honest: only the xtra depth filers worked, hence the two stars rating.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> This product works but will take over 6 months over every day and keeping nails trim . I recommend this product</li>
            <li> After having gel nails removed, I developed a really bad &amp;#34;fungus&amp;#34; or infection.  Nails split, became loose, and had white and yellow specks  all over.  After using Mycocide for two months, my nails are finally clearing up (I keep clipping off the ends).  I had tried everryting, including an expensive anti-fungal cream, and this is the only thing has worked for me.  I don&#x27;t know why there is confusion about the  box labeling -- perhaps it&#x27;s a Democratic owned company.</li>
            <li> About 10 years ago after receiving an unsanitary pedicure my toe nail started thickening, yellowing, and loosening from the nail bed.  I went to podiatrist and they told me it wasn&#x27;t a fungus.  I started trying to find natural things I could do for this ugly toenail.  I tried many things, natural and over the counter and nothing seemed to help.  Years later I went to another podiatrist, still telling me it wasn&#x27;t fungus with no answers as to what I can do with this ugly now painful nail.  I was so embarrassed I NEVER went without polish I decided I had to learn to live with it.  This last year is got so bad my toe nail was totally loosening from the nail bed, curling into my skin, and was extremely painful I had to try something, anything.  I found Mycocide and started to use it. In the past with other treatments I had to have polish removed and for this one I could leave my polish on to continue to hide my ugly nail. After applying it for 2 months on top of around and under my toenail it was finally cleared up.  My toenail is no longer yellow, and it&#x27;s shape and thickness was totally back to normal! Athletes foot is caused by the Tinea fungus, which is often the same type of fungus that effects toe nails.  I haven&#x27;t gone to get a pedicure for over 10 years and will never do it again.  I do my own feet, properly disinfect my tools, use new files every time.  I am so happy to have my healthy normal looking toenail back I will be sure to keep it that way! Totally happy with Mycocide.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find this product locally and I was so happy to find I could order it.  An absolutely wonderful product!</li>
