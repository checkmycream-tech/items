            <li>AND LOOKS GOOD</li>
            <li>it is good for something.</li>
            <li>THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the teeth.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect, but for the price it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I really love them!</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time about my beautiful smile!  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use, but getting the perfect fit does take some work.</li>
            <li>Truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li>but I never did get the beads to work that are supposed to make them clip over your own teeth.  </li>
            <li>I would of liked them to be whiter like my own teeth but for pics I can adjust the brihtness scale to gleaming.</li>
            <li>so I could mold my own teeth....</li>
            <li>Wonderful, takes a bit of fitting,  but once done right,  </li>
            <li>The product was easy to use and when they are in they look really good.</li>
            <li>Use the container to keep them away from pets, my dog used to grab my eyeglasses off the coffee table, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d love to chew this!</li>
            <li>the denture adhesive worked but could bearly keep the teeth on just the top of your own teeth...</li>
            <li>surprised how good they work!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get a perfect fit the first time but</li>
            <li>The fit is superb, the look is decent, and I can talk without any issues.</li>
            <li>Fit fine and look good.</li>
            <li>I am sure they will look much better.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I readjusted them.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to read the instructions, follow the instructions</li>
            <li>You will love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li>After watching that and reading some reviews (most of which were favorable...)</li>
            <li>and I immediately opened them and began the fitting process.</li>
            <li>TO MAKE MORE DURABLE&lt;</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T QUIT RE MOLDING or RE FITTING until it FITS</li>
            <li>The more time you spend with it the more they feel better.  </li>
            <li>it helped me with feeling better about the situation for the time being.</li>
            <li>What better place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of time and patience to do-it-yourself. :)</li>
            <li>made sure to follow both the written and video instructions, that&#x27;s a MUST.</li>
            <li>I dipped either one side or the top part in simmering water to re-loosen it and re-mold it.</li>
            <li>They do give you more than needed as it says, so I trimmed a bit off.</li>
            <li>Wearing them gives me more confidence.</li>
            <li>better off ordering the others from rogers.</li>
            <li>they are more like the real thing and work great.</li>
            <li>The directions need to be more understanding.</li>
            <li>she doesnt have a couple of grand to redo the front of her mouth.</li>
            <li>Over-all satisfied.</li>
            <li>most people couldn&#x27;t tell what I had done.</li>
            <li>They are ok</li>
            <li>the good thing is you can get another chance until it&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>Great fit the first time...</li>
            <li>I laughed at him at first</li>
            <li>He was able to get a very secure fit.</li>
            <li>I do recomend this product for a quick fix of your own teeth.</li>
            <li>Anyway, after 20 minutes and 3 re-simmers of the water, I finally had them in for a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>they would have been better just drawing teeth on a piece of paper for you to fit on top of your teeth.</li>
            <li>(watch the web video if you can) and most importantly; TAKE YOUR TIME AND DONT USE A MICROWAVE.  </li>
            <li>Way easy.</li>
            <li>It was easy to fix an to my surprize</li>
            <li>I found the instructions easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>and they worked fine for that.</li>
            <li>make it easy to fit.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to fit in your mouth and they stay.</li>
            <li>The front teeth are slightly large but it&#x27;s so amazing regardless....</li>
            <li>You have to  work a little to get a perfect fit</li>
            <li>They let you watch the video on how to make these work (fit them to your teeth and mouth step by step).</li>
            <li>but they look absolutely fantastic</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get them to fit correctly in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>He lost the 4 teeth in the front top smile line and we have NO dental insurance or the amount of cash at this time to do any type of replacement at this time .  </li>
            <li>could not get to fit.  </li>
            <li>until I do I&#x27;m going to enjoy and recommend these.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love the way you look I can smile again</li>
            <li>it was important to me when I broke my front tooth</li>
            <li>I believe these work best for those missing front teeth.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing some more real soon just to keep on hand love it</li>
            <li>so I think I am also but for the price they are good for a new smile.</li>
            <li>I had been excited to get them all weekend and was elated when they arrived.</li>
            <li>I am pretty crafty and thought maybe we could work something out of it!  </li>
            <li>but they are worth it!</li>
            <li>As far as fitting the device it did take a pretty good amount of time to get it just right.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing job with these teeth so far!</li>
            <li>after a little experimenting and more trys,i pretty much think that i did get the best fit.</li>
            <li>REMOVE AND REMELT until it sits good and not to low</li>
            <li>If the measurements were true to size on the chart, it would of not been a problem</li>
            <li>you will get the right fit.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>Not a long term solution, but if you are willing to take your time to fit it properly it is a great temporary fix until you can have real dental work done.</li>
            <li>They can absolutely change even the most messed up smile.</li>
            <li>luckily, you can remold over and over again to re-set them.</li>
            <li>I super glue it to the front tooth</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anybody for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>Also, I had to melt the stuff 4 times before I got a better fit, and I use the word better loosely.</li>
            <li>The product looks pretty good and has definitely helped my husband&#x27;s self esteem.</li>
            <li>These will work, I used them before I saved up money to have a lot of cavaties filled in the front of my mouth, they were really unsightly.  </li>
            <li>this product was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>these teeth were unbelieveably BIG like Mr. Ed the horse, honestly.</li>
            <li>have the 2 grand+ to get my teeth fixed but</li>
            <li>I work in an industry where the smile is everything.</li>
            <li>what the problem was, they are flat and just fit over the top of your teeth.</li>
            <li>I finally feel confident when I smile!</li>
            <li>but after a few times I had a pretty good fit</li>
            <li>came right away in the mail</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>BUT something still wasnt right</li>
            <li>It took me two try&#x27;s to get them fitted right</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t set right</li>
            <li>KEEP THE FAITH-It will work if you are patient and remold and remold till it&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I am skeptical of most too good to be true quick fixes.  </li>
            <li>the other ones from rogers work so much better and look more real.</li>
            <li>Looks natural, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Try fresh the next day. :)</li>
            <li>I will never order the natural pair again they stain easily</li>
            <li>they are not secure more like costume teeth,, plus the material for the inside doesnt melt and the additional plastic to help make a bridge doesnt melt, had to melt in hot water did not melt at all to even be able to roll plastic or pull apart,,,,</li>
            <li>As far as the look of the product when my husband is speaking I wouldn&#x27;t know he he was wearing it if I wasn&#x27;t aware of the situation, it looks fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You should be aware that they are not kidding when they say do not eat with them.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>i should have gone to my doc and gotten the real snap-on smile that custom fits my teeth.</li>
            <li>if they were like actual dentures or like one cap you snap into place and snap out, this would be a better item.</li>
            <li>Exactly what the heading says.</li>
            <li>ORDER THE EXTRA BEADS FOR FITTING</li>
            <li>Drinking sips of hot water will help loosen it if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First these are cosmetic to hide your flaws, just like you wear make-up so don&#x27;t expect dentures.</li>
            <li>Decent quick fix.</li>
            <li>But I also only need the front 4-5 to look okay</li>
            <li>It probably won&#x27;t happen the first try.  </li>
            <li>And the right fit ultimately means  the right look.  </li>
            <li>If anything I would have drawn more attention to my teeth with them on than I would with my own poorly looking front teeth.</li>
            <li>first try is really a disaster.</li>
            <li>But I do think these would work just fine for people that do not have this problem and of course only for occasions such as job interviews for instance or public appearances where you want to make a good impression.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t perfect, (I think that&#x27;s ONLY due to the fact that I bought the large instead of small), but they are WAY better than what I supposed $40 dollars would get me.</li>
            <li>I first saw this item in an ad from a different supplier and was the most excited I&#x27;ve been in a long time.</li>
            <li>I purchased a large and they were a bit too large.</li>
            <li>Oh also, the stock picture they show is for the size large.</li>
            <li>They do not look as real as the other brand sold out there, but even my brother did not notice they were not my teeeth until I smiled big enough that he could see the color difference in my own teeth.</li>
            <li>I have no stains, though I would strongly suggest after the clear polish dries completely, brushing the teeth and using Listerine on them to remove the toxic taste.</li>
            <li>You may have to try more than once to get the perfect fit, so don&#x27;t get frustrated the first few minutes.</li>
            <li>speech was fine today, just the occasional \\&quot;shound\\&quot; people make with a denture, I haven&#x27;t tried eating</li>
            <li>Great  hard for people to notice them, I had one person ask me if I had clear braces on thow.  </li>
            <li>I can feel a little more confident in public until I can purchae real</li>
            <li>you are thinking about purchasing this product and you can&#x27;t afford to purchase the real thing....</li>
            <li>Also, if you are just out of prison and you don&#x27;t have much money.  </li>
            <li>Now I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be a replacement for real teeth or even what the dentist can do and</li>
            <li>and you really do have to be prepared to \\&quot;hold</li>
            <li>I really am in search of something snap on.</li>
            <li>If you open the plastic bag to look at this cheap piece of plastic - then no return.</li>
            <li>These look so real</li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT REAL PICS&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT REAL PICS&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li>You have to spend some time getting these to fit properly but it will do it</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It took me a couple of times and  still I found my problem was I couldn&#x27;t tell by looking straight on in the mirror where my teeth were underneath to align them</li>
            <li>To me these look so real</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Very dissaponted</li>
            <li>These things fit well even though they do take some patience to get set properly.</li>
            <li>I had a front crown break off at the gum and had to find an affordable fix fast.</li>
            <li>Once I got the fit right, I hardly have any speech impediments and I can finally smile again without being mortified!</li>
            <li>Despite the personal self conscious issues - he works in a job that deals with the public and appearance is very important!  </li>
            <li>After we played with it and molded and remolded it a bunch of times it fit snug and doesnt look bad - he wears it only to work to keep it in the best condition until we get something</li>
            <li>and I cut off, then  sand down most of the side edges.</li>
            <li>I was able to drink cold liquids with mine, and some warm coffee, did not even try to eat with them.  </li>
            <li>:)     I have just added my actual before &amp; after picture above the reviews.</li>
            <li>I will rate it high because the product is worthwhile............unless you have protruding teeth.</li>
            <li>The fitting is a little tricky but keep trying.</li>
            <li>your teeth exactly as instructed on their site, that is a major point.</li>
            <li>exactly as instructed on their site, that is a major point.</li>
            <li>It is possible to eat soft foods while at work if i loosen them slightly to clean out any food stuck inside with my finger.</li>
            <li>I wish I could get the dang things to stay on, they really look natural.</li>
            <li>SO we followed the directions, and it actually was worth it for the TEMPORARY FIX.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Public speaking, family functions, everything will be much improved for this small investement. :)</li>
            <li>Instant Smile Cosmetic Novelty</li>
            <li>If they are too white for you, I soaked mine overnight in tea until the color matched my more natural white.  </li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t live with all the embarrassment I felt.</li>
            <li>The instructions were very clear.</li>
            <li>You do have to have some common sense and patience when getting them to fit right.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband who has pretty severe decay in two of his front upper teeth.</li>
            <li>But wow to my surprize!</li>
            <li>I got hit in the face by a pretty hefty box during my last job and it completely snapped off one of my front two teeth.</li>
            <li>It is a little tricky to get them to fit your teeth</li>
            <li>When he is laughing really hard I can tell it is not his natural teeth, but still it is much better looking than his natural teeth.</li>
            <li>I immediately went directly to the Imako site to get as much info as possible.</li>
            <li>I had to remove a lot of the clear moldable material from places where it interfered with my bite.  </li>
            <li>Remember, they are soft, so you can not eat with them in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I ordered the natural.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s completely unnoticeable in pictures.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>trick was to mold them in a natural way (get the edges curved around you natural teeth line.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>My natural teeth are absolutely horrendous and made me constantly self conscious even while talking I was constantly embarrassed.</li>
            <li>but I finally figured it out and bought a few pairs (I recommend this because they wear out fairly easy.)</li>
            <li>, i have bad teeth and work a professional position, i use these all day long, every day of the week, easy to custom fit, very comfortable to wear, very realistic, and no one will know any different, the only reason i did not rate 5 stars is because they will only last about 2 weeks before starting to look yellow, so i have to keep ordering new ones...</li>
            <li>And given that we have no other options we decided to order it anyway.  </li>
            <li>but I am considering getting small as the two front are really large on the large ones.</li>
            <li>I made mistakes of smooshing the mold compound too high on my front gum, and too low on my back two sides.</li>
            <li>My husband spent the whole weekend</li>
            <li>I recently bought these imako cosmetic teeth and they have far surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>these from imako look so phoney and too white even though they call it natural in color.  </li>
            <li>I did take a sharp knife and gently sculpt each tooth to look like mine</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wish the &amp;#34;gums&amp;#34; looked a little more realistic.</li>
            <li>what a waste of money...guess it would be good for Halloween,to paint some of the teeth black for the missing teeth</li>
            <li>so I finally figured to hold them next to the teeth before I pressed and feel underneath to make sure the Imakos were lower than my partial which I don&#x27;t recommend, but I made them work over my own fakes as I have a bad looking tooth in front next to my partial</li>
            <li>I ordered small at first based on other reviews but upon sight I exchanged them for a large.</li>
            <li>It took me three tries to cover a gap of three missing teeth, but once you get it right, no one knows the difference, even up close!</li>
            <li>It does not look not even close to real, very hard to fit in mouse.  </li>
            <li>gave this product 3 stars because I dont really know for sure how wearing them for a period of time would have been or if anyone would notice them as I myself could not wear them that long due to them being uncomfortable from the protruding.</li>
            <li>After all the good and bad reviews.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Make sure you do not have protruding teeth!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are great!!!  </li>
            <li> absolutely wonderful customer service and product perfect</li>
            <li> PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Perfect for a prop we set up.</li>
            <li> Brilliant.</li>
            <li> (I asked people who would tell me the truth LOL).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been quite a while since I&#x27;ve been this happy.</li>
            <li> they look great</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great temporary patch.  </li>
            <li> LOL.  </li>
            <li> They are great for the price.  </li>
            <li> if you need dentures for the top but don&#x27;t have the money, roger&#x27;s works best.</li>
            <li> AND LOOKS GOOD</li>
            <li> it is good for something.</li>
            <li> THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the teeth.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t perfect, but for the price it was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love them!</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time about my beautiful smile!  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use, but getting the perfect fit does take some work.</li>
            <li> Truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li> but I never did get the beads to work that are supposed to make them clip over your own teeth.  </li>
            <li> I would of liked them to be whiter like my own teeth but for pics I can adjust the brihtness scale to gleaming.</li>
            <li> so I could mold my own teeth....</li>
            <li> Wonderful, takes a bit of fitting,  but once done right,  </li>
            <li> The product was easy to use and when they are in they look really good.</li>
            <li> Use the container to keep them away from pets, my dog used to grab my eyeglasses off the coffee table, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d love to chew this!</li>
            <li> the denture adhesive worked but could bearly keep the teeth on just the top of your own teeth...</li>
            <li> surprised how good they work!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a perfect fit the first time but</li>
            <li> The fit is superb, the look is decent, and I can talk without any issues.</li>
            <li> Fit fine and look good.</li>
            <li> I am sure they will look much better.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I readjusted them.</li>
            <li> You will be pleased.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to read the instructions, follow the instructions</li>
            <li> You will love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li> After watching that and reading some reviews (most of which were favorable...)</li>
            <li> and I immediately opened them and began the fitting process.</li>
            <li> TO MAKE MORE DURABLE&lt;</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T QUIT RE MOLDING or RE FITTING until it FITS</li>
            <li> The more time you spend with it the more they feel better.  </li>
            <li> it helped me with feeling better about the situation for the time being.</li>
            <li> What better place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time and patience to do-it-yourself. :)</li>
            <li> made sure to follow both the written and video instructions, that&#x27;s a MUST.</li>
            <li> I dipped either one side or the top part in simmering water to re-loosen it and re-mold it.</li>
            <li> They do give you more than needed as it says, so I trimmed a bit off.</li>
            <li> Wearing them gives me more confidence.</li>
            <li> better off ordering the others from rogers.</li>
            <li> they are more like the real thing and work great.</li>
            <li> The directions need to be more understanding.</li>
            <li> she doesnt have a couple of grand to redo the front of her mouth.</li>
            <li> Over-all satisfied.</li>
            <li> most people couldn&#x27;t tell what I had done.</li>
            <li> They are ok</li>
            <li> the good thing is you can get another chance until it&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> Great fit the first time...</li>
            <li> I laughed at him at first</li>
            <li> He was able to get a very secure fit.</li>
            <li> I do recomend this product for a quick fix of your own teeth.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after 20 minutes and 3 re-simmers of the water, I finally had them in for a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> they would have been better just drawing teeth on a piece of paper for you to fit on top of your teeth.</li>
            <li> (watch the web video if you can) and most importantly; TAKE YOUR TIME AND DONT USE A MICROWAVE.  </li>
            <li> Way easy.</li>
            <li> It was easy to fix an to my surprize</li>
            <li> I found the instructions easy to follow.  </li>
            <li> and they worked fine for that.</li>
            <li> make it easy to fit.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to fit in your mouth and they stay.</li>
            <li> The front teeth are slightly large but it&#x27;s so amazing regardless....</li>
            <li> You have to  work a little to get a perfect fit</li>
            <li> They let you watch the video on how to make these work (fit them to your teeth and mouth step by step).</li>
            <li> but they look absolutely fantastic</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them to fit correctly in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> He lost the 4 teeth in the front top smile line and we have NO dental insurance or the amount of cash at this time to do any type of replacement at this time .  </li>
            <li> could not get to fit.  </li>
            <li> until I do I&#x27;m going to enjoy and recommend these.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love the way you look I can smile again</li>
            <li> it was important to me when I broke my front tooth</li>
            <li> I believe these work best for those missing front teeth.  </li>
            <li> Will be purchasing some more real soon just to keep on hand love it</li>
            <li> so I think I am also but for the price they are good for a new smile.</li>
            <li> I had been excited to get them all weekend and was elated when they arrived.</li>
            <li> I am pretty crafty and thought maybe we could work something out of it!  </li>
            <li> but they are worth it!</li>
            <li> As far as fitting the device it did take a pretty good amount of time to get it just right.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing job with these teeth so far!</li>
            <li> after a little experimenting and more trys,i pretty much think that i did get the best fit.</li>
            <li> REMOVE AND REMELT until it sits good and not to low</li>
            <li> If the measurements were true to size on the chart, it would of not been a problem</li>
            <li> you will get the right fit.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Not a long term solution, but if you are willing to take your time to fit it properly it is a great temporary fix until you can have real dental work done.</li>
            <li> They can absolutely change even the most messed up smile.</li>
            <li> luckily, you can remold over and over again to re-set them.</li>
            <li> I super glue it to the front tooth</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anybody for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> Also, I had to melt the stuff 4 times before I got a better fit, and I use the word better loosely.</li>
            <li> The product looks pretty good and has definitely helped my husband&#x27;s self esteem.</li>
            <li> These will work, I used them before I saved up money to have a lot of cavaties filled in the front of my mouth, they were really unsightly.  </li>
            <li> this product was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> these teeth were unbelieveably BIG like Mr. Ed the horse, honestly.</li>
            <li> have the 2 grand+ to get my teeth fixed but</li>
            <li> I work in an industry where the smile is everything.</li>
            <li> what the problem was, they are flat and just fit over the top of your teeth.</li>
            <li> I finally feel confident when I smile!</li>
            <li> but after a few times I had a pretty good fit</li>
            <li> came right away in the mail</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> BUT something still wasnt right</li>
            <li> It took me two try&#x27;s to get them fitted right</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t set right</li>
            <li> KEEP THE FAITH-It will work if you are patient and remold and remold till it&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I am skeptical of most too good to be true quick fixes.  </li>
            <li> the other ones from rogers work so much better and look more real.</li>
            <li> Looks natural, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Try fresh the next day. :)</li>
            <li> I will never order the natural pair again they stain easily</li>
            <li> they are not secure more like costume teeth,, plus the material for the inside doesnt melt and the additional plastic to help make a bridge doesnt melt, had to melt in hot water did not melt at all to even be able to roll plastic or pull apart,,,,</li>
            <li> As far as the look of the product when my husband is speaking I wouldn&#x27;t know he he was wearing it if I wasn&#x27;t aware of the situation, it looks fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should be aware that they are not kidding when they say do not eat with them.</li>
            <li> but I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> i should have gone to my doc and gotten the real snap-on smile that custom fits my teeth.</li>
            <li> if they were like actual dentures or like one cap you snap into place and snap out, this would be a better item.</li>
            <li> Exactly what the heading says.</li>
            <li> ORDER THE EXTRA BEADS FOR FITTING</li>
            <li> Drinking sips of hot water will help loosen it if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First these are cosmetic to hide your flaws, just like you wear make-up so don&#x27;t expect dentures.</li>
            <li> Decent quick fix.</li>
            <li> But I also only need the front 4-5 to look okay</li>
            <li> It probably won&#x27;t happen the first try.  </li>
            <li> And the right fit ultimately means  the right look.  </li>
            <li> If anything I would have drawn more attention to my teeth with them on than I would with my own poorly looking front teeth.</li>
            <li> first try is really a disaster.</li>
            <li> But I do think these would work just fine for people that do not have this problem and of course only for occasions such as job interviews for instance or public appearances where you want to make a good impression.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t perfect, (I think that&#x27;s ONLY due to the fact that I bought the large instead of small), but they are WAY better than what I supposed $40 dollars would get me.</li>
            <li> I first saw this item in an ad from a different supplier and was the most excited I&#x27;ve been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased a large and they were a bit too large.</li>
            <li> Oh also, the stock picture they show is for the size large.</li>
            <li> They do not look as real as the other brand sold out there, but even my brother did not notice they were not my teeeth until I smiled big enough that he could see the color difference in my own teeth.</li>
            <li> I have no stains, though I would strongly suggest after the clear polish dries completely, brushing the teeth and using Listerine on them to remove the toxic taste.</li>
            <li> You may have to try more than once to get the perfect fit, so don&#x27;t get frustrated the first few minutes.</li>
            <li> speech was fine today, just the occasional \\&quot;shound\\&quot; people make with a denture, I haven&#x27;t tried eating</li>
            <li> Great  hard for people to notice them, I had one person ask me if I had clear braces on thow.  </li>
            <li> I can feel a little more confident in public until I can purchae real</li>
            <li> you are thinking about purchasing this product and you can&#x27;t afford to purchase the real thing....</li>
            <li> Also, if you are just out of prison and you don&#x27;t have much money.  </li>
            <li> Now I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be a replacement for real teeth or even what the dentist can do and</li>
            <li> and you really do have to be prepared to \\&quot;hold</li>
            <li> I really am in search of something snap on.</li>
            <li> If you open the plastic bag to look at this cheap piece of plastic - then no return.</li>
            <li> These look so real</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT REAL PICS&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT REAL PICS&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> You have to spend some time getting these to fit properly but it will do it</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of times and  still I found my problem was I couldn&#x27;t tell by looking straight on in the mirror where my teeth were underneath to align them</li>
            <li> To me these look so real</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Very dissaponted</li>
            <li> These things fit well even though they do take some patience to get set properly.</li>
            <li> I had a front crown break off at the gum and had to find an affordable fix fast.</li>
            <li> Once I got the fit right, I hardly have any speech impediments and I can finally smile again without being mortified!</li>
            <li> Despite the personal self conscious issues - he works in a job that deals with the public and appearance is very important!  </li>
            <li> After we played with it and molded and remolded it a bunch of times it fit snug and doesnt look bad - he wears it only to work to keep it in the best condition until we get something</li>
            <li> and I cut off, then  sand down most of the side edges.</li>
            <li> I was able to drink cold liquids with mine, and some warm coffee, did not even try to eat with them.  </li>
            <li> :)     I have just added my actual before &amp; after picture above the reviews.</li>
            <li> I will rate it high because the product is worthwhile............unless you have protruding teeth.</li>
            <li> The fitting is a little tricky but keep trying.</li>
            <li> your teeth exactly as instructed on their site, that is a major point.</li>
            <li> exactly as instructed on their site, that is a major point.</li>
            <li> It is possible to eat soft foods while at work if i loosen them slightly to clean out any food stuck inside with my finger.</li>
            <li> I wish I could get the dang things to stay on, they really look natural.</li>
            <li> SO we followed the directions, and it actually was worth it for the TEMPORARY FIX.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Public speaking, family functions, everything will be much improved for this small investement. :)</li>
            <li> Instant Smile Cosmetic Novelty</li>
            <li> If they are too white for you, I soaked mine overnight in tea until the color matched my more natural white.  </li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t live with all the embarrassment I felt.</li>
            <li> The instructions were very clear.</li>
            <li> You do have to have some common sense and patience when getting them to fit right.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband who has pretty severe decay in two of his front upper teeth.</li>
            <li> But wow to my surprize!</li>
            <li> I got hit in the face by a pretty hefty box during my last job and it completely snapped off one of my front two teeth.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky to get them to fit your teeth</li>
            <li> When he is laughing really hard I can tell it is not his natural teeth, but still it is much better looking than his natural teeth.</li>
            <li> I immediately went directly to the Imako site to get as much info as possible.</li>
            <li> I had to remove a lot of the clear moldable material from places where it interfered with my bite.  </li>
            <li> Remember, they are soft, so you can not eat with them in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I ordered the natural.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s completely unnoticeable in pictures.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> trick was to mold them in a natural way (get the edges curved around you natural teeth line.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> My natural teeth are absolutely horrendous and made me constantly self conscious even while talking I was constantly embarrassed.</li>
            <li> but I finally figured it out and bought a few pairs (I recommend this because they wear out fairly easy.)</li>
            <li> , i have bad teeth and work a professional position, i use these all day long, every day of the week, easy to custom fit, very comfortable to wear, very realistic, and no one will know any different, the only reason i did not rate 5 stars is because they will only last about 2 weeks before starting to look yellow, so i have to keep ordering new ones...</li>
            <li> And given that we have no other options we decided to order it anyway.  </li>
            <li> but I am considering getting small as the two front are really large on the large ones.</li>
            <li> I made mistakes of smooshing the mold compound too high on my front gum, and too low on my back two sides.</li>
            <li> My husband spent the whole weekend</li>
            <li> I recently bought these imako cosmetic teeth and they have far surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> these from imako look so phoney and too white even though they call it natural in color.  </li>
            <li> I did take a sharp knife and gently sculpt each tooth to look like mine</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish the &amp;#34;gums&amp;#34; looked a little more realistic.</li>
            <li> what a waste of money...guess it would be good for Halloween,to paint some of the teeth black for the missing teeth</li>
            <li> so I finally figured to hold them next to the teeth before I pressed and feel underneath to make sure the Imakos were lower than my partial which I don&#x27;t recommend, but I made them work over my own fakes as I have a bad looking tooth in front next to my partial</li>
            <li> I ordered small at first based on other reviews but upon sight I exchanged them for a large.</li>
            <li> It took me three tries to cover a gap of three missing teeth, but once you get it right, no one knows the difference, even up close!</li>
            <li> It does not look not even close to real, very hard to fit in mouse.  </li>
            <li> gave this product 3 stars because I dont really know for sure how wearing them for a period of time would have been or if anyone would notice them as I myself could not wear them that long due to them being uncomfortable from the protruding.</li>
            <li> After all the good and bad reviews.</li>
            <li> At first try, they might look a little bit &amp;#34;denture-ish&amp;#34; but a few tweeks and adjustments can make the world of difference and certainly money well spent.</li>
            <li> had to determine over a period where the compound was too thick, or where it didn&#x27;t sit right.</li>
            <li> I am a smoker, so I took the advice of other reviewers and painted clear fingernail polish over them once they were set.</li>
            <li> &quot;     Public speaking, family functions, everything will be much improved for this small investement.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Large from the measurements given, when if fact I should of ordered a Small.</li>
            <li> ( the few I have) dabbed on a few drops of super glue pressed them on.</li>
            <li> Got my upper teeth today a few days late but free shipping I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This keeps the teeth in place without the use of adhesives and actually makes them firm enough that you can eat soft foods and drink without problems.</li>
            <li> They will come flat</li>
            <li> and, I have been wearing them every day without any strange reactions or people staring (or even glancing) at the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have to boil each time inserted to try to reduce minor discomfort to gums.</li>
            <li> The teeth are an odd color, like yellow tinged white.</li>
            <li> You will look very strange.</li>
            <li> It was next to impossible to fit them and wearing them discretely is NOT possible.</li>
            <li> Once done, I speak normally and hardly notice them at all.</li>
            <li> Day two, I cut them shorter (removing 2 teeth from the back of both sides), and trimmed some of the gum area down.</li>
            <li> i tried several times to refit and cut them down to my size and it just wouldnt work.</li>
            <li> They were as I expected to look</li>
            <li> I felt it was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was afraid it would be loose and fall out, but once I perfected the fit, just the opposite, it took a little trying to come out!</li>
            <li> But we decided a few days later due to his work urgency to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This is a very thin strip of plastic worth pennies.</li>
            <li> So, the first day of trying to fit these into my mouth was terrible.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the smalls and they are due to arrive today.</li>
            <li> They must either be impatient, have trouble following directions, or mentally challenged because I read the directions and watched the web video at the site provided on the instructions, took my time, didn&#x27;t use a microwave</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t quite shut my lips when I had them on and the product is pretty thin!</li>
            <li> We are not currently able to see a dentist, and since it is looking like we are going to wait is till February when we get our taxes back we decided to look for a temporary solution.</li>
            <li> Other than that they are a 5.</li>
            <li> so, I basically looked like a drug addict due to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had never really noticed that I have slightly protruding teeth and neither had anyone else</li>
            <li> So u are actually biting on the plastic around and behind back</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I first ordered them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product for what it&#x27;s intended for though if they do fit</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product for what it&#x27;s intended for though if they do fit you.</li>
            <li> They did well for me as I was waiting to have my front tooth capped after my root canal caused my front tooth to turn dark.</li>
            <li> do not let this fool you, heat them up in the water, adn apply them to your teeth to get the mold down.  </li>
            <li> People that do know you may slightly notice</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wear mine as I look slightly like a horse face.  </li>
            <li> It took a little doing</li>
            <li> My other teeth are in pretty bad shape already</li>
            <li> It looks totally fake and the fit is uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m missing one front tooth and the tooth between it and the incisor</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The teeth are made from a rubber feeling silicone material, however the pert that you mold to your mouth is a firm hardened plastic.</li>
            <li> When we saw this item - I looked at just about every review they had on amazon dot com to see if it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;4. when molding it use extra beads to mold it under and behind teeth so it fits like a football teethguard or retainer.  </li>
            <li> and I wasted $$.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you have missing front teeth</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> However, after living with a broken bridge for so long, when I knew I was so close to having &amp;#34;teeth,&amp;#34; my patience was out the window.</li>
            <li> although there is just a little bit of an overbite but what the hell for 40 bucks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First note: If you are an impatient person, do not get these!</li>
            <li> If it is closer to 1-1/8th inches (28 mm.), then order small, If closer to 1-1/4th inches (32 mm.)</li>
            <li> If it is closer to 1-1/8th inches (28 mm.), then order small, If closer to 1-1/4th inches (32 mm.)</li>
            <li> She ordered small</li>
            <li> so I have a small dremel tool</li>
            <li> The instructions were clear but they are very uncomfortable and hurt trying to wear them, and to get them off in a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> Just dont allow your natural teeth to go untreated if you have bad cavaties or pain.</li>
            <li> i mean, these false teeth have no kind of support</li>
            <li> i bought lots of things off amazon.com and this was the ONLY item i was disappointed with.</li>
            <li> but the chart was wrong for me, I should of gone with my gut instinct and ordered a Small.</li>
            <li> A lil tough on the directions</li>
            <li> Covers my 2 broken front teeth</li>
            <li> I found this product to be of quality standards, but, when I applied the molding strip, it just was a poorly designed process and now the product is useless.</li>
            <li> i HATE that i wasted my money on these false teeth.</li>
            <li> These looked too bulky and fake.</li>
            <li> sorry to the company who makes this product, but im just telling the truth.....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the fake reviews.</li>
            <li> These things LOOK as fake as they are.</li>
            <li> IS A TEMPORARY PRODUCT THAT IS LAUGHABLE BEFORE SET/MOLDED.  </li>
            <li> bought both sizes and unable to make them work.  </li>
            <li> And it look&#x27;s fake...</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Sent wrong size.</li>
            <li> I do sand it very thin too to avoid the Mr Ed look</li>
            <li> then they will say it isn&#x27;t bad looking at all.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li> Too bad the offer don&#x27;t include 2 sets.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when I saw them.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So, the first day of trying to fit these into my mouth was terrible. I read all the reviews and knew I was supposed to have patience. However, after living with a broken bridge for so long, when I knew I was so close to having &amp;#34;teeth,&amp;#34; my patience was out the window. Day two, I cut them shorter (removing 2 teeth from the back of both sides), and trimmed some of the gum area down. I purchased a large and they were a bit too large. Anyway, after 20 minutes and 3 re-simmers of the water, I finally had them in for a perfect fit. They aren&#x27;t perfect, (I think that&#x27;s ONLY due to the fact that I bought the large instead of small), but they are WAY better than what I supposed $40 dollars would get me. The fit is superb, the look is decent, and I can talk without any issues. I am a smoker, so I took the advice of other reviewers and painted clear fingernail polish over them once they were set. I have no stains, though I would strongly suggest after the clear polish dries completely, brushing the teeth and using Listerine on them to remove the toxic taste. I just ordered the smalls and they are due to arrive today. I am sure they will look much better. Thank you for making these. Truly.</li>
            <li> I have big teeth and these things made my teeth look even bigger.No matter how many times I readjusted them. Plus they were like a yellow stained color.</li>
            <li> not what I thought it be</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever bought in my life. It looks totally fake and the fit is uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I read the mixed reviews prior to purchasing the Imako Cosmetic Teeth.  The problem prior individuals who had complaints seemed to revolve around following the directions.  They must either be impatient, have trouble following directions, or mentally challenged because I read the directions and watched the web video at the site provided on the instructions, took my time, didn&#x27;t use a microwave and I had no prolems what so ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the teeth. I&#x27;m missing one front tooth and the tooth between it and the incisor (I dont know the numbers) but the teeth cover them perfectly.  For the price you just can&#x27;t beat the product!  I used them during a job interview and I got the job; and, I have been wearing them every day without any strange reactions or people staring (or even glancing) at the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should be aware that they are not kidding when they say do not eat with them. They are truly too flimsy to do that.  But they will work until I can afford to purchase a perminent fix.  Needless to say, for the price, I LOVE THESE TEETH.  I can feel a little more confident in public until I can purchae real teeth.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about purchasing this product and you can&#x27;t afford to purchase the real thing....DO IT.  You will be pleased. Just be sure to read the instructions, follow the instructions (watch the web video if you can) and most importantly; TAKE YOUR TIME AND DONT USE A MICROWAVE.  You will love the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Also, if you are just out of prison and you don&#x27;t have much money.  This is the way to go. Yes, I&#x27;m speaking from experience.</li>
            <li> These looked too bulky and fake. It was next to impossible to fit them and wearing them discretely is NOT possible.</li>
            <li> I first saw this item in an ad from a different supplier and was the most excited I&#x27;ve been in a long time. I immediately went directly to the Imako site to get as much info as possible. They let you watch the video on how to make these work (fit them to your teeth and mouth step by step). After watching that and reading some reviews (most of which were favorable...) I then searched Amazon for these and purchased them as they were cheaper with shipping from here.&lt;br /&gt;They came right away in the mail and I immediately opened them and began the fitting process. Now I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be a replacement for real teeth or even what the dentist can do and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed when I saw them. They were as I expected to look I guess. It is a little tricky to get them to fit your teeth just right and you really do have to be prepared to \\&quot;hold still\\&quot; during the molding process and all that but after a few times I had a pretty good fit BUT something still wasnt right..I couldn&#x27;t quite shut my lips when I had them on and the product is pretty thin! I had never really noticed that I have slightly protruding teeth and neither had anyone else (I asked people who would tell me the truth LOL). But I guess after prolonged pushing from my wisdom teeth, my front teeth had been pushed forward. And as it says on the package and directions...these are NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PROTRUDING TEETH.  That was my mistake for not noticing that. But I do think these would work just fine for people that do not have this problem and of course only for occasions such as job interviews for instance or public appearances where you want to make a good impression.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 3 stars because I dont really know for sure how wearing them for a period of time would have been or if anyone would notice them as I myself could not wear them that long due to them being uncomfortable from the protruding. If anything I would have drawn more attention to my teeth with them on than I would with my own poorly looking front teeth. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product for what it&#x27;s intended for though if they do fit you.orly looking front teeth. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product for what it&#x27;s intended for though if they do fit you.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband who has pretty severe decay in two of his front upper teeth. We are not currently able to see a dentist, and since it is looking like we are going to wait is till February when we get our taxes back we decided to look for a temporary solution. The product looks pretty good and has definitely helped my husband&#x27;s self esteem. It isn&#x27;t perfect, but for the price it was definitely worth it. As far as fitting the device it did take a pretty good amount of time to get it just right. Just be patient and take your time. My husband spent the whole weekend we got it trying it out and modifying it. He was able to get a very secure fit. As far as the look of the product when my husband is speaking I wouldn&#x27;t know he he was wearing it if I wasn&#x27;t aware of the situation, it looks fine. When he is laughing really hard I can tell it is not his natural teeth, but still it is much better looking than his natural teeth. Not a long term solution, but if you are willing to take your time to fit it properly it is a great temporary fix until you can have real dental work done.</li>
            <li> I recently bought these imako cosmetic teeth and they have far surpassed my expectations. My natural teeth are absolutely horrendous and made me constantly self conscious even while talking I was constantly embarrassed. I was a little skeptical when I first ordered them but I was willing to try anything. I just couldn&#x27;t live with all the embarrassment I felt. I had been excited to get them all weekend and was elated when they arrived. It took me two try&#x27;s to get them fitted right but they look absolutely fantastic it&#x27;s been quite a while since I&#x27;ve been this happy. I owe a giant thank u to the people who created this product it truly will change my life</li>
            <li> i saw a lot of reviews sayin this product was worth the buy. i HATE that i wasted my money on these false teeth. i should have gone to my doc and gotten the real snap-on smile that custom fits my teeth. these teeth were unbelieveably BIG like Mr. Ed the horse, honestly. i tried several times to refit and cut them down to my size and it just wouldnt work. what the problem was, they are flat and just fit over the top of your teeth. if they were like actual dentures or like one cap you snap into place and snap out, this would be a better item. the denture adhesive worked but could bearly keep the teeth on just the top of your own teeth...they would have been better just drawing teeth on a piece of paper for you to fit on top of your teeth. i mean, these false teeth have no kind of support and i was afriad they would fall out if i talked LOL!! just do not buy this product. i bought lots of things off amazon.com and this was the ONLY item i was disappointed with. sorry to the company who makes this product, but im just telling the truth.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to find the time to do all the boiling of the water &amp; forming this.  I really am in search of something snap on.</li>
            <li> The instructions were clear but they are very uncomfortable and hurt trying to wear them, and to get them off in a pain in the butt.</li>
            <li> Rip off. Worthless. 0 Stars. Don&#x27;t buy this product. Don&#x27;t fall for the fake reviews. This is a very thin strip of plastic worth pennies. If you open the plastic bag to look at this cheap piece of plastic - then no return. Even if you can return it they will charge you a re-stocking fee.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t set right</li>
            <li> a couple of friends or rather people I know have busted teeth and so I bought a set for them. they look great but they don&#x27;t wear them often, they should cause as I said they are busted.</li>
            <li> Exactly what the heading says. These things LOOK as fake as they are. Also, I had to melt the stuff 4 times before I got a better fit, and I use the word better loosely. These suck. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The teeth are an odd color, like yellow tinged white. They do not look as real as the other brand sold out there, but even my brother did not notice they were not my teeeth until I smiled big enough that he could see the color difference in my own teeth. The teeth are made from a rubber feeling silicone material, however the pert that you mold to your mouth is a firm hardened plastic. This keeps the teeth in place without the use of adhesives and actually makes them firm enough that you can eat soft foods and drink without problems. They did well for me as I was waiting to have my front tooth capped after my root canal caused my front tooth to turn dark. They can absolutely change even the most messed up smile. If you dont have dental insurance and cant afford veneers or caps then this is an affordable alternative. Just dont allow your natural teeth to go untreated if you have bad cavaties or pain. That can cause severe health probkems.I rated these at a 3 because of the color. Other than that they are a 5.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them to fit correctly in my mouth.  They wouldn&#x27;t arch enough or stick.  Bottom line:  I had to get two front crowns and a root canal to truly fix my issue.</li>
            <li> These look so real but I never did get the beads to work that are supposed to make them clip over your own teeth.  But, I just wanted them to have some pictures taken and they worked fine for that. I did take a sharp knife and gently sculpt each tooth to look like mine did 20 years ago.  I wish I could get the dang things to stay on, they really look natural.</li>
            <li> When we got the package we opened it for my spouse and just about cried.  He lost the 4 teeth in the front top smile line and we have NO dental insurance or the amount of cash at this time to do any type of replacement at this time .  Despite the personal self conscious issues - he works in a job that deals with the public and appearance is very important!  When we saw this item - I looked at just about every review they had on amazon dot com to see if it was a waste of money.  And given that we have no other options we decided to order it anyway.  I am skeptical of most too good to be true quick fixes.  When this arrived I almost cried.  It looks like a toy plastic joke!  But we decided a few days later due to his work urgency to give it a try.  I am pretty crafty and thought maybe we could work something out of it!  SO we followed the directions, and it actually was worth it for the TEMPORARY FIX.  After we played with it and molded and remolded it a bunch of times it fit snug and doesnt look bad - he wears it only to work to keep it in the best condition until we get something else.&lt;br /&gt;SUGGESTIONS if you are in the same boat and HAVE TO ORDER THIS.&lt;br /&gt;1. ORDER THE EXTRA BEADS FOR FITTING TO MAKE MORE DURABLE&lt;br /&gt;2. DON&#x27;T QUIT RE MOLDING or RE FITTING until it FITS AND LOOKS GOOD&lt;br /&gt;3. REMOVE AND REMELT until it sits good and not to low&lt;br /&gt;4. when molding it use extra beads to mold it under and behind teeth so it fits like a football teethguard or retainer.  So u are actually biting on the plastic around and behind back teeth.&lt;br /&gt;5 KEEP THE FAITH-It will work if you are patient and remold and remold till it&#x27;s right and then it looks good.&lt;br /&gt;6. I laughed at him at first but now i like it when he wears it.&lt;br /&gt;7. People that don&#x27;t know you won&#x27;t even notice at all&lt;br /&gt;8 People that do know you may slightly notice then they will say it isn&#x27;t bad looking at all.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A TEMPORARY PRODUCT THAT IS LAUGHABLE BEFORE SET/MOLDED.  BUT FOR SOMEONE WITH NO TEETH IT WILL HELP YOU EMAIL ME IF YOU WANT REAL PICS&lt;br /&gt;THANKS IN OREGON&lt;br /&gt;emNO TEETH IT WILL HELP YOU EMAIL ME IF YOU WANT REAL PICS&lt;br /&gt;THANKS IN OREGON&lt;br /&gt;em</li>
            <li> could not get to fit.  bought both sizes and unable to make them work.  Out the money as they are unusable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use not uncomfortable.  I have this space in between my two front teeth and its always bothered me. But now I dont. I drank coffee &amp; water with these no problem.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> And it look&#x27;s fake...smh what a waste of money...guess it would be good for Halloween,to paint some of the teeth black for the missing teeth look, there you go..it is good for something.</li>
            <li> What a lifesaver!  I get compliments all the time about my beautiful smile!  If you are self conscience about your teeth, I would recommed this product. You have to  work a little to get a perfect fit but they are worth it!</li>
            <li> The instructions were very clear. The product was easy to use and when they are in they look really good.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the results of the imako teeth. I could not get the two pieces that are suppost to bond together to work. They would not stick together. I felt it was a total waste of money. Sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> These will work, I used them before I saved up money to have a lot of cavaties filled in the front of my mouth, they were really unsightly.  The only response that I got was people asked me if I work done like veneers.  You have to spend some time getting these to fit properly but it will do it, I messed with mine for a week.  They will come flat do not let this fool you, heat them up in the water, adn apply them to your teeth to get the mold down.  The more time you spend with it the more they feel better.  I was able to drink cold liquids with mine, and some warm coffee, did not even try to eat with them.  If nothing else it helped me with feeling better about the situation for the time being.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed. Fit fine and look good. The fitting is a little tricky but keep trying. I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Truly an amazing product. I use daily.  Wonderful, takes a bit of fitting,  but once done right,  stays in all day.  Brilliant.</li>
            <li> Great temporary patch.  Looks natural, easy to apply.  Remember, they are soft, so you can not eat with them in your mouth.</li>
            <li> first try is really a disaster. luckily, you can remold over and over again to re-set them. after a little experimenting and more trys,i pretty much think that i did get the best fit. although there is just a little bit of an overbite but what the hell for 40 bucks!</li>
            <li> they are not secure more like costume teeth,, plus the material for the inside doesnt melt and the additional plastic to help make a bridge doesnt melt, had to melt in hot water did not melt at all to even be able to roll plastic or pull apart,,,,</li>
            <li> Covers my 2 broken front teeth but I can always feel them floating upward to the roof of my mouth leaving some of the bottom of my upper teeth showing. Have to boil each time inserted to try to reduce minor discomfort to gums. It is possible to eat soft foods while at work if i loosen them slightly to clean out any food stuck inside with my finger.</li>
            <li> After having them for a week, I finally put them to the test today. In an hour-long session with my therapist! What better place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First note: If you are an impatient person, do not get these! It takes a bit of time and patience to do-it-yourself. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to follow both the written and video instructions, that&#x27;s a MUST. I didn&#x27;t get a perfect fit the first time but the good thing is you can get another chance until it&#x27;s right. (Not like the Clone-A-Willy kit!) I made mistakes of smooshing the mold compound too high on my front gum, and too low on my back two sides. I dipped either one side or the top part in simmering water to re-loosen it and re-mold it. I gradually tried it on each day and talked in a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to determine over a period where the compound was too thick, or where it didn&#x27;t sit right. They do give you more than needed as it says, so I trimmed a bit off. I would not recommend ever trimming the actual product unless you need to trim for a low frenum. Remember, it won&#x27;t grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid it would be loose and fall out, but once I perfected the fit, just the opposite, it took a little trying to come out! Drinking sips of hot water will help loosen it if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the 2 grand+ to get my teeth fixed but until I do I&#x27;m going to enjoy and recommend these. Again, be patient. You may have to try more than once to get the perfect fit, so don&#x27;t get frustrated the first few minutes. Try fresh the next day. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My speech was fine today, just the occasional \\&quot;shound\\&quot; people make with a denture, I haven&#x27;t tried eating but I never eat out so no worries there. It&#x27;s over 100 degrees here so coffee isn&#x27;t a worry either. Use the container to keep them away from pets, my dog used to grab my eyeglasses off the coffee table, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d love to chew this! Oh also, the stock picture they show is for the size large. I ordered small at first based on other reviews but upon sight I exchanged them for a large. (The smalls are noticably smaller than the stock pic.)&lt;br /&gt;Measure your teeth exactly as instructed on their site, that is a major point. Like this - \\&quot;Measure across the width of the four front teeth.

Measure your teeth exactly as instructed on their site, that is a major point. Like this - \\&quot;Measure across the width of the four front teeth.

            <li> They are a LIFE SAVER! I feel real good about myself! Will be purchasing some more real soon just to keep on hand love it</li>
            <li> I ordered the Large from the measurements given, when if fact I should of ordered a Small. Very disappointed and I wasted $$. If the measurements were true to size on the chart, it would of not been a problem but the chart was wrong for me, I should of gone with my gut instinct and ordered a Small.</li>
            <li> Wearing them gives me more confidence.</li>
            <li> better off ordering the others from rogers. they are more like the real thing and work great. these from imako look so phoney and too white even though they call it natural in color.  the other ones from rogers work so much better and look more real. if you need dentures for the top but don&#x27;t have the money, roger&#x27;s works best. you just can&#x27;t eat with them unless its soup or coffee. these you definitely can&#x27;t eat with. don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are best:&lt;br /&gt;Secure Instant Smile Cosmetic Novelty Teeth-One Size Fits Most&lt;br /&gt;Sold by Rodgers Goods</li>
            <li> Perfect. A lil tough on the directions I just watched the ones on YouTube. Way easy. Great fit the first time...&lt;br /&gt;Lots of compliments. I ordered the natural. I would of liked them to be whiter like my own teeth but for pics I can adjust the brihtness scale to gleaming. I&#x27;ll probably buy another I&#x27;m a lil bit. If they come in whiter. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a JOKE ... do not waste your money</li>
            <li> If you can be patient and work with them,(and they can be worked with over and over again)  you will get the right fit.  And the right fit ultimately means  the right look.  At first try, they might look a little bit &amp;#34;denture-ish&amp;#34; but a few tweeks and adjustments can make the world of difference and certainly money well spent.</li>
            <li> I like them. The directions need to be more understanding. I measured my teeth like it said they were the perfect size. Too bad the offer don&#x27;t include 2 sets. I do recomend this product for a quick fix of your own teeth.</li>
            <li> I work in an industry where the smile is everything. Read the directions and watch the video to make these work. It took me three tries to cover a gap of three missing teeth, but once you get it right, no one knows the difference, even up close! Order extra gel. Until I get my partials.. these will work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> First these are cosmetic to hide your flaws, just like you wear make-up so don&#x27;t expect dentures. It took me a couple of times and  still I found my problem was I couldn&#x27;t tell by looking straight on in the mirror where my teeth were underneath to align them right so I finally figured to hold them next to the teeth before I pressed and feel underneath to make sure the Imakos were lower than my partial which I don&#x27;t recommend, but I made them work over my own fakes as I have a bad looking tooth in front next to my partial I wanted to cover.To me these look so real but I am considering getting small as the two front are really large on the large ones. But my neice came by and she recently lost two in front and when she saw mine she ordered some also like me she doesnt have a couple of grand to redo the front of her mouth. She ordered small so I think I am also but for the price they are good for a new smile.</li>
            <li> I have ordered and used 10-12 of these, i have bad teeth and work a professional position, i use these all day long, every day of the week, easy to custom fit, very comfortable to wear, very realistic, and no one will know any different, the only reason i did not rate 5 stars is because they will only last about 2 weeks before starting to look yellow, so i have to keep ordering new ones... but, i cant get through my day without them.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all, hurt my mouth too! Could not get evil her one to soften so I could mold my own teeth....</li>
            <li> Got my upper teeth today a few days late but free shipping I can&#x27;t complain. Opened the package .fitted the teeth to my upper teeth( the few I have) dabbed on a few drops of super glue pressed them on. THEY LOOK REALLY GOOD. if you have missing front teeth buy this product you&#x27;ll love the way you look I can smile again Android I am very happy. THANKS</li>
            <li> Decent quick fix. Over-all satisfied. My only complaint is that I wish the &amp;#34;gums&amp;#34; looked a little more realistic. But it&#x27;s completely unnoticeable in pictures. Good product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> If i had a chose id put no stars. Its a piece of crap. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was realy doughtful about this product. But wow to my surprize! It was easy to fix an to my surprize most people couldn&#x27;t tell what I had done. Since I&#x27;m known as smiley it was important to me when I broke my front tooth an I would an have recommended it to my friends</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I had protruding teeth.  Just wanted to cover a couple of gaps.  But, video, and instructions make it easy to fit.  I won&#x27;t wear mine as I look slightly like a horse face.  LOL.  Make sure you do not have protruding teeth!!!!!! You will look very strange. I believe these work best for those missing front teeth.  I will rate it high because the product is worthwhile............unless you have protruding teeth.</li>
            <li> I got these because I have been out of work and cannot get any dental insurance. It took a little doing but I finally figured it out and bought a few pairs (I recommend this because they wear out fairly easy.) Now I have a big gomer tooth left in the upper middle so I use that as my anchor and I have the two canine teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick was to mold them in a natural way (get the edges curved around you natural teeth line. But I also only need the front 4-5 to look okay so I have a small dremel tool and I cut off, then  sand down most of the side edges. I super glue it to the front tooth and if I leave enough sometimes glue the edges to the canine. I do sand it very thin too to avoid the Mr Ed look</li>
            <li> INFOR GIVEN WAS MISLEADING</li>
            <li> Yes; however, they were very, very white.  Just a tip.  If they are too white for you, I soaked mine overnight in tea until the color matched my more natural white.  I found the instructions easy to follow.  They are a life saver.</li>
            <li> These are great!!!  You do have to have some common sense and patience when getting them to fit right.  It probably won&#x27;t happen the first try.  I had to remove a lot of the clear moldable material from places where it interfered with my bite.  Once done, I speak normally and hardly notice them at all. I finally feel confident when I smile!</li>
            <li> absolutely wonderful customer service and product perfect</li>
            <li> Sent wrong size. But I can make them work</li>
            <li> They are great for the price.  They are easy to fit in your mouth and they stay. I would recommend these to anybody for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> It does not look not even close to real, very hard to fit in mouse.  I have requested a refund but no answer from the Company.  Very dissaponted</li>
            <li> I found this product to be of quality standards, but, when I applied the molding strip, it just was a poorly designed process and now the product is useless.I am very disappointed, and will not buy anything here again.</li>
            <li> I will never order the natural pair again they stain easily</li>
            <li> They are ok but I wish they can be eaten with</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing job with these teeth so far! I really love them! I got hit in the face by a pretty hefty box during my last job and it completely snapped off one of my front two teeth. My other teeth are in pretty bad shape already so, I basically looked like a drug addict due to my teeth. These things fit well even though they do take some patience to get set properly. They are easy to use, but getting the perfect fit does take some work. Once I got the fit right, I hardly have any speech impediments and I can finally smile again without being mortified!</li>
            <li> After all the good and bad reviews. I have to say I&#x27;m ecstatic about these... The front teeth are slightly large but it&#x27;s so amazing regardless....</li>
            <li> Wow I&#x27;am surprised how good they work!!! Great  hard for people to notice them, I had one person ask me if I had clear braces on thow.  But I say buy buy buy!!11</li>
            <li> I had a front crown break off at the gum and had to find an affordable fix fast. I wait tables and couldn&#x27;t wait until I could afford an implant. PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Perfect for a prop we set up.</li>
