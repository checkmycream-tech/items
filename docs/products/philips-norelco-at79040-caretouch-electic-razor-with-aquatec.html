            <li>Best shaver I have ever bought, works fantastically.</li>
            <li>One day I found this wonderful beauty of a shaver the Philips Norelco AT790.</li>
            <li>With the Andis Profoil shaver I had to use the Andis T-outliner (which is wonderful!!!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, this shaver has done a very good job.  </li>
            <li>Very good product, but not like the color.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Great price for a great shaver!  </li>
            <li>A good razor doesn&#x27;t need to cost hundreds of dollars!</li>
            <li>This shaver is a great investment.</li>
            <li>Great product; wish it operated in corded mode, but I understand this is a safety feature to prevent electrocution from mixing water &amp; AC power.</li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower with a blade works great</li>
            <li>This one works great, has a trimmer, and when I bought mine, it had a $10 off coupon.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, great product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, another great quality electric razor from Norelco.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, another great quality electric razor from Norelco.</li>
            <li>Battery life is great...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation while using this razor.</li>
            <li>I was getting a great shave without any destruction to my skin.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li>&amp;#62;best elect.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This razor is great.</li>
            <li>Excellent item, well packaged, promptly shipped, good buy with a good price.  </li>
            <li>Great Razor,I would buy again,and it was a good price.</li>
            <li>A pleasant change from my Remington shaver</li>
            <li>I have been using this one with Edge gel, which I think is a very good gel that I&#x27;ve used many times with a blade razor.  </li>
            <li>Works good and is inexpensive</li>
            <li>seems to be a good shaver according to my man</li>
            <li>, if you don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, I&#x27;d recommend this as a good middle-of-the-road value/performer.</li>
            <li>By the way the shave I get is as good as I get with a blade shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a good, no-nonsense razor that will get the job done.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully, gives a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is a good shaver for the price point, if you want a closer shave pick one with the HQ8 type of head.  </li>
            <li>This razor does a good job of meeting that balance.  </li>
            <li>but it is a really good shaver, so</li>
            <li>but it is a really good shaver, so</li>
            <li>So I expect that the battery in the AT790/40 is as good if not better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He said it doesn&#x27;t seem to give quite a good a shave as his SpeedXL.  </li>
            <li>I was apprehensive about it but vowed to give it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone who is avoiding electric razors because of the irritation from too close of a shave would be wise to try this model.</li>
            <li>The battery holds the charge for a good amount of time as well.</li>
            <li>That too was good.</li>
            <li>Be very, very glad.  </li>
            <li>This razor also looks stylish with that jazzy-yellow flourish, so you can shave in style!</li>
            <li>of them working perfectly,  Philips brand is my first choice now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great shaver that I will enjoy using for years or until the batteries die.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for close to a month and have found it be a nice, reliable, no-frills electric razor.</li>
            <li>I think this model would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li>Both have a nice trimmer too (that part of them looks identical).  </li>
            <li>I also own a Panasonic ES-LA93-K razor.</li>
            <li>and it conforms to his face nicely.</li>
            <li>The razor just kind of glides over the beard.  </li>
            <li>Kind of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may pass mine on to a friend that would be able to get good use out of it.</li>
            <li>nice feel in the hand, not noisy and looks nice.  </li>
            <li>(what Phillips Norelco calls Aquatec), and this is one really nice razor.  </li>
            <li>I use Aveeno Shave Gel, which is the absolute best of any shaving gel or foam I&#x27;ve used since I started shaving over four decades ago.</li>
            <li>I use Aveeno Shave Gel, which is the absolute best of any shaving gel or foam I&#x27;ve used since I started shaving over four decades ago.</li>
            <li>the absolute best electric shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Braun but did not like the price of the cleaning solution that had to be replaced every month.</li>
            <li>Looks nice.</li>
            <li>Speaking of trimmers, the attached trimmer is a nice plus but it doesn&#x27;t replace my stand alone trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Bingo, he liked it and now has his own.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m impressed that it still holds a charge sufficient for 2-3 decent shaves before I have to recharge it.</li>
            <li>This guy is pretty good!</li>
            <li>a very good razor.very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and this is the best tool by far.  </li>
            <li>It fits very comfortably in my hand, and the pivoting blades move with the contours of my face and head.  </li>
            <li>This razor gives me a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth with a foam</li>
            <li>Very comfortable with the close shaves.</li>
            <li>I DID EXPECT MORE.</li>
            <li>Anyway, in an effort to be a relaxed, supportive parent who doesn&#x27;t hover or over-control</li>
            <li>(Love you Amazon Prime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more unsightly peach fuzz growing on the apple of my eye&#x27;s cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I love both of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>newer AT790 has more flex in the heads, making it feel a bit nicer on your chin.  </li>
            <li>, I just wish it had a beefier motor and more battery capacity.</li>
            <li>Way better than Philips Norelco SensoTouch 2D</li>
            <li>I bought it to shave my legs because I had knee surgery and could not shave in the shower any more.</li>
            <li>It does not have a battery indicator or a &#x27;cleaning needed&#x27; notice, but it works well for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If anything, the HQ7 heads seem to track my face better.</li>
            <li>The shave was not as close as one I can get with a blade, but it was close for the most part.  </li>
            <li>The shave was not as close as one I can get with a blade, but it was close for the most part.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a horrible task.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never gotten as perfectly smooth a shave with any electric razor as I can with a good blade, but the Norelco 7180XL and this one, the AT790/40, give me as smooth and near-perfect a shave as I think I can get without using a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver is so much better.</li>
            <li>it lasts more than a week.</li>
            <li>He really likes it and we feel for the money it was a great deal</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly made out of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found this model which advertised it as the best model to avoid ingrown hairs because it shaves hair just above the surface of the skin.  </li>
            <li>It gave an almost perfect shave without irritation from prior electric razors I had tried.  </li>
            <li>Now it takes more time and effort.  </li>
            <li>Quite satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>If I had reviewed this shaver after one week of usage, I would have rated it a two at the most.  </li>
            <li>That worked, well better than the foam based shave.</li>
            <li>but it does feel better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I found them just OK at the time.</li>
            <li>The Andis Profoil was giving me just an okay shave</li>
            <li>and I felt that there had to be something better out there.</li>
            <li>The more I cut with it the better it performed on my face.</li>
            <li>This product provides a nice, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Razor clean up was very easy with a good rinse under hot water.</li>
            <li>It has almost 100% plastic parts which while it is light weight it feels kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>and I do know that most any decent electric razor with good blades should cut well.  </li>
            <li>this is a replacement for my 3 year old shaver works great</li>
            <li>, most comfortable shaves I have ever had.</li>
            <li>My Panasonic razor has one wide foil that seems to work best for me.</li>
            <li>But there is no question the shave is more comfortable using shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>But there is no question the shave is more comfortable using shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>So far, its been doing a great job.  </li>
            <li>at the 3 week mark, I have to say that this shaver has given me the most comfortable shave ever.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a very reasonably-priced wet/dry shaver, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a very reasonably-priced wet/dry shaver, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>I have used other electric razors but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>The cut was extremely close and perfect.</li>
            <li>The build quality on this is so much better, the heads shave close without any pulling, easy to clean under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>so my skin easily gets irritated.</li>
            <li>love this product and hope to get years of quality clean shaves.</li>
            <li>It is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is pretty much a nice working, no-frills shaver.  </li>
            <li>though if both units had brand new heads/blades in them, they might give equally good shaves).</li>
            <li>It still works fine.</li>
            <li>and these do that just fine.  </li>
            <li>Once the AT790 is charged, it works fine</li>
            <li>He has fine textured hair.</li>
            <li>It is a magnificent shaver for black men struggling with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Up until getting this shaver, I had been using barber&#x27;s clippers/groomers on their closest setting, but this did not get me the smooth shave I desired.  </li>
            <li>for performance, I thought it worked great on my chin and along my jaw, but the design doesn&#x27;t work well for my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, and clean.</li>
            <li>Never thought that it would be comfortable an electric razor shaving.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>BUT wal-mart 50.00 free ship to</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a smooth shave that won&#x27;t irritate your skin or be too close and cause problems like ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>No problem getting a close, comfortable shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li>the recharge light has not come on yet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this as a light duty shaver.</li>
            <li>So I thought maybe I could give electric shaving a try again if it was cheap</li>
            <li>Gives a close shave and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Light goes off when it is charged fully.  </li>
            <li>About as comfortable as the non-irritation shave I get.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>No ingrown hairs and my face is smooth each time out.  </li>
            <li>I still get a close smooth shave without razor burn too.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>clean shave,Very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth,When engaging in activities to buy.</li>
            <li>like that I can rinse off the blades easily under running water, and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li>The lithium ion battery is nice because it will hold a charge longer than batteries in older models.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco razor is a good razor for the price providing consistent close shaves with very affordable maintenance parts.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first but decided to try this out because of the just okay experience with the Andis</li>
            <li>I then opened the top of the shaver and again ran the hot tap water over the gears and heads until all was clean again.  </li>
            <li>A quick start sheet and separate detailed printed manual are also provided.  </li>
            <li>He likes the fact that he can rinse the razor off in water to help get it clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean…..works on 1-2 day stubble very well, which is all you can hope for in a well priced electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound as powerful as the Remington shaver I had</li>
            <li>which - who had a full on Amish beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So the Norelco AT790/40 with \\&quot;Aquatec\\&quot; hits the sweet spot for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price, you are getting a good, basic shaver without any bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>I never get them all, I just shave until I feel it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li>A full recharge takes close to 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>A full recharge takes close to 8 hours.  </li>
            <li>This really helps with minimizing irritation more so than using the Aveeno shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this shaver.   </li>
            <li>It is much lighter than most electric razors.  </li>
            <li>This is the first razor I&#x27;ve used where I haven&#x27;t had to deal with hairs becoming ingrown.</li>
            <li>It sounds weak and underpowered, almost too light (if that&#x27;s reality) but it does a great, great job, I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>The shaver glided easily over my face and provided a comfortable and reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lights on the razor include a Battery light, LED charge light and most importantly, a battery low function.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Lights on the razor include a Battery light, LED charge light and most importantly, a battery low function.  </li>
            <li>Yes the heads swivel a bit to follow your face but the wet shave is very nice.</li>
            <li>Both are as easy to clean manually, but the Panasonic comes with an automatic wash/dry system which is very convenient.</li>
            <li>charges quickly and comes with a cover for the blades.</li>
            <li>The AT790/40 is an excellent electric razor, especially at its relatively low price.  </li>
            <li>this excellent tool to be discontinued simply because they did not invest enough in marketing.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much and would feel comfortable in my recommendation.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The pictures in the manual indicate it is fine to rinse the shaver under running water to clean the blades while the razor is still on and then go back to shave a bit more.  </li>
            <li>one son said it worked great and the other said it works better than his old one.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Real close shave and easy cleanup.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean since all you have to do is rinse it under water and leave it open to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still stand by my 5 star review of the Wahl Super Close, it is an excellent product, but the Caretouch deserves a 6 out of 5 stars due to the ability to wet shave and enjoy the comfort using shave oils and etc.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco 9160XL is a great dry electric shaver, but you have to sweep out all the stubble after each use and clean it frequently by dissembling the head - which is a pain</li>
            <li>I enjoy how easy it is to clean on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Hub says it shaves real well and the floating heads are comfortable and not abrasive.  </li>
            <li>and it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Fact is, I rarely put either under running water.  </li>
            <li>I can only say that this razor gave me a shaving experience that was more comfortable than any</li>
            <li>has HQ9 heads, which are triple track with 3 sets of blades per head and gave the closest most comfortable shave especially on my mustache area.</li>
            <li>It shaves much smoother and my skin is much healthier and looks much better.</li>
            <li>When my last shaver gave up the ghost after 12 years of reasonably good service, I researched very thoroughly before settling on this model.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a symbol that supposedly lights up when it&#x27;s time to get a replacement head, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>But the most important thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave me with red skin, acne breakouts, or ingrown</li>
            <li>Gives me a great shave, though I&#x27;ve come to  realize that it&#x27;s not really the shaver that I need for my particular hair type.</li>
            <li>the Norelco AT790/40 will certainly provide you with close, comfortable shaves and be easy to keep clean for a reasonably low price.d a comfortable and reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer works as good as any other</li>
            <li>So the real decision is how close a shave is good enough for your needs vs the added expense in moving up to higher end razors.</li>
            <li>Says it right in the owners manual.</li>
            <li>I needed a shaver right away and ended up buying the Norelco AT790.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s all right for a shaved look.</li>
            <li>I tried it right away</li>
            <li>To end this review on a positive note, this electric razor leaves no razor burn or cuts on your skin, making it more reliable than a good old fashioned wet shave.</li>
            <li>the Norelco AT790/40 will certainly provide you with close, comfortable shaves and be easy to keep clean for a reasonably low price.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, medium level razor that offers features (wet/dry, water cleaning) often found on more expensive models for a good price.</li>
            <li>I have used various methods of shaving to address razor bumps including Magic Shave and the Wahl Super Close</li>
            <li>/&gt;It charges fast, but overnight is needed for a full charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because my AT790/40 is less than a month old, the blades are of course super sharp and it gives a great shave and a superior shave to that of my 7180XL (</li>
            <li>This little wonder cuts almost as close as a blade shave, better than the rest, for sure.  </li>
            <li>What I like about this razor as I can shave quickly in the morning and save time getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>For one thing, it provides a traditionally-very good/close shave I have come to expect from a Norelco rotary shaver, while at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>significantly though is the fact that with these type of shavers you need to replace razor heads once a year--and because of their cost, you might as well keep buying new shavers every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish you could plug it into the wall, and use it direct, like the older models, but I am sure some &#x27;safety&#x27; problem now prohibits that.  </li>
            <li>My first Norelco lasted for 10 yrs.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fan of Norelco razors, this is a no frills model that works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>this razor was exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li>Very quality shaver!</li>
            <li>The first is that there&#x27;s no travel case included.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed when I unpacked the shaver is how lightweight it is.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;One of the big improvements made is being able to use shaving cream/gel with these things.</li>
            <li>IT HAS BEEN 3 DAYS FROM THE FIRST SHAVE</li>
            <li>I actually like the trimmer much better on either Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower (something Norelco says is okay to do in the FAQ for this razor at their site), which is so convenient (though I have to touch up around my sideburns outside the shower because I don&#x27;t have a mirror in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I bought this for my son and it is his first electric shaver.</li>
            <li>My first Norelco shaver was purchased 35 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I find that it works pretty well for me in that regard.</li>
            <li>Then I saw a better model with extra &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; at Costco for $69.00.  </li>
            <li>first use, I did have razor burns and some hair under my neck.</li>
            <li>first days, I tried to use the shaving gel, which I had used with my blade razor.</li>
            <li>Have been debating about a wet/dry shaver for quite awhile, glad I finally made the decision to get this one.</li>
            <li>This is my first electrical razor.</li>
            <li>I WAS NOT GETTING A CLOSE SHAVE; SO I BOUGHT THIS NEW NORELCO; BUT IT DID NOT GIVE A BETTER OF FASTER SHAVE THAN MY OLD NORELCO.</li>
            <li>had to replace the old shaver because Norelco stopped selling replacement blades for it; had I been able to get new blades</li>
            <li>Over time, I&#x27;ll spend more on replacement heads than on the shaver itself (MUCH more!), but I&#x27;ll go ahead and play the game, because this shaver works for me.</li>
            <li>It provides a good, close shave, does not grab at your skin, runs well wet or dry, and be easily cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li>It provides a good, close shave, does not grab at your skin, runs well wet or dry, and be easily cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li>This is a great item to have if you grow thick facial hair and want a clean shave!</li>
            <li>When this shaver came available for me to try I was happy to do so; after all I could compare it with a few recent Panasonic and some older Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a light that blinks while charging, and you can see readily when charging is complete.  </li>
            <li>In terms of cons, I thought its time to reacharge is kind of long in proportion to usage--8 hours for a full charge, for up to 40 minutes of cordless use--though this is pretty much the standard with many current shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I grabbed my iPhone and clicked on my Amazon App faster than Grizzly Adams could skin a fish (and it was pretty damned fast, let me tell you).  </li>
            <li>For those who can put up with that or if you have no history of irritation or sensitive skin, then this is a true value for you as it will do the job of those electric razors that are over $100.  </li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s a pop-up trimmer in the back, it&#x27;s pretty light when holding it</li>
            <li>blade.&lt;br /&gt;While the shave is certainly acceptable, it is just not quite as close, but the trade-off is convenience and saving time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Norelco AT790/40 falls more at the entry level end of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver arrives in pretty basic packaging with an easy to open box and a firm, shaped cardboard liner to keep everything safe from damage.  </li>
            <li>THE SHAVE WAS VERY SMOOTH AND FAST DURING THE WET</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for my entire 40-year shaving career (this one is my fourth shaver), and I like them for being quiet, thorough, and easy to service on my own</li>
            <li>far as the technical specifics go: takes about eight hours to charge the first time (and it&#x27;s pretty easy to see when it&#x27;s done charging)</li>
            <li>but, it provides a much closer shave</li>
            <li>Just judging by the sound and initial feel, I did not expect it to perform well, but it did the job.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely zero burn with this shaver, no matter how aggressively you may push it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I has a solid construction with a non-slip surface, contoured to fit your hand.</li>
            <li>The charger is also very lightweight, and these features give it an edge to those who might use it for travel purposes.  </li>
            <li>I really like the looks and styling of this shaver.</li>
            <li>It has a very sporty look to it.  </li>
            <li>Like chargers with modern cell phones</li>
            <li>A brush is provided but I really can&#x27;t see any reason to use it unless you will be shaving where you don&#x27;t have access to a sink with running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A brush is provided but I really can&#x27;t see any reason to use it unless you will be shaving where you don&#x27;t have access to a sink with running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it or any real complaints about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He prefers the AT810, just because he wants the closer shave, but he will be using this AT790 on the spots where he often gets ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>They are very close in form factor, weight, and run time.  </li>
            <li>VERY WELL USING IT ABOUT 3 TIMES</li>
            <li>That is one feature I really miss on the Xl-8260.  </li>
            <li>So this shaver has what I really missed on the XL-8260, a battery level</li>
            <li>That is one feature I really miss on the Xl-8260.  </li>
            <li>So this shaver has what I really missed on the XL-8260, a battery level</li>
            <li>, this razon shaves very close.</li>
            <li>Shaves very close to the skin with no razor burns.</li>
            <li>I found I get a closer shave with this Norelco using the shaving cream, but it&#x27;s still not quite as close as a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I like the wet better.</li>
            <li>From day one, the shave was comfortable but did not cut close and left hairs on my face/neck.  </li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, the shave is much closer.  </li>
            <li>really hope Philips Norelco gets the word out and do some hardcore marketing to boost demand.  </li>
            <li>The AT790 cut the hair with out me using my T-outliner and it left my face smooth and not irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems kind of messy to use gel and an electric razor, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it because of its performance.</li>
            <li>this one falls right about in the middle on cost, and is better than several of the others, some costing 50% more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s stylish, comfortable, and having a lithium ion battery should mean that it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Easy to maintain and stays charged for a long period.  </li>
            <li>Both seam to cut just fine - very smooth, no pulling the hair (as long as the blades are sharp).  </li>
            <li>Very good for both wet and dry shaving and extremely quiet.  </li>
            <li>know it shouldn&#x27;t matter, but I also really like how this particular razor looks.</li>
            <li>I think I put it back under the tap 4 times to clean the heads a bit until I was</li>
            <li>I normally wait a week between shaving, and the hairs grow out too much for the heads to tackle straight on</li>
            <li>When I first used it I thought it sounded underpowered or low on charge but it powered through two days worth of stubble without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AT790 is a reasonable replacement for the older Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I like this new one for what I use it for: light shaving here and there.</li>
            <li>If I were to lose this model, I would certainly consider replacing it, only I would likely go for a better model.</li>
            <li>It is quiet for an electric razor, but by the same token doesn&#x27;t sound or feel particularly powerful.</li>
            <li>It charged to full in about three hours, very simple.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to clean out as long as you dry</li>
            <li>It is surprising how little they have changed in the last 30 years.</li>
            <li>I just got this new AT790, the version that lets you clean it under running water, and I&#x27;m comparing it to another similar Norelco shaver (7310XL), that also can be cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li>and it immediately cut better than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li>you do get a better shave with more expensive razors.</li>
            <li>the razor I would choose if I was going to buy again, but a decent one for the money.</li>
            <li>My older 8240XL</li>
            <li>The charger has a thin, straight cord and feels fairly frail.  </li>
            <li>This Philips Norelco AT790/40 Caretouch razor gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I found it on clearance for cheaper than Amazon as I guess that particular store wasn&#x27;t going to stock this model any longer.  </li>
            <li>This Philips Norelco can be cleaned with regular tap water, just open the top and rinse.</li>
            <li>I just recommend that you use decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Just know he was a big old lumberjack or mountain man or communer with bears or overly happy recluse - not sure</li>
            <li>1150X SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor to be more precise) became pretty much useless after a couple of cleanings.</li>
            <li>It wants to fold back in unless you hold it just right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating the Norelco high for</li>
            <li>Norelco shavers are generally of high quality, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>RATED HIGHLY</li>
            <li>But when compared in pure performance vs a more expensive razor, it does not provide as smooth and close a shave -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric razors on and and off for about 40 years now, and the only ones I&#x27;ve used that I consider worth using are Norelco.</li>
            <li>It shaves close, relatively speaking, but you will not have a super smooth face since it only cuts the hair short to avoid razor bumps.  </li>
            <li>This is the third electric razor I have purchased for my teenage son but the first one that actually adequately tamed his beard.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning the shaver after shaving involves nothing more than popping the head open, rinsing it under some water, and letting it air dry.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning the shaver after shaving involves nothing more than popping the head open, rinsing it under some water, and letting it air dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this razor gave far less irritation than most electric razors.</li>
            <li>My spouse has used Norelco electric razors for more than 40 years, and his current model is a 8175 SpeedXL which is a dry razor.  </li>
            <li>I bought my last Norelco from Amazon in 2008 - the rechargeable cord/cordless model 7180XL - and replaced the heads once, and it&#x27;s still going strong (I only use it cordless).</li>
            <li>The shave from the AT790 is smooth and pretty much the same as the somewhat more expensive XL-8260.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the shaver is touted as being washable, I don&#x27;t want to take the risk of immersing it in water, and I clean it out quite easily enough with the included brush (or brushes from old shavers, or an old toothbrush could also work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also relatively light in comparison to other electric razors.  </li>
            <li>Rather than buying new blades for my old shaver, I opted, for a little more, to just buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>Before receiving this razor, my previously smooth-faced, dimpled cheeked first born was walking around sporting Grizzly Adams whiskers (for those of you who were mercifully born after that cheesy show was popular, be glad you are oblivious to my reference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, he told me that his new pimpin style wasn&#x27;t a fad, his razor wasn&#x27;t working.  </li>
            <li>So rather re-writing an all new review.....</li>
            <li>There is no carry case provided, which in my opinion should be included with any new electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t say how fast the blades will dull because I haven&#x27;t put that many shaves on these</li>
            <li>And when you do, they might easily cost half the price of a new razor, so that&#x27;s something to keep in mind when thinking about investing in an electric razor.</li>
            <li>a warning: be careful when you take the shaving head off and clean it.</li>
            <li>Just be careful when it&#x27;s time to clean it.</li>
            <li>(yes, I have been reading Parenting with Love and Logic), I refrained from remarking on my son&#x27;s alarming facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did a slightly better job that my current razor that cost almost twice as much, but I would not make a direct comparison given that the more expensive one has 2-year-old blades in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been bitten by most electric razors in the past and I have yet to find one that does it irritation-free and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco razors over the years, and this is the first one that doesn&#x27;t leave me with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I turned it on was how quiet it was.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is pretty basic.  </li>
            <li>I remember the first electric razor I bought back in the mid-80s.</li>
            <li>and I wash off the inner blades with hot water.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no rash on the face, full Shaver.</li>
            <li>*stand* from my old norelco and adapted it to the new power supply that came with this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is pretty much an entry level shaver as there are really no bells and whistles with this model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is pretty much an entry level shaver as there are really no bells and whistles with this model.  </li>
            <li>quick plus is that this shaver is not very noisy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin but still need to shave frequently, then BUY THIS SHAVER!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for over twenty years and this one seems to provide a closer shave than any of the previous models I&#x27;ve owned, the 7800XL being the most recent one.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve bought some prescription moisturizer that has done the trick) and the occasional hair bump, but nothing like what I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with other shavers.  </li>
            <li>I did have to go over my whiskers with a few passes and pull my skin tight in a few places but it was in impressive shave considering the job at hand.</li>
            <li>so I have learned the hard way. :-)</li>
            <li>morning I merely briefly washed my face with soap, and while it was still wet applied some cheap shaving foam.  </li>
            <li>This one is also easier to clean than previous models.  </li>
            <li>This shaver feels to be 1/4 lighter than my old one.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver because I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>B00FRGM26C Philips Norelco HQ7/52 Gentle Cut Replacement Head]]) are currently $28, and it is recommended that they be replaced every 12 months or so.  </li>
            <li>My old model function always.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t try a swap with the old power supply.  </li>
            <li>The AT790 is noticeably quieter, and the trimmer works much faster to trim my facial hair and sideburns.</li>
            <li>+ year old</li>
            <li>Over the years I have used many different electric shavers manufactured by Norelco, Remington, and Panasonic, each with different features and selling for a wide variety of prices.  </li>
            <li>In the old days you had to buy the conditioning liquid made specifically for electric razors or risk razor burn with</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a 12-15 year old Norelco 5842 XL.  </li>
            <li>It takes 8 hours to charge fully; my old shaver took 2-3</li>
            <li>AT790 is a basic shaver that is a reasonable value and shaves well.</li>
            <li>Both razors can be rinsed under the tap, which is a much easier way to get hairs off and out of the razor than using a tiny brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to use and swear by the Wahl 4000 with the sensitive head because ingrown hairs are a problem for me.</li>
            <li>Have not recharged it since I got it nearly 4 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>about 12 shaves so far and</li>
            <li>The results completely amazed me.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who has skin problems with ingrown hairs or sensitive skin should give this model a try.  </li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t use the Norelco Lift &amp; Cut blades it gives a shave about as close as what you would expect to find on your face at about noon after an early morning shave: the hair is still there</li>
            <li>I have a 37 year old handicapped son that my wife has shaved from the start.</li>
            <li>The burning under the chin and neck had gone completely and I have mastered to art of shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always used a razor but due to the price increase and constant model changes, that eventually will force you to buy the available model and blade type, I settled in to buying an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>before.d pretty much the same as the somewhat more expensive XL-8260.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the black design adds a nice sleek, elegance to an otherwise mundane product.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of my older shavers, this model has a lithium-ion battery that not only provides a lot of juice between charges but will also not build up a memory like the old Ni-Cad and NiMH batteries.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t want to deal with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>Being a African American male I generally stayied away from them, however this one gives me a clean shave without the razor bumps.</li>
            <li>He says this razor is powerful, quiet, and doesn&#x27;t pull his whiskers (not even his long mountain man whiskers).  </li>
            <li>Unlike the Wahl shaver, I don’t have to first use a trimmer to cut my beard to get the hairs short enough to shave.  </li>
            <li>With both my 8240XL and the AT790 fully charged, within a month the AT790 is completely dead while the 8240XL works perfectly at full power.</li>
            <li>The third week, I used soap to wash my face, towel dried the face and washed the heads with warm water and used the wet type shave.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut as thoroughly as a blade, which means you have to make more passes to get an equal shave, but it just doesn&#x27;t pull or scrape hardly at all.  </li>
            <li>Simple yet worth every dollar spent.</li>
            <li>On the plus side for the Norelco is the Panasonic costs almost 4 times as much, and the replacement blades are similarly much more expensive.</li>
            <li>This makes it heavier and less convenient to use when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars, with a few minor complaints (mainly related to traveling with the razor), the AT790 with single track HQ7 heads works just as fast and good as the 8240XL with HQ9 triple-track heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few years ago I had given up on electric razors due to skin irritation after I decided that I simply didn&#x27;t have a skin type suitable for electric shaving.  </li>
            <li>If I was careful to not apply too much pressure and only shaved when my face was perfectly clean and very dry, I could achieve a half decent result without butchering my skin, but I could never shave every day.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s solid price/performance mix as long as your expectations for the shave you&#x27;ll get is reasonable.</li>
            <li>He also said that it is very quiet and when he trims his &#x27;ears&#x27; and near them, it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise in his ear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I consider this a con because if the power starts to run out in the middle of a shave, you (I) don&#x27;t want to have to wait hours to use it again (and unlike my older Norelco, this one cannot be powered by wall current; there&#x27;s an explanation for this at the aforementioned FAQ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried two other of the modern Norelco&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor i have ever bought that actually gave me the same feeling as when i wet shave.</li>
            <li>He says it is much better than his (old and dull) previous electric razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned several shavers and passed them on to my sons when they were old enough to use them.</li>
            <li>However, they do use different heads, with the AT810 using a dual precision head HQ8 and this one using CareTouch (HQ7) which is supposed to cut a little higher to avoid ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>The other model I had was decent in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really am noticing less ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have used quite a few different electric razors over the years, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve had that allows the use of shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is anything about the razor the illustrations did not convey, but if this is your first rotary shaver, a few basic sentences would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no indicator to tell you how much charge is left, no adjustment for closeness of shave, no carry case, and no self-cleaning system like other more expensive shavers might have.  </li>

            <li>But, like my XL-8260, the AT790 runs normally and then abruptly stops when the battery runs out.  </li>

            <li>It is easier to get a close shave when using it dry as you can pull your skin taught to let the blades shave more closely to the skin, which is hard to do when your face is wet with shaving cream.  </li>

            <li>battery power in my older Norelco, the one I bought in 2008, has declined over the years in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t hold charges as long as it did when it was fresher, but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li>/&gt;What stood out for me with this particular razor though (and Norelco shavers in general), is that it works well on sensitive skin, in terms of there being less skin irritation in comparison to other shavers of similar type.</li>
            <li>but in my opinion, the dry shave and the just plain water wet shave was better than that of the wet foam based shave.</li>
            <li>I HAVE GIVEN UP ON RAZOR SHAVING DUE TO A VERY SENSITIVE SKIN..</li>

            <li> One day I found this wonderful beauty of a shaver the Philips Norelco AT790.</li>
            <li> With the Andis Profoil shaver I had to use the Andis T-outliner (which is wonderful!!!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, this shaver has done a very good job.  </li>
            <li> Very good product, but not like the color.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Great price for a great shaver!  </li>
            <li> A good razor doesn&#x27;t need to cost hundreds of dollars!</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great investment.</li>
            <li> Great product; wish it operated in corded mode, but I understand this is a safety feature to prevent electrocution from mixing water &amp; AC power.</li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower with a blade works great</li>
            <li> This one works great, has a trimmer, and when I bought mine, it had a $10 off coupon.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, great product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, another great quality electric razor from Norelco.</li>

            <li> This razor is great.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, well packaged, promptly shipped, good buy with a good price.  </li>
            <li> Great Razor,I would buy again,and it was a good price.</li>
            <li> A pleasant change from my Remington shaver</li>
            <li> I have been using this one with Edge gel, which I think is a very good gel that I&#x27;ve used many times with a blade razor.  </li>
            <li> Works good and is inexpensive</li>
            <li> seems to be a good shaver according to my man</li>
            <li> , if you don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, I&#x27;d recommend this as a good middle-of-the-road value/performer.</li>
            <li> By the way the shave I get is as good as I get with a blade shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good, no-nonsense razor that will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, gives a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is a good shaver for the price point, if you want a closer shave pick one with the HQ8 type of head.  </li>
            <li> This razor does a good job of meeting that balance.  </li>
            <li> but it is a really good shaver, so</li>
            <li> but it is a really good shaver, so</li>
            <li> So I expect that the battery in the AT790/40 is as good if not better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said it doesn&#x27;t seem to give quite a good a shave as his SpeedXL.  </li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about it but vowed to give it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who is avoiding electric razors because of the irritation from too close of a shave would be wise to try this model.</li>
            <li> The battery holds the charge for a good amount of time as well.</li>
            <li> That too was good.</li>
            <li> Be very, very glad.  </li>
            <li> This razor also looks stylish with that jazzy-yellow flourish, so you can shave in style!</li>
            <li> of them working perfectly,  Philips brand is my first choice now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great shaver that I will enjoy using for years or until the batteries die.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for close to a month and have found it be a nice, reliable, no-frills electric razor.</li>
            <li> I think this model would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Both have a nice trimmer too (that part of them looks identical).  </li>
            <li> I also own a Panasonic ES-LA93-K razor.</li>
            <li> and it conforms to his face nicely.</li>
            <li> The razor just kind of glides over the beard.  </li>
            <li> Kind of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may pass mine on to a friend that would be able to get good use out of it.</li>
            <li> nice feel in the hand, not noisy and looks nice.  </li>
            <li> (what Phillips Norelco calls Aquatec), and this is one really nice razor.  </li>
            <li> I use Aveeno Shave Gel, which is the absolute best of any shaving gel or foam I&#x27;ve used since I started shaving over four decades ago.</li>
            <li> I use Aveeno Shave Gel, which is the absolute best of any shaving gel or foam I&#x27;ve used since I started shaving over four decades ago.</li>
            <li> the absolute best electric shaver I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I liked the Braun but did not like the price of the cleaning solution that had to be replaced every month.</li>
            <li> Looks nice.</li>
            <li> Speaking of trimmers, the attached trimmer is a nice plus but it doesn&#x27;t replace my stand alone trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Bingo, he liked it and now has his own.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m impressed that it still holds a charge sufficient for 2-3 decent shaves before I have to recharge it.</li>
            <li> This guy is pretty good!</li>
            <li> a very good razor.very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and this is the best tool by far.  </li>
            <li> It fits very comfortably in my hand, and the pivoting blades move with the contours of my face and head.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives me a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth with a foam</li>
            <li> Very comfortable with the close shaves.</li>
            <li> I DID EXPECT MORE.</li>
            <li> Anyway, in an effort to be a relaxed, supportive parent who doesn&#x27;t hover or over-control</li>
            <li> (Love you Amazon Prime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more unsightly peach fuzz growing on the apple of my eye&#x27;s cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I love both of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> newer AT790 has more flex in the heads, making it feel a bit nicer on your chin.  </li>
            <li> , I just wish it had a beefier motor and more battery capacity.</li>
            <li> Way better than Philips Norelco SensoTouch 2D</li>
            <li> I bought it to shave my legs because I had knee surgery and could not shave in the shower any more.</li>
            <li> It does not have a battery indicator or a &#x27;cleaning needed&#x27; notice, but it works well for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anything, the HQ7 heads seem to track my face better.</li>
            <li> The shave was not as close as one I can get with a blade, but it was close for the most part.  </li>
            <li> The shave was not as close as one I can get with a blade, but it was close for the most part.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a horrible task.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never gotten as perfectly smooth a shave with any electric razor as I can with a good blade, but the Norelco 7180XL and this one, the AT790/40, give me as smooth and near-perfect a shave as I think I can get without using a razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver is so much better.</li>
            <li> it lasts more than a week.</li>
            <li> He really likes it and we feel for the money it was a great deal</li>
            <li> Love this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly made out of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found this model which advertised it as the best model to avoid ingrown hairs because it shaves hair just above the surface of the skin.  </li>
            <li> It gave an almost perfect shave without irritation from prior electric razors I had tried.  </li>
            <li> Now it takes more time and effort.  </li>
            <li> Quite satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> If I had reviewed this shaver after one week of usage, I would have rated it a two at the most.  </li>
            <li> That worked, well better than the foam based shave.</li>
            <li> but it does feel better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I found them just OK at the time.</li>
            <li> The Andis Profoil was giving me just an okay shave</li>
            <li> and I felt that there had to be something better out there.</li>
            <li> The more I cut with it the better it performed on my face.</li>
            <li> This product provides a nice, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Razor clean up was very easy with a good rinse under hot water.</li>
            <li> It has almost 100% plastic parts which while it is light weight it feels kind of cheap.</li>
            <li> and I do know that most any decent electric razor with good blades should cut well.  </li>
            <li> this is a replacement for my 3 year old shaver works great</li>
            <li> , most comfortable shaves I have ever had.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic razor has one wide foil that seems to work best for me.</li>
            <li> But there is no question the shave is more comfortable using shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> But there is no question the shave is more comfortable using shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> So far, its been doing a great job.  </li>
            <li> at the 3 week mark, I have to say that this shaver has given me the most comfortable shave ever.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a very reasonably-priced wet/dry shaver, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a very reasonably-priced wet/dry shaver, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li> I have used other electric razors but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> The cut was extremely close and perfect.</li>
            <li> The build quality on this is so much better, the heads shave close without any pulling, easy to clean under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> so my skin easily gets irritated.</li>
            <li> love this product and hope to get years of quality clean shaves.</li>
            <li> It is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is pretty much a nice working, no-frills shaver.  </li>
            <li> though if both units had brand new heads/blades in them, they might give equally good shaves).</li>
            <li> It still works fine.</li>
            <li> and these do that just fine.  </li>
            <li> Once the AT790 is charged, it works fine</li>
            <li> He has fine textured hair.</li>
            <li> It is a magnificent shaver for black men struggling with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Up until getting this shaver, I had been using barber&#x27;s clippers/groomers on their closest setting, but this did not get me the smooth shave I desired.  </li>
            <li> for performance, I thought it worked great on my chin and along my jaw, but the design doesn&#x27;t work well for my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> easy to use, and clean.</li>
            <li> Never thought that it would be comfortable an electric razor shaving.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> BUT wal-mart 50.00 free ship to</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a smooth shave that won&#x27;t irritate your skin or be too close and cause problems like ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> No problem getting a close, comfortable shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li> the recharge light has not come on yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this as a light duty shaver.</li>
            <li> So I thought maybe I could give electric shaving a try again if it was cheap</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Light goes off when it is charged fully.  </li>
            <li> About as comfortable as the non-irritation shave I get.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> No ingrown hairs and my face is smooth each time out.  </li>
            <li> I still get a close smooth shave without razor burn too.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> clean shave,Very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth,When engaging in activities to buy.</li>
            <li> like that I can rinse off the blades easily under running water, and it charges quickly.</li>
            <li> The lithium ion battery is nice because it will hold a charge longer than batteries in older models.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco razor is a good razor for the price providing consistent close shaves with very affordable maintenance parts.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but decided to try this out because of the just okay experience with the Andis</li>
            <li> I then opened the top of the shaver and again ran the hot tap water over the gears and heads until all was clean again.  </li>
            <li> A quick start sheet and separate detailed printed manual are also provided.  </li>
            <li> He likes the fact that he can rinse the razor off in water to help get it clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean…..works on 1-2 day stubble very well, which is all you can hope for in a well priced electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sound as powerful as the Remington shaver I had</li>
            <li> which - who had a full on Amish beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So the Norelco AT790/40 with \\&quot;Aquatec\\&quot; hits the sweet spot for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price, you are getting a good, basic shaver without any bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I never get them all, I just shave until I feel it&#x27;s good enough.  </li>
            <li> A full recharge takes close to 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> A full recharge takes close to 8 hours.  </li>
            <li> This really helps with minimizing irritation more so than using the Aveeno shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this shaver.   </li>
            <li> It is much lighter than most electric razors.  </li>
            <li> This is the first razor I&#x27;ve used where I haven&#x27;t had to deal with hairs becoming ingrown.</li>
            <li> It sounds weak and underpowered, almost too light (if that&#x27;s reality) but it does a great, great job, I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> The shaver glided easily over my face and provided a comfortable and reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lights on the razor include a Battery light, LED charge light and most importantly, a battery low function.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Lights on the razor include a Battery light, LED charge light and most importantly, a battery low function.  </li>
            <li> Yes the heads swivel a bit to follow your face but the wet shave is very nice.</li>
            <li> Both are as easy to clean manually, but the Panasonic comes with an automatic wash/dry system which is very convenient.</li>
            <li> charges quickly and comes with a cover for the blades.</li>
            <li> The AT790/40 is an excellent electric razor, especially at its relatively low price.  </li>
            <li> this excellent tool to be discontinued simply because they did not invest enough in marketing.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much and would feel comfortable in my recommendation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The pictures in the manual indicate it is fine to rinse the shaver under running water to clean the blades while the razor is still on and then go back to shave a bit more.  </li>
            <li> one son said it worked great and the other said it works better than his old one.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Real close shave and easy cleanup.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean since all you have to do is rinse it under water and leave it open to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still stand by my 5 star review of the Wahl Super Close, it is an excellent product, but the Caretouch deserves a 6 out of 5 stars due to the ability to wet shave and enjoy the comfort using shave oils and etc.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco 9160XL is a great dry electric shaver, but you have to sweep out all the stubble after each use and clean it frequently by dissembling the head - which is a pain</li>
            <li> I enjoy how easy it is to clean on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Hub says it shaves real well and the floating heads are comfortable and not abrasive.  </li>
            <li> and it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fact is, I rarely put either under running water.  </li>
            <li> I can only say that this razor gave me a shaving experience that was more comfortable than any</li>
            <li> has HQ9 heads, which are triple track with 3 sets of blades per head and gave the closest most comfortable shave especially on my mustache area.</li>
            <li> It shaves much smoother and my skin is much healthier and looks much better.</li>
            <li> When my last shaver gave up the ghost after 12 years of reasonably good service, I researched very thoroughly before settling on this model.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a symbol that supposedly lights up when it&#x27;s time to get a replacement head, for whatever that&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> But the most important thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave me with red skin, acne breakouts, or ingrown</li>
            <li> Gives me a great shave, though I&#x27;ve come to  realize that it&#x27;s not really the shaver that I need for my particular hair type.</li>
            <li> the Norelco AT790/40 will certainly provide you with close, comfortable shaves and be easy to keep clean for a reasonably low price.d a comfortable and reasonably close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer works as good as any other</li>
            <li> So the real decision is how close a shave is good enough for your needs vs the added expense in moving up to higher end razors.</li>
            <li> Says it right in the owners manual.</li>
            <li> I needed a shaver right away and ended up buying the Norelco AT790.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s all right for a shaved look.</li>
            <li> I tried it right away</li>
            <li> To end this review on a positive note, this electric razor leaves no razor burn or cuts on your skin, making it more reliable than a good old fashioned wet shave.</li>
            <li> the Norelco AT790/40 will certainly provide you with close, comfortable shaves and be easy to keep clean for a reasonably low price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, medium level razor that offers features (wet/dry, water cleaning) often found on more expensive models for a good price.</li>
            <li> I have used various methods of shaving to address razor bumps including Magic Shave and the Wahl Super Close</li>
            <li> /&gt;It charges fast, but overnight is needed for a full charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because my AT790/40 is less than a month old, the blades are of course super sharp and it gives a great shave and a superior shave to that of my 7180XL (</li>
            <li> This little wonder cuts almost as close as a blade shave, better than the rest, for sure.  </li>
            <li> What I like about this razor as I can shave quickly in the morning and save time getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> For one thing, it provides a traditionally-very good/close shave I have come to expect from a Norelco rotary shaver, while at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> significantly though is the fact that with these type of shavers you need to replace razor heads once a year--and because of their cost, you might as well keep buying new shavers every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish you could plug it into the wall, and use it direct, like the older models, but I am sure some &#x27;safety&#x27; problem now prohibits that.  </li>
            <li> My first Norelco lasted for 10 yrs.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of Norelco razors, this is a no frills model that works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> this razor was exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li> Very quality shaver!</li>
            <li> The first is that there&#x27;s no travel case included.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed when I unpacked the shaver is how lightweight it is.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;One of the big improvements made is being able to use shaving cream/gel with these things.</li>
            <li> IT HAS BEEN 3 DAYS FROM THE FIRST SHAVE</li>
            <li> I actually like the trimmer much better on either Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower (something Norelco says is okay to do in the FAQ for this razor at their site), which is so convenient (though I have to touch up around my sideburns outside the shower because I don&#x27;t have a mirror in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I bought this for my son and it is his first electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My first Norelco shaver was purchased 35 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I find that it works pretty well for me in that regard.</li>
            <li> Then I saw a better model with extra &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; at Costco for $69.00.  </li>
            <li> first use, I did have razor burns and some hair under my neck.</li>
            <li> first days, I tried to use the shaving gel, which I had used with my blade razor.</li>
            <li> Have been debating about a wet/dry shaver for quite awhile, glad I finally made the decision to get this one.</li>
            <li> This is my first electrical razor.</li>
            <li> I WAS NOT GETTING A CLOSE SHAVE; SO I BOUGHT THIS NEW NORELCO; BUT IT DID NOT GIVE A BETTER OF FASTER SHAVE THAN MY OLD NORELCO.</li>
            <li> had to replace the old shaver because Norelco stopped selling replacement blades for it; had I been able to get new blades</li>
            <li> Over time, I&#x27;ll spend more on replacement heads than on the shaver itself (MUCH more!), but I&#x27;ll go ahead and play the game, because this shaver works for me.</li>
            <li> It provides a good, close shave, does not grab at your skin, runs well wet or dry, and be easily cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li> It provides a good, close shave, does not grab at your skin, runs well wet or dry, and be easily cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li> This is a great item to have if you grow thick facial hair and want a clean shave!</li>
            <li> When this shaver came available for me to try I was happy to do so; after all I could compare it with a few recent Panasonic and some older Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a light that blinks while charging, and you can see readily when charging is complete.  </li>
            <li> In terms of cons, I thought its time to reacharge is kind of long in proportion to usage--8 hours for a full charge, for up to 40 minutes of cordless use--though this is pretty much the standard with many current shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I grabbed my iPhone and clicked on my Amazon App faster than Grizzly Adams could skin a fish (and it was pretty damned fast, let me tell you).  </li>
            <li> For those who can put up with that or if you have no history of irritation or sensitive skin, then this is a true value for you as it will do the job of those electric razors that are over $100.  </li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a pop-up trimmer in the back, it&#x27;s pretty light when holding it</li>
            <li> blade.&lt;br /&gt;While the shave is certainly acceptable, it is just not quite as close, but the trade-off is convenience and saving time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Norelco AT790/40 falls more at the entry level end of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver arrives in pretty basic packaging with an easy to open box and a firm, shaped cardboard liner to keep everything safe from damage.  </li>
            <li> THE SHAVE WAS VERY SMOOTH AND FAST DURING THE WET</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for my entire 40-year shaving career (this one is my fourth shaver), and I like them for being quiet, thorough, and easy to service on my own</li>
            <li> far as the technical specifics go: takes about eight hours to charge the first time (and it&#x27;s pretty easy to see when it&#x27;s done charging)</li>
            <li> but, it provides a much closer shave</li>
            <li> Just judging by the sound and initial feel, I did not expect it to perform well, but it did the job.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely zero burn with this shaver, no matter how aggressively you may push it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I has a solid construction with a non-slip surface, contoured to fit your hand.</li>
            <li> The charger is also very lightweight, and these features give it an edge to those who might use it for travel purposes.  </li>
            <li> I really like the looks and styling of this shaver.</li>
            <li> It has a very sporty look to it.  </li>
            <li> Like chargers with modern cell phones</li>
            <li> A brush is provided but I really can&#x27;t see any reason to use it unless you will be shaving where you don&#x27;t have access to a sink with running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A brush is provided but I really can&#x27;t see any reason to use it unless you will be shaving where you don&#x27;t have access to a sink with running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it or any real complaints about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He prefers the AT810, just because he wants the closer shave, but he will be using this AT790 on the spots where he often gets ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> They are very close in form factor, weight, and run time.  </li>
            <li> VERY WELL USING IT ABOUT 3 TIMES</li>
            <li> That is one feature I really miss on the Xl-8260.  </li>
            <li> So this shaver has what I really missed on the XL-8260, a battery level</li>

            <li> So this shaver has what I really missed on the XL-8260, a battery level</li>
            <li> , this razon shaves very close.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close to the skin with no razor burns.</li>
            <li> I found I get a closer shave with this Norelco using the shaving cream, but it&#x27;s still not quite as close as a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I like the wet better.</li>
            <li> From day one, the shave was comfortable but did not cut close and left hairs on my face/neck.  </li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, the shave is much closer.  </li>
            <li> really hope Philips Norelco gets the word out and do some hardcore marketing to boost demand.  </li>
            <li> The AT790 cut the hair with out me using my T-outliner and it left my face smooth and not irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems kind of messy to use gel and an electric razor, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it because of its performance.</li>
            <li> this one falls right about in the middle on cost, and is better than several of the others, some costing 50% more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s stylish, comfortable, and having a lithium ion battery should mean that it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Easy to maintain and stays charged for a long period.  </li>
            <li> Both seam to cut just fine - very smooth, no pulling the hair (as long as the blades are sharp).  </li>
            <li> Very good for both wet and dry shaving and extremely quiet.  </li>
            <li> know it shouldn&#x27;t matter, but I also really like how this particular razor looks.</li>
            <li> I think I put it back under the tap 4 times to clean the heads a bit until I was</li>
            <li> I normally wait a week between shaving, and the hairs grow out too much for the heads to tackle straight on</li>
            <li> When I first used it I thought it sounded underpowered or low on charge but it powered through two days worth of stubble without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AT790 is a reasonable replacement for the older Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I like this new one for what I use it for: light shaving here and there.</li>
            <li> If I were to lose this model, I would certainly consider replacing it, only I would likely go for a better model.</li>
            <li> It is quiet for an electric razor, but by the same token doesn&#x27;t sound or feel particularly powerful.</li>
            <li> It charged to full in about three hours, very simple.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to clean out as long as you dry</li>
            <li> It is surprising how little they have changed in the last 30 years.</li>
            <li> I just got this new AT790, the version that lets you clean it under running water, and I&#x27;m comparing it to another similar Norelco shaver (7310XL), that also can be cleaned under running water.  </li>
            <li> and it immediately cut better than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> you do get a better shave with more expensive razors.</li>
            <li> the razor I would choose if I was going to buy again, but a decent one for the money.</li>
            <li> My older 8240XL</li>
            <li> The charger has a thin, straight cord and feels fairly frail.  </li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco AT790/40 Caretouch razor gives a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I found it on clearance for cheaper than Amazon as I guess that particular store wasn&#x27;t going to stock this model any longer.  </li>
            <li> This Philips Norelco can be cleaned with regular tap water, just open the top and rinse.</li>
            <li> I just recommend that you use decent shaving cream.</li>

            <li> 1150X SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor to be more precise) became pretty much useless after a couple of cleanings.</li>
            <li> It wants to fold back in unless you hold it just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating the Norelco high for</li>
            <li> Norelco shavers are generally of high quality, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> RATED HIGHLY</li>
            <li> But when compared in pure performance vs a more expensive razor, it does not provide as smooth and close a shave -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors on and and off for about 40 years now, and the only ones I&#x27;ve used that I consider worth using are Norelco.</li>
            <li> It shaves close, relatively speaking, but you will not have a super smooth face since it only cuts the hair short to avoid razor bumps.  </li>
            <li> This is the third electric razor I have purchased for my teenage son but the first one that actually adequately tamed his beard.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning the shaver after shaving involves nothing more than popping the head open, rinsing it under some water, and letting it air dry.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Using this razor gave far less irritation than most electric razors.</li>
            <li> My spouse has used Norelco electric razors for more than 40 years, and his current model is a 8175 SpeedXL which is a dry razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought my last Norelco from Amazon in 2008 - the rechargeable cord/cordless model 7180XL - and replaced the heads once, and it&#x27;s still going strong (I only use it cordless).</li>
            <li> The shave from the AT790 is smooth and pretty much the same as the somewhat more expensive XL-8260.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the shaver is touted as being washable, I don&#x27;t want to take the risk of immersing it in water, and I clean it out quite easily enough with the included brush (or brushes from old shavers, or an old toothbrush could also work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also relatively light in comparison to other electric razors.  </li>
            <li> Rather than buying new blades for my old shaver, I opted, for a little more, to just buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Before receiving this razor, my previously smooth-faced, dimpled cheeked first born was walking around sporting Grizzly Adams whiskers (for those of you who were mercifully born after that cheesy show was popular, be glad you are oblivious to my reference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, he told me that his new pimpin style wasn&#x27;t a fad, his razor wasn&#x27;t working.  </li>
            <li> So rather re-writing an all new review.....</li>
            <li> There is no carry case provided, which in my opinion should be included with any new electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t say how fast the blades will dull because I haven&#x27;t put that many shaves on these</li>
            <li> And when you do, they might easily cost half the price of a new razor, so that&#x27;s something to keep in mind when thinking about investing in an electric razor.</li>
            <li> a warning: be careful when you take the shaving head off and clean it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when it&#x27;s time to clean it.</li>
            <li> (yes, I have been reading Parenting with Love and Logic), I refrained from remarking on my son&#x27;s alarming facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did a slightly better job that my current razor that cost almost twice as much, but I would not make a direct comparison given that the more expensive one has 2-year-old blades in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bitten by most electric razors in the past and I have yet to find one that does it irritation-free and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco razors over the years, and this is the first one that doesn&#x27;t leave me with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I turned it on was how quiet it was.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty basic.  </li>
            <li> I remember the first electric razor I bought back in the mid-80s.</li>
            <li> and I wash off the inner blades with hot water.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no rash on the face, full Shaver.</li>
            <li> *stand* from my old norelco and adapted it to the new power supply that came with this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is pretty much an entry level shaver as there are really no bells and whistles with this model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is pretty much an entry level shaver as there are really no bells and whistles with this model.  </li>
            <li> quick plus is that this shaver is not very noisy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin but still need to shave frequently, then BUY THIS SHAVER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for over twenty years and this one seems to provide a closer shave than any of the previous models I&#x27;ve owned, the 7800XL being the most recent one.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve bought some prescription moisturizer that has done the trick) and the occasional hair bump, but nothing like what I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with other shavers.  </li>
            <li> I did have to go over my whiskers with a few passes and pull my skin tight in a few places but it was in impressive shave considering the job at hand.</li>
            <li> so I have learned the hard way. :-)</li>
            <li> morning I merely briefly washed my face with soap, and while it was still wet applied some cheap shaving foam.  </li>
            <li> This one is also easier to clean than previous models.  </li>
            <li> This shaver feels to be 1/4 lighter than my old one.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> B00FRGM26C Philips Norelco HQ7/52 Gentle Cut Replacement Head]]) are currently $28, and it is recommended that they be replaced every 12 months or so.  </li>
            <li> My old model function always.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t try a swap with the old power supply.  </li>
            <li> The AT790 is noticeably quieter, and the trimmer works much faster to trim my facial hair and sideburns.</li>
            <li> + year old</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used many different electric shavers manufactured by Norelco, Remington, and Panasonic, each with different features and selling for a wide variety of prices.  </li>
            <li> In the old days you had to buy the conditioning liquid made specifically for electric razors or risk razor burn with</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 12-15 year old Norelco 5842 XL.  </li>
            <li> It takes 8 hours to charge fully; my old shaver took 2-3</li>
            <li> AT790 is a basic shaver that is a reasonable value and shaves well.</li>
            <li> Both razors can be rinsed under the tap, which is a much easier way to get hairs off and out of the razor than using a tiny brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use and swear by the Wahl 4000 with the sensitive head because ingrown hairs are a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Have not recharged it since I got it nearly 4 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> about 12 shaves so far and</li>
            <li> The results completely amazed me.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has skin problems with ingrown hairs or sensitive skin should give this model a try.  </li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t use the Norelco Lift &amp; Cut blades it gives a shave about as close as what you would expect to find on your face at about noon after an early morning shave: the hair is still there</li>
            <li> I have a 37 year old handicapped son that my wife has shaved from the start.</li>
            <li> The burning under the chin and neck had gone completely and I have mastered to art of shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always used a razor but due to the price increase and constant model changes, that eventually will force you to buy the available model and blade type, I settled in to buying an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> before.d pretty much the same as the somewhat more expensive XL-8260.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the black design adds a nice sleek, elegance to an otherwise mundane product.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of my older shavers, this model has a lithium-ion battery that not only provides a lot of juice between charges but will also not build up a memory like the old Ni-Cad and NiMH batteries.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t want to deal with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> Being a African American male I generally stayied away from them, however this one gives me a clean shave without the razor bumps.</li>
            <li> He says this razor is powerful, quiet, and doesn&#x27;t pull his whiskers (not even his long mountain man whiskers).  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Wahl shaver, I don’t have to first use a trimmer to cut my beard to get the hairs short enough to shave.  </li>
            <li> With both my 8240XL and the AT790 fully charged, within a month the AT790 is completely dead while the 8240XL works perfectly at full power.</li>
            <li> The third week, I used soap to wash my face, towel dried the face and washed the heads with warm water and used the wet type shave.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut as thoroughly as a blade, which means you have to make more passes to get an equal shave, but it just doesn&#x27;t pull or scrape hardly at all.  </li>
            <li> Simple yet worth every dollar spent.</li>
            <li> On the plus side for the Norelco is the Panasonic costs almost 4 times as much, and the replacement blades are similarly much more expensive.</li>
            <li> This makes it heavier and less convenient to use when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars, with a few minor complaints (mainly related to traveling with the razor), the AT790 with single track HQ7 heads works just as fast and good as the 8240XL with HQ9 triple-track heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had given up on electric razors due to skin irritation after I decided that I simply didn&#x27;t have a skin type suitable for electric shaving.  </li>
            <li> If I was careful to not apply too much pressure and only shaved when my face was perfectly clean and very dry, I could achieve a half decent result without butchering my skin, but I could never shave every day.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s solid price/performance mix as long as your expectations for the shave you&#x27;ll get is reasonable.</li>
            <li> He also said that it is very quiet and when he trims his &#x27;ears&#x27; and near them, it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise in his ear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I consider this a con because if the power starts to run out in the middle of a shave, you (I) don&#x27;t want to have to wait hours to use it again (and unlike my older Norelco, this one cannot be powered by wall current; there&#x27;s an explanation for this at the aforementioned FAQ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other of the modern Norelco&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor i have ever bought that actually gave me the same feeling as when i wet shave.</li>
            <li> He says it is much better than his (old and dull) previous electric razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned several shavers and passed them on to my sons when they were old enough to use them.</li>
            <li> However, they do use different heads, with the AT810 using a dual precision head HQ8 and this one using CareTouch (HQ7) which is supposed to cut a little higher to avoid ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The other model I had was decent in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really am noticing less ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have used quite a few different electric razors over the years, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve had that allows the use of shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything about the razor the illustrations did not convey, but if this is your first rotary shaver, a few basic sentences would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no indicator to tell you how much charge is left, no adjustment for closeness of shave, no carry case, and no self-cleaning system like other more expensive shavers might have.  </li>

            <li> But, like my XL-8260, the AT790 runs normally and then abruptly stops when the battery runs out.  </li>
            <li> But, like my XL-8260, the AT790 runs normally and then abruptly stops when the battery runs out.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to get a close shave when using it dry as you can pull your skin taught to let the blades shave more closely to the skin, which is hard to do when your face is wet with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to get a close shave when using it dry as you can pull your skin taught to let the blades shave more closely to the skin, which is hard to do when your face is wet with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> battery power in my older Norelco, the one I bought in 2008, has declined over the years in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t hold charges as long as it did when it was fresher, but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> /&gt;What stood out for me with this particular razor though (and Norelco shavers in general), is that it works well on sensitive skin, in terms of there being less skin irritation in comparison to other shavers of similar type.</li>
            <li> but in my opinion, the dry shave and the just plain water wet shave was better than that of the wet foam based shave.</li>
            <li> I HAVE GIVEN UP ON RAZOR SHAVING DUE TO A VERY SENSITIVE SKIN..</li>
            <li> The only thing I miss from my previous Norelco was that it was a little easier to clean out the blade area, but that&#x27;s only a minor issue.</li>
            <li> The AT790 seems to have a slower motor than my older shaver, so it takes me a little longer to shave.  </li>
            <li> While browsing the Norelco website to see if anything \\&quot;new\\&quot; had come to shaving in recent years, I saw a typical parade of all the Norelco Lift &amp; Cut models that promised shaving the hair below the skin, super close shaves, etc.  </li>
            <li> I wish the charge would at least last a week to two weeks or at least be able to work with a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stubble still present after quite a long time of shaving.</li>
            <li> only con is that the charging time is long, an estimated 8 hours to fully charge it for up to 40 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> only con is that the charging time is long, an estimated 8 hours to fully charge it for up to 40 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> one issue that I do have with this shaver is that battery life does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> first to get the small hairs even smaller and then use the profoil shaver to cut the smaller hairs, which left my face burning slightly.</li>
            <li> I kept the shaver open and set it on 2 paper towels to dry.  </li>
            <li> am comparing this shaver to my current ones, a Norelco XL-8240 (dry) and a Panasonic ES4026NC (wet/dry).  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it takes 2-3x longer to shave with the electric razor to get the same results as wet shaving.</li>
            <li> At first his skin was a little irritated but only for a few days.  </li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from razor bumps and want to enjoy the benefits of a wet have.  </li>
            <li> I started slowly and carefully and used it only 2 times the first week.  </li>
            <li> So after letting it charge initially overnight I tried it out with some plain old Gillette shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> So if you shave only dry, you might want to look for a  dry shaver that does run while plugged</li>
            <li> So if you shave only dry, you might want to look for a  dry shaver that does run while plugged</li>
            <li> close shave,wet or dry,blades don,t nip your skin,easey to clean,chage last a long time&amp;#60;2wks&amp;#62;!!!</li>
            <li> You really should not post a review until you’ve used it at least the recommended 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> but I wonder just how long it will hold up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a pop-up trimmer which works well, and the charge lasts a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> and although it&#x27;s a little messy compared to the dry/&amp;#34;Lectric Shave&amp;#34; way I used before with other razors, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , that is if you don&#x27;t mind a larger water and power bill due to the long time you have to shower and keep the water going.  </li>
            <li> He tested this Caretouch model both wet and dry, and definitely prefers using it dry.  </li>
            <li> It seems capable of cutting only the single stray hair, and is not really powerful enough to do real grooming.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco from Amazon vine, and other than the color I can not see any difference between the two.  </li>
            <li> Like other Norelco shavers I have owned this model has a pop up trimmer in back for trimming sideburns or a moustache that works well.  </li>
            <li> Like other Norelco shavers I have owned this model has a pop up trimmer in back for trimming sideburns or a moustache that works well.  </li>
            <li> Hope this model will last longer than other electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have noticed that the AT790 does not retain a battery charge very long.</li>
            <li> I either used my dry electric shaver (a Philips Norelco 9160XL SmartTouch XL men&#x27;s shaver) or shaved in the shower with a blade and soap.  </li>
            <li> and it works dry too.</li>
            <li> I have yet to dry shave with the shaver</li>
            <li> Just a dry shave.</li>
            <li> While that is an obvious, and necessary, safety feature, it does prevent you from shaving dry when your shaver goes dead and you want to dry shave while it is plugged in/charging.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The shaver is not completely waterproof, so it is not designed for usage in the shower, but it is designed for shaving both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> The other complaint is that the charger uses a straight cord, and not a coiled cord like on the 8240XL.</li>
            <li> OR MY DURATION OF TIME SPENT (TO LONG)</li>
            <li> /&gt;After researching and narrowing the model down, I finally decided to purchase the AT790 razor from Norelco.</li>
            <li> Feeling let down but determined to succeed, I used the shaver daily.</li>
            <li> The next time I will get one that takes less time for a recharge.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Philips Caretouch and received it less than two days later</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is about 40 minutes overall, typical of this type of razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco backs the AT790 with a 2 year warranty, AND a 45 day money back guarantee, less</li>

            <li> He has not used it for wet shaving as he prefers a dry shave.  </li>
            <li> It is part of the Aquatec line from Norelco which is for wet or dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> Daily use can be, but the texture is not particularly good, hope to improve next time will not necessarily buy.</li>
            <li> The AT790 performs just as well as my other Norleco in dry conditions, and just as well as my Panasonic dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> The body of the razor is a little too big for a woman&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have always had a hard time balancing a close shave with protecting my face.  </li>
            <li> My older Norelco shavers would slow down as the battery was dying, so you got some warning, even without a battery meter, that the shaver would soon need a charge.  </li>

            <li> One of my other razors lacks some of the features and was only $20 less than this</li>
            <li> I have coarse facial hair that is hard to cut</li>
            <li> and you never really get all the stubble out unless it is dissembled.  </li>
            <li> There are really no frills with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Add to that the ability to wet shave</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t understand &amp;#34;aquatec&amp;#34; - I didn&#x27;t want to wet my face for fact shaving.  </li>
            <li> These used to be included, sometimes a molded case with a more expensive razor, or a soft case with a less expensive model - but there was always a case, so you could travel with the razor, its charger, brush, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that the pop-up shaver is not very useful at all.  </li>
            <li> In addition you have to constantly buy new blades, and these days they are quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how poortly my previous shaver (also a Norelco) had been doing; course, it was at least 8 years old.  </li>
            <li> My other annoyance is that replacement heads ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> For me, the reality is I cannot get quite as close a shave with this (or any other electric) razor as I can get with a razor</li>
            <li> This makes it a bit easier to trim my moustache and sideburns than other razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to make the same comment I do for every Norelco shaver I have bought in the past 5 years or so</li>
            <li> And a can of it lasts longer than any other</li>
            <li> And a can of it lasts longer than any other</li>
            <li> Have used electric shavers in the past with mixed results.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find a reason that other reviewers are saying this isn&#x27;t for use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Norelco makes other shavers for you guys.  </li>
            <li> A WEEK VERY MINIMAL BUMPS</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed that it cannot be used while plugged in, but that is a very minor issue compared to the relief of a smooth shave without skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> I had a similar Norelco that had dull blades and tired batteries, it is cheaper to buy a new one that to replace blades and batteries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will eventually need to replace the blades (Philips recommends annually), which Philips Norelco refers to as replacement heads, and how soon depends on how frequently you use the razor and how tough your beard is.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it has a hard time with getting the whiskers on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least 5 or 6 electric razors in the last 10 years...</li>
            <li> only complaint is the 30 - 40 minutes of charge the razor holds.</li>
            <li> What I found with this razor and using the gel was that it cut my beard with less pulling and less friction than any other shaving system I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> so I rely on the trimmer to trim everything down to a point the heads can do their jobs without ripping my hairs</li>
            <li> Thumbs up for Norelco motors and gearing; thumbs down for trying to boost sales by turning off the supply of spare parts.  </li>
            <li> Can be annoying to adjust it at the right angle, and I have not had the same problem with other razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I paid less than $40.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get a bit of irritation after using this shaver, but my skin has always been subject to irritation and I used to get it from my Panasonic, too.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT MY PREVIOUS SHAVING PURCHASE COMMENTS THERE ALL</li>
            <li> Everything I said previously still holds.  </li>
            <li> and you can slightly feel it, so</li>
            <li> Previously, pre-shave lotion and then finish shaving in two minutes.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a comfort shaver, not a super close shaver.</li>
            <li> As a black man I&#x27;ve always had to deal with curly hairs growing inward.</li>
            <li> That was what went wrong with my other Norelco razor: the thin plastic that held the individual blades together came apart and couldn&#x27;t be put back together properly, which resulted in the head popping off every time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> but it is not a true wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li> Has a little less zip.  </li>
            <li> There is not a huge amount of output so the motor seems to operate at slightly lower than optimal speed.</li>
            <li> The electric shavers are a lot less messy, and the Norelco cuts out the cost cleaning solution and/or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> newer AT790 is shaped a little narrower at the end, could slip out of your hand, but it never has (yet)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> found that the trimmer is a little too touchy.</li>
            <li> so there is little chance of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> have shaved with this razor a few times with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It keeps destroying my neck to the point that I can not use it</li>
            <li> I do NOT have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> (just rinse with water), the battery charge lasts a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge quite well, and the closeness of the shave is very typical for a quality electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Recently, some of Norelco&#x27;s less expensive models have not had a pop up trimmer on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did have trouble getting it to adequately shave hairs at the base of my neck, though.  </li>
            <li> I did have trouble getting it to adequately shave hairs at the base of my neck, though.  </li>
            <li> I really wish this was the case for me, but unfortunately its back to the cold blades of steel for me.  </li>
            <li> This razor has cut down on them by at least 90%.</li>
            <li> and I have been using Panasonic for the past decade or so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely not top of the line.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems like the battery is somewhat small.</li>
            <li> My 8240XL came with a small nylon zippered case that could store the razor in my luggage or carry on bag.</li>
            <li> Usually use disposable shavers but with the increase of their cost decided to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t shave every day, but usually 3 to 4 times per week without any skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Poor shave quality,not what I expected from Norelco.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how to explain it</li>
            <li> I replace my blades (the heads) at least every year, usually 9months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a complaint</li>
            <li> And it runs for at least a week (shaving once each morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of all the electric shavers I have tried over the years, I always found Norelco to be the least of the evils.  </li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t mean you can use the razor under running water in the shower, then I guess I don&#x27;t know why Norelco would put that in the guide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> B0018C0LP8 000 blade]] to give myself serious stubble for the electric razor to battle.</li>
            <li> Not a good thing to mismatch it.</li>
            <li> This was not a good option.</li>
            <li> Using a blade, regardless of brand and shaving technique, was never good.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works good and is inexpensive</li>
            <li> this is a replacement for my 3 year old shaver works great</li>
            <li> My first Norelco lasted for 10 yrs.  The rotating blades give me a closer shave than the foil shavers.  This shaver feels to be 1/4 lighter than my old one.  Has a little less zip.  It still works fine.</li>
            <li> seems to be a good shaver according to my man</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because I have extremely sensitive skin.  Up until getting this shaver, I had been using barber&#x27;s clippers/groomers on their closest setting, but this did not get me the smooth shave I desired.  This shaver came with &amp;#34;gentle cut&amp;#34; blades, so I took a chance that they would cut close, but not so close that my skin would break out and that I would develop horrendous &amp;#34;hair bumps&amp;#34; later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this shaver has done a very good job.  It fits very comfortably in my hand, and the pivoting blades move with the contours of my face and head.  I still experience some irritation on my face (I&#x27;ve bought some prescription moisturizer that has done the trick) and the occasional hair bump, but nothing like what I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with other shavers.  Although the shaver is touted as being washable, I don&#x27;t want to take the risk of immersing it in water, and I clean it out quite easily enough with the included brush (or brushes from old shavers, or an old toothbrush could also work well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have a complaint, it&#x27;s that the pop-up shaver is not very useful at all.  It seems capable of cutting only the single stray hair, and is not really powerful enough to do real grooming.  My other annoyance is that replacement heads ([[ASIN:B00FRGM26C Philips Norelco HQ7/52 Gentle Cut Replacement Head]]) are currently $28, and it is recommended that they be replaced every 12 months or so.  Over time, I&#x27;ll spend more on replacement heads than on the shaver itself (MUCH more!), but I&#x27;ll go ahead and play the game, because this shaver works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor about 3 weeks. It&#x27;s a bit liter and the shaving head is also a bit smaller than my prior one. I don&#x27;t mind the difference at all.  This razor gives me a very comfortable shave.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this razor is it takes 8 hrs. to fully recharge the battery.  The next time I will get one that takes less time for a recharge.</li>
            <li> hubby says it is one of the best</li>
            <li> This model do not function with cord when the battery is low, for this reason you will have to charge a 5 min to use when battery are low, and I think that you have to leave out when the battery will die. My old model function always.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great investment. I got mine at Wal-Mart for $64 and it is well worth the money. It doesn&#x27;t sound as powerful as the Remington shaver I had but, it provides a much closer shave and since it is aquatic you can use any gel or foam product.</li>
            <li> Best power shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  Made in Holland.  I&#x27;ve tried two other of the modern Norelco&#x27;s.  The build quality on this is so much better, the heads shave close without any pulling, easy to clean under the faucet.  I took the power *stand* from my old norelco and adapted it to the new power supply that came with this.  It does not come with a stand.  You have to use the power supply that came with this, don&#x27;t try a swap with the old power supply.  The voltage level is different between models. Not a good thing to mismatch it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least 5 or 6 electric razors in the last 10 years... this one falls right about in the middle on cost, and is better than several of the others, some costing 50% more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s stylish, comfortable, and having a lithium ion battery should mean that it lasts longer. It is quiet for an electric razor, but by the same token doesn&#x27;t sound or feel particularly powerful. Just judging by the sound and initial feel, I did not expect it to perform well, but it did the job. It did a slightly better job that my current razor that cost almost twice as much, but I would not make a direct comparison given that the more expensive one has 2-year-old blades in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, I&#x27;d recommend this as a good middle-of-the-road value/performer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bitten by most electric razors in the past and I have yet to find one that does it irritation-free and unfortunately if you have a history of irritation, this may just be another one that bites the dust(or your face in this case.)  For those who can put up with that or if you have no history of irritation or sensitive skin, then this is a true value for you as it will do the job of those electric razors that are over $100.  I really wish this was the case for me, but unfortunately its back to the cold blades of steel for me.  This razor also looks stylish with that jazzy-yellow flourish, so you can shave in style!</li>
            <li> Wet or dry, it gets the job done. I have used this for close to a month and have found it be a nice, reliable, no-frills electric razor. It holds a charge quite well, and the closeness of the shave is very typical for a quality electric shaver. For me, the reality is I cannot get quite as close a shave with this (or any other electric) razor as I can get with a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;While the shave is certainly acceptable, it is just not quite as close, but the trade-off is convenience and saving time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have shaved with this razor a few times with shaving cream. The shave was a bit closer, but realistically, if I am going to go the extra step of using shaving cream I will just use a razor blade. What I like about this razor as I can shave quickly in the morning and save time getting ready for work. I already have some growth coming in by the end of the day, but that&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can rinse off the blades easily under running water, and it charges quickly. This is a nice, medium level razor that offers features (wet/dry, water cleaning) often found on more expensive models for a good price. One of my other razors lacks some of the features and was only $20 less than this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it shouldn&#x27;t matter, but I also really like how this particular razor looks. I think the black design adds a nice sleek, elegance to an otherwise mundane product. I think this model would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED NORELCO RAZORS FOR ABOUT 40 YEARS. I WAS NOT GETTING A CLOSE SHAVE; SO I BOUGHT THIS NEW NORELCO; BUT IT DID NOT GIVE A BETTER OF FASTER SHAVE THAN MY OLD NORELCO. I DID EXPECT MORE. I CHOSE THIS MODEL FOR ITS WATERPROOF FEATURE.</li>
            <li> This is the third electric razor I have purchased for my teenage son but the first one that actually adequately tamed his beard.  Before receiving this razor, my previously smooth-faced, dimpled cheeked first born was walking around sporting Grizzly Adams whiskers (for those of you who were mercifully born after that cheesy show was popular, be glad you are oblivious to my reference.  Be very, very glad.  Just know he was a big old lumberjack or mountain man or communer with bears or overly happy recluse - not sure which - who had a full on Amish beard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgive me, I digressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where was I?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, my son&#x27;s chin bush!  Anyway, in an effort to be a relaxed, supportive parent who doesn&#x27;t hover or over-control (yes, I have been reading Parenting with Love and Logic), I refrained from remarking on my son&#x27;s alarming facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, he told me that his new pimpin style wasn&#x27;t a fad, his razor wasn&#x27;t working.  I grabbed my iPhone and clicked on my Amazon App faster than Grizzly Adams could skin a fish (and it was pretty damned fast, let me tell you).  I ordered the Philips Caretouch and received it less than two days later (Love you Amazon Prime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more unsightly peach fuzz growing on the apple of my eye&#x27;s cheeks.  He says this razor is powerful, quiet, and doesn&#x27;t pull his whiskers (not even his long mountain man whiskers).  He also likes the pop up trimmer.</li>
            <li> I just got this new AT790, the version that lets you clean it under running water, and I&#x27;m comparing it to another similar Norelco shaver (7310XL), that also can be cleaned under running water.  Fact is, I rarely put either under running water.  They are easy to clean out as long as you dry shave - and these do that just fine.  I love both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer AT790 is shaped a little narrower at the end, could slip out of your hand, but it never has (yet)&lt;br /&gt;The newer AT790 has more flex in the heads, making it feel a bit nicer on your chin.  Both have a nice trimmer too (that part of them looks identical).  Both are charged and then run on an internal battery.  My guess is it&#x27;s the same or similar battery technology inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AT790 uses HQ7 heads, the 7310XL uses HQ8&#x27;s.  I don&#x27;t know what the difference it, probably just size.  Both seam to cut just fine - very smooth, no pulling the hair (as long as the blades are sharp).  I replace my blades (the heads) at least every year, usually 9months or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say, both are equal, unless you have them both in your hands to compare, and then it&#x27;s user preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco razors over the years, and this is the first one that doesn&#x27;t leave me with ingrown hairs. Despite what you might read here, this razor IS MADE TO BE USED IN THE BATH OR SHOWER!!!  Says it right in the owners manual. Great product; wish it operated in corded mode, but I understand this is a safety feature to prevent electrocution from mixing water &amp; AC power.</li>
            <li> one son said it worked great and the other said it works better than his old one.  so i gave it a four rating.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco from Amazon vine, and other than the color I can not see any difference between the two.  So rather re-writing an all new review..... same razor - same review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I owned several shavers and passed them on to my sons when they were old enough to use them. Then I tried the Panasonic shavers and I made the switch and I have been using Panasonic for the past decade or so. When this shaver came available for me to try I was happy to do so; after all I could compare it with a few recent Panasonic and some older Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here goes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely not top of the line. It has almost 100% plastic parts which while it is light weight it feels kind of cheap. The shaver is put together well enough but I wonder just how long it will hold up. Also, it seems like the battery is somewhat small. There is not a huge amount of output so the motor seems to operate at slightly lower than optimal speed. This being said, there is no difference between corded &amp; cordless shaving and regardless of how it \\&quot;seems\\&quot; to run, it shaves just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say this is one of the quickest, most comfortable shaves I have ever had. I think I am back to being a Norelco man after this experience. I like the way the heads float on my face, especially around the chin, mouth area and under my nose. There is absolutely zero burn with this shaver, no matter how aggressively you may push it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges fast, but overnight is needed for a full charge. And it runs for at least a week (shaving once each morning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works as good as any other shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I like it, I just wish it had a beefier motor and more battery capacity. If I were to lose this model, I would certainly consider replacing it, only I would likely go for a better model.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of Norelco razors, this is a no frills model that works pretty well.  Aside from the three metal foils, everything else visible is rubber and plastic.  The end flips open for cleaning, and to allow you to pop out the head for replacement.  The lithium ion battery is nice because it will hold a charge longer than batteries in older models.  In the box, you get the razor, a plastic cap, the charger, and a basic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for performance, I thought it worked great on my chin and along my jaw, but the design doesn&#x27;t work well for my upper lip.  I ended up going back and cleaning up with a safety razor because I just couldn&#x27;t get an even shave on my upper lip.  My Panasonic razor has one wide foil that seems to work best for me.</li>
            <li> This guy is pretty good! Daily use can be, but the texture is not particularly good, hope to improve next time will not necessarily buy.</li>
            <li> this razor was exactly what my husband wanted.</li>
            <li> easy to use, and clean. No residues. Way better than Philips Norelco SensoTouch 2D 1160X/42 Electric Razor, a more expensive model.</li>
            <li> very perfect product! It&#x27;s a gift for my husband.and give him a big surprise in our spring holiday.thanks for the sales.</li>
            <li> The Norelco razor is a good razor for the price providing consistent close shaves with very affordable maintenance parts. I also own a Panasonic ES-LA93-K razor. In comparison, the Norelco shaver does not get as close a shave as the Panasonic. Both are as easy to clean manually, but the Panasonic comes with an automatic wash/dry system which is very convenient. On the plus side for the Norelco is the Panasonic costs almost 4 times as much, and the replacement blades are similarly much more expensive. Within their respective price levels, I&#x27;d say the Norelco is a solid razor for it&#x27;s price. But when compared in pure performance vs a more expensive razor, it does not provide as smooth and close a shave - you do get a better shave with more expensive razors. So the real decision is how close a shave is good enough for your needs vs the added expense in moving up to higher end razors. I&#x27;m rating the Norelco high for it&#x27;s solid price/performance mix as long as your expectations for the shave you&#x27;ll get is reasonable.</li>
            <li> The body of the razor is a little too big for a woman&#x27;s hand. I bought it to shave my legs because I had knee surgery and could not shave in the shower any more. This was not a good option. Stubble still present after quite a long time of shaving. Very disappointed. The trimmer release is located in a bad place. My finger touches it when I am trying to use the razor.</li>
            <li> So I have owned numerous electric shavers over the years.  Prior to getting the Philips Norelco AT790/40 Caretouch Electric Razor with Aquatec I either used my dry electric shaver (a Philips Norelco 9160XL SmartTouch XL men&#x27;s shaver) or shaved in the shower with a blade and soap.  The Norelco 9160XL is a great dry electric shaver, but you have to sweep out all the stubble after each use and clean it frequently by dissembling the head - which is a pain and you never really get all the stubble out unless it is dissembled.  Shaving in the shower with a blade works great, that is if you don&#x27;t mind a larger water and power bill due to the long time you have to shower and keep the water going.  In addition you have to constantly buy new blades, and these days they are quite expensive.  So the Norelco AT790/40 with \\&quot;Aquatec\\&quot; hits the sweet spot for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I merely briefly washed my face with soap, and while it was still wet applied some cheap shaving foam.  I then unplugged my Norelco and stuck the head briefly under the tap, and then began shaving.  I think I put it back under the tap 4 times to clean the heads a bit until I was finished shaving.  I then opened the top of the shaver and again ran the hot tap water over the gears and heads until all was clean again.  I kept the shaver open and set it on 2 paper towels to dry.  Then you place the cap back on and after a week or two of shaving you plug it back in to charge (the night before) so that you allow 8 hours to charge.  By the way the shave I get is as good as I get with a blade shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great shaver that I will enjoy using for years or until the batteries die.  Great price for a great shaver!  6 stars if I could give it that.</li>
            <li> This is a good, no-nonsense razor that will get the job done. There are no extra frills with this razor. It does not have a battery indicator or a &#x27;cleaning needed&#x27; notice, but it works well for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the trimmer is a little too touchy. It wants to fold back in unless you hold it just right. Can be annoying to adjust it at the right angle, and I have not had the same problem with other razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the razor I would choose if I was going to buy again, but a decent one for the money.</li>
            <li> Norelco shavers are generally of high quality, and this one is no exception. It has a pop-up trimmer, a cleaning brush, and is cordless. It&#x27;s also pretty comfortable to use. In terms of cons, I thought its time to reacharge is kind of long in proportion to usage--8 hours for a full charge, for up to 40 minutes of cordless use--though this is pretty much the standard with many current shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More significantly though is the fact that with these type of shavers you need to replace razor heads once a year--and because of their cost, you might as well keep buying new shavers every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What stood out for me with this particular razor though (and Norelco shavers in general), is that it works well on sensitive skin, in terms of there being less skin irritation in comparison to other shavers of similar type.</li>
            <li> My husband has been very happy using this razor. He says it is much better than his (old and dull) previous electric razor. He says it provides a close shave (I agree) and it conforms to his face nicely. He also said that it is very quiet and when he trims his &#x27;ears&#x27; and near them, it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of noise in his ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I has a solid construction with a non-slip surface, contoured to fit your hand. There is a pop out side-burn trimmer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It charges quickly and comes with a cover for the blades.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few different electric razors over the years, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve had that allows the use of shaving gel.  And, that&#x27;s quite a feature.  I have been using this one with Edge gel, which I think is a very good gel that I&#x27;ve used many times with a blade razor.  What I found with this razor and using the gel was that it cut my beard with less pulling and less friction than any other shaving system I&#x27;ve ever used.  The razor just kind of glides over the beard.  It doesn&#x27;t cut as thoroughly as a blade, which means you have to make more passes to get an equal shave, but it just doesn&#x27;t pull or scrape hardly at all.  Kind of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can&#x27;t say how fast the blades will dull because I haven&#x27;t put that many shaves on these and I do know that most any decent electric razor with good blades should cut well.  I can only say that this razor gave me a shaving experience that was more comfortable than any I think I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  It seems kind of messy to use gel and an electric razor, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it because of its performance.</li>
            <li> Never thought that it would be comfortable an electric razor shaving. Absolutely no rash on the face, full Shaver. Battery presence of 4 shave.</li>
            <li> There is no need to buy a $100 razor. This one works great, has a trimmer, and when I bought mine, it had a $10 off coupon. I paid less than $40. The only drawback I see is it is battery only, you cannot use it with the cord. I had a similar Norelco that had dull blades and tired batteries, it is cheaper to buy a new one that to replace blades and batteries.</li>
            <li> Gives me a great shave, though I&#x27;ve come to  realize that it&#x27;s not really the shaver that I need for my particular hair type. Works wonderfully, gives a close, smooth shave. I may pass mine on to a friend that would be able to get good use out of it. Very quality shaver!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the performance of the AT790/40 because of its single-track HQ7 heads. My older 8240XL has HQ9 heads, which are triple track with 3 sets of blades per head and gave the closest most comfortable shave especially on my mustache area. With the AT790, I noticed that it had the same shaving performance as the 8240XL in the same amount of time. If anything, the HQ7 heads seem to track my face better. The AT790 is noticeably quieter, and the trimmer works much faster to trim my facial hair and sideburns. I normally wait a week between shaving, and the hairs grow out too much for the heads to tackle straight on so I rely on the trimmer to trim everything down to a point the heads can do their jobs without ripping my hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have 2 complaints. The first is that there&#x27;s no travel case included. My 8240XL came with a small nylon zippered case that could store the razor in my luggage or carry on bag. The other complaint is that the charger uses a straight cord, and not a coiled cord like on the 8240XL. This makes it heavier and less convenient to use when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 4/5 stars, with a few minor complaints (mainly related to traveling with the razor), the AT790 with single track HQ7 heads works just as fast and good as the 8240XL with HQ9 triple-track heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 7 MAR 2014&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that the AT790 does not retain a battery charge very long. With both my 8240XL and the AT790 fully charged, within a month the AT790 is completely dead while the 8240XL works perfectly at full power. Once the AT790 is charged, it works fine but I felt the need to deduct a star for a short standby battery lifespan especially when my 6+ year old 8240XL can keep a charge for well over a month on standby.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used many different electric shavers manufactured by Norelco, Remington, and Panasonic, each with different features and selling for a wide variety of prices.  The Norelco AT790/40 falls more at the entry level end of the spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver arrives in pretty basic packaging with an easy to open box and a firm, shaped cardboard liner to keep everything safe from damage.  There are really no frills with this shaver.  The box contains the shaver, a plastic cover to protect the cutting blades, a charger, and a small brush to help with cleaning.  A quick start sheet and separate detailed printed manual are also provided.  There is no carry case provided, which in my opinion should be included with any new electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I unpacked the shaver is how lightweight it is.  The charger is also very lightweight, and these features give it an edge to those who might use it for travel purposes.  I really like the looks and styling of this shaver. It has a very sporty look to it.  It has a light that blinks while charging, and you can see readily when charging is complete.  Unlike some of my older shavers, this model has a lithium-ion battery that not only provides a lot of juice between charges but will also not build up a memory like the old Ni-Cad and NiMH batteries.  It is also one of the reasons the shaver is so lightweight.  The charger has a thin, straight cord and feels fairly frail.  Like chargers with modern cell phones, it is not designed to be handled roughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is not completely waterproof, so it is not designed for usage in the shower, but it is designed for shaving both wet and dry.  So after letting it charge initially overnight I tried it out with some plain old Gillette shaving cream.  The first thing I noticed when I turned it on was how quiet it was.  You are not going to wake anyone up when this thing is running.  The shaver glided easily over my face and provided a comfortable and reasonably close shave.  I could feel the cutting heads moving and adapting to the curves of my face.  The shave was not as close as one I can get with a blade, but it was close for the most part.  I did have trouble getting it to adequately shave hairs at the base of my neck, though.  It is easier to get a close shave when using it dry as you can pull your skin taught to let the blades shave more closely to the skin, which is hard to do when your face is wet with shaving cream.  But there is no question the shave is more comfortable using shaving cream.  Like other Norelco shavers I have owned this model has a pop up trimmer in back for trimming sideburns or a moustache that works well.  Cleaning the shaver after shaving involves nothing more than popping the head open, rinsing it under some water, and letting it air dry.  Nothing could be easier.  A brush is provided but I really can&#x27;t see any reason to use it unless you will be shaving where you don&#x27;t have access to a sink with running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty much an entry level shaver as there are really no bells and whistles with this model.  There is no indicator to tell you how much charge is left, no adjustment for closeness of shave, no carry case, and no self-cleaning system like other more expensive shavers might have.  But if you don&#x27;t need all of those fancier features the Norelco AT790/40 will certainly provide you with close, comfortable shaves and be easy to keep clean for a reasonably low price.d a comfortable and reasonably close shave.  I could feel the cutting heads moving and adapting to the curves of my face.  The shave was not as close as one I can get with a blade, but it was close for the most part.  I did have trouble getting it to adequately shave hairs at the base of my neck, though.  It is easier to get a close shave when using it dry as you can pull your skin taught to let the blades shave more closely to the skin, which is hard to do when your face is wet with shaving cream.  But there is no question the shave is more comfortable using shaving cream.

            <li> This Philips Norelco AT790/40 Caretouch razor gives a decent shave. I&#x27;ve used it several times now and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it or any real complaints about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is quite quiet. When I first used it I thought it sounded underpowered or low on charge but it powered through two days worth of stubble without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this razor gave far less irritation than most electric razors. It can be used with shaving cream or gel but it is not a true wet/dry razor. Don&#x27;t take this in the shower with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is mounted somewhat further forward on the barrel of the razor than some others that I&#x27;ve used. This makes it a bit easier to trim my moustache and sideburns than other razors. It&#x27;s still somewhat awkward but it&#x27;s not a horrible task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the 30 - 40 minutes of charge the razor holds. I find myself just using it and leaving it plugged in when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> This is a basic shaver.  Since what actually shaves are the blades and the motor (not the fancy led lights or indicators) I often wonder what you are paying for if you buy a more expensive model. I actually had just recently bought him a Norelco AT810, and  these two look the same except for the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However, they do use different heads, with the AT810 using a dual precision head HQ8 and this one using CareTouch (HQ7) which is supposed to cut a little higher to avoid ingrown hairs.  The HQ810 does have a longer run time (50 min vs 40 min).  The AT790 specifies that you can use it for 240V, whereas I could not find that info for the AT810.  The AT810 will charge in an hour whereas the AT790 takes 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years my husband has tried a lot of shavers, from the cheapest to the most expensive and he always comes back to Norelco.  This is a good shaver for the price point, if you want a closer shave pick one with the HQ8 type of head.  He prefers the AT810, just because he wants the closer shave, but he will be using this AT790 on the spots where he often gets ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using an electric razor almost all of my life.  This one does the job quite well.  I enjoy how easy it is to clean on a daily basis.  For the money, you cannot beat the AT790</li>
            <li> When I got my product on Monday and opened it there was a lot dust and seems like someone had used the product.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor i have ever bought that actually gave me the same feeling as when i wet shave. The only downside is that it takes 2-3x longer to shave with the electric razor to get the same results as wet shaving. To end this review on a positive note, this electric razor leaves no razor burn or cuts on your skin, making it more reliable than a good old fashioned wet shave. This is a great item to have if you grow thick facial hair and want a clean shave!</li>
            <li> I am coming to this razor from a Panasonic electric shaver.  The shave is close enough, and after 30 days of use I really am noticing less ingrown hairs.  The shaver is pretty basic.  It is lightweight and comfortable to hold.  I sometimes get a bit of irritation after using this shaver, but my skin has always been subject to irritation and I used to get it from my Panasonic, too.  For the price, you are getting a good, basic shaver without any bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I remember the first electric razor I bought back in the mid-80s. It is surprising how little they have changed in the last 30 years. This one is a bit smaller and definitely lighter than the one I had way back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the big improvements made is being able to use shaving cream/gel with these things. In the old days you had to buy the conditioning liquid made specifically for electric razors or risk razor burn with these suckers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d grown my beard out a bit so I used my [[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster clippers]] with the [[ASIN:B0018C0LP8 000 blade]] to give myself serious stubble for the electric razor to battle. Then I realized I needed to charge it for 8 hours so it was the trim plus 8 hours of five o&#x27;clock shadow growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results? Stubble defeated. I did have to go over my whiskers with a few passes and pull my skin tight in a few places but it was in impressive shave considering the job at hand. Razor clean up was very easy with a good rinse under hot water.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have always had a hard time balancing a close shave with protecting my face.  This razor does a good job of meeting that balance.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it has a hard time with getting the whiskers on my neck.  I never get them all, I just shave until I feel it&#x27;s good enough.  Otherwise, great product</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 12-15 year old Norelco 5842 XL.  I&#x27;ve used Norelcos for my entire 40-year shaving career (this one is my fourth shaver), and I like them for being quiet, thorough, and easy to service on my own (I replace the batteries myself).  I shave dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to replace the old shaver because Norelco stopped selling replacement blades for it; had I been able to get new blades, that shaver probably had another 5 years in it.  Thumbs up for Norelco motors and gearing; thumbs down for trying to boost sales by turning off the supply of spare parts.  That policy lost the AT790 a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AT790 is a reasonable replacement for the older Norelco.  They are very close in form factor, weight, and run time.  The AT790 seems to have a slower motor than my older shaver, so it takes me a little longer to shave.  The AT790 can&#x27;t be run off of the A/C plug; you can charge it, or run it, but not both at the same time.  It takes 8 hours to charge fully; my old shaver took 2-3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AT790 is a basic shaver that is a reasonable value and shaves well.</li>
            <li> NOT PURCHASED THROUGH AMAZON  BUT wal-mart 50.00 free ship to store.&gt;&gt;&gt;OUT OF THE BOX IT DID NOT CHARGE IT WAS PLUGGED IN FOR ABOUT 10 HOURS I DID CONTACT PHILLIPS THRU A ONLINE CHAT TO FIND THAT THE CHARGER MAY BE THE CULPRIT THE REP INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY BUT OUT OF A COURTESY HE WILL SEND ONE WITHIN 7-10 DAYS ONCE I RECEIVE IT AND  SHAVE I WILL UPDATE YOU GUYS. I HAVE GIVEN UP ON RAZOR SHAVING DUE TO A VERY SENSITIVE SKIN..AND MY SHAVING TECHNIQUES..PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT MY PREVIOUS SHAVING PURCHASE COMMENTS THERE ALL RATED HIGHLY SO I&#x27;M RETURNING TO AN ELECTRIC SHAVER PRIOR USER OF A WAHL 5 STAR SO I&#x27;LL UPDATE YOU ALL SOON&#x3D;&#x3D;UPDATE&#x3D;&#x3D; THE SHAVE WAS VERY SMOOTH AND FAST DURING THE WET SHAVE NO PULLING OF ANY SORT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IRRITATION AROUND THE CHIN AND LIP AREA NON ON THE NECK OR CHEEKS COULD BE THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE BEING APPLIED OR MY DURATION OF TIME SPENT (TO LONG) IT HAS BEEN 3 DAYS FROM THE FIRST SHAVE I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT FOR THE NEXT 30 DAYS AND UPDATE AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;!!UPDATE!! WORKING VERY WELL USING IT ABOUT 3 TIMES A WEEK VERY MINIMAL BUMPS I MADE A CHANGE WITH THE TYPES OF PRE SHAVE AND AFTERSHAVE CARE.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my son for Christmas.  He loves it!  He can now shave in fraction of the time.  At first his skin was a little irritated but only for a few days.  Once he adjusted, he said that it gave him a close shave and thanked me for making his life easier.</li>
            <li> The unit works well, nothing fancy but didn&#x27;t expect that for the price.  nice feel in the hand, not noisy and looks nice.  Works as designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with it.</li>
            <li> Working perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought Philips razor,  Philips TV antenna,  Philips tooth brush and  Philips Blu-ray player recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them working perfectly,  Philips brand is my first choice now.</li>
            <li> My husband says this is the best razor he has ever had. He has fine textured hair. My son tried it and didn&#x27;t like but he has course facial hair. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> There is a lot to like about the Norelco AT790.  For one thing, it provides a traditionally-very good/close shave I have come to expect from a Norelco rotary shaver, while at a very reasonable price.  Add to that the ability to wet shave (what Phillips Norelco calls Aquatec), and this is one really nice razor.  It is made in The Netherlands.  Personally, I have owned Norelco shavers made in china, and I find a difference in the quality, specifically the durability and the head assembly popping off during cleaning, so when possible go with a model from the Netherlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s in the box?&lt;br /&gt;* Phillips Norelco AT790/40 electric shaver&lt;br /&gt;* Plastic cap&lt;br /&gt;* AC charger&lt;br /&gt;* Cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;* User&#x27;s Manual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to make the same comment I do for every Norelco shaver I have bought in the past 5 years or so - how about a darn case?  These used to be included, sometimes a molded case with a more expensive razor, or a soft case with a less expensive model - but there was always a case, so you could travel with the razor, its charger, brush, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: The User&#x27;s Manual is not written directions, but all illustrations.  Not a big deal, and somewhat simple to follow.  I don&#x27;t think there is anything about the razor the illustrations did not convey, but if this is your first rotary shaver, a few basic sentences would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AT790/40 has the standard Norelco 3 rotary head design, and sports a pop up trimmer.  Recently, some of Norelco&#x27;s less expensive models have not had a pop up trimmer on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am comparing this shaver to my current ones, a Norelco XL-8240 (dry) and a Panasonic ES4026NC (wet/dry).  The AT790 performs just as well as my other Norleco in dry conditions, and just as well as my Panasonic dry or wet.  I actually like the trimmer much better on either Norelco.  For whatever reason, the trimmer on the Panasonic was always a bit \\&quot;biting\\&quot; on my skin.  The shave from the AT790 is smooth and pretty much the same as the somewhat more expensive XL-8260.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to the shaver: because it is wet/dry, you CANNOT use it while you have it plugged in.  While that is an obvious, and necessary, safety feature, it does prevent you from shaving dry when your shaver goes dead and you want to dry shave while it is plugged in/charging.  Again though, a necessary safety feature.  So if you shave only dry, you might want to look for a  dry shaver that does run while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is about 40 minutes overall, typical of this type of razor.  A full recharge takes close to 8 hours.  The shaver does adjust for international voltage (100v - 240v).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lights on the razor include a Battery light, LED charge light and most importantly, a battery low function.  That is one feature I really miss on the Xl-8260.  My older Norelco shavers would slow down as the battery was dying, so you got some warning, even without a battery meter, that the shaver would soon need a charge.  I guess that was because they didn&#x27;t have a Li-Ion battery.  But, like my XL-8260, the AT790 runs normally and then abruptly stops when the battery runs out.  So this shaver has what I really missed on the XL-8260, a battery level indicator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco backs the AT790 with a 2 year warranty, AND a 45 day money back guarantee, less shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a very reasonably-priced wet/dry shaver, this is a good choice.  It provides a good, close shave, does not grab at your skin, runs well wet or dry, and be easily cleaned under running water.  The razor in and by itself is a &#x60;5&#x27;.  I felt like maybe it should be rated a 4 based on the absurd \\&quot;illustrations only\\&quot; manual - but it is a really good shaver, so I felt the manual wasn&#x27;t enough of a detractor and went with a 5, especially if you&#x27;ve used a Norelco rotary shaver before.d pretty much the same as the somewhat more expensive XL-8260.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to the shaver: because it is wet/dry, you CANNOT use it while you have it plugged in.

            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how poortly my previous shaver (also a Norelco) had been doing; course, it was at least 8 years old.  Rather than buying new blades for my old shaver, I opted, for a little more, to just buy a new shaver.  So far, its been doing a great job.  The only thing I miss from my previous Norelco was that it was a little easier to clean out the blade area, but that&#x27;s only a minor issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors on and and off for about 40 years now, and the only ones I&#x27;ve used that I consider worth using are Norelco. I bought my last Norelco from Amazon in 2008 - the rechargeable cord/cordless model 7180XL - and replaced the heads once, and it&#x27;s still going strong (I only use it cordless). I have never gotten as perfectly smooth a shave with any electric razor as I can with a good blade, but the Norelco 7180XL and this one, the AT790/40, give me as smooth and near-perfect a shave as I think I can get without using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my AT790/40 is less than a month old, the blades are of course super sharp and it gives a great shave and a superior shave to that of my 7180XL (though if both units had brand new heads/blades in them, they might give equally good shaves). Both razors can be rinsed under the tap, which is a much easier way to get hairs off and out of the razor than using a tiny brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will eventually need to replace the blades (Philips recommends annually), which Philips Norelco refers to as replacement heads, and how soon depends on how frequently you use the razor and how tough your beard is. And when you do, they might easily cost half the price of a new razor, so that&#x27;s something to keep in mind when thinking about investing in an electric razor. The AT790 uses the replacement heads that are listed on Amazon as Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads, so you can check the current price and see what you&#x27;ll need to spend a year or so after buying this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery power in my older Norelco, the one I bought in 2008, has declined over the years in the sense that it doesn&#x27;t hold charges as long as it did when it was fresher, but that&#x27;s to be expected and I&#x27;m impressed that it still holds a charge sufficient for 2-3 decent shaves before I have to recharge it. So I expect that the battery in the AT790/40 is as good if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AT790/40 can be used with gel or foam but I have not felt the need to try that. (When I shave with a razor blade I use Aveeno Shave Gel, which is the absolute best of any shaving gel or foam I&#x27;ve used since I started shaving over four decades ago. And a can of it lasts longer than any other I&#x27;ve tried.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had problems with ingrown hairs so I cannot comment on how well it works for that. I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower (something Norelco says is okay to do in the FAQ for this razor at their site), which is so convenient (though I have to touch up around my sideburns outside the shower because I don&#x27;t have a mirror in the shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that the charging time is long, an estimated 8 hours to fully charge it for up to 40 minutes of use. I consider this a con because if the power starts to run out in the middle of a shave, you (I) don&#x27;t want to have to wait hours to use it again (and unlike my older Norelco, this one cannot be powered by wall current; there&#x27;s an explanation for this at the aforementioned FAQ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, another great quality electric razor from Norelco. If you&#x27;re looking for a gift for a guy who uses an electric, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have questions about this model, check Norelco&#x27;s page for it, where you can find FAQ, instruction videos and a PDF of the user manual.l or foam but I have not felt the need to try that.

            <li> I have had norelco shavers for years and this is the worst !&lt;br /&gt;It keeps destroying my neck to the point that I can not use it</li>
            <li> Usually use disposable shavers but with the increase of their cost decided to try this product.  Have used electric shavers in the past with mixed results.  I have coarse facial hair that is hard to cut but this razor did the job with no  problem.  Easy to maintain and stays charged for a long period.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a smooth shave that won&#x27;t irritate your skin or be too close and cause problems like ingrown hairs this is the one. I used to use and swear by the Wahl 4000 with the sensitive head because ingrown hairs are a problem for me. I went on a trip and forgot my shaver. I needed a shaver right away and ended up buying the Norelco AT790. This shaver is so much better. It shaves much smoother and my skin is much healthier and looks much better.</li>
            <li> I selected this for my father, so the review is his, not mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pretty much a nice working, no-frills shaver.  Very lightweight and easy to use.  Very good for both wet and dry shaving and extremely quiet.  No problem getting a close, comfortable shave with this razor.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Norelco razors seem to be a hit with my husband.  Bought this to replace an outdated Norelco.  Hub says it shaves real well and the floating heads are comfortable and not abrasive.  He likes the fact that he can rinse the razor off in water to help get it clean.  He has not used it for wet shaving as he prefers a dry shave.  Battery life is great...it lasts more than a week.</li>
            <li> My spouse has used Norelco electric razors for more than 40 years, and his current model is a 8175 SpeedXL which is a dry razor.  He tested this Caretouch model both wet and dry, and definitely prefers using it dry.  He said it doesn&#x27;t seem to give quite a good a shave as his SpeedXL.  He&#x27;ll use this model when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a pop-up trimmer which works well, and the charge lasts a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor now for 2 months. I have used other electric razors but this one is the best. I have eczema so my skin easily gets irritated. I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin irritation while using this razor. However, I apply lotion(Aveeno) to my face two or three times a day. This really helps with minimizing irritation more so than using the Aveeno shaving gel. I highly recommend this product for anyone who has sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t want to deal with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and it is his first electric shaver. He really likes it and we feel for the money it was a great deal</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Have not recharged it since I got it nearly 4 weeks ago. Admittedly, I only shave an avg. of 3 times a week (retired) that&#x27;s still about 12 shaves so far and the recharge light has not come on yet. The last razor I got about 4 shaves then had to recharge. Another note, this razon shaves very close. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I intentionally waited several months before writing this review. My first Norelco shaver was purchased 35 years ago.  Using a blade, regardless of brand and shaving technique, was never good.  Even being shaved by professionals, my face would be a mess within 24 - 36 hours, and then impossible to shave until it cleared up, which could take up to a week.  Of all the electric shavers I have tried over the years, I always found Norelco to be the least of the evils.  If I was careful to not apply too much pressure and only shaved when my face was perfectly clean and very dry, I could achieve a half decent result without butchering my skin, but I could never shave every day.  My face always needed a day or two or three to recuperate. When my last shaver gave up the ghost after 12 years of reasonably good service, I researched very thoroughly before settling on this model.  I was apprehensive about it but vowed to give it a fair chance.  The results completely amazed me.  I was getting a great shave without any destruction to my skin.  I started slowly and carefully and used it only 2 times the first week.  Then 3 times the next.  I still don&#x27;t shave every day, but usually 3 to 4 times per week without any skin irritation.  A few times I shaved every day for five days straight, and still had no problems. This is, without a doubt. the absolute best electric shaver I have ever used.  I am a bit disappointed that it cannot be used while plugged in, but that is a very minor issue compared to the relief of a smooth shave without skin irritation.  Thank you, Norelco for this wonderful device.  I hope you never discontinue it.  Update:  Feb. 2, 2017 Has it been 2 and 1/2 years already??  It is still going strong.  I cannot say enough good things about this shaver.   Everything I said previously still holds.  If you have sensitive skin but still need to shave frequently, then BUY THIS SHAVER!</li>
            <li> Shaves very close to the skin with no razor burns.</li>
            <li> I only got this razor because the one I already had, made by the same company and about $30 more expensive (Philips Norelco 1150X SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor to be more precise) became pretty much useless after a couple of cleanings. Overall, I like this new one for what I use it for: light shaving here and there. I don&#x27;t use it for full-face shaving, so can&#x27;t comment on that. The other model I had was decent in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a warning: be careful when you take the shaving head off and clean it. That was what went wrong with my other Norelco razor: the thin plastic that held the individual blades together came apart and couldn&#x27;t be put back together properly, which resulted in the head popping off every time I tried to use it. Once I saw the outrageous price on a replacement head, it made sense why the thing had such a crappy design. This model, however, seems to have a sturdier design than that more expensive razor. The plastic contraption holding the blades together is thicker, but I&#x27;d still exercise caution when it&#x27;s time for a cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the technical specifics go: takes about eight hours to charge the first time (and it&#x27;s pretty easy to see when it&#x27;s done charging), there&#x27;s a pop-up trimmer in the back, it&#x27;s pretty light when holding it and it&#x27;s not too noisy. There&#x27;s a symbol that supposedly lights up when it&#x27;s time to get a replacement head, for whatever that&#x27;s worth. It&#x27;s mostly made out of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this as a light duty shaver. I find that it works pretty well for me in that regard. Just be careful when it&#x27;s time to clean it.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had given up on electric razors due to skin irritation after I decided that I simply didn&#x27;t have a skin type suitable for electric shaving.  While browsing the Norelco website to see if anything \\&quot;new\\&quot; had come to shaving in recent years, I saw a typical parade of all the Norelco Lift &amp; Cut models that promised shaving the hair below the skin, super close shaves, etc.  Then . . . I found this model which advertised it as the best model to avoid ingrown hairs because it shaves hair just above the surface of the skin.  So I thought maybe I could give electric shaving a try again if it was cheap enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver at a Wal-Mart store after looking at the Norelco website.  I found it on clearance for cheaper than Amazon as I guess that particular store wasn&#x27;t going to stock this model any longer.  I charged it and gave it a try.  It gave an almost perfect shave without irritation from prior electric razors I had tried.  Anyone who has skin problems with ingrown hairs or sensitive skin should give this model a try.  It gives a shave *ALMOST* as close as a blade.  Since it doesn&#x27;t use the Norelco Lift &amp; Cut blades it gives a shave about as close as what you would expect to find on your face at about noon after an early morning shave: the hair is still there and you can slightly feel it, so it isn&#x27;t perfect.  But the most important thing is that it doesn&#x27;t leave me with red skin, acne breakouts, or ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking through the instruction manual (which is all pictures, no text) I can&#x27;t find a reason that other reviewers are saying this isn&#x27;t for use in the shower.  It is part of the Aquatec line from Norelco which is for wet or dry shaving.  The pictures in the manual indicate it is fine to rinse the shaver under running water to clean the blades while the razor is still on and then go back to shave a bit more.  If that doesn&#x27;t mean you can use the razor under running water in the shower, then I guess I don&#x27;t know why Norelco would put that in the guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who is avoiding electric razors because of the irritation from too close of a shave would be wise to try this model.</li>
            <li> Not as a close shave as with a razor but it&#x27;s all right for a shaved look.</li>
            <li> Great Razor,I would buy again,and it was a good price.</li>
            <li> This product provides a nice, clean shave.  The battery holds the charge for a good amount of time as well. The only drawback is that no travel pouch was supplied. So, I put mine in a zip-lock bag to prevent any stray whiskers from getting out into my luggage....which will happen, or so I have learned the hard way. :-)</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean…..works on 1-2 day stubble very well, which is all you can hope for in a well priced electric razor.  Wish you could plug it into the wall, and use it direct, like the older models, but I am sure some &#x27;safety&#x27; problem now prohibits that.  When it dies, you have to charge it to use it at all.</li>
            <li> It works great!  But I didn&#x27;t understand &amp;#34;aquatec&amp;#34; - I didn&#x27;t want to wet my face for fact shaving.  Previously, pre-shave lotion and then finish shaving in two minutes.  Now it takes more time and effort.  Then I saw a better model with extra &amp;#34;heads&amp;#34; at Costco for $69.00.  I would have purchased that. Ken A</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave and is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The AT790/40 is an excellent electric razor, especially at its relatively low price.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for over twenty years and this one seems to provide a closer shave than any of the previous models I&#x27;ve owned, the 7800XL being the most recent one.  This one is also easier to clean than previous models.  The initial charging takes a while, but it does seem to hold its charge well.  It&#x27;s also relatively light in comparison to other electric razors.  All in all, it&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> a very good razor.very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Poor shave quality,not what I expected from Norelco.</li>
            <li> This electric razor works as well as any electric razor I have owned. I have tried a Braun model that was self-cleaning. I liked the Braun but did not like the price of the cleaning solution that had to be replaced every month. The shave quality between the Braun and the Norelco is about the same, and the time it takes to shave is about the same. This Philips Norelco can be cleaned with regular tap water, just open the top and rinse. You can also use this Norelco with shaving cream, and clean-up again is with tap water. The electric shavers I have tried do not give as close a shave as a blade. I do NOT have a heavy beard. I like to shave every day. I have found however, that if I skip a day, and my beard gets a bit heavier, that the shaver actually seems to cut a bit faster and closer. I found I get a closer shave with this Norelco using the shaving cream, but it&#x27;s still not quite as close as a straight razor. The electric shavers are a lot less messy, and the Norelco cuts out the cost cleaning solution and/or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This little wonder cuts almost as close as a blade shave, better than the rest, for sure.  It sounds weak and underpowered, almost too light (if that&#x27;s reality) but it does a great, great job, I was surprised.  It charged to full in about three hours, very simple.  Light goes off when it is charged fully.  It is much lighter than most electric razors.  I like it very much and would feel comfortable in my recommendation.  About as comfortable as the non-irritation shave I get.</li>
            <li> Growing up with earlier versions of Electric Razors makes one cautious of \\&quot;new\\&quot; razors. I had microscreen and rotary but never could I have imagined a washable shave-in-the-shower electric rotary.  It is very smooth with a foam and I wash off the inner blades with hot water. Sleek!  Yes the heads swivel a bit to follow your face but the wet shave is very nice. and it works dry too. I tried it both ways. I like the wet better.</li>
            <li> Looks nice. Does the job. Quite satisfied with purchase. Razer could shave closer but it&#x27;s a comfort shaver, not a super close shaver.</li>
            <li> &amp;#62;best elect. razor I,ve had,close shave,wet or dry,blades don,t nip your skin,easey to clean,chage last a long time&amp;#60;2wks&amp;#62;!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, but not like the color.&lt;br /&gt;Very clean shave,Very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth,When engaging in activities to buy.</li>
            <li> My hubby is African American and gets lots of ingrown hairs. This razor has cut down on them by at least 90%. A good razor doesn&#x27;t need to cost hundreds of dollars! This one is great!</li>
            <li> If I had reviewed this shaver after one week of usage, I would have rated it a two at the most.  You really should not post a review until you’ve used it at least the recommended 3 weeks.  Now that I’m at the 3 week mark, I have to say that this shaver has given me the most comfortable shave ever.  I have used various methods of shaving to address razor bumps including Magic Shave and the Wahl Super Close and this is the best tool by far.  I still stand by my 5 star review of the Wahl Super Close, it is an excellent product, but the Caretouch deserves a 6 out of 5 stars due to the ability to wet shave and enjoy the comfort using shave oils and etc.  It exceeds expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed some of Craig the Barber’s advice and exfoliated, used a shave oil and Bump Patrol shave cream (shave cream was included with the shaver) prior to shaving.  From day one, the shave was comfortable but did not cut close and left hairs on my face/neck.  After 3 weeks, the shave is much closer.  Unlike the Wahl shaver, I don’t have to first use a trimmer to cut my beard to get the hairs short enough to shave.  With the Caretouch, I have gone two days without shaving and the hairs were still short enough to cut without the use of a trimmer.  Speaking of trimmers, the attached trimmer is a nice plus but it doesn&#x27;t replace my stand alone trimmer.  I charge the shaver overnight and it lasts longer than a week so I have no issue with the charge time.  It is also very easy to clean since all you have to do is rinse it under water and leave it open to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not suffer from razor bumps, this is not for you.  It shaves close, relatively speaking, but you will not have a super smooth face since it only cuts the hair short to avoid razor bumps.  Norelco makes other shavers for you guys.  But I highly recommend this to anyone who suffers from razor bumps and want to enjoy the benefits of a wet have.  I have yet to dry shave with the shaver so I can’t comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope Philips Norelco gets the word out and do some hardcore marketing to boost demand.  I would hate for this excellent tool to be discontinued simply because they did not invest enough in marketing.  This is an answer to a lot of people&#x27;s dreams.</li>
            <li> I have a 37 year old handicapped son that my wife has shaved from the start. He has never let me shave him. Then my wife was in the hospital. He was watching me shave with my Norelco, I asked if he wanted to try it and he did. Bingo, he liked it and now has his own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 6 months.  It works perfectly.  Easy to clean (just rinse with water), the battery charge lasts a few weeks.  I&#x27;m really impressed at the engineering quality of this razor.</li>
            <li> I have always used a razor but due to the price increase and constant model changes, that eventually will force you to buy the available model and blade type, I settled in to buying an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching and narrowing the model down, I finally decided to purchase the AT790 razor from Norelco. At first glance, it looked like an ordinary electric razor yet I followed the manufactures instructions and started to use it for the duration of time recommended by the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first use, I did have razor burns and some hair under my neck. Feeling let down but determined to succeed, I used the shaver daily. As the days rolled to weeks, soon the 3 week test cycle period came. The burning under the chin and neck had gone completely and I have mastered to art of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first days, I tried to use the shaving gel, which I had used with my blade razor. The cut was extremely close and perfect. Then the second week I used the razor with out any gel foam. Just a dry shave. That worked, well better than the foam based shave. No idea how that can be but it does feel better in my opinion. The third week, I used soap to wash my face, towel dried the face and washed the heads with warm water and used the wet type shave. That too was good. I am not sure how to explain it but in my opinion, the dry shave and the just plain water wet shave was better than that of the wet foam based shave. No burns and closer cut too, even on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and hope to get years of quality clean shaves. Hope this model will last longer than other electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the price and quality of the shave, I will recommend this shaver to anyone. Great product. Simple yet worth every dollar spent.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used.  No ingrown hairs and my face is smooth each time out.  It is a magnificent shaver for black men struggling with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Been using Norelco shavers for years. Very comfortable with the close shaves. Have been debating about a wet/dry shaver for quite awhile, glad I finally made the decision to get this one. Best shaver I have ever bought, works fantastically.</li>
            <li> It does the job.  The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I used Norelco razors years ago. I found them just OK at the time. I decided to try one again, and bought the AT790/40. This razor is great. Real close shave and easy cleanup. I&#x27;m hooked on this one!!</li>
            <li> This is the first razor I&#x27;ve used where I haven&#x27;t had to deal with hairs becoming ingrown. As a black man I&#x27;ve always had to deal with curly hairs growing inward. This razor doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs below the skin line so there is little chance of ingrown hairs. I still get a close smooth shave without razor burn too. I use it with a shave gel and although it&#x27;s a little messy compared to the dry/&amp;#34;Lectric Shave&amp;#34; way I used before with other razors, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this razor lives up to it&#x27;s name and would recommend it to anyone who has had problems with ingrown hairs on their face or neck.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, well packaged, promptly shipped, good buy with a good price.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> A pleasant change from my Remington shaver</li>
            <li> This is my first electrical razor. Being a African American male I generally stayied away from them, however this one gives me a clean shave without the razor bumps. I just recommend that you use decent shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had come to a point with the Andis Profoil shaver that I could not pass. The Andis Profoil was giving me just an okay shave and I felt that there had to be something better out there. One day I found this wonderful beauty of a shaver the Philips Norelco AT790. I was hesitant at first but decided to try this out because of the just okay experience with the Andis shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got home I tried it right away and it immediately cut better than my previous shaver. The more I cut with it the better it performed on my face. With the Andis Profoil shaver I had to use the Andis T-outliner (which is wonderful!!!) first to get the small hairs even smaller and then use the profoil shaver to cut the smaller hairs, which left my face burning slightly. The AT790 cut the hair with out me using my T-outliner and it left my face smooth and not irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another quick plus is that this shaver is not very noisy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue that I do have with this shaver is that battery life does not last long at all. An 8 hour charge only lasts 40 minutes! I wish the charge would at least last a week to two weeks or at least be able to work with a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this shaver doesn’t have a lot of fancy things with it but it does the job... and that’s all I ask</li>
