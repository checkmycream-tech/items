            <li> i must say i am not one for promoting products.  but i MUST MUST throw this one out there for all to see. I am a person who keeps my hair in braids and therefore the edges tend to break off and eventually bald. i had to come up with clever styles to hide the quarter size bald spot right on my right temple in plain sight!  Ladies when I tell you within 2 weeks i was seeing sprouts and a month later no evidence of balding. I stood in the mirror and cried! This product truly and quickly works.&lt;br /&gt;This is one product that i defintely will make sure to budget in my expenses for the month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT GREAT GREAT PRODUCT</li>
