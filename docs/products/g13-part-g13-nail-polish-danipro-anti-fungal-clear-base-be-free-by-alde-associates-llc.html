            <li>that is a good thing!</li>
            <li>This is a really great product.  </li>
            <li>I cannot tell you was it helpful but can say that the taker was happy)))</li>
            <li>It is great to cover the nails for wearing sandals with something that is good for them.</li>
            <li>Polish is good deterrent and this is my fav brand</li>
            <li>Love this polish!  </li>
            <li>good top coat, shiny.</li>
            <li>I used this product along with the dani pro color over it and dani pro top coat.</li>
            <li>Wish they had more colors, hopefully they will soon.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and allows top coat to spread evenly so gives a nice effect</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and also easy to apply color polish over it.  </li>
            <li>Nail polish goes on easy and stays on.</li>
            <li>It looks fine.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT, VERY FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>The polish goes on smoothly, dries quickly and lasts for many days.  </li>
            <li>I have been told not to wear polish while  growing out effected nails, this product allows me to enjoy polished nails with confidence.</li>
            <li>The color was beautiful and as the other reviewers said it does improve the appearance of your nails.  </li>
            <li>I have used herbs, tea tree, etc with some success.</li>
            <li>right off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I talked to my doctor and he said most likely nail polish brushes cannot transfer fungus from one nail to the other.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She probably will stop usage and opt for her standard nail polish since it&#x27;s more durable.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t really see spending this type of money for a product that dosen&#x27;t stay on and whether or not it will help fungus</li>
            <li>but I do not know if it had anything to do with using the same brush on the fungus nail and then using that brush to put polish on the fungus free nails...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Ok to use as a basecoat, wasn&#x27;t anything out of the ordinary, and I am trusting the anti-fungal properties are worth the price.</li>
            <li>As far as the antifungal properties, it works.</li>
            <li>I had prior to using the polish would not spread to my other fungus free nails.</li>
            <li>Third time I went to a salon and over these 3 things they put a quick dry product</li>
            <li>I do regret my purchase(s) - I bought several colors, plus base, plus top coating - and strongly don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>

            <li> This turned out to be a very appreciated hard nail polish for my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I used it as prescribed - applying first the base, then the color, then the top coat - for almost 3 months</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell as I&#x27;ve not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> I ordered this base coat and the Red First Kiss color, and it was really worth the money!  </li>
            <li> spent the extra money because my toe nails need it for anti fungal</li>
            <li> Strange, this product is advertised as an anti-fungal nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but it is a long term process using it and seeing the results.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended this for me with my long- time fungal nails.</li>
            <li> However, I expected at least some improvement after the first 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> On the worst nails, it does not look smooth but looks fine on the others.</li>
            <li> Recommend for use on toenails only, due to the chipping.</li>
            <li> Other products last 3 to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if it works yet but great as a base coat.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but a month or 2, but seems to have stopped the progression of fungus on toe nails, and may be doing the same on my thumb nails (result of gardener&#x27;s green thumb -- perpetual).</li>
            <li> The nail polish was everything I expected.  </li>
            <li> This polish is just like any other polish.</li>
            <li> I tried tea tree oil and other liquid antifungals and they did nothing.</li>
            <li> addition, the nail polish chips and peels off easily, the selection of colors is not great, some of them are very thick and hard to apply evenly (depending on the color) and is waaay overpriced to use it just instead of regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Now am trying this and Kerasal for a few months.</li>
            <li> I used it as a base coat, and it worked very well lasting 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Not only didn&#x27;t I see any, but worse, the nail fungus got worse and spread to other nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small print says it is not effective  on nails....</li>
            <li> I had issues with my big toe from a bad pedicure.</li>
            <li> Ordered the base coat to use with anti fungal red polish.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to use the base coat under the colors to help protect the nail.</li>
            <li> No idea if this eliminates fungus or just keeps it from getting worse</li>
            <li> Nail fungus is serious!</li>
            <li> I use the base and the pink color.</li>
            <li> I used the base on my toes and it chipped in about a week and half.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to get off...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is frustrated with nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible,,, Polish chipped in 1 day!!!</li>

            <li> I used this product along with the dani pro color over it and dani pro top coat. It chipped off the very next day--major. It just does not stay on. I tried again, same thing. Third time I went to a salon and over these 3 things they put a quick dry product and I sat for over an hour--its only on the toes. I can&#x27;t do the hands because as I said before it chips right off.&lt;br /&gt;I spent the extra money because my toe nails need it for anti fungal but I can&#x27;t really see spending this type of money for a product that dosen&#x27;t stay on and whether or not it will help fungus I can&#x27;t tell as I&#x27;ve not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is frustrated with nail fungus. I have been told not to wear polish while  growing out effected nails, this product allows me to enjoy polished nails with confidence.</li>
            <li> Ordered the base coat to use with anti fungal red polish. Was very disappointed. It did not work. Not worth the money. Will not buy neither product again.</li>
            <li> Go to the doctor! Polish is good deterrent and this is my fav brand but it&#x27;s not a cure. Nail fungus is serious! Get a prescription!</li>
            <li> Horrible,,, Polish chipped in 1 day!!!</li>
            <li> This turned out to be a very appreciated hard nail polish for my fingernails.  It is difficult to get off...that is a good thing!</li>

            <li> I ordered this base coat and the Red First Kiss color, and it was really worth the money!  The polish goes on smoothly, dries quickly and lasts for many days.  It has definitely improved the appearance of my toe nails, even when I don&#x27;t have them polished.  This is a really great product.  It definitely helps to use the base coat under the colors to help protect the nail.</li>
            <li> Ok to use as a basecoat, wasn&#x27;t anything out of the ordinary, and I am trusting the anti-fungal properties are worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my podiatrist&#x27;s recommendation to treat an incipient nail fungus. I used it as prescribed - applying first the base, then the color, then the top coat - for almost 3 months and it did nothing for the fungus. Now, I know fungus treatment requires patience, and I didn&#x27;t expect the nail polish to cure it overnight. However, I expected at least some improvement after the first 2 months of use. Not only didn&#x27;t I see any, but worse, the nail fungus got worse and spread to other nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the nail polish chips and peels off easily, the selection of colors is not great, some of them are very thick and hard to apply evenly (depending on the color) and is waaay overpriced to use it just instead of regular nail polish. I do regret my purchase(s) - I bought several colors, plus base, plus top coating - and strongly don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This polish is just like any other polish. It does not help with fungus you already have on your nails. I bought this so the fungus I had prior to using the polish would not spread to my other fungus free nails. It did spread but I do not know if it had anything to do with using the same brush on the fungus nail and then using that brush to put polish on the fungus free nails... I talked to my doctor and he said most likely nail polish brushes cannot transfer fungus from one nail to the other.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product  unless it was on sale.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom.  She didn&#x27;t notice any difference in her nails after three weeks.  She probably will stop usage and opt for her standard nail polish since it&#x27;s more durable.</li>
            <li> And so because it was a gift I cannot tell you was it helpful but can say that the taker was happy)))</li>
            <li> good top coat, shiny.</li>
            <li> Works as stated, this is the only one I now use, it even impresses the professionals that do my nails.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, VERY FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> it works and this is my second purchase</li>
            <li> It looks fine.  Just don&#x27;t know about its anti-fungal properties.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if it works yet but great as a base coat. Dries quickly and allows top coat to spread evenly so gives a nice effect</li>
            <li> The only problem with this polish is this that it chips. I cannot wear it on my fingernails without it chipping off. As far as the antifungal properties, it works. I had issues with my big toe from a bad pedicure. This polish has cleared everything up. I tried tea tree oil and other liquid antifungals and they did nothing. Recommend for use on toenails only, due to the chipping.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was everything I expected.  The color was beautiful and as the other reviewers said it does improve the appearance of your nails.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and also easy to apply color polish over it.  No idea if this eliminates fungus or just keeps it from getting worse--Only time will tell.</li>

            <li> As advertised...suggested by my Podiatrist. I used it as a base coat, and it worked very well lasting 2 weeks.</li>

            <li> I like it, but it is a long term process using it and seeing the results.</li>
            <li> I have had a fungus on my toenails, so this polish was recommended to me to keep the fungus from returning/spreading.  I use it on my fingernails as well.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended this for me with my long- time fungal nails. I have used herbs, tea tree, etc with some success. Now am trying this and Kerasal for a few months. It is great to cover the nails for wearing sandals with something that is good for them. On the worst nails, it does not look smooth but looks fine on the others. I use the base and the pink color. Wish they had more colors, hopefully they will soon.</li>
            <li> Love this polish!  Recommended by my podiatrist.  Nail polish goes on easy and stays on.</li>
