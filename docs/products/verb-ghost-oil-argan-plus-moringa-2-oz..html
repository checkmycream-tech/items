            <li>This oil is amazing for my hair!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel good as well as my hands.  </li>
            <li>It is more of a styling oil than argan or coconut oil, which are great for split ends and damage.</li>
            <li>love this stuff!</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!  </li>
            <li>everything does, let me tell you - and it makes me want to just sit and pet my own head.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Light easy to use with great shine</li>
            <li>IT IS FANTASTIC!</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this ghost oil.</li>
            <li>I finally figured out the best way to use this (for me) and it&#x27;s heavenly.  </li>
            <li>I began using it on my face and love the way that feels.  </li>
            <li>I love this and will be getting more.</li>
            <li>This oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>The scent is light.</li>
            <li>just a couple quick squirts on my fine hair and all is well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and blows out easily.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable since you get 2 oz.  </li>
            <li>works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>My first attempts in using the Ghost Oil did not go well.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, extremely long hair and</li>
            <li>It truly is light weight but moisturizing and smooths my coarse hair!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really find a lot of products that work for my hair that I read in those celeb magazines</li>
            <li>Really helps to manage the &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; on my curly haired head.</li>
            <li>Finally, suffering from severe static electricity in winter, I spray a bit on my hands and rub together and gently smooth down the fly-aways.  </li>
            <li>For reference: I have long, fine hair that is naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>Nice sheen and delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li>on 1 oz bottles in the past, so relatively speaking, this is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Just a tiny drop of the oil makes my dry hair ends look better.</li>
            <li>The product was recommended to me by a professional cosmetologist.</li>
            <li>Use sparingly, for real... and definitely test to see if it irritates your facial skin.</li>
            <li>I had some minor breakouts around my hairline, but I think I was using too much... not enough to stop me from using it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably tried between 20-25 different types of oils in the last 3-4 years from various brands - high &amp; low end.  </li>
            <li>and I barely have to use my flat iron</li>
            <li>I have coarse, dry, natural curl in my hair</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am attempting to replace my very expensive beauty products,  This doesn&#x27;t do it.  Onward thru the products unreadable labels.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside for me is it is very thick coming out of the bottle so its hard to pump.&lt;br /&gt;Is it a miracle, no...but it does help with tangles and makes your hair feel softer</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic. It is more of a styling oil than argan or coconut oil, which are great for split ends and damage. Ghost oil is lightweight but keeps the frizz at bay. I also like that it can be used root to tip. For reference: I have long, fine hair that is naturally wavy. I use a flatiron quite often.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! After reading about it in numerous magazines and seeing it on blogs, I just had to try it. IT IS FANTASTIC! My hair is soft and blows out easily. Use sparingly, for real... and definitely test to see if it irritates your facial skin. I had some minor breakouts around my hairline, but I think I was using too much... not enough to stop me from using it!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so shiny &amp; stops fly-away without making my hair oily.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I just walked out of a salon when I put it on after using the flat-iron.</li>
            <li> I use a couple drops (2 for short hair) just before I dry my hair. My hair is smoother, shinier and more manageable. I have coarse, dry, natural curl in my hair and it is color treated.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!! It truly is light weight but moisturizing and smooths my coarse hair!!!</li>
            <li> just a couple quick squirts on my fine hair and all is well.  doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down - and everything does, let me tell you - and it makes me want to just sit and pet my own head.  love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Light weight. Works well on thick hair. Don&#x27;t know what else to say about this great product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really find a lot of products that work for my hair that I read in those celeb magazines but I decided to try this one anyway and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It leaves my thin hair soft and pretty and I barely have to use my flat iron and it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> Really helps to manage the &amp;#34;frizz&amp;#34; on my curly haired head.</li>
            <li> I love this ghost oil. It fully disappears in hair no greasiness</li>
            <li> Light easy to use with great shine</li>
            <li> Used by AA woman w/ relaxed hair after shampoo and almost daily on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Love it. Nice sheen and delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li> I finally figured out the best way to use this (for me) and it&#x27;s heavenly.  I am unfortunate to have very fine, thin hair. I have avoided conditioners all my life due to this hair and the disaster combining with anything to make it worse. My first attempts in using the Ghost Oil did not go well.  I began using it on my face and love the way that feels.  Finally, suffering from severe static electricity in winter, I spray a bit on my hands and rub together and gently smooth down the fly-aways.  A miracle!  It worked great and added a shine to my hair without the added weight.  I love this and will be getting more.</li>
            <li> The VERB Ghost Oil is similar to other products I&#x27;ve used. The scent is light. Just a tiny drop of the oil makes my dry hair ends look better. But the oil takes a lot of work to get off of your hands. Even though the bottle was sealed, it still leaking in shipping. The product works, even if it is a little messy.</li>
            <li> The product was recommended to me by a professional cosmetologist. It has exceeded my expectations. It makes my hair feel good as well as my hands.  My hands do not feel oily.  This is an excellent product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase of this oil, which says alot for me.  I&#x27;ve probably tried between 20-25 different types of oils in the last 3-4 years from various brands - high &amp; low end.  This oil is amazing for my hair!  There is no discernible scent and it does not weigh down my hair.  I usually apply post style to smooth frizzies from 2/3rd of my hair down (never on the roots).  I have very fine, extremely long hair and this product never feels heavy. 2-3 pumps is all I need. I will continue to buy so long as I can find it &amp; would recommend it to anyone. The price is very reasonable since you get 2 oz.  I&#x27;ve spent upwards of $30-35+ on 1 oz bottles in the past, so relatively speaking, this is a good deal.  One negative is that once you get down to the last 10th or so of the bottle, the pump no longer works so you have to unscrew the cap to get the remnants of product out - no big deal.  Another negative for me is that once applied, I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!  Highly recommended!!!</li>
