            <li>I enjoy this lotion more than any others on the market.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and really busts the stress.</li>
            <li>/&gt;B&amp;BW&#x27;s entire Aromatherapy line is pretty great, but this one the Eucalyptus Tea and the Sensual line are exceptional.</li>
            <li>We really enjoy this aromatic, soothing, pleasing scent in body lotion.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I was happy.</li>
            <li>got this as a gift last year and just bought this one; the smell is amazing as i love the tea fragrance,  It also stays with you.</li>
            <li>I loved this particular lotion so much that I felt compelled to do a review on it.</li>
            <li>The  Bath &amp; Body Works met my full expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rodman</li>
            <li>It is cool.</li>
            <li>Came fast :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not one to return things often if its a quick fix i tapped it together so it would leak anymore.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and is very calming after a hot bath at the end of a busy day.</li>
            <li>i put it on right before I go to bed</li>
            <li>I take it with me to the nail salon and have them give me a quick massage on my neck and back with it. :-)</li>
            <li>but it does absorb into the skin very fast.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper to purchase online than in the stores!  </li>
            <li>Thanks BB&amp;B!</li>
            <li>I have moderate allergies and do fine with it.  </li>
            <li>and I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>as well  the shipping was fast ....</li>
            <li>I tried this every night for about a week, but I could not get over how much it smells like cologne.  </li>
            <li>It is the the things really relaxes.</li>
            <li>After applying, I feel much calmer and my day&#x27;s concerns fade away.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m in love with this product it was kind of disappointing that it arrived to me Cracked</li>

            <li> Love this stuff... I also have the Lavender Sleep scent.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  Want to order chamomile and Lavender body wash</li>
            <li> I loved this particular lotion so much that I felt compelled to do a review on it. Enough said!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B&amp;BW&#x27;s entire Aromatherapy line is pretty great, but this one the Eucalyptus Tea and the Sensual line are exceptional.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. The fragrance smell very good.  I don&#x27;t use perfumes as often because this lotion smell great on me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the aroma. It smells so good and is very calming after a hot bath at the end of a busy day.</li>
            <li> I keep this at my desk when I am working and get a little stressed out I just use a little and the aroma relaxes me.  A little bit goes a long way and I really like this lotion.  I could see how it would not be good for someone with severe allergies though.  I have moderate allergies and do fine with it.  We like all of the aromatherapy scents and keep them all in the house.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome i love it ...as well  the shipping was fast ....the seller was very nice thank uuuuuuuuu</li>
            <li> Not my favorite smell but it does absorb into the skin very fast. I like the ginger better. I don&#x27;t think relief has any thing to do with the product but I suppose it depends on who is putting it on your body.</li>
            <li> Came safely packaged and I just love the product!</li>
            <li> The  Bath &amp; Body Works met my full expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rodman</li>
            <li> It is cool. It does relief stress I guess.</li>
            <li> got this as a gift last year and just bought this one; the smell is amazing as i love the tea fragrance,  It also stays with you.</li>
            <li> We really enjoy this aromatic, soothing, pleasing scent in body lotion.  My wife uses this eucalyptus tea lotion for her legs and arms.  After a day of work in the sun or a long day of fishing, I like to shower and apply this aromatic lotion to my arms and cheeks.  Sometimes I just squeeze some into my hands and rub, just to appreciate the aroma.</li>
            <li> Arrived with the pump broken.</li>
            <li> Like the brand says: it is very relaxing, it works very good for me and for my daughter and I&#x27;ll buy it again !!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this every night for about a week, but I could not get over how much it smells like cologne.  I think that it just how it smelled to me though, I wouldn&#x27;t say to not try it for others.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and really busts the stress. If you check the back of the bottle, you will see that linalool is an actual ingredient. It is the the things really relaxes.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with all aspects of my purchase.love the product.It has a clean refreshing smell.quick shipping .nicely wrapped! Thank You! 👍</li>
            <li> love this lotion and it&#x27;s much cheaper to purchase online than in the stores!  Will be ordering again....</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for one of my friends and she loves it! She said it smells very nice and it works great. I would recommend this as a gift, or even for yourself. I&#x27;ve never tried this lotion, but I tried the Energy lotion from the Bath and Body Works aromatherapy collection. The Energy one is wonderful and I&#x27;m sure this one is too!</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m in love with this product it was kind of disappointing that it arrived to me Cracked and I&#x27;m not one to return things often if its a quick fix i tapped it together so it would leak anymore. but overall i love the product itself just the fulfillment of things disappointed me. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I got some of this in Atlanta when I was visiting that great city.  When It it ran out I was glad to see that it is available on amazon prime.  It is very good lotion.  I will keep ordering it.  The price is treasonable also.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion for the aroma, but found that it does relieve stress.  After applying, I feel much calmer and my day&#x27;s concerns fade away.  The smell is wonderful.  It isn&#x27;t too powerful, but it does a great job of making you feel like you&#x27;re in a fancy salon being pampered.  Unlike many &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; scents that send my husband screaming out of the room, this one is therapeutic and isn&#x27;t distracting.</li>
            <li> nice, relaxing frangrance</li>
            <li> works and smells great it was a great gift from my wife i put it on right before I go to bed</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Great price. Came fast :)</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and I&#x27;ve used it for awhile, but today I was eaten up by mosquitoes and couldn&#x27;t find my benadryl cream. I used this instead and a few hours later my bug bites had all but disappeared! No more itching! Surprising, awesome use.</li>
            <li> It really does work. The smell, and after rubbing it on made me fall asleep almost instantly. Wish it was less expensive</li>
            <li> Package was delived on time and it was just what I wanted. The price was resonable, but the price to ship it was ridiculous. Overall, I was happy.</li>
            <li> No question, this stuff is goood! I take it with me to the nail salon and have them give me a quick massage on my neck and back with it. :-)</li>
            <li> I enjoy this lotion more than any others on the market. The texture is creamy and the smell amazing. I use it before bed after a long bath. Great lotion. Thanks BB&amp;B! and Amazon!</li>
