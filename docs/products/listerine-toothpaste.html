            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Best toothpaste made.</li>
            <li>very good!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a while and find it very good at keeping Bacteria in the mouth down&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Instead of fluoride, both use baking soda which some claim to be superior to fluoride.</li>
            <li>I had tried this toothpaste years ago at a friends and was quite impressed by how clean my mouth felt.</li>
            <li>works great and leaves your breath fresh!!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that I can get it delivered each month or two, on the subscription plan, and I get a better deal!</li>
            <li>We love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>everyone has their own brand they prefer but this seems to make my&lt;br /&gt;mouth feel cleaner</li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>It so cool~~!!</li>
            <li>I think it may contain some not so good ingredients, but my teeth and mouth feel and look so clean.    </li>
            <li>My all time Favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li>but it sure did the trick.  </li>
            <li>Freshens your mouth so well, you will feel comfortable reducing the number of times you use mouthwash per day if you choose to!</li>
            <li>i LOVE THIS THING.</li>
            <li>i have never tasted better.</li>
            <li>i suppose my teeth love it too....</li>
            <li>Leaves my teeth squeaky clean all day!</li>
            <li>I feel my mouth, breath and teeth are soo clean :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong</li>
            <li>Everything is fine.</li>
            <li>I find them to be as effective or better than fluoride toothpastes, partly because I&#x27;m not soaking the sensitive membranes in my mouth with harmful chemicals when I use them.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Listerine toothpaste in conjunction with their mouthwash for a few years now and find it best for reducing tar buildup that exacerbates gum disease.</li>
            <li>The first brushing or two were different tasting than what I was used to but after that we loved it!</li>
            <li>Teeth and gums feel amazingly clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>and I am happy to pay a little extra for a great product.</li>
            <li>This was rated as a much healthier toothpaste than most others when I researched.</li>
            <li>but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>My first feeling of meeing listerine toothpaste...is very very Gooooood!!</li>
            <li>There is no sting as with using the Listerine mouthwash - which I kind of miss, but my teeth have the dentist clean feeling to them for a long time.  </li>
            <li>so fresh</li>
            <li>I currently use Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil toothpaste, which I think is a much healthier choice of toothpaste, and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>No other toothpaste comes close to the clean feeling that we get when we use it!</li>
            <li>Very intense flavor at first</li>
            <li>doesnt really work too well for me.</li>
            <li>Three weeks later my teeth were noticeably whiter, and my month felt as clean as after a visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>This is the best, I&#x27;m a not healthy eater, usually when I go to my dentist</li>
            <li>Best toothpaste for fighting bad breath on the market.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now back to using this product and plan to stay using it until I no longer have any teeth left to clean.</li>
            <li>It is unbelievable how clean my teeth, tongue, and mouth feel for hours after using this!  </li>
            <li>This product surprised me.  </li>
            <li>Copied directly from the toothpaste label:&lt;br /&gt;Anticavity</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m traveling I use EcoDent naturally effervescent baking soda toothpowder.</li>
            <li>The taste is somewhat strong of artificial sweetener, without the kick of eucalyptus or menthol, but there is definitely something strong tasting in it which freshens breath and it cleaned my teeth well, as far as aesthetics go.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that I wish it foamed up more when you brushed.</li>

            <li> My only complaint would be that I wish it foamed up more when you brushed.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 10 years and not once in the 10 years I developed any cavities, one day I decided to try something different and slightly cheaper, so I bought the Colgate total advance and started using it, after like 5 months I visited my dentist for a cleaning and the dentist told me I had three cavities.</li>
            <li> I had always thought this toothpaste contained the same active ingredients as Listerine mouthwash - eucalyptus, menthol, etc., but in reading the active and inactive ingredient list in this toothpaste (which is why I ordered it), I see no mention of these things.  </li>
            <li> If does sting a bit when brushing, but I have found nothing better to fight bad breath.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Overpowering flavor (like bitter menthol) and the gel leaves teeth feeling like the toothpaste has oil or something in it.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder and harder to find and that is a shame!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner after using this toothpaste over any other one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this product but when shipping costs and taxes are added on, it is, I think, unnecessarily too expensive.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t really need hydrated sillica, glycerin, PEG, or artificial sweetener in my toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Although it is a bit expensive, it is the only toothpaste my picky husband likes.  </li>
            <li> I used this product to help me fight bad breath and control tartar and even fight gingivitis   well to my disappointment this has actually made my mouth worse and created a new problem, white film is peeling from my cheeks   </li>
            <li> I have at least one cavatiy</li>
            <li> It was probably twice as expensive per ounce than any other brand</li>
            <li> try to avoid products containing sodium lauryl sulfate, which is an irritant, and products containing unnecessary coloring.</li>
            <li> If I am wrong, someone please let me know, and I will change my star rating.  </li>
            <li> kinda gives me a weird taste in my mouth after i use it.</li>
            <li> also the tastes is awful</li>

            <li> My all time Favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li> I had always thought this toothpaste contained the same active ingredients as Listerine mouthwash - eucalyptus, menthol, etc., but in reading the active and inactive ingredient list in this toothpaste (which is why I ordered it), I see no mention of these things.  If I am wrong, someone please let me know, and I will change my star rating.  But since it&#x27;s name is Listerine, it is misleading for it not to contain the same ingredients as the mouthwash.        The taste is somewhat strong of artificial sweetener, without the kick of eucalyptus or menthol, but there is definitely something strong tasting in it which freshens breath and it cleaned my teeth well, as far as aesthetics go.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and have noticed my teeth getting a bit dingy over the years. I had tried this toothpaste years ago at a friends and was quite impressed by how clean my mouth felt. I forgot about it and then years later I saw it at the grocery store. It was probably twice as expensive per ounce than any other brand but I wanted to give it another try.  Three weeks later my teeth were noticeably whiter, and my month felt as clean as after a visit to the dentist. I don&#x27;t even think they advertise this as whitening toothpaste but it sure did the trick.  This is by far the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used and I am happy to pay a little extra for a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this at dentist.net when I was stocking up in preparation for some dental work.  I decided to buy this on a whim as I have always used the Listerine mouthwash.  This product surprised me.  I think it may contain some not so good ingredients, but my teeth and mouth feel and look so clean.    It is unbelievable how clean my teeth, tongue, and mouth feel for hours after using this!  There is no sting as with using the Listerine mouthwash - which I kind of miss, but my teeth have the dentist clean feeling to them for a long time.  I will definitely repurchase this product.  I alternate using this in the daytime and the Oravive remineralizing toothpaste at night.    This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Although it is a bit expensive, it is the only toothpaste my picky husband likes.  I like the fact that I can get it delivered each month or two, on the subscription plan, and I get a better deal!</li>
            <li> I used this product for 10 years and not once in the 10 years I developed any cavities, one day I decided to try something different and slightly cheaper, so I bought the Colgate total advance and started using it, after like 5 months I visited my dentist for a cleaning and the dentist told me I had three cavities. I don&#x27;t know if they are related to the toothpaste change, but if I never had any cavities for 10 years while using this product and now all of the sudden they start to appear, I&#x27;m assuming it was the change (mistake I made). I&#x27;m now back to using this product and plan to stay using it until I no longer have any teeth left to clean.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste for fighting bad breath on the market.  If does sting a bit when brushing, but I have found nothing better to fight bad breath.</li>
            <li> I used this product to help me fight bad breath and control tartar and even fight gingivitis   well to my disappointment this has actually made my mouth worse and created a new problem, white film is peeling from my cheeks   also the tastes is awful</li>
            <li> We love this toothpaste! No other toothpaste comes close to the clean feeling that we get when we use it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Teeth and gums feel amazingly clean after brushing.  Was recommended by my test to fight gingivitis. Works great!</li>
            <li> Freshens your mouth so well, you will feel comfortable reducing the number of times you use mouthwash per day if you choose to!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m korean. I knew listerine as &amp;#34;Mouth Wash&amp;#34;. By chance, I saw that listerine produce toothpaste, but couldn&#x27;t find it in korea. So, I ordered it at amazon.com. My first feeling of meeing listerine toothpaste...is very very Gooooood!! It so cool~~!!</li>
            <li> i LOVE THIS THING. keeps my mouth so fresh I&#x27;m gonna order a pack of these</li>
            <li> I did not know Listerine made a toothpaste. I feel my mouth, breath and teeth are soo clean :)&lt;br /&gt;I found this and now I can not find it in the stores anymore.&lt;br /&gt; I went to Walgreen&#x27;s today and still couldn&#x27;t find it.. I hope I can still order it online.</li>
            <li> This was rated as a much healthier toothpaste than most others when I researched. The first brushing or two were different tasting than what I was used to but after that we loved it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and find it very good at keeping Bacteria in the mouth down&lt;br /&gt;to a Min.. Your price was the lowest I found this time around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raven</li>
            <li> This is the best, I&#x27;m a not healthy eater, usually when I go to my dentist I have at least one cavatiy, I went after 2 yrs of no check ups and with using this tooth paste I had 0 cavaties. Fantastic. It&#x27;s strong I never notice my breath no one had offered me a mint and it cleans so well.</li>
            <li> kinda gives me a weird taste in my mouth after i use it. doesnt really work too well for me. i rather stick with my crest toothpaste, but i use this occasionally.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste made. It is getting harder and harder to find and that is a shame!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Listerine toothpaste in conjunction with their mouthwash for a few years now and find it best for reducing tar buildup that exacerbates gum disease. The manufacture seems to have dropped this product but still makes their Whitening toothpaste still with a tartar reduction formula.</li>
            <li> everyone has their own brand they prefer but this seems to make my&lt;br /&gt;mouth feel cleaner and it does not get pasty all over my teeth when I&lt;br /&gt;brush.</li>
            <li> very good! i have never tasted better. i am using it for years now. i suppose my teeth love it too....</li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner after using this toothpaste over any other one I&#x27;ve tried. My only complaint would be that I wish it foamed up more when you brushed. Very intense flavor at first but you get used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product but when shipping costs and taxes are added on, it is, I think, unnecessarily too expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste! Leaves my teeth squeaky clean all day!</li>
            <li> Copied directly from the toothpaste label:&lt;br /&gt;Anticavity Ingredient: Sodium monofluorophosphat 0.76% (0.13% W/V Fluoride ion)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Ingredients: sorbitol, water, hydrated sillica, glycerin, PEG-32, flavors, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium saccharin, cellulose gum, phosphoric acid, sodium phosphate, xanthan gum, benzoic acid, FD&amp;C blue no. 1, and D&amp;C yellow no. 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try to avoid products containing sodium lauryl sulfate, which is an irritant, and products containing unnecessary coloring. I also don&#x27;t really need hydrated sillica, glycerin, PEG, or artificial sweetener in my toothpaste. I currently use Desert Essence Natural Tea Tree Oil toothpaste, which I think is a much healthier choice of toothpaste, and it works great for me. When I&#x27;m traveling I use EcoDent naturally effervescent baking soda toothpowder. Instead of fluoride, both use baking soda which some claim to be superior to fluoride. I find them to be as effective or better than fluoride toothpastes, partly because I&#x27;m not soaking the sensitive membranes in my mouth with harmful chemicals when I use them.</li>
            <li> As expected. Everything is fine.</li>
            <li> Overpowering flavor (like bitter menthol) and the gel leaves teeth feeling like the toothpaste has oil or something in it. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> works great and leaves your breath fresh!!</li>
