    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I researched lip balms with sunscreen and found this one to be the best in terms of ingredients and sun protection</li>
            <li>I experienced no allergies when using this</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>But it won&#x27;t be pleasant.</li>
            <li>Feels really good - not at all sticky.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;While this may be really good stuff, and the ingredients show that it is.  </li>
            <li>Good for the summer if you are in the sun.  </li>
            <li>is so many lip products--this one feels good and works great for sun and wind.</li>
            <li>Not even the dermatologist prescription cream  came close to being so effective and soothing.</li>
            <li>It gets warm</li>
            <li>In this case the score is very high, as it contains no harmful chemicals, provides excellent UVA (and UVB) protection as well as being truthful with regards to the advertised SPF 30.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
            <li>If it could be more solidified like chapstick it would be a 5 star.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got contact allergies to many sunscreen ingredients.</li>
            <li>Probably this product blocks the sun very effectively; however, the zinc oxide made the product very gooey.  </li>
            <li>This one is fine.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to be in the snow or on the water for many daylight hours, it&#x27;s probably worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments of how beautiful, light pink, natural my lips look after use.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for the beach only.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty easy</li>
            <li>The fragrance is cocoa butter but mild.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s free of all the chemicals you probably shouldn&#x27;t put on your lips, but it&#x27;s very sticky.</li>
            <li>if when Spring hits, I end each bike right with a bunch of gnats stuck to my lips.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect these natural sunscreens to be as easy to apply or transparent as chemical SPF.</li>
            <li>What I look for in a sunscreen is first of all the rating from EWG.</li>
            <li>You can get the white to mostly blend out if you spend awhile in front of a mirror and rub at it.</li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to put up with this one.</li>
            <li>Even though the lip balm is a little sticky and smells like grass (it IS natural), my lips feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li>I was worried this would feel pasty and hard to rub on my lips, but it&#x27;s a good lip sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It also feels very nourishing.</li>
            <li>This does not go on smoothly: it comes off in big globs and stays sticky.</li>
            <li>I really needed a lip balm to help with the sun.</li>
            <li>It is not as moist as a regular lip balm of course, but is fairly smooth and not dry-feeling.</li>
            <li>and then when you put it on your lips you end up putting too much on because it has softened.  </li>
            <li>The chapstick is soft and pretty easy to rub into my lips, but it&#x27;s definitely not clear when I first apply it.</li>
            <li>As far as leaving your lips looking white, the only way I can imagine that happening is if your lips are very chapped (in which case, all you have to do is to rub it in a bit) or if you let the lip balm get too warm so that too much product ends up on your lips.   </li>
            <li>True to advertising, it is not a white balm - it goes on pretty clear.</li>
            <li>However, the price of this particular product is lower than its competitors, so I decided to give it a try anyway.   </li>
            <li>I usually use a thinner \\&quot;normal\\&quot; lip balm first and then apply this one on top.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high score on Envornmental Work Group (EWG).  </li>
            <li>The Environmental Working Group&#x27;s 2011 sunblock reviews gave this lip balm high marks, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to chemical sunscreens so became interested in natural lip</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that hasn&#x27;t turned my lips white at all!</li>
            <li>I use a small amount and add tinted lip gloss on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it while commuting on my bike to work and won&#x27;t be surprised</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t apply too much there&#x27;s no discernible white hue on your lips.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s 100 % natural.</li>
            <li>and I am sensitive to the majority of sun screens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the sun all summer long, I really like this because it protects my lips</li>
            <li>It does take a little bit of rubbing in, but once I apply, I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to quickly rub off.</li>
            <li>From 5 stars way down, unless you have it fresh and use it within a month or so.</li>
            <li>Also, even blended out, your lips will still be white enough that you end up looking really</li>
            <li>I actually use this product on my nose for sunscreen because it is pure white and looks like you painted your lips white when you use it on your lips.</li>
            <li>The texture is a bit stickier than your average chapstick, but it&#x27;s not difficult to apply at all.</li>
            <li>It does make my lip sort of white, but I understand it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens last year and started looking for a zinc oxide lip balm.</li>
            <li>If anything, the thicker texture makes it feel like it really stays in place unlike other lip balms that feel like they just melt off your face.</li>
            <li>But while the ingredients are safe and effective, the balm itself is hard to get on--it&#x27;s extremely sticky and difficult to spread.</li>
            <li>Trying to apply it normally (like any other chapstick) leaves chunks of chipstick on my lips, as well as as turning my lips white.</li>

            <li> Only reason why I purchased was due to</li>
            <li> No problem on dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its a little oily and the lip balm is very fragile, used my finger tip to swipe some to apply to child&#x27;s lips and the part of the balm that is out of the tube just fell off.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time understanding all the complaints about this product, so far it has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This product is messy, leaving white goop on your lips no matter how you try to melt it into the skin.</li>
            <li> This lip balm definitely is thick, sticky and difficult to spread, BUT I personally love the color it leaves of on my lips.</li>
            <li> Works when none of the other chapped lip balms do (voice of experience here).  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t used it in extreme circumstances</li>
            <li> this does NOT go on smoothly, get&#x27;s very dry and cake-y with wear and leaves an ugly residue (not an invisible one)</li>
            <li> , once it&#x27;s spread out evenly my lips I feel like I need more chapstick--like the only thing left behind is stickiness and very unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no overpowering scents or irritating ingredients, which suits my sensitive skin well.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical after having read some of the reviews for this product: People were complaining about the texture and how it left their lips looking white.</li>
            <li> It is stiffly waxy but keeping in your pocket solves that problem.</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve resorted to mixing zinc-based lip sunscreens with lipsticks to try and cancel out the whitening effect, but with this, I can use one product.</li>
            <li> So thick and whitish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a winner because the two tubes I got are really sloppy like vasceline consistency.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s difficult to rub off.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s equally difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I still got an allergic reaction to this lip balm</li>
            <li> That being said I didn&#x27;t find this to be as inconvenient as others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Plus side: it doesn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>
            <li> And I figured, how bad could it be?      </li>

            <li> I was a little skeptical after having read some of the reviews for this product: People were complaining about the texture and how it left their lips looking white. However, the price of this particular product is lower than its competitors, so I decided to give it a try anyway.   What I look for in a sunscreen is first of all the rating from EWG. In this case the score is very high, as it contains no harmful chemicals, provides excellent UVA (and UVB) protection as well as being truthful with regards to the advertised SPF 30. I also like the fact that it contains zinc oxide as opposed to titanium oxide, as the latter can be problematic for acne prone skin (not to mention the fact that it may give you a rather deathly pallor).   I have a hard time understanding all the complaints about this product, so far it has exceeded my expectations. The texture is a bit stickier than your average chapstick, but it&#x27;s not difficult to apply at all. If anything, the thicker texture makes it feel like it really stays in place unlike other lip balms that feel like they just melt off your face. It also feels very nourishing. As far as leaving your lips looking white, the only way I can imagine that happening is if your lips are very chapped (in which case, all you have to do is to rub it in a bit) or if you let the lip balm get too warm so that too much product ends up on your lips.   Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I definitely plan to repurchase.</li>
            <li> This does not go on smoothly: it comes off in big globs and stays sticky. Trying to apply it normally (like any other chapstick) leaves chunks of chipstick on my lips, as well as as turning my lips white. You can get the white to mostly blend out if you spend awhile in front of a mirror and rub at it. However, I need this for hourly outdoor use and that&#x27;s just not practical. Also, even blended out, your lips will still be white enough that you end up looking really sickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, once it&#x27;s spread out evenly my lips I feel like I need more chapstick--like the only thing left behind is stickiness and very unpleasant smell. I tried this for about a week to see if the stuff grew on me, but now it&#x27;s in the trashcan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus side: it doesn&#x27;t taste bad.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to chemical sunscreens so became interested in natural lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;I was unsure after reading some of the reviews about it being sticky and white.&lt;br /&gt;Not so.  Feels really good - not at all sticky.  I noticed that if my lips are moist when I put it on it shows some white - I rub it in and it disappears.  No problem on dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this lip sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Probably this product blocks the sun very effectively; however, the zinc oxide made the product very gooey.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Only reason why I purchased was due to it&#x27;s high score on Envornmental Work Group (EWG).  I really needed a lip balm to help with the sun. And I figured, how bad could it be?      All I can say if \\&quot;YUK!\\&quot;.  It gobs on and it make your lips white. Just threw out the 2 purchased, after one try.  It was not even close to being practical.</li>
            <li> Even though the lip balm is a little sticky and smells like grass (it IS natural), my lips feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different lip sunscreens with an SPF of 30 that contained zinc. This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that hasn&#x27;t turned my lips white at all! In the past, I&#x27;ve resorted to mixing zinc-based lip sunscreens with lipsticks to try and cancel out the whitening effect, but with this, I can use one product. There&#x27;s no overpowering scents or irritating ingredients, which suits my sensitive skin well. The consistency is just moisturizing enough. It does take a little bit of rubbing in, but once I apply, I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to quickly rub off. I prefer this to something that I feel like I&#x27;d have to reapply often.</li>
            <li> I agree with Roxanne&#x27;s review- this does NOT go on smoothly, get&#x27;s very dry and cake-y with wear and leaves an ugly residue (not an invisible one) that&#x27;s difficult to rub off.</li>
            <li> It works. It&#x27;s free of all the chemicals you probably shouldn&#x27;t put on your lips, but it&#x27;s very sticky. I&#x27;m using it while commuting on my bike to work and won&#x27;t be surprised if when Spring hits, I end each bike right with a bunch of gnats stuck to my lips.</li>
            <li> Works when none of the other chapped lip balms do (voice of experience here).  Yes, it momentarily tastes of its ingredients (no flavorings are added) and yes, it has a faint whitish look from the zinc oxide (easily covered with lipstick or just left uncovered).  Not even the dermatologist prescription cream  came close to being so effective and soothing. P.s. After using this product for 7 months, I find my earlier comments still hold up, HOWEVER it now it smells and tastes rancid.  The manufacture date is in 2015 and the expiration date in 2017, about a year from now.  From 5 stars way down, unless you have it fresh and use it within a month or so.</li>
            <li> I actually use this product on my nose for sunscreen because it is pure white and looks like you painted your lips white when you use it on your lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the sun all summer long, I really like this because it protects my lips and it doesn&#x27;t get all clumpy.</li>
            <li> I researched lip balms with sunscreen and found this one to be the best in terms of ingredients and sun protection but I didn&#x27;t like the texture.  So thick and whitish.  Wasn&#x27;t pleasant to use.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;While this may be really good stuff, and the ingredients show that it is.  It&#x27;s not a winner because the two tubes I got are really sloppy like vasceline consistency.  If it could be more solidified like chapstick it would be a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I was worried this would feel pasty and hard to rub on my lips, but it&#x27;s a good lip sunscreen. True to advertising, it is not a white balm - it goes on pretty clear. It is not as moist as a regular lip balm of course, but is fairly smooth and not dry-feeling. Seemed to protect my lips well at the beach.</li>
            <li> The Environmental Working Group&#x27;s 2011 sunblock reviews gave this lip balm high marks, so I tried it. But while the ingredients are safe and effective, the balm itself is hard to get on--it&#x27;s extremely sticky and difficult to spread. Once it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s equally difficult to remove. If you&#x27;re going to be in the snow or on the water for many daylight hours, it&#x27;s probably worth it. But it won&#x27;t be pleasant.</li>
            <li> It does make my lip sort of white, but I understand it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s all natural. So I need to use it together with a lip color.</li>
            <li> Its a little oily and the lip balm is very fragile, used my finger tip to swipe some to apply to child&#x27;s lips and the part of the balm that is out of the tube just fell off.</li>
            <li> I put this on once a day and it kept my lips from getting sunburned while I was in Hawaii for a week.  I recommend not taking it with you in the heat though.  It gets warm and then when you put it on your lips you end up putting too much on because it has softened.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product is messy, leaving white goop on your lips no matter how you try to melt it into the skin. Had to wipe it all off.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to chemical sunscreens last year and started looking for a zinc oxide lip balm. Don&#x27;t expect these natural sunscreens to be as easy to apply or transparent as chemical SPF. That being said I didn&#x27;t find this to be as inconvenient as others. It goes on pretty easy and if you purse your lips to distribute it&#x27;s not too gloopy in practice. If you don&#x27;t apply too much there&#x27;s no discernible white hue on your lips. Unfortunately I still got an allergic reaction to this lip balm so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> This lip balm definitely is thick, sticky and difficult to spread, BUT I personally love the color it leaves of on my lips. I usually use a thinner \\&quot;normal\\&quot; lip balm first and then apply this one on top. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments of how beautiful, light pink, natural my lips look after use. And it&#x27;s 100 % natural. I love it and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Turned my lips visibly white. People commented on it at work. Maybe good for the beach only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got contact allergies to many sunscreen ingredients. The burning sensation start in about 1 -5 minutes and I&#x27;m running to scrub it off. This one is fine. It&#x27;s not summer so I haven&#x27;t used it in extreme circumstances but I think it will work. It is stiffly waxy but keeping in your pocket solves that problem. The fragrance is cocoa butter but mild. I can&#x27;t stand the smell of cocoa butter but I&#x27;m willing to put up with this one.</li>
            <li> My lips often peel  from the mint is so many lip products--this one feels good and works great for sun and wind.</li>
            <li> The chapstick is soft and pretty easy to rub into my lips, but it&#x27;s definitely not clear when I first apply it. I use a small amount and add tinted lip gloss on top.</li>
            <li> Good for the summer if you are in the sun.  I experienced no allergies when using this and I am sensitive to the majority of sun screens.</li>
