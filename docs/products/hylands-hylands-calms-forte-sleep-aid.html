            <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>I have learned that the best combination for me is one tablet of the Forte&#x27; with 1 or 2 1 mg tablets of melatonin.  </li>

            <li>I do love herbal products and homeopathy, and I&#x27;ve been trying to find the best procuts for me, but I&#x27;m a bit on the fence with this one.</li>
            <li>What a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff - both my mother (senior citizen with apnea)</li>
            <li>Good sleep aid.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to have a good night of sleep</li>
            <li>The good part:  no after or side effects</li>
            <li>I am waking up from a really good sleep.</li>
            <li>Works good on dogs too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT WAS GOOD.  </li>
            <li>I have always found this supplement good for calming sleep without feeling drugged like prescriptions do.  </li>
            <li>OK THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT..</li>
            <li>Its also great because i can take as many as I need through out the day and not have to worry about overdosing ect</li>
            <li>SUPER DUPER GREAT PRODUCT, GO FOR GOLD, YOU&#x27;RE IN IT TO WIN</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re stressed during the day take two , wait a couple hours and take two more and see what that does!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My daughter recommended this to me, she loves it and now so do I. Works better than prescription drugs !</li>
            <li>Tonight , it&#x27;ll be warm milk.</li>
            <li>Nice touch having a work area--like having a built in journal.</li>
            <li>Honestly however I can&#x27;t remember ever feeling groggy even with 4 or 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are now into 3 generations of keeping these handy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for non-habit forming, effective, non-groggy OTC medications.  </li>
            <li>Good remedy to help relax and get easy sleep.</li>
            <li>This one does not seem to be any more effective than others</li>
            <li>The Calms Forte are probably one of the most cost effective sleeping aids on the market.</li>
            <li>I feel like a sugar pill would be more effective.</li>
            <li>It calmed me completely and before bed took 2 more and slept the best I have slept in weeks....</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know what a placebo is, then go ahead and buy this garbage, I&#x27;m sure it will work for you.</li>
            <li>If after taking 3 I still have an issue I pop 1-2 more</li>
            <li>and I am sure to be able to sleep.  </li>
            <li>The reason I gave it a 4 star is I have to use more than recommended.</li>
            <li>We have been using this for years and love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything for a couple hours and was still stressed so I took two more and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never taken more than 2.</li>
            <li>I woke up from the most vidid dream</li>
            <li>and I feel more rested in the morning.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind I am using it with Melatonin, maybe that is why it is working better for me.</li>
            <li>Make sure you take it away from food and don&#x27;t touch homeopathic - put them in the lid and into your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I always get a better night&#x27;s sleep when I use these products.</li>
            <li>Most OTC sleep meds either leave me groggy</li>
            <li>and if that didn&#x27;t work, add 1 or 2 more; you cannot overdose on this product.  </li>
            <li>Wife said they were just ok.</li>
            <li>Great sleep aid, gentle and no residual grogginess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad it took a chance.</li>
            <li>Helps me falling asleep , no hang over and is safe.</li>
            <li>It was the same price as in stores so was happy to see it!</li>
            <li>Works for me most of the time.  </li>
            <li>does work better</li>
            <li>it for yourself as on of my friends love these.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I do wake up, I find that because I am more relaxed from the Calms Forte&#x27;</li>
            <li>and I do get better sleep now that I have started using it nightly.  </li>
            <li>Buy One Get One Free!]</li>
            <li>Homeopathic remedies like this are nothing more than placebos.</li>
            <li>As with anything homeopathic, there are perfectly safe &amp; non-habit forming.</li>
            <li>, however I have found  that taking more than three at a time isn&#x27;t really more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>These are some of the best I&#x27;ve found, they are also cheap and relatively natural.  </li>
            <li>The difference between the quality of sleep I had with and without the Calms Forte was striking.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful for both sleep and occasional panic attacks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve introduced many to it who all love it.  </li>
            <li>I have taken as many as five at one time.  </li>
            <li>What I love most, is that it relaxes my mind, but not my body.  </li>
            <li>It is a staple in my purse and has performed magically at times when I would otherwise have, well, &amp;#34;freaked out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Some work better than others, but none have ever have the effects of Calms</li>
            <li>Anyway, in summary, I think these do a pretty good job as a sleep aid.</li>
            <li>Good to help calm an over excited child, too.</li>
            <li>1 to 2 are good for travel sickness or taking the edge off certain days.</li>
            <li>I have used a number of prescription narcoleptics over the years, and so I am pretty good at distinguishing placebo from genuine effect.  </li>
            <li>i take two at night and i am able to sleep soundly.</li>
            <li>Great, all natural pills for sleep.</li>
            <li>As soon as I pop one of these babies, I am feeling calm and sleepy within 20 minutes and drift nicely off to sleep.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, good product</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t taste good, but are not extremely bad tasting, and well worth the taste.</li>
            <li>Oh and they&#x27;re about the size of a sudafed, easy to swallow.</li>
            <li>I have used this product and it let me go to sleep easy and sleep all night and wake in the morning refreshed and not groggy.</li>
            <li>Its great because they are non-habit forming, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects (knock on wood).</li>
            <li>This is safe for people who have a history of substance abuse and are trying to cope with life clean.  </li>
            <li>So they worked, but maybe too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>If I try naturally - without any aid  - I may or may not be successful.</li>
            <li>now I seem to have built up a tolerance for them and not as effective as at first.  </li>
            <li>With Calms Forte, I feel fine when I wake</li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>FINE  </li>
            <li>There is oats in this products and they aren&#x27;t gluten free.</li>
            <li>The product isn&#x27;t gluten free and there is no advisory warning to that fact.</li>
            <li>Beware, this is not a lactos free or a gluten free product.</li>
            <li>The effect was clearly genuine here.  </li>
            <li>The product was packed secure.    </li>
            <li>you feel the YAWN - douse the light and curl up</li>
            <li>When it was still available.)  </li>
            <li>That puts me out like a light.</li>
            <li>Its great to take the edge off / help quiet racing minds at night, though alone</li>
            <li>Its all natural, eases you into sleep and you have no &amp;#34;hangover&amp;#34; in the morning~~this is by far the best deal I&#x27;ve ever found for this product.</li>
            <li>When traveling, I won&#x27;t leave the house without these pills and Bach Original Flower Essences Rescue Remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural product, but most sleep aids do not work well for me!  </li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m working full time in a fairly stressful finance job, I&#x27;m studying for the LSAT, and I have a 14 year old son who is full of \\&quot;teenaged angst.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty good for a natural product.</li>
            <li>This outstanding product really does work.</li>
            <li>My Girlfriend was able to get rid of a very toxic Anti-Anxiety Medication, and exchange it for the Calms Forte product.</li>
            <li>I have just begun to use this product and so far, it seems to be effective.</li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing the true benefits of it as I continue use.</li>
            <li>Thank you, just what the lady needed, works good former legs.</li>
            <li>I want to see peer reviewed journals demonstrating efficacy; I don&#x27;t care if cultures used passiflora incarnata or avena sativa (the top two ingredients) to cure ailments before the birth of modern medicine.  </li>
            <li>my sleep cycle was full of spikes where I was waking up every 30/60 minutes whereas the night I did take it</li>
            <li>It is not bad though</li>
            <li>I love that it is not very expensive, and I don&#x27;t need a doctor&#x27;s prescription.  </li>
            <li>And most importantly, I stay asleep or if I wake up it is easy to get back to sleep.</li>
            <li>I have used Calm&#x27;s Forte for several years now and it gives me a good night of sleep without the stupor in the morning.  </li>
            <li>so I thought that wasn&#x27;t too great, but at least I was going to be able to sleep for the night.</li>
            <li>and I fall asleep quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild; this is not something that will knock you out in fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li>The latter can be habit forming if used too often, but it can be a bit more potent when needed.</li>
            <li>Still in all, if you want a mild dosage of something that will help you get to sleep...this is it.</li>
            <li>so it is a very safe medically.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used melatonin before, but it&#x27;s much too strong for me and makes me feel groggy in the morning.</li>
            <li>One of the rules of homeopathy is that higher dilution equates to a more powerful medicine, which is absolutely ludicrous if you know the simplest tenets of chemistry.</li>
            <li>just one is fine, i have restless problems all the time, love how they just desolve no water when you&#x27;re reaching for them in the middle of the night and don&#x27;t want to get up.</li>
            <li>I would suggest that anyone considering buying Calm Forte sleeping pills watch a TED talk by James Randi entitled &amp;#34;Homeopathy, Quackery, and Fraud&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The bottle warns that anyone who overdoses on Calm Forte to contact poison control.</li>
            <li>Does calm anxiety to a degree.</li>
            <li>Unlike, when we&#x27;ve given her Benedryl (sp), she did not act &amp;#34;drugged&amp;#34;--just calm...</li>
            <li>Worth a try though</li>
            <li>A useful product we buy often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely feel when this kicks in, a kind of heaviness, a</li>
            <li>I rarely need a sleep aide, but grab for this or Valerian when I do.</li>
            <li>I have a background in medicine and as a result, I view natural products with a healthy amount of skepticism.</li>
            <li>So if you need help relaxing the body, this might not be right for you.  </li>
            <li>Good product, I use it to calm me down during he day (1-2) and some times to hekp ne sleep (3-4).</li>
            <li>If I wake during the night, I can go back to sleep pretty quickly which I can rarely do on most nights.</li>
            <li>Every single time I take these, I have amazing dreams.  </li>
            <li>so I feel the good sleep outweighs the little bit of nerves that I get.</li>
            <li>help relax and sleep very fast acting and safe not addictining as precriptions thx deb</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sister who works at sleep lab - told us about this product and it really works well!</li>
            <li>Two more nights of waking up but being back to sleep in a couple minutes</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are safe for children and you only need 1-3 tablets for the temporary treatment of nervous tension and insomnia.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I wonder how much Hyland&#x27;s employees are getting paid to leave reviews on the Calm Forte product page?</li>
            <li>Within an hour of taking just one tablet I started to relax for the first time in days.</li>
            <li>I tried it on me first -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this after my first restful sleep all week, after taking two Calms Forte pills before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Sometimes Calms Forte is exactly what I need to break the cycle.</li>
            <li>What is also important for me is that it feels natural to my body.</li>
            <li>the first to write a review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first time i take 3 before bedtime and didn&#x27;t help me</li>
            <li>If you found these ineffective, my first suggestion would be to take them on a (near-)empty stomach if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li>Thanks Hylands!</li>
            <li>At first almost nothing would help but later on I was able to get some relief with antihistamine products.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking of buying this - or any like product - watch this first:</li>
            <li>Randi&#x27;s fiery takedown of psychic fraud\\&quot; which starts with the famous debunker downing an ENTIRE bottle of this!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>I felt a little calmer, but did not sleep as quickly as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>It really does help me to sleep more fully and deep and relaxes me.  </li>
            <li>After much resistance, he finally tried my Calms Forte and he was able to get to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I imagine they would have worked better if they were used within a reasonable amount of time, hence the extra star for longevity.  </li>
            <li>Worked really well for the first couple weeks</li>
            <li>it be nice to lie down for a minute\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li>probably most useful for middle insomnia (awakening too early) than for a whole night.  </li>
            <li>These are pure sugar</li>
            <li>Someone who needs help occasionally may be fine with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a heavy, drugged feeling but a pleasant calm that washes over you slowly.  </li>
            <li>But if I get a phonecall or get to a good part in my book, then it&#x27;s not very hard to push through and miss that little window of drowsiness.</li>
            <li>This little bottle will definitely be part of my carry on luggage when I fly out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I am not tired.</li>
            <li>I DO HAVE SOME INTENSE DREAMS WITH THIS PRODUCT..</li>
            <li>This has worked out very well-without any side effects at all.</li>
            <li>However, melatonin leaves me feeling really groggy the day after I use it.  </li>
            <li>So this morning I was really nervous and saw I had put them here on my desk</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years now and it really works well.  </li>
            <li>I wake feeling refreshed and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>this product really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While these are calming - Try Valerian to really knock yourself out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t improve sleep quality much.</li>
            <li>This product works very well for anxiety and for sleep without making you feel groggy in the morning.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>This helps avoid feeling groggy in the morning by taking too much.</li>
            <li>really calms my thoughts so i can sleep.  </li>
            <li>It relaxes my whole body.</li>
            <li>We are very grateful.</li>
            <li>Service was fast ,but doesn&#x27;t  work for me .none</li>
            <li>They work reasonably well.</li>
            <li>They are very relaxing when taken before bed, it makes my thoughts stop racing which is helpful.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and it is very helpful whenever I experience insomnia.</li>
            <li>i really like this product.  </li>
            <li>These tablets really help me to relax and get to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>Buy some real sleep aids instead.</li>
            <li>Saw a video by science baby where she takes a whole bottle with no effect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel groggy in the morning, and they seem to knock me out fast after taking.</li>
            <li>Really takes the edge off.</li>
            <li>I have insomnia and normally need a prescription to sleep, but I was able to cut down on that when I started using Calm Forte.</li>
            <li>wow; I&#x27;m so mellow right now.</li>
            <li>Take the active ingredient crush it up, make sure you shake it, that&#x27;s important, as you dilute it in a liquid solution as big as Lake Michigan.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild generalized and social anxiety, so I pop one in every morning and can really tell the difference on the days when I forget to take one.</li>
            <li>Because these pills are nothing more than water and other harmless stuff.  </li>
            <li>It works better than other over the counter sleeping medications.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I only notice a minor physical difference with the xanax, except for it puts me to sleep right away instead of rolling around for 3 hours like the nights when I don&#x27;t take it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this product would be effective if you&#x27;re not actually tired.  </li>
            <li>Take it with low dose melatonin, Inositol and Calms for sleep and gives me 8-10 hrs good sleep, if I wake  up in  wee hours, and can&#x27;t get back to sleep, take a Calms and back to sleep.    </li>
            <li>And the tablets are nice and small.</li>
            <li>For the occasional time that I am unable to settle to sleep, Calms Forte is the perfect answer.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see they work for others, getting enough sleep is so important for mental and physical health.</li>
            <li>a night&#x27;s sleep is a little more sound/deep, versus those requiring something to literally knock them out.</li>
            <li>These are great for getting rid of the nervous feelings so you can sleep before your big meeting or exam, or if you just need a little extra something to put you to sleep.</li>
            <li>Then add that dilution that may not even have a single molecule of the original substance to a sugar tablet and you have Calms</li>
            <li>this natural product really helps me get to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>I normally stress out all night about the next day&#x27;s laundry list of things to accomplish but with these, I&#x27;m level headed and calm.</li>
            <li>He used it for a couple months until his normal sleep mode kicked in for him.  </li>
            <li>It works even better after a few days.</li>
            <li>love that it is natural and calms me down and puts me to sleep with no groggy after effect when i wake up</li>
            <li>And even if I do get up to the bathroom at night, I go right back to sleep as though I had never awakened.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s right in the middle.</li>
            <li>Already used up one bottle that I bought from Walgreens and ordered a new one from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s great to take these on a regular basis, but their relatively weaker influence won&#x27;t lead to the psychological dependence you might experience with other drugs.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it is natural and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t help me sleep, but they defiantly take the edge off coming into work and driving on busy streets!</li>
            <li>Potential customers might wonder how taking one or two Calm Forte pills can have any real effect if an entire 100 pill bottle doesn&#x27;t affect an old man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Sure, it may claim it does, but they are deluded down so far that there&#x27;s no actual ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li>I do like these little pills and do enjoy that they dont make me wake up groggy</li>
            <li>Homeopathy is fraud that exploits the scientific illiteracy of the general public, and the only reason it and other homeopathic remedies haven&#x27;t been flagged by the FDA is because the FDA is too understaffed to effectively screen all the treatments that pass through their system annually.</li>
            <li>Calms Forte actually relaxed me enough that I fell into a natural sleep and woke up with no after effects and no weird dreams either!</li>
            <li>I suspect this one one of those products that works for a select group of people, probably based on genetics and other factors (which is no less true of rx drugs).  </li>
            <li>ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED OF COURSE</li>
            <li>The only thing really to say is that \\&quot;it is what it is.\\</li>
            <li>I bought these looking for a natural way to relieve my anxiety.</li>
            <li>Someone told me I should have taken several of them to achieve the desired effect, but I don&#x27;t really think it does anything at all.</li>
            <li>and I ordered it to round up for free shipping of another item.  </li>
            <li>Co-incidentally, it works very well to get back to sleep.  </li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>sleep medications so that his body could heal naturally.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old was having night time panic attacks.</li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>but if you are sensitive to medications (which I am) I don&#x27;t recommend a homepathic route.</li>
            <li>Instead of giving them up completely, I&#x27;ve taken to alternating months.</li>
            <li>Initially Calms Forte didn&#x27;t do much of anything for me</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t done anything for helping me sleep so far.</li>
            <li>My wife often has trouble sleeping and has tried many different products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is more for calming &amp; relaxing to help you cross over the edge to sleep, rather than something heavy to put you out like Lunesta or a chemical over-the-counter &amp;#34;PM&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken other Hylands products, with success, but never this one.</li>
            <li>I like the tablets better because I can halve them if I only want a small dose.  </li>
            <li>The active ingredient in this preparation is caffeine, and all other ingredients are so diluted that they pass Avogadro&#x27;s limit, so you&#x27;re taking nothing more than a caffeinated placebo.</li>
            <li>helps to calm down and fall asleep faster.</li>
            <li>I also take three before bed to help my mind calm down a bit and have found that they do help me fall and stay asleep.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also why James Randi can swallow entire bottles of these pills in front of live audiences and not overdose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s literally been diluted to the point where there is NO ACTIVE INGREDIENT in the tablets.</li>
            <li>I have major insomnia issues.  </li>
            <li>I have issues but nothing major that I can&#x27;t deal with...    </li>
            <li>Not dramatic, certainly no knock-out,</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t take long enough to really know how they are</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used long enough to really know, but seems to be working as hoped.</li>
            <li>Non addictive, natural product.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I was surprised that the stuff did anything for me.  </li>
            <li>Why I am still alive and awake after eating the entire bottle of pills?  </li>
            <li>price for it here on Amazon than in your local natural food store.</li>
            <li>The only natural anxiety reliever I can say truly works.</li>
            <li>In this video Randi, a very old man, takes an entire 100 pill bottle at once to demonstrate any actual effects.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great before again before an audition or work presentation, and help with flying and road trips since I tend to get motion sick.</li>
            <li>Worth trying in AmbienNation, especially since so little apparent risk.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between it and all the other herbal remedies out there.</li>
            <li>I would much rather use these than prescription medications and have replaced other meds with them.</li>
            <li>Also helps with social anxiety.</li>
            <li>My wife use Calms for long time, it helps a lot to calm down for sleep</li>
            <li>I usually just give the kids 2 pills right away and</li>
            <li>I received this in less then two weeks, which is incredibly fast for overseas.  </li>

            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve found</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very effective.  </li>
            <li> I do love herbal products and homeopathy, and I&#x27;ve been trying to find the best procuts for me, but I&#x27;m a bit on the fence with this one.</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff - both my mother (senior citizen with apnea)</li>
            <li> Good sleep aid.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to have a good night of sleep</li>
            <li> The good part:  no after or side effects</li>
            <li> I am waking up from a really good sleep.</li>
            <li> Works good on dogs too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT WAS GOOD.  </li>
            <li> I have always found this supplement good for calming sleep without feeling drugged like prescriptions do.  </li>
            <li> OK THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT..</li>
            <li> Its also great because i can take as many as I need through out the day and not have to worry about overdosing ect</li>
            <li> SUPER DUPER GREAT PRODUCT, GO FOR GOLD, YOU&#x27;RE IN IT TO WIN</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re stressed during the day take two , wait a couple hours and take two more and see what that does!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this to me, she loves it and now so do I. Works better than prescription drugs !</li>
            <li> Tonight , it&#x27;ll be warm milk.</li>
            <li> Nice touch having a work area--like having a built in journal.</li>
            <li> Honestly however I can&#x27;t remember ever feeling groggy even with 4 or 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are now into 3 generations of keeping these handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for non-habit forming, effective, non-groggy OTC medications.  </li>
            <li> Good remedy to help relax and get easy sleep.</li>
            <li> This one does not seem to be any more effective than others</li>
            <li> The Calms Forte are probably one of the most cost effective sleeping aids on the market.</li>
            <li> I feel like a sugar pill would be more effective.</li>
            <li> It calmed me completely and before bed took 2 more and slept the best I have slept in weeks....</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know what a placebo is, then go ahead and buy this garbage, I&#x27;m sure it will work for you.</li>
            <li> If after taking 3 I still have an issue I pop 1-2 more</li>
            <li> and I am sure to be able to sleep.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave it a 4 star is I have to use more than recommended.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for years and love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything for a couple hours and was still stressed so I took two more and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never taken more than 2.</li>
            <li> I woke up from the most vidid dream</li>
            <li> and I feel more rested in the morning.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind I am using it with Melatonin, maybe that is why it is working better for me.</li>
            <li> Make sure you take it away from food and don&#x27;t touch homeopathic - put them in the lid and into your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I always get a better night&#x27;s sleep when I use these products.</li>
            <li> Most OTC sleep meds either leave me groggy</li>
            <li> and if that didn&#x27;t work, add 1 or 2 more; you cannot overdose on this product.  </li>
            <li> Wife said they were just ok.</li>
            <li> Great sleep aid, gentle and no residual grogginess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad it took a chance.</li>
            <li> Helps me falling asleep , no hang over and is safe.</li>
            <li> It was the same price as in stores so was happy to see it!</li>
            <li> Works for me most of the time.  </li>
            <li> does work better</li>
            <li> it for yourself as on of my friends love these.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I do wake up, I find that because I am more relaxed from the Calms Forte&#x27;</li>
            <li> and I do get better sleep now that I have started using it nightly.  </li>
            <li> Buy One Get One Free!]</li>
            <li> Homeopathic remedies like this are nothing more than placebos.</li>
            <li> As with anything homeopathic, there are perfectly safe &amp; non-habit forming.</li>
            <li> , however I have found  that taking more than three at a time isn&#x27;t really more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best I&#x27;ve found, they are also cheap and relatively natural.  </li>
            <li> The difference between the quality of sleep I had with and without the Calms Forte was striking.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful for both sleep and occasional panic attacks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve introduced many to it who all love it.  </li>
            <li> I have taken as many as five at one time.  </li>
            <li> What I love most, is that it relaxes my mind, but not my body.  </li>
            <li> It is a staple in my purse and has performed magically at times when I would otherwise have, well, &amp;#34;freaked out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Some work better than others, but none have ever have the effects of Calms</li>
            <li> Anyway, in summary, I think these do a pretty good job as a sleep aid.</li>
            <li> Good to help calm an over excited child, too.</li>
            <li> 1 to 2 are good for travel sickness or taking the edge off certain days.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of prescription narcoleptics over the years, and so I am pretty good at distinguishing placebo from genuine effect.  </li>
            <li> i take two at night and i am able to sleep soundly.</li>
            <li> Great, all natural pills for sleep.</li>
            <li> As soon as I pop one of these babies, I am feeling calm and sleepy within 20 minutes and drift nicely off to sleep.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good product</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t taste good, but are not extremely bad tasting, and well worth the taste.</li>
            <li> Oh and they&#x27;re about the size of a sudafed, easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it let me go to sleep easy and sleep all night and wake in the morning refreshed and not groggy.</li>
            <li> Its great because they are non-habit forming, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects (knock on wood).</li>
            <li> This is safe for people who have a history of substance abuse and are trying to cope with life clean.  </li>
            <li> So they worked, but maybe too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> If I try naturally - without any aid  - I may or may not be successful.</li>
            <li> now I seem to have built up a tolerance for them and not as effective as at first.  </li>
            <li> With Calms Forte, I feel fine when I wake</li>
            <li> it works fine.</li>
            <li> FINE  </li>
            <li> There is oats in this products and they aren&#x27;t gluten free.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t gluten free and there is no advisory warning to that fact.</li>
            <li> Beware, this is not a lactos free or a gluten free product.</li>
            <li> The effect was clearly genuine here.  </li>
            <li> The product was packed secure.    </li>
            <li> you feel the YAWN - douse the light and curl up</li>
            <li> When it was still available.)  </li>
            <li> That puts me out like a light.</li>
            <li> Its great to take the edge off / help quiet racing minds at night, though alone</li>
            <li> Its all natural, eases you into sleep and you have no &amp;#34;hangover&amp;#34; in the morning~~this is by far the best deal I&#x27;ve ever found for this product.</li>
            <li> When traveling, I won&#x27;t leave the house without these pills and Bach Original Flower Essences Rescue Remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural product, but most sleep aids do not work well for me!  </li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m working full time in a fairly stressful finance job, I&#x27;m studying for the LSAT, and I have a 14 year old son who is full of \\&quot;teenaged angst.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty good for a natural product.</li>
            <li> This outstanding product really does work.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend was able to get rid of a very toxic Anti-Anxiety Medication, and exchange it for the Calms Forte product.</li>
            <li> I have just begun to use this product and so far, it seems to be effective.</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing the true benefits of it as I continue use.</li>
            <li> Thank you, just what the lady needed, works good former legs.</li>
            <li> I want to see peer reviewed journals demonstrating efficacy; I don&#x27;t care if cultures used passiflora incarnata or avena sativa (the top two ingredients) to cure ailments before the birth of modern medicine.  </li>
            <li> my sleep cycle was full of spikes where I was waking up every 30/60 minutes whereas the night I did take it</li>
            <li> It is not bad though</li>
            <li> I love that it is not very expensive, and I don&#x27;t need a doctor&#x27;s prescription.  </li>
            <li> And most importantly, I stay asleep or if I wake up it is easy to get back to sleep.</li>
            <li> I have used Calm&#x27;s Forte for several years now and it gives me a good night of sleep without the stupor in the morning.  </li>
            <li> so I thought that wasn&#x27;t too great, but at least I was going to be able to sleep for the night.</li>
            <li> and I fall asleep quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild; this is not something that will knock you out in fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li> The latter can be habit forming if used too often, but it can be a bit more potent when needed.</li>
            <li> Still in all, if you want a mild dosage of something that will help you get to sleep...this is it.</li>
            <li> so it is a very safe medically.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used melatonin before, but it&#x27;s much too strong for me and makes me feel groggy in the morning.</li>
            <li> One of the rules of homeopathy is that higher dilution equates to a more powerful medicine, which is absolutely ludicrous if you know the simplest tenets of chemistry.</li>
            <li> just one is fine, i have restless problems all the time, love how they just desolve no water when you&#x27;re reaching for them in the middle of the night and don&#x27;t want to get up.</li>
            <li> I would suggest that anyone considering buying Calm Forte sleeping pills watch a TED talk by James Randi entitled &amp;#34;Homeopathy, Quackery, and Fraud&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The bottle warns that anyone who overdoses on Calm Forte to contact poison control.</li>
            <li> Does calm anxiety to a degree.</li>
            <li> Unlike, when we&#x27;ve given her Benedryl (sp), she did not act &amp;#34;drugged&amp;#34;--just calm...</li>
            <li> Worth a try though</li>
            <li> A useful product we buy often.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely feel when this kicks in, a kind of heaviness, a</li>
            <li> I rarely need a sleep aide, but grab for this or Valerian when I do.</li>
            <li> I have a background in medicine and as a result, I view natural products with a healthy amount of skepticism.</li>
            <li> So if you need help relaxing the body, this might not be right for you.  </li>
            <li> Good product, I use it to calm me down during he day (1-2) and some times to hekp ne sleep (3-4).</li>
            <li> If I wake during the night, I can go back to sleep pretty quickly which I can rarely do on most nights.</li>
            <li> Every single time I take these, I have amazing dreams.  </li>
            <li> so I feel the good sleep outweighs the little bit of nerves that I get.</li>
            <li> help relax and sleep very fast acting and safe not addictining as precriptions thx deb</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sister who works at sleep lab - told us about this product and it really works well!</li>
            <li> Two more nights of waking up but being back to sleep in a couple minutes</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are safe for children and you only need 1-3 tablets for the temporary treatment of nervous tension and insomnia.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I wonder how much Hyland&#x27;s employees are getting paid to leave reviews on the Calm Forte product page?</li>
            <li> Within an hour of taking just one tablet I started to relax for the first time in days.</li>
            <li> I tried it on me first -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this after my first restful sleep all week, after taking two Calms Forte pills before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Sometimes Calms Forte is exactly what I need to break the cycle.</li>
            <li> What is also important for me is that it feels natural to my body.</li>
            <li> the first to write a review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first time i take 3 before bedtime and didn&#x27;t help me</li>
            <li> If you found these ineffective, my first suggestion would be to take them on a (near-)empty stomach if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li> Thanks Hylands!</li>
            <li> At first almost nothing would help but later on I was able to get some relief with antihistamine products.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of buying this - or any like product - watch this first:</li>
            <li> Randi&#x27;s fiery takedown of psychic fraud\\&quot; which starts with the famous debunker downing an ENTIRE bottle of this!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I felt a little calmer, but did not sleep as quickly as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> It really does help me to sleep more fully and deep and relaxes me.  </li>
            <li> After much resistance, he finally tried my Calms Forte and he was able to get to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I imagine they would have worked better if they were used within a reasonable amount of time, hence the extra star for longevity.  </li>
            <li> Worked really well for the first couple weeks</li>
            <li> it be nice to lie down for a minute\\&quot; feeling.</li>
            <li> probably most useful for middle insomnia (awakening too early) than for a whole night.  </li>
            <li> These are pure sugar</li>
            <li> Someone who needs help occasionally may be fine with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a heavy, drugged feeling but a pleasant calm that washes over you slowly.  </li>
            <li> But if I get a phonecall or get to a good part in my book, then it&#x27;s not very hard to push through and miss that little window of drowsiness.</li>
            <li> This little bottle will definitely be part of my carry on luggage when I fly out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I am not tired.</li>
            <li> I DO HAVE SOME INTENSE DREAMS WITH THIS PRODUCT..</li>
            <li> This has worked out very well-without any side effects at all.</li>
            <li> However, melatonin leaves me feeling really groggy the day after I use it.  </li>
            <li> So this morning I was really nervous and saw I had put them here on my desk</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years now and it really works well.  </li>
            <li> I wake feeling refreshed and ready to go.  </li>
            <li> this product really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While these are calming - Try Valerian to really knock yourself out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t improve sleep quality much.</li>
            <li> This product works very well for anxiety and for sleep without making you feel groggy in the morning.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> This helps avoid feeling groggy in the morning by taking too much.</li>
            <li> really calms my thoughts so i can sleep.  </li>
            <li> It relaxes my whole body.</li>
            <li> We are very grateful.</li>
            <li> Service was fast ,but doesn&#x27;t  work for me .none</li>
            <li> They work reasonably well.</li>
            <li> They are very relaxing when taken before bed, it makes my thoughts stop racing which is helpful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it is very helpful whenever I experience insomnia.</li>
            <li> i really like this product.  </li>
            <li> These tablets really help me to relax and get to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> Buy some real sleep aids instead.</li>
            <li> Saw a video by science baby where she takes a whole bottle with no effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel groggy in the morning, and they seem to knock me out fast after taking.</li>
            <li> Really takes the edge off.</li>
            <li> I have insomnia and normally need a prescription to sleep, but I was able to cut down on that when I started using Calm Forte.</li>
            <li> wow; I&#x27;m so mellow right now.</li>
            <li> Take the active ingredient crush it up, make sure you shake it, that&#x27;s important, as you dilute it in a liquid solution as big as Lake Michigan.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild generalized and social anxiety, so I pop one in every morning and can really tell the difference on the days when I forget to take one.</li>
            <li> Because these pills are nothing more than water and other harmless stuff.  </li>
            <li> It works better than other over the counter sleeping medications.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I only notice a minor physical difference with the xanax, except for it puts me to sleep right away instead of rolling around for 3 hours like the nights when I don&#x27;t take it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product would be effective if you&#x27;re not actually tired.  </li>
            <li> Take it with low dose melatonin, Inositol and Calms for sleep and gives me 8-10 hrs good sleep, if I wake  up in  wee hours, and can&#x27;t get back to sleep, take a Calms and back to sleep.    </li>
            <li> And the tablets are nice and small.</li>
            <li> For the occasional time that I am unable to settle to sleep, Calms Forte is the perfect answer.  </li>
            <li> Highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Glad to see they work for others, getting enough sleep is so important for mental and physical health.</li>
            <li> a night&#x27;s sleep is a little more sound/deep, versus those requiring something to literally knock them out.</li>
            <li> These are great for getting rid of the nervous feelings so you can sleep before your big meeting or exam, or if you just need a little extra something to put you to sleep.</li>
            <li> Then add that dilution that may not even have a single molecule of the original substance to a sugar tablet and you have Calms</li>
            <li> this natural product really helps me get to sleep at night.  </li>
            <li> I normally stress out all night about the next day&#x27;s laundry list of things to accomplish but with these, I&#x27;m level headed and calm.</li>
            <li> He used it for a couple months until his normal sleep mode kicked in for him.  </li>
            <li> It works even better after a few days.</li>
            <li> love that it is natural and calms me down and puts me to sleep with no groggy after effect when i wake up</li>
            <li> And even if I do get up to the bathroom at night, I go right back to sleep as though I had never awakened.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s right in the middle.</li>
            <li> Already used up one bottle that I bought from Walgreens and ordered a new one from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s great to take these on a regular basis, but their relatively weaker influence won&#x27;t lead to the psychological dependence you might experience with other drugs.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it is natural and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t help me sleep, but they defiantly take the edge off coming into work and driving on busy streets!</li>
            <li> Potential customers might wonder how taking one or two Calm Forte pills can have any real effect if an entire 100 pill bottle doesn&#x27;t affect an old man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Sure, it may claim it does, but they are deluded down so far that there&#x27;s no actual ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li> I do like these little pills and do enjoy that they dont make me wake up groggy</li>
            <li> Homeopathy is fraud that exploits the scientific illiteracy of the general public, and the only reason it and other homeopathic remedies haven&#x27;t been flagged by the FDA is because the FDA is too understaffed to effectively screen all the treatments that pass through their system annually.</li>
            <li> Calms Forte actually relaxed me enough that I fell into a natural sleep and woke up with no after effects and no weird dreams either!</li>
            <li> I suspect this one one of those products that works for a select group of people, probably based on genetics and other factors (which is no less true of rx drugs).  </li>
            <li> ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED OF COURSE</li>
            <li> The only thing really to say is that \\&quot;it is what it is.\\</li>
            <li> I bought these looking for a natural way to relieve my anxiety.</li>
            <li> Someone told me I should have taken several of them to achieve the desired effect, but I don&#x27;t really think it does anything at all.</li>
            <li> and I ordered it to round up for free shipping of another item.  </li>
            <li> Co-incidentally, it works very well to get back to sleep.  </li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> sleep medications so that his body could heal naturally.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old was having night time panic attacks.</li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> but if you are sensitive to medications (which I am) I don&#x27;t recommend a homepathic route.</li>
            <li> Instead of giving them up completely, I&#x27;ve taken to alternating months.</li>
            <li> Initially Calms Forte didn&#x27;t do much of anything for me</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything for helping me sleep so far.</li>
            <li> My wife often has trouble sleeping and has tried many different products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is more for calming &amp; relaxing to help you cross over the edge to sleep, rather than something heavy to put you out like Lunesta or a chemical over-the-counter &amp;#34;PM&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken other Hylands products, with success, but never this one.</li>
            <li> I like the tablets better because I can halve them if I only want a small dose.  </li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this preparation is caffeine, and all other ingredients are so diluted that they pass Avogadro&#x27;s limit, so you&#x27;re taking nothing more than a caffeinated placebo.</li>
            <li> helps to calm down and fall asleep faster.</li>
            <li> I also take three before bed to help my mind calm down a bit and have found that they do help me fall and stay asleep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also why James Randi can swallow entire bottles of these pills in front of live audiences and not overdose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally been diluted to the point where there is NO ACTIVE INGREDIENT in the tablets.</li>
            <li> I have major insomnia issues.  </li>
            <li> I have issues but nothing major that I can&#x27;t deal with...    </li>
            <li> Not dramatic, certainly no knock-out,</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t take long enough to really know how they are</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to really know, but seems to be working as hoped.</li>
            <li> Non addictive, natural product.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I was surprised that the stuff did anything for me.  </li>
            <li> Why I am still alive and awake after eating the entire bottle of pills?  </li>
            <li> price for it here on Amazon than in your local natural food store.</li>
            <li> The only natural anxiety reliever I can say truly works.</li>
            <li> In this video Randi, a very old man, takes an entire 100 pill bottle at once to demonstrate any actual effects.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great before again before an audition or work presentation, and help with flying and road trips since I tend to get motion sick.</li>
            <li> Worth trying in AmbienNation, especially since so little apparent risk.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between it and all the other herbal remedies out there.</li>
            <li> I would much rather use these than prescription medications and have replaced other meds with them.</li>
            <li> Also helps with social anxiety.</li>
            <li> My wife use Calms for long time, it helps a lot to calm down for sleep</li>
            <li> I usually just give the kids 2 pills right away and</li>
            <li> I received this in less then two weeks, which is incredibly fast for overseas.  </li>
            <li> I have had vivid active dreams for three nights in a row.</li>
            <li> sure, I felt a bit tired but felt all these other things too.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to meds and this product does have some slight side effects for me.</li>
            <li> Like homeopathics generally, I trust that their are minimal, if any, side-effects.</li>
            <li> I had long periods of deep sleep without waking.  </li>
            <li> I use these on a regular basis to help with stress and minor anxiety.</li>
            <li> I used to take it while in graduate school when I was anxious for a test the next day or needed to just calm down for a presentation.  </li>
            <li> Its possible that people are confused over how they are marketed as a sleep aid, when the effects they provide (for me at least) are the relief of tension and anxiety, which then help me sleep better.</li>
            <li> My natural food store owner recommended this as I was having trouble getting to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I take it only if I wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble going back to sellp.</li>
            <li> Long term use isn&#x27;t desirable.</li>
            <li> I also have had really strange dreams while taking this</li>
            <li> Ie, if I am in bed, it helps me sleep, but if it is daytime and I am busy, it calms me down without ANY other side effects like drowsiness, grogginess, etc.  </li>
            <li> Since then I have only been using Melatonin, but I wake up often due to pain.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s for for those who are a little wired on a random night or want to make sure</li>
            <li> I take other homeopathics and believe they HELP with my overall health....</li>
            <li> They have never complained of weird or vivid dreams or hearing things, as someone else mentioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m making a major cross country move, and my nerves have been shot lately.</li>
            <li> nights, my mind is spinning with thoughts about the previous day and things I need to take care of the next day.  </li>
            <li> This may be the reason for less than 5 star reviews, this is the only thing that I can take that will put my to sleep and allow me to wake up alert.</li>
            <li> 3 at night - then read a little - the instant</li>
            <li> my eyes got really heavy and fell asleep almost instantly.</li>
            <li> I am U.S. military, stationed on Okinawa, Japan.   </li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t sleep after a few hours I take a second recommended dose.</li>
            <li> They are not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Life has my mind on overload right now , so after reading the reviews , I figured an all natural sleep aid might not be a bad idea.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY this product or any other homeopathic product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other over the counter drugs</li>
            <li> I saw it in the drug store the other day, so I guess some folks like it.</li>
            <li> started using this  as an alternative to advilPM  every other night.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> No grogginess or any other side effects</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to folks that wake up after a few hours of sleep and stay awake long afterwards.  </li>
            <li> We find that we don&#x27;t wake up groggy with this homeopathic as we do with some other treatment like Melatonin, does not seem to work for us but Calms Forte seems to address our needs both kids and adults.</li>
            <li> Also use it at other times if lots of activity going on.</li>
            <li> There is nothing in these pills, not any active ingredients, just a bunch of herbal things that won&#x27;t hurt you if you OD on them.</li>
            <li> I can fall back asleep, which is always hard to do.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I was having a hard time finding the tablets in stores</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE HEALTH RISKS for me.  </li>
            <li> side effects include: irritability, tingling tongue than bumps on side of tongue, a not right feeling, slight but continued burning in throat, redness and puffiness of cheeks.  </li>
            <li> If I do lie down, I&#x27;ll sleep til morning.</li>
            <li> I lie down</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make him comatose but does help to settle him down.</li>
            <li> These tablets have no taste and are very small, but they definitely work.  </li>
            <li> Just to make sure to not risk a terrible day the next day I will use this product.</li>
            <li> and I cannot take even a half dose.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should cut them in half?</li>
            <li> I take about 5 of them a half hour before bed</li>
            <li> Both of those almost always keep me feeling slightly dragging after waking up.</li>
            <li> and I have to concede that I do notice a slight effect.</li>
            <li> After an hour and a half, I was still tossing and turning.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble winding down and sleeping at night so my Naturopathic doctor suggested this sleep aid.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked and couldn&#x27;t find any contraindications, other than to avoid this if you are taking other anxiety meds, or at least this is my understanding.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken an entire bottle in front of High School classes to show them how useless this is and never even got tired.</li>
            <li> Every time that I feel a little bit nervous I take 2 of this tablets.</li>
            <li> It may have calmed me a little, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> but the price isn&#x27;t bad and it didn&#x27;t have any side effects so it might be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> She suffers from leg pain and this really works.</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural but this thing is useless.</li>
            <li> Neither of us needs to take it now, but it helped us when we were having trouble sleeping.  </li>
            <li> This stuff did nothing, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> He has trouble sleeping</li>
            <li> have recently been diagnosed with tinnitus I believe brought on or made worse by stress.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money if I were you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these with my kids (age 7 &amp; 14) for a few years.</li>
            <li> It takes a few hours to work, but she sleeps well in the car.</li>
            <li> For heavy duty anxiety I&#x27;ll sooner reach for Xanax.</li>
            <li> waste your money on a placebo.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my acupuncturist as I was having trouble staying asleep during the night.  </li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with insomnia.  </li>
            <li> I have a few periods throughout the year when I have difficulty getting to and staying a sleep.  </li>
            <li> I noticed no appreciative difference in any other night of insomnia.</li>
            <li> At least not right after a meal.</li>
            <li> I usually have a lot of trouble sleeping and staying asleep.  </li>
            <li> It was very difficult to fall back asleep after such images, but when I finally did, another frightening nightmare would transpire.  </li>
            <li> At some point in the past, while visiting my parents&#x27; home, I wanted something to help me sleep.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it gives me a big headache</li>
            <li> I was dead asleep for about twelves hours!</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s not a sure thing.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about these.</li>
            <li> , I dont dream at all usually.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m usually one who will try a product at least a few times before writing it off, but I cannot afford another night of sleeplessness.  </li>
            <li> My eyes get very heavy after 30-45 min.</li>
            <li> but I was very tired last night</li>
            <li> Broken seal and half pills</li>
            <li> BUT AT LEAST I AM SLEEPING</li>
            <li> Not effective for me</li>
            <li> She gave me a helpful piece of information, because it is homeopathic you need to chew it to activate, if you just swallow it will slow release.</li>
            <li> I let them dissolve slowly under my tongue.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I used to take Ambien, but I quit taking it after my Mom and sister both had serious repercussions from using it.  </li>
            <li> If I have a very hard time sleeping, I take two at a time.  </li>
            <li> On the contrary, I am v. tired.</li>
            <li> I use this when I&#x27;m tired, but too wound up from the day to drift off.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make her tired at all</li>
            <li> One thing I did notice though was that I wasn&#x27;t waking up feeling tired and exhausted.  </li>
            <li> I feel tired and want to sleep</li>
            <li> I have trouble sleeping at night and often get on a bad sleeping schedule because of it.</li>
            <li> Once I began sleeping for longer periods, I had some of the most devastating, horrifying dreams I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I called the company, complained, and got a &#x27;very sorry&#x27; for being made ill and that they will consider relabeling the package.</li>
            <li> I take this both to sleep, but also just, well, when something really bad or hard to deal with happens during the day.  </li>
            <li> or I dream weird dreams</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t do anything for me, sad to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really poor sleeper, so Hylands Calms Forte&#x27; stays on my bedside table at all times!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these pills did nothing to help me get to sleep, however I did notice I was calmer after taking them, and that is one of the effects of the pills.</li>
            <li> think prolonged use unfortunately diminishes the function of the pills.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad.</li>
            <li> There are also completely useless except as placebos.</li>
            <li> I gave up at 4:30 after a mere four hours of listless sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been taking clonazapam which is a hard hitting sedative and it ended up making me sick.</li>
            <li> I took them and the next morning made comments about the crazy, insane dreams that I&#x27;d had the night before.  </li>
            <li> I take 3 nightly and within 30 Mins, I am out cold.</li>
            <li> I was desperate</li>
            <li> well, it works in vaccines but they always make me very ill.</li>
            <li> And this is after a \\&quot;bad news\\&quot; phone call an hour ago.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> Did not help me at all, as a matter of fact I have bad dreams when I use them.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> and she never gets sleepy or sick.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful, but out of my prescription stress medication/sleep aid</li>
            <li> Sometimes, for whatever reason, they aren&#x27;t especially tired, Calms Forte helps get them to sleep.</li>
            <li> I would hate to do without it.</li>
            <li> This was a dreadful purchase and experience and I will contact Amazon for refund.</li>
            <li> Homeopathy is quackery at its worst.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible insomnia</li>
            <li> Then I began dozing on and off, always waking with terrifying hallucinations including sounds, sights,</li>
            <li> and I had a terrible one-night stand!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is homeopathic &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s literally been diluted to the point where there is NO ACTIVE INGREDIENT in the tablets. In fact, they&#x27;re sugar tablets. I must repeat... NO MEDICINE IN THIS.  It&#x27;s a placebo. If you don&#x27;t know what a placebo is, then go ahead and buy this garbage, I&#x27;m sure it will work for you.</li>
            <li> help relax and sleep very fast acting and safe not addictining as precriptions thx deb</li>
            <li> Some nights I am so overstimulated I can&#x27;t fall asleep. It&#x27;s not that I am not tired. On the contrary, I am v. tired. If I try naturally - without any aid  - I may or may not be successful. Just to make sure to not risk a terrible day the next day I will use this product. For me I have to swallow 3 pills. If after taking 3 I still have an issue I pop 1-2 more and I am sure to be able to sleep.  The reason I gave it a 4 star is I have to use more than recommended.</li>
            <li> these work great to help me sleep</li>
            <li> The ingredients are listen by their Latin names which is no help to the layman. There is oats in this products and they aren&#x27;t gluten free. The product isn&#x27;t gluten free and there is no advisory warning to that fact. I called the company, complained, and got a &#x27;very sorry&#x27; for being made ill and that they will consider relabeling the package. This was a dreadful purchase and experience and I will contact Amazon for refund. Beware, this is not a lactos free or a gluten free product.</li>
            <li> Great, with no side effects. Good remedy to help relax and get easy sleep. Good to help calm an over excited child, too. Safer than a prescription remedy.</li>
            <li> OK THIS PRODUCT WORKS GREAT..I DO NOT FEEL DROWSY UPON WAKENING..I DO HAVE SOME INTENSE DREAMS WITH THIS PRODUCT..BUT AT LEAST I AM SLEEPING&lt;br /&gt;USE ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED OF COURSE</li>
            <li> We have been using this for years and love this stuff.  It helps you fall asleep when your brain won&#x27;t shut off, without having any drowsiness in the morning.  You wake up as if you didn&#x27;t take anything.</li>
            <li> This outstanding product really does work. After about (5) days of use, this product starts to work quite well. My Girlfriend was able to get rid of a very toxic Anti-Anxiety Medication, and exchange it for the Calms Forte product. This has worked out very well-without any side effects at all.</li>
            <li> Non addictive, natural product.  Amazon HSS best price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - both my mother (senior citizen with apnea) and I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I take one pill when I go to bed (actually resting in bed with the lights off) 20 mins after taking fall you into deep restful sleep. Will buy again and will recommend to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sister who works at sleep lab - told us about this product and it really works well!</li>
            <li> At some point in the past, while visiting my parents&#x27; home, I wanted something to help me sleep.  They didn&#x27;t have any melatonin, but they had these pills.  I took them and the next morning made comments about the crazy, insane dreams that I&#x27;d had the night before.  My mom replied that the dreams were the specific reason why she wouldn&#x27;t take the pills anymore.  This was not a one-time thing, either.  Every single time I take these, I have amazing dreams.  The situation is the same with melatonin.  However, melatonin leaves me feeling really groggy the day after I use it.  These pills don&#x27;t appear to have any affect on my mood the following day.  Actually, I feel well rested, which I guess is the point.  Anyway, in summary, I think these do a pretty good job as a sleep aid.</li>
            <li> I suspect this one one of those products that works for a select group of people, probably based on genetics and other factors (which is no less true of rx drugs).  Personally, I was surprised that the stuff did anything for me.  I have used a number of prescription narcoleptics over the years, and so I am pretty good at distinguishing placebo from genuine effect.  The effect was clearly genuine here.  Not dramatic, certainly no knock-out, probably most useful for middle insomnia (awakening too early) than for a whole night.  But, given my expectations, they were solidly surpassed.  Worth trying in AmbienNation, especially since so little apparent risk.</li>
            <li> I have been a nervous wreck and forgot I had these in my closet ! So this morning I was really nervous and saw I had put them here on my desk and I took two. I didn&#x27;t notice anything for a couple hours and was still stressed so I took two more and wow; I&#x27;m so mellow right now. And this is after a \\&quot;bad news\\&quot; phone call an hour ago.  No; I doubt they&#x27;d help me sleep; I take blue gel caps for that or Benedryl. But if you&#x27;re stressed during the day take two , wait a couple hours and take two more and see what that does!</li>
            <li> It does work but unfortunately it gives me a big headache and I cannot take even a half dose.  Keep in mind that this is a sedative and not a hypnotic.</li>
            <li> I take 3 nightly and within 30 Mins, I am out cold. No groggy hang over. yes I will use this again. I use to get Ambiam but my doctor is a prude about giving them to me. Dont need them now, got Calms Fort.</li>
            <li> The only thing really to say is that \\&quot;it is what it is.\\&quot;  I&#x27;m not real big on homeopathic or alternative medicine but for the price I decided to give it a chance.  I wanted to use it as an alternative to Xanax every night for help sleeping but it didn&#x27;t work well enough for that.  To be fair, I only notice a minor physical difference with the xanax, except for it puts me to sleep right away instead of rolling around for 3 hours like the nights when I don&#x27;t take it.  It may work for you, it may not... but the price isn&#x27;t bad and it didn&#x27;t have any side effects so it might be worth a shot. Oh and they&#x27;re about the size of a sudafed, easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> I had trouble winding down and sleeping at night so my Naturopathic doctor suggested this sleep aid. It definitely pushes me to the edge of sleeping. My eyes get very heavy after 30-45 min. I&#x27;ve never taken more than 2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years now and it really works well.  It really does help me to sleep more fully and deep and relaxes me.  I used to take it while in graduate school when I was anxious for a test the next day or needed to just calm down for a presentation.  It is not a placebo and definitely works for me.</li>
            <li> I wake up between ine and three am and couldn&#x27;t go back to sleep. Tried several unsuccessful things. Using these I have had two nights of not even waking up before my alarm. Two more nights of waking up but being back to sleep in a couple minutes</li>
            <li> just one is fine, i have restless problems all the time, love how they just desolve no water when you&#x27;re reaching for them in the middle of the night and don&#x27;t want to get up.</li>
            <li> I take a couple of these during the day and they seem to \\&quot;take the edge off.\\&quot; Also, at bedtime, three tabs. and I seem to relax and fall asleep faster. Highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> Life has my mind on overload right now , so after reading the reviews , I figured an all natural sleep aid might not be a bad idea.Well, let me tell you ....I woke up from the most vidid dream I think I&#x27;ve ever had ! My heart was pounding and it took me about an hour to get back to sleep ! I&#x27;ve thrown the pills away. Tonight , it&#x27;ll be warm milk.</li>
            <li> I usually have a lot of trouble sleeping and staying asleep.  I used to take Ambien, but I quit taking it after my Mom and sister both had serious repercussions from using it.  Since then I have only been using Melatonin, but I wake up often due to pain.  Since I started using the Calms Forte I have been staying asleep longer and I feel more rested in the morning. Keep in mind I am using it with Melatonin, maybe that is why it is working better for me.</li>
            <li> Every time that I feel a little bit nervous I take 2 of this tablets. They make miracles. I am so happy I found this product in Amazon.</li>
            <li> WILL HELP YOU TO DRIFT OFF</li>
            <li> I have used Calm&#x27;s Forte for several years now and it gives me a good night of sleep without the stupor in the morning.  I wake feeling refreshed and ready to go.  I would highly recommend this product.  And even if I do get up to the bathroom at night, I go right back to sleep as though I had never awakened.  I take two but it states one to three may be taken one-half hour prior to sleep.</li>
            <li> this product really works. i take two at night and i am able to sleep soundly. no problem waking up in the morning</li>
            <li> We all go through various situations which put us to the test. When traveling, I won&#x27;t leave the house without these pills and Bach Original Flower Essences Rescue Remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also keep these in your purse for when your friends and family are going through stressful times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are safe for children and you only need 1-3 tablets for the temporary treatment of nervous tension and insomnia.&lt;br /&gt;Non-habit forming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100 tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these are calming - Try Valerian to really knock yourself out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> I ate the entire bottle of this product at 8:30 PM yesterday evening.  It is now after 1:30 in the morning and I am still awake (that is 5 hours for those who don&#x27;t want to do the math).  Why I am still alive and awake after eating the entire bottle of pills?  Because these pills are nothing more than water and other harmless stuff.  Homeopathy is quackery at its worst.  DO NOT BUY this product or any other homeopathic product.  Homeopathy is a scam.  If you need help sleeping, see your doctor.  He might give you something that works.</li>
            <li> I debated between giving this product three or four stars, but I decided to go with three so it&#x27;s right in the middle. They do work, but almost too well. It says to take one for relaxation and two or three to sleep, but I just took one and after about twenty minutes my eyes got really heavy and fell asleep almost instantly. I wanted them for the anxiety purpose too so I thought that wasn&#x27;t too great, but at least I was going to be able to sleep for the night. I was dead asleep for about twelves hours! And so groggy the next day. So they worked, but maybe too strong for me. Maybe I should cut them in half? I do love herbal products and homeopathy, and I&#x27;ve been trying to find the best procuts for me, but I&#x27;m a bit on the fence with this one.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t sleep without these!</li>
            <li> I bought these looking for a natural way to relieve my anxiety. These work great! They don&#x27;t help me sleep, but they defiantly take the edge off coming into work and driving on busy streets! I recommend taking two-three.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for the first couple weeks now I seem to have built up a tolerance for them and not as effective as at first.  Maybe it is me I will keep trying.</li>
            <li> I am U.S. military, stationed on Okinawa, Japan.   I received this in less then two weeks, which is incredibly fast for overseas.  I would have never went with this company if they did not have the Amazon backing them up.   Amazon has been known to have companies that are relible subworking under their name.    The product was packed secure.    Calms forte works.  I sleep amoung hundreds of people at close range.  It helps you relax and rest with noises everywhere.</li>
            <li> Great homeopathic to take before bedtime.  Make sure you take it away from food and don&#x27;t touch homeopathic - put them in the lid and into your mouth.  After I take 3 at bedtime, I also take one BHI Calming under the tongue and I fall asleep quickly.  I always get a better night&#x27;s sleep when I use these products.</li>
            <li> I took there pills 1 hour before bed as recommended, through out the night I woke up 4 or 5 times sometimes hallucinating sometimes standing and I totally different area in my room. I am calling out of work today because I still don&#x27;t feel quite like myself.</li>
            <li> I would suggest that anyone considering buying Calm Forte sleeping pills watch a TED talk by James Randi entitled &amp;#34;Homeopathy, Quackery, and Fraud&amp;#34;. In this video Randi, a very old man, takes an entire 100 pill bottle at once to demonstrate any actual effects. The bottle warns that anyone who overdoses on Calm Forte to contact poison control. Potential customers might wonder how taking one or two Calm Forte pills can have any real effect if an entire 100 pill bottle doesn&#x27;t affect an old man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wonder how much Hyland&#x27;s employees are getting paid to leave reviews on the Calm Forte product page?</li>
            <li> Because it is not 5 star.Does calm anxiety to a degree. Doesn&#x27;t improve sleep quality much. Worth a try though</li>
            <li> This product works very well for anxiety and for sleep without making you feel groggy in the morning.</li>
            <li> My doctor didn&#x27;t want me taking extra things, so I sent back...didn&#x27;t take long enough to really know how they are</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sleep/relaxation aid on and off for decades.  It helps me to go to sleep, and it doesn&#x27;t have harmful side effects or addictions.</li>
            <li> There is nothing in these pills, not any active ingredients, just a bunch of herbal things that won&#x27;t hurt you if you OD on them. Don&#x27;t believe me? There&#x27;s a Youtube video of a woman swallowing an entire bottle of these pills at once and she never gets sleepy or sick. Anyone who thinks this pill is doing something is experiencing a placebo effect. And of course, I took 2 of these before bed and was up all night, they didn&#x27;t work. I wish I knew they were placebos before I bought them.</li>
            <li> I was trying to get off my prescription sleeping pills.  Most OTC sleep meds either leave me groggy or I dream weird dreams all ight or they do nothing at all. Calms Forte actually relaxed me enough that I fell into a natural sleep and woke up with no after effects and no weird dreams either!</li>
            <li> Good sleep aid. Not too strong. The way I like.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my situation at all, Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to really know, but seems to be working as hoped.</li>
            <li> Only seems to work if you take 3 or 4.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would help me sleep. I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between it and all the other herbal remedies out there. It may have calmed me a little, but that&#x27;s about it. Would not recommend for insomnia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m making a major cross country move, and my nerves have been shot lately. I&#x27;ve taken other Hylands products, with success, but never this one. Within an hour of taking just one tablet I started to relax for the first time in days. This little bottle will definitely be part of my carry on luggage when I fly out.</li>
            <li> I never suffer from Insomnia but I was very tired last night and I wanted to have a good night of sleep, My husband has bought them, took them once and did not do anything to him, so I had one pill last night, only one, and could NOT fall asleep the entire night finally I got up at 3:00 A.M. got a tylenol p.m. and 30 mins. later I was deeply asleep. I wanted something natural but this thing is useless. So instead of helping me I think these pills were the cause of my insomnia, would never try them again.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, good product</li>
            <li> These tablets have no taste and are very small, but they definitely work.  I take about 5 of them a half hour before bed and I sleep deeply and wake up refreshed. I&#x27;ll be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> My natural food store owner recommended this as I was having trouble getting to sleep.  He told me to take 3 tabs and if that didn&#x27;t work, add 1 or 2 more; you cannot overdose on this product.  Three tabs worked for me.  Months later my husband was hospitalized for a month and when he came home, his sleep pattern was all mixed up.  After much resistance, he finally tried my Calms Forte and he was able to get to sleep.  He used it for a couple months until his normal sleep mode kicked in for him.  Neither of us needs to take it now, but it helped us when we were having trouble sleeping.  I keep it on hand --- just in case.</li>
            <li> Wife said they were just ok.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this would help with RLS and put me to sleep but I need to keep looking.  Not effective for me</li>
            <li> I bought this b/c I read it worked well for pets. I tried it on me first - I slept well without feeling &amp;#34;drugged&amp;#34;. I gave one to my 98# Dobie-Rott on July 4th (who HATES fireworks), she chilled on the couch with me--mostly on her back watching TV. Unlike, when we&#x27;ve given her Benedryl (sp), she did not act &amp;#34;drugged&amp;#34;--just calm...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t always work like I want it to.</li>
            <li> I love these! I have problems falling asleep when there&#x27;s a lot on my mind. I&#x27;ve tried other over the counter drugs but I wake up feeling drugged. This stuff relaxes me to sleep and I stay asleep! Best thing I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> Definitely helps me sleep.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t do anything for me, sad to say. I saw it in the drug store the other day, so I guess some folks like it. Someone told me I should have taken several of them to achieve the desired effect, but I don&#x27;t really think it does anything at all.</li>
            <li> Great sleep aid, gentle and no residual grogginess. One or two pills will do nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Best price for it here on Amazon than in your local natural food store.</li>
            <li> My wife often has trouble sleeping and has tried many different products. This one does not seem to be any more effective than others</li>
            <li> A useful product we buy often.</li>
            <li> My mind seems to work overtime when I would prefer to sleep and this helps on those restless nights.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this after my first restful sleep all week, after taking two Calms Forte pills before bedtime. I have trouble sleeping at night and often get on a bad sleeping schedule because of it. Sometimes Calms Forte is exactly what I need to break the cycle. It&#x27;s relaxing and does make me just drowsy enough to fall asleep. I&#x27;ve used melatonin before, but it&#x27;s much too strong for me and makes me feel groggy in the morning. With Calms Forte, I feel fine when I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely feel when this kicks in, a kind of heaviness, a \\&quot;wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to lie down for a minute\\&quot; feeling. If I do lie down, I&#x27;ll sleep til morning. But if I get a phonecall or get to a good part in my book, then it&#x27;s not very hard to push through and miss that little window of drowsiness. Also, one pill doesn&#x27;t do it for me, I have to take two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand the mix of five-star and one-star reviews. It&#x27;s mild; this is not something that will knock you out in fifteen minutes. Some people respond to herbal remedies, some don&#x27;t. So buy the smaller bottle and give it a try, just be prepared to pass the rest on to a friend or family member if it doesn&#x27;t work out for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad it took a chance. It helps with anxiety during the day and sleep for the night. No complaints. I take it as per directions on bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> If you wake up and cannot get back to sleep Calms Forte&#x27; will help you to get back to sleep and no side affects...</li>
            <li> have been using it for maybe 40/50 years. Helps me falling asleep , no hang over and is safe.</li>
            <li> I have to take 2 in order to fall asleep.  And, it&#x27;s not a sure thing. About 85% of the time I catch the elusive zzzzzzzz&#x27;s.  That&#x27;s pretty good for a natural product.</li>
            <li> works well to help me sleep!</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product. It did the opposite of what it was supposed to, &amp; discarded the m]remainder</li>
            <li> Works great as a nighttime sleep aid without morning grogginess.</li>
            <li> Insightful author!  Gave just enough personal stories to add to the discussions.  Nice touch having a work area--like having a built in journal.</li>
            <li> Helped me relax and fall asleep after stopping pain medicine I had been on for 7 months after surgery.  I had no side effects from Calms Forte either and I followed the directions.</li>
            <li> 3 at night - then read a little - the instant you feel the YAWN - douse the light and curl up - you will drift off to sleep. It will take you to sleep (but is not druggy and will not necessarily keep you there).</li>
            <li> I rarely need a sleep aide, but grab for this or Valerian when I do. The latter can be habit forming if used too often, but it can be a bit more potent when needed. For Calms I also like the fact that you can start with 1 or 2 tabs and then add another 1 or 2 if necessary. This helps avoid feeling groggy in the morning by taking too much. Honestly however I can&#x27;t remember ever feeling groggy even with 4 or 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more for calming &amp; relaxing to help you cross over the edge to sleep, rather than something heavy to put you out like Lunesta or a chemical over-the-counter &amp;#34;PM&amp;#34; product. Both of those almost always keep me feeling slightly dragging after waking up. NOTE: I have recommended this to acquaintances with chronic sleep issues or who are using prescription aides, and they claim it doesn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s for for those who are a little wired on a random night or want to make sure a night&#x27;s sleep is a little more sound/deep, versus those requiring something to literally knock them out.</li>
            <li> this natural product really helps me get to sleep at night.  I like it because it is natural and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> helps to calm down and fall asleep faster.</li>
            <li> It does seem to help some, but it is not what I had hoped for.  The good part:  no after or side effects</li>
            <li> really calms my thoughts so i can sleep.  i chew them thoroughly to dissolve faster and they work for me.</li>
            <li> Calms Forte&#x27; is a great sleep inducer. I take it only if I wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble going back to sellp. Works every time!</li>
            <li> My wife use Calms for long time, it helps a lot to calm down for sleep</li>
            <li> Calms Forte has been around for years. It calms in emergencies and for sleep too.</li>
            <li> Helps me relax and sleep!</li>
            <li> I wanted something that would help me relax at night so I could get to sleep. This stuff did nothing, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After years of suffering from health anxiety, I have finally found something that alleviates my symptoms.  I bought this to help me sleep and had NO idea that it would also reduce my anxiety, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s psychosomatic, considering I didn&#x27;t realize there could be a correlation!  What a pleasant surprise.  Give it a shot and see if it works for you, as it may not work for everyone.  It has harmless homeopathic ingredients..  I looked and looked and couldn&#x27;t find any contraindications, other than to avoid this if you are taking other anxiety meds, or at least this is my understanding.  I only wish I had discovered this years ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take two a day, one in the morning and one at night.  At times, as needed, I take three a day.  If I have a very hard time sleeping, I take two at a time.  This has been life-changing!</li>
            <li> Does have some calming affect, but not like Advil PM or like Tylenol PM (When it was still available.)  Still in all, if you want a mild dosage of something that will help you get to sleep...this is it.</li>
            <li> I have just begun to use this product and so far, it seems to be effective. I look forward to seeing the true benefits of it as I continue use.</li>
            <li> This is a must have in my medicine cabinet and I ordered it to round up for free shipping of another item.  It was the same price as in stores so was happy to see it!</li>
            <li> Calms Forte was purchased to help reduce another family member&#x27;s anxiety before dental visits.  Co-incidentally, it works very well to get back to sleep.  Depending on the time I wake in the night I may only take ½ a tablet,  and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling &#x27;dopey&#x27; in the morning.  Like homeopathics generally, I trust that their are minimal, if any, side-effects.</li>
            <li> The only natural anxiety reliever I can say truly works.</li>
            <li> Great, all natural pills for sleep. They make me feel a bit woozy which is what I need. You can use them on pets too!</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised. I was doubtful, but out of my prescription stress medication/sleep aid and my doctor did not have any openings. I actually decided to stick with this instead. It works even better after a few days.</li>
            <li> I have terrible insomnia and This gets me to sleep within 15 minutes of taking it. It relaxes my whole body. And most importantly, I stay asleep or if I wake up it is easy to get back to sleep. I&#x27;ve never tried it on a regular basis but I am considering doing so. What is also important for me is that it feels natural to my body.</li>
            <li> Works for me most of the time.  After reading reviews, I&#x27;ll try to chew them.&lt;br /&gt;It does work better that anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> For the occasional time that I am unable to settle to sleep, Calms Forte is the perfect answer.  I like that fact that I cannot &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it acting.  It just relaxes my body and before I know it I am waking up from a really good sleep.</li>
            <li> This product worked for my husband who just finished going through hell with throat cancer. He has trouble sleeping and we wanted to get him off all prescriptions sleep medications so that his body could heal naturally. This has been wonderful establishing good sleep patterns. We are very grateful.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. It does help you fall asleep and have a restful sleep.</li>
            <li> 3 &#x3D; 5 hours sleep works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this  as an alternative to advilPM  every other night.&lt;br /&gt;Next, I will try chamomile caps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product would be effective if you&#x27;re not actually tired.  I use this when I&#x27;m tired, but too wound up from the day to drift off.  Right now, I&#x27;m working full time in a fairly stressful finance job, I&#x27;m studying for the LSAT, and I have a 14 year old son who is full of \\&quot;teenaged angst.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most nights, my mind is spinning with thoughts about the previous day and things I need to take care of the next day.  Two of these pills help quiet those thoughts so I can sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to knock you out, this may not be the thing for you, but if you just need something to allow you to sleep, give this a try.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old was having night time panic attacks. She has never slept well.  I was desperate so I tried these. 1 pill 30 mins before bed...  They have worked wonders.  She sleeps with no problems.  They don&#x27;t make her tired at all they just allow her to fall asleep when she is ready.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently been diagnosed with tinnitus I believe brought on or made worse by stress.  Taking these all 2 pills before each meal and 2 at bed time have allowed me to focus and not listen to the ringing. Life saver!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product and it let me go to sleep easy and sleep all night and wake in the morning refreshed and not groggy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really poor sleeper, so Hylands Calms Forte&#x27; stays on my bedside table at all times! Its all natural, eases you into sleep and you have no &amp;#34;hangover&amp;#34; in the morning~~this is by far the best deal I&#x27;ve ever found for this product. I will purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Did not help me at all, as a matter of fact I have bad dreams when I use them.&lt;br /&gt;Try it for yourself as on of my friends love these.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these pills did nothing to help me get to sleep, however I did notice I was calmer after taking them, and that is one of the effects of the pills.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after reading about it and its reviews.  I found that it indeed helps me sleep through the night.  Sometimes if I do wake up, I find that because I am more relaxed from the Calms Forte&#x27; I can fall back asleep, which is always hard to do.  I have learned that the best combination for me is one tablet of the Forte&#x27; with 1 or 2 1 mg tablets of melatonin.  No grogginess or any other side effects and I do get better sleep now that I have started using it nightly.  I would recommend it to folks that wake up after a few hours of sleep and stay awake long afterwards.  This will help.</li>
            <li> I am having hormonal issues and this helps me sleep. Would recomend to any one.</li>
            <li> Service was fast ,but doesn&#x27;t  work for me .none of the herbal remedies work well on me tho.Have tried severa.</li>
            <li> Works great for me. Already used up one bottle that I bought from Walgreens and ordered a new one from Amazon. Plan to always have this around.</li>
            <li> I have these used these on and off since i was a kid. These are great for getting rid of the nervous feelings so you can sleep before your big meeting or exam, or if you just need a little extra something to put you to sleep.</li>
            <li> I sleep well when I use these. I only need them here and there, but they always work - well. I recommend it to friends and family daily.</li>
            <li> All natural. Works good on dogs too. No side effects.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference taking this</li>
            <li> side effects include: irritability, tingling tongue than bumps on side of tongue, a not right feeling, slight but continued burning in throat, redness and puffiness of cheeks.  sure, I felt a bit tired but felt all these other things too.  NOT WORTH THE HEALTH RISKS for me.  (My doc gave me a couple pills in the office so I didn&#x27;t see the bottle until he handed me it afterwards.)  Homepathy might work for some but if you are sensitive to medications (which I am) I don&#x27;t recommend a homepathic route. like treats like...well, it works in vaccines but they always make me very ill.</li>
            <li> Great product will order again</li>
            <li> I have insomnia and normally need a prescription to sleep, but I was able to cut down on that when I started using Calm Forte.</li>
            <li> Taking the max recommended dosage did nothing to help me sleep.  I suppose these did help alleviate some anxiety I had been feeling, but there&#x27;s no way to know if it&#x27;s because of these tablets or because of a placebo effect.  They may work for you, but they don&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Hylands: Sleep Aid Calms Forte, 1 Ct&lt;br /&gt;Be the first to write a review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item Description&lt;br /&gt;Temporarily relieves the symptoms Of simple nervous tension And occasional SLEEPLESSNESS&lt;br /&gt;Non-habit FORMING&lt;br /&gt;Non-Drowsy FORMULA&lt;br /&gt;100% natural&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Passiflora Hpus, Avena Sativa Hpus, Humulus Lupulus Hpus, Chamomila, Calcarea Hosphorica, Ferrum Phosphoricum, Natrum Phosphoricum, Magnesia Phosphoricum&lt;br /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;Adults And children 12 years or over: as a relaxant 1 To 2 capletswith water as needed three times daily for occasional sleeplessness: 1to 3 caplets 1/2 To 1 hour before retiring children 6 To 12 years1/2adult dose&lt;br /&gt;*******************************************************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above is the manufacturers summary of the product.  Note where it says non drowsy formula.  Well, they are correct.  It did not help me sleep at all, nor did it help me relax. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money if I were you.</li>
            <li> the first time i take 3 before bedtime and didn&#x27;t help me i don&#x27;t even feel sleepy!&lt;br /&gt;maybe because i used to take panadol night</li>
            <li> The Calms Forte are probably one of the most cost effective sleeping aids on the market. They work reasonably well. They are very relaxing when taken before bed, it makes my thoughts stop racing which is helpful. I normally stress out all night about the next day&#x27;s laundry list of things to accomplish but with these, I&#x27;m level headed and calm. It&#x27;s a good feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think prolonged use unfortunately diminishes the function of the pills. Like anything, your body begins to develop an immunity. It&#x27;s sad. Instead of giving them up completely, I&#x27;ve taken to alternating months. Between the Calms Forte and Sleep Aid RX [[ASIN:B00CBF6OE8 Sleep Aid RX Maximum Strength Capsules - Buy One Get One Free!]] I&#x27;m able to regularly sleep through the night and continue the pattern without fail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these with my kids (age 7 &amp; 14) for a few years. They&#x27;ve always worked well for them. Sometimes, for whatever reason, they aren&#x27;t especially tired, Calms Forte helps get them to sleep. They have never complained of weird or vivid dreams or hearing things, as someone else mentioned. Doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t happen. Just means they don&#x27;t affect my kids that way. Another poster mentioned taking one pill that didn&#x27;t work. You are to start with one, then repeat every 15 min. I usually just give the kids 2 pills right away and no water and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Homeopathic remedies like this are nothing more than placebos. Take the active ingredient crush it up, make sure you shake it, that&#x27;s important, as you dilute it in a liquid solution as big as Lake Michigan. Then add that dilution that may not even have a single molecule of the original substance to a sugar tablet and you have Calms Forte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve taken an entire bottle in front of High School classes to show them how useless this is and never even got tired. If your getting drowsy from this it is all in your mind.</li>
            <li> I have used this formula when feeling anxiety or restlessness at bedtime. It works better than other over the counter sleeping medications. It also calms the stomach if I&#x27;m having an acidity problem. If I can&#x27;t sleep after a few hours I take a second recommended dose. That puts me out like a light. I also give one pill a day to my cat on road trips. It takes a few hours to work, but she sleeps well in the car. I would compare this to Rescue Remedy.</li>
            <li> The product did meet my expectations and was delivered in a timely manner!  I have used this product before and it is very helpful whenever I experience insomnia. I do not wake up feeling drugged.</li>
            <li> As with anything homeopathic, there are perfectly safe &amp; non-habit forming. There are also completely useless except as placebos.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people fall for these overpriced placebos called homeopathic \\&quot;medicines\\&quot;. One of the rules of homeopathy is that higher dilution equates to a more powerful medicine, which is absolutely ludicrous if you know the simplest tenets of chemistry. The active ingredient in this preparation is caffeine, and all other ingredients are so diluted that they pass Avogadro&#x27;s limit, so you&#x27;re taking nothing more than a caffeinated placebo. This is why Calms Forte is non-habit forming and has zero side effects. It&#x27;s also why James Randi can swallow entire bottles of these pills in front of live audiences and not overdose. Homeopathy is fraud that exploits the scientific illiteracy of the general public, and the only reason it and other homeopathic remedies haven&#x27;t been flagged by the FDA is because the FDA is too understaffed to effectively screen all the treatments that pass through their system annually.</li>
            <li> Thank you, just what the lady needed, works good former legs. She suffers from leg pain and this really works.</li>
            <li> i really like this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years and it helps me sleep through the night and wake up feeling refreshed not sluggish.</li>
            <li> Does the trick, that&#x27;s about it folks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural product, but most sleep aids do not work well for me!  I felt a little calmer, but did not sleep as quickly as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001EPQ43C Hyland&#x27;s Calms Forte Sleep Aid, 100 Tablets (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My therapist recommended this product to me because I was taking Ambien and that stopped working. She gave me a helpful piece of information, because it is homeopathic you need to chew it to activate, if you just swallow it will slow release. This may be the reason for less than 5 star reviews, this is the only thing that I can take that will put my to sleep and allow me to wake up alert. Love the stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Broken seal and half pills</li>
            <li> These tablets really help me to relax and get to sleep at night.  I awake the next morning and do not feel groggy.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use these for anxiety and stress management. I suffer from mild generalized and social anxiety, so I pop one in every morning and can really tell the difference on the days when I forget to take one. They&#x27;re great before again before an audition or work presentation, and help with flying and road trips since I tend to get motion sick. I also take three before bed to help my mind calm down a bit and have found that they do help me fall and stay asleep. Its great because they are non-habit forming, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects (knock on wood). Its also great because i can take as many as I need through out the day and not have to worry about overdosing ect, however I have found  that taking more than three at a time isn&#x27;t really more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calms Forte is not a sedative and is not meant to work like ambien or another sleeping pill of that variety. Its possible that people are confused over how they are marketed as a sleep aid, when the effects they provide (for me at least) are the relief of tension and anxiety, which then help me sleep better. Its not going to knock you out though, if thats what your looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about what you expect. These don&#x27;t rival Unisom. For heavy duty anxiety I&#x27;ll sooner reach for Xanax. That said, both of the aforementioned have their benefits and side effects. Long term use isn&#x27;t desirable. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s great to take these on a regular basis, but their relatively weaker influence won&#x27;t lead to the psychological dependence you might experience with other drugs.  I have a background in medicine and as a result, I view natural products with a healthy amount of skepticism. I want to see peer reviewed journals demonstrating efficacy; I don&#x27;t care if cultures used passiflora incarnata or avena sativa (the top two ingredients) to cure ailments before the birth of modern medicine.  With all of this said, I was given this bottle well over five years ago and I came across them today. I took three and I have to concede that I do notice a slight effect. Sedating, I suppose. I imagine they would have worked better if they were used within a reasonable amount of time, hence the extra star for longevity.  If you found these ineffective, my first suggestion would be to take them on a (near-)empty stomach if you haven&#x27;t already. At least not right after a meal. A needle in a haystack for your digestive system, so to speak.</li>
            <li> I have been using Calms Forte for years to help with occasional sleeplessness.  Recently, I was having a hard time finding the tablets in stores (I could only find the capsules).  I like the tablets better because I can halve them if I only want a small dose.  I do not suffer from severe insomnia, just restlessness every now and again.  As soon as I pop one of these babies, I am feeling calm and sleepy within 20 minutes and drift nicely off to sleep.  It&#x27;s not a heavy, drugged feeling but a pleasant calm that washes over you slowly.  I do not take anything but these when I need help getting to sleep!</li>
            <li> We are now into 3 generations of keeping these handy. 1 to 2 are good for travel sickness or taking the edge off certain days. 3 often help me sleep although they aren&#x27;t a &amp;#34;sleeping pill&amp;#34; per se.  Of course your mileage may vary but for me  - these are a staple in our medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I love this. I think it works great!</li>
            <li> I have used for about 6 months. Kicks in 15-30 minutes after taking before bedtime. Thanks Hylands! Beats western meds with no side affects.!</li>
            <li> This pill literally has no ingredients in it. Sure, it may claim it does, but they are deluded down so far that there&#x27;s no actual ingredients in the product. These are pure sugar pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally chugged the entire bottle in one go to prove my point. The label says that I took a fatal dose. It&#x27;s been three days since and I&#x27;m still alive, and not once did it make me even remotely sleepy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on a placebo. Buy some real sleep aids instead.</li>
            <li> FINE  I HAD USED PRODUCT BEFORE SO I KNEW IT WAS GOOD.  TELL WHOEVER HAS A PROBLEM WITH SLEEP THAT I USE IT.</li>
            <li> SUPER DUPER GREAT PRODUCT, GO FOR GOLD, YOU&#x27;RE IN IT TO WIN THIS IS IT AND DO IT WELL BUY THIS ITEM! 19 WORDS TO FILL THE REVIEW WOOT! WOOT!</li>
            <li> There is no medicine in these pills. They are sugar. Saw a video by science baby where she takes a whole bottle with no effect.</li>
            <li> I have seen several reviews stating this is just a placebo and won&#x27;t work. I just don&#x27;t believe that. I do however think it works for some and not for others. I have tried just about everything under the sun for sleep. I had been taking clonazapam which is a hard hitting sedative and it ended up making me sick. Because of clonanzapm I ended up having chronic insomnia for months. At first almost nothing would help but later on I was able to get some relief with antihistamine products. Initially Calms Forte didn&#x27;t do much of anything for me but now I can take 3 and get a restful sleep. I am very sensitive to meds and this product does have some slight side effects for me. About 24 hours later I experience some nervousness that lasts about a day. It is not bad though so I feel the good sleep outweighs the little bit of nerves that I get.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking of buying this - or any like product - watch this first: [...]&lt;br /&gt;It is the YouTube video  \\&quot;James Randi&#x27;s fiery takedown of psychic fraud\\&quot; which starts with the famous debunker downing an ENTIRE bottle of this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of sleeping pills for travel-induced insomnia.  These are some of the best I&#x27;ve found, they are also cheap and relatively natural.  I don&#x27;t feel groggy in the morning, and they seem to knock me out fast after taking.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had hoped for. I was under stress...came home from work and took 2. It calmed me completely and before bed took 2 more and slept the best I have slept in weeks....so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my acupuncturist as I was having trouble staying asleep during the night.  I assumed it would help me sleep through without waking, but it didn&#x27;t.  One thing I did notice though was that I wasn&#x27;t waking up feeling tired and exhausted.  So, recently I started using an app to monitor my sleep/movement during the night and I didn&#x27;t take the Calms Forte one night, the following night I did.  The difference between the quality of sleep I had with and without the Calms Forte was striking.  The night I didn&#x27;t take it my sleep cycle was full of spikes where I was waking up every 30/60 minutes whereas the night I did take it I had long periods of deep sleep without waking.  It can also be taken during the day for anxiety and stress.  I wouldn&#x27;t have any issues taking the lower dose during the day because it doesn&#x27;t make you drowsy or sleepy at all.  It is like meditation in pill form.  I love it!</li>
            <li> These did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I have always found this supplement good for calming sleep without feeling drugged like prescriptions do.  It doesn&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;t knock you out for hours so it is a very safe medically.  Been using for several years (5+).</li>
            <li> I use these on a regular basis to help with stress and minor anxiety. I would much rather use these than prescription medications and have replaced other meds with them.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for both sleep and occasional panic attacks. We find that we don&#x27;t wake up groggy with this homeopathic as we do with some other treatment like Melatonin, does not seem to work for us but Calms Forte seems to address our needs both kids and adults.</li>
            <li> Can work for some but not for me. It was recommended by my doctor so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> this is the best overthe counter sleep aid. It does not leave a side effect and you just feel sleepy.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything for helping me sleep so far.</li>
            <li> I do like these little pills and do enjoy that they dont make me wake up groggy but I often have a stomach ache in the morning from them.</li>
            <li> I have major insomnia issues.  I have tried this stuff twice now, and both times it has made no difference.  I feel like a sugar pill would be more effective.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to relax before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about these. I have taken them several nights. I feel tired and want to sleep but I can&#x27;t. I lie down and then I get back up and read. I  am groggy in the morning and have difficulty getting out of bed and moving. If I wake during the night, I can go back to sleep pretty quickly which I can rarely do on most nights. I also have had really strange dreams while taking this, I dont dream at all usually. I have had vivid active dreams for three nights in a row. They are not what I expected. Glad to see they work for others, getting enough sleep is so important for mental and physical health. I will try something else.</li>
            <li> Use this for all my anxiety needs.  Its great to take the edge off / help quiet racing minds at night, though alone, it doesnt put me to sleep, but is great for anxiety management.  Others I&#x27;ve introduced many to it who all love it.  This is safe for people who have a history of substance abuse and are trying to cope with life clean.  Really takes the edge off. Non habit forming, but you&#x27;ll value having it around all the time.  Also helps with social anxiety.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t sleep without it</li>
            <li> works great as sleep aid</li>
            <li> Calms Forte, calms my nerves, lets me sleep well, without any side  effects. I would hate to do without it.</li>
            <li> This has no medicine in it, these are sugar pills, you can take an entire bottle at once and feel NO EFFECT.  need proof? http://m.worldstarhiphop.com/android/video.php?v&#x3D;wshh3u86dxibjMS1w3zj</li>
            <li> Good product, I use it to calm me down during he day (1-2) and some times to hekp ne sleep (3-4).</li>
            <li> love that it is natural and calms me down and puts me to sleep with no groggy after effect when i wake up</li>
            <li> I found this product to be calming, but it had no impact on my sleep.  I have always had trouble with insomnia.  Someone who needs help occasionally may be fine with this.</li>
            <li> I take this both to sleep, but also just, well, when something really bad or hard to deal with happens during the day.  The box recommends 1-3 tablets for sleeping and 1-2 tablets on a regular basis as a relaxant.  I have taken as many as five at one time.  I let them dissolve slowly under my tongue.  They don&#x27;t taste good, but are not extremely bad tasting, and well worth the taste. I take them as needed and not on a regular basis.  What I love most, is that it relaxes my mind, but not my body.  Ie, if I am in bed, it helps me sleep, but if it is daytime and I am busy, it calms me down without ANY other side effects like drowsiness, grogginess, etc.  So if you need help relaxing the body, this might not be right for you.  I love that it is not very expensive, and I don&#x27;t need a doctor&#x27;s prescription.  I also like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the kids accidentally getting into it.  It is a staple in my purse and has performed magically at times when I would otherwise have, well, &amp;#34;freaked out&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this to me, she loves it and now so do I. Works better than prescription drugs ! Need to relax after a stressful day and ease into a great nights sleep ? If so, order this now !</li>
            <li> I took two tabs as recommended and did not fall asleep. I noticed no appreciative difference in any other night of insomnia. I tried to return the product and Amazon said they would return it for 20% of the purchase price. They suggested I contact the manufacturer by phone and  was taken in circles with no human contact or even a place to leave a voice mail.  Beware of buying this expensive product and then not even being able to return it.</li>
            <li> Take it with low dose melatonin, Inositol and Calms for sleep and gives me 8-10 hrs good sleep, if I wake  up in  wee hours, and can&#x27;t get back to sleep, take a Calms and back to sleep.    I take other homeopathics and believe they HELP with my overall health....I have issues but nothing major that I can&#x27;t deal with...    I read where some say they \\&quot;chew\\&quot; the tab, I have not but for the test may do that.</li>
            <li> Helps me with stress at work.</li>
            <li> Give to my 17-lb dog before storms and it takes the edge off his anxiety. Also use it at other times if lots of activity going on. Doesn&#x27;t make him comatose but does help to settle him down. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have a few periods throughout the year when I have difficulty getting to and staying a sleep.  I&#x27;m always on the lookout for non-habit forming, effective, non-groggy OTC medications.  Some work better than others, but none have ever have the effects of Calms Forte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took two tablets before bed then read for a bit.  After an hour and a half, I was still tossing and turning.  Then I began dozing on and off, always waking with terrifying hallucinations including sounds, sights, even smells that weren&#x27;t there.  Once I began sleeping for longer periods, I had some of the most devastating, horrifying dreams I&#x27;ve ever had.  It was very difficult to fall back asleep after such images, but when I finally did, another frightening nightmare would transpire.  I gave up at 4:30 after a mere four hours of listless sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m usually one who will try a product at least a few times before writing it off, but I cannot afford another night of sleeplessness.  Calms Forte and I had a terrible one-night stand!</li>
            <li> I like this brand.  It just takes the edge off getting to sleep, and STAYING asleep.  No after effects.  And the tablets are nice and small. I take three before going to bed, almost every night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective.  Been using it for years</li>
    </ol>
