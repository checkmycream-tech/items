            <li> Great product.  I keep it in my car to keep my hands somewhat moist while driving.  Especially good in cold weather when your hands tend to dry out and the steering wheel tends to get slippery.  My wife has now bought her a jar to keep in her car.  It&#x27;s not greasy feeling and it does have a refreshing odor that is neither masculine or feminine.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter! It&#x27;s perfect for the winter nights when skin gets dry. Lovely smell too.</li>
            <li> Although it has a nice fragrance that resembles baby powder, I CANNOT BELIEVE this product contains things like PARABENS and DYES!!!  I do NOT WANT these things on my SKIN!!!!  ......absorbing THROUGH into my BODY!  I am very disappointed....... Did you know Yellow #5 is BANNED in Austria, Norway and other European countries???  These dyes are said to cause everything from cancer to hyper activity in children and lower sperm count.  .....REGARDLESS of what it does or does not do, I do NOT put dyes and chemicals on my body......intentionally.  I threw this stuff away.......waste of money.  :-(</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing the skin, I have dry skin and as I get older it get worst.</li>
            <li> Great skin softener.  Lasting results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and have found that it does a better job of moisturizing that some of the MUCH more expensive lotions/creams do. I strong recommend this to moisture any portion of you body that you need it for. Especially since the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> This product extends the life of my tan and makes my skin look and feel like silk. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product. Quality is fine. But I am so disappointed. Thought this was a completely natural product. Full ingredients were not listed on ad.  Once I received I see it is more of a commercial product with chemicals. Too much trouble to send back.</li>
            <li> Such a great body moisturizer.  Smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so creamy and doesn&#x27;t go on cakey. The smell is absolutely amazing, but not overbearing at all.  Would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely dry region and this is the only product I have found that provides deep moisture without a greasy feel.  The seller had my order to me within 3 days.  Not only do I highly recommend this product to treat dry skin, or just keep skin smooth and silky, but I equally highly recommend this seller.[[ASIN:B000PI11N2 Hempz By Hempz - Body Butter 8 Oz]]</li>
            <li> Product is not what I expected. It is nothing like what some customers compared. There was way too much scent.</li>
            <li> This is great for your dry spots - heels, ankles, elbows, etc.  Or all over...  It&#x27;s Hempz so you know it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely thick cream.  I have a large number of allergies, yet I am able to use this product without any problems.  My daughter likes it too.  Maybe the hemp leaf on the jar will make you feel a little bit naughty!  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Love this Hempf cream butter</li>
            <li> DONT HESITATE.  THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!!  EVERYBODY ASKS WHAT IM WEARING. THEY LOVE THE SCENT. YET ITS VERY SOFT AND SUTTLE BUT VERY PRETTY</li>

            <li> I love this lotion! It smells so nice and is very hydrating without feeling oily. I would recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic body butter for me. I even use it as a facial moisturizer. it feels light and absorbs quickly, yet works all day. The skin on my feet and lower legs is no longer parched looking! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love Hempz and I always get my order quickly!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This one is the original. Works ok but I myself do not like the smell.</li>
