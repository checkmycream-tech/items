    <ol>
            <li> This is a very nice product to use.&lt;br /&gt;I would order again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;This product has really helped me to keep my&lt;br /&gt;hair moist, and has helped to keep the culr&#x27;s in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I haveused this product for year&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Still a very good product. I used for 18 year. This was great to find it still around. I hate they discontinued it</li>
            <li> After washing my hair (showering) I put a little bit in my hand and mix it with other products (like a cocktail).  Have been using if for quite some time and truly like it.  VERY hard to find.........thanks Amazon!  BTW - it makes my natural curls bounce.  Right on!&lt;br /&gt; ~ P  ;)</li>
            <li> My mother and I love this product. This is the original formula which is excellent. We are having a hard time finding it. So when we find the original formula we try to purchase more than one.&lt;br /&gt;It make your hair feel smooth and silky and makes your hair grow. It is an excellent product. Wish we didn&#x27;t have such a hard time finding the Original formula. I hope we can continue to buy it from this source.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This gel works great on my hair. I use it every time I comb my hair to bring out the curls and it works like magic on my hair.</li>
            <li> Back in the 60&#x27;s, I purchased this product for my afro. Raised in New York, this item was very popular. Of course, as times change,&lt;br /&gt;I changed my hair style. I was so surprise to see this item, on Amazon.com. I immediately decided to buy this, since I went back to&lt;br /&gt;an afro. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for curly or natural hair it works very good, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my frizz under control.  Have natural wavy, grey hair and I don&#x27;t go a shampoo without using this afterwards.  Not sticky, not oily, just defines my waves.  Only need to use a quarter size as directed.  Be sure to rub hands together to activate.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product,i&#x27;ve used it for years,stores stopped stacking,why? never thought i would go to the net to find my products,seems it&#x27;s the way to go</li>
            <li> My love this product her hair looks amazing !!</li>
            <li> This just did not work for me.. The consistency of the formula was way too watery and it evaporated off my head in a matter of hours. It also left it incredibly frizzy. Might work better on shorter hair a couple inches in length.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Good &#x27;ole Lustrasilk reminds me of my childhood.</li>
            <li> waste of money. it did not do anything to my hair.. I was very disappointed. ;-( ..&lt;br /&gt;so please do not buy this crap</li>
            <li> This product is ok.  I thought I would see better results.</li>
            <li> Maintains moisture for rectitude hair without the oil drippy look. I use linage text for straight style and curl style but use establish lustrasilk for mousture</li>
            <li> I love it but the price is too great.  Your price is for the 16 oz. size. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly unruly frizzy hair. I use this product to make my curls lovely, which it does, it&lt;br /&gt;helps with the dryness and frizz, and really smells nice. It makes my hair look softer, also&lt;br /&gt;this bottles lasts a good long time and I have medium length hair. I will when the time comes&lt;br /&gt;buy another bottle for sure. And just a small amount per time is all you need.</li>
            <li> I love it it helps my hair to me manageabe soft and sheen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  Because It works really well as a moisterizer for ethnic hair, I&#x27;ve recommended to so many relatives and friends.  Thanks for this outstanding product!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have been to a number of stores and have not found it.  I talked to one of the owners of the stores and he told me that Lustrasilk no longer makes this product. I am so sad.  It took me a very long time to find something that works for my hair, now i have to search again.  i tried the Max product that is suppose to be an enhancement of the Right on but not the same.  It does not help keep the curl.  so sad</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 30 years but the company stopped make it so i had to go  on line to find it and you guy&#x27;s found them for me, the product is great just don&#x27;t understand why the company stopped make it.</li>
            <li> Great for my naturally curly-frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve used it everyday for years. Leaves my hair soft and touchable but managed.  Sad to not be able to find it anywhere anymore. I used to buy a6  oz bottle too.</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed and I was looking for a product that can keep it moist for a long period of time. So far, this product is the best. I like how it does not have any petroleum and no mineral oil ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this for my father for sometime now. I am so glad that somebody provides this for my father who will NOT use anything else.</li>
