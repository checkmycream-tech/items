            <li>This is great if you are a cast member on Jersey Shore, but didn&#x27;t work so well for me.</li>
            <li>Great color payoff and nice feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>A+ product reccomend to buy before they sell out good price</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfect, my skin tone is light brown, I use maybelline dream matte powder and mousse foundation,</li>
            <li>Good for anyone looking for this discontinued product</li>
            <li>Good for a summer or winter glow.  </li>
            <li>This product is very nice and goes on very easy.  </li>
            <li>The color on the cap is the color of the blush LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Great color, it blends on your skin so naturally, easy to use and looks like you are not even wearing make up...</li>
            <li>This product goes perfect with my skin, it blends very well and gives just the shimmer that I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>nice blush buy it good product I love it</li>
            <li>, I would have grabbed as many as I can.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it highlights the cheek areas</li>
            <li>I really like this blush works great and can&#x27;t beat the price,.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>The color was orangey, more like a bronzer.</li>
            <li>but after trying it on, i am soo in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It sure thing mousse.</li>
            <li>Only thing I found is if you use a powder foundation this does not work well with it, but for summer when you don&#x27;t use powder works very nicely!</li>
            <li>The is a fun and effective blush.</li>
            <li>Maybelline replaced this nice Dream Moose blush with a very inferior \\&quot;Dream</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be the right color for my skin tone</li>
            <li>I have used this in the cloud wine color for years and it has never disappointed.</li>
            <li>This blush is actually gorgeous, it&#x27;s so smooth and goes well on skin, also last for a good amount of hours before it starts to fade, would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li>but it is just fine for me right now.  </li>
            <li>A nice color, looks natural not cakey.</li>
            <li>well..I even use it under my eyes for a quick shimmer.  </li>
            <li>l love this product .. replacement not nearly as good .. great seller.</li>
            <li>Was a small bottle but looks as good a mac liquid blush!</li>
            <li>Then it is pretty!</li>
            <li>but as i applied it onto my face it left a nice shimmery shine.</li>
            <li>it is light, the texture is very very soft and is pretty pigmented.</li>
            <li>this has definitely became one of my favorite face products.</li>
            <li>Nice product just not much of it.  </li>
            <li>I straight up looked like Deena.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Less is more also.</li>
            <li>The only thing that ppl may not like is that Is smaller than what it looks in the picture, it&#x27;s not like the ones that you buy at the store for foundation but for the price it&#x27;s perfect since you only need to use just a little bit.</li>
            <li>when i first saw it online, i thought the color was going to be super dark and should be used as a bronzer instead of a blush.</li>
            <li>Do not like the new stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and melts into my skin for a natural finish.</li>
            <li>It makes your face look really soft and don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li>this color has a tad of pink and is very shimmery.</li>
            <li>Sorry this is being discontinued as it&#x27;s a nice creamy blush, rather than a powder, which I don&#x27;t care for at all.</li>
            <li>always remember to seal properly after use or else it will lose its fluffy mousey texture quickly.</li>
            <li>DONT LIKE IT NOT GOOD COLOR FOR ME  GOOD PRICE VERY SMALL</li>

            <li> I use a flat liquid foundation application brush</li>
            <li> I suppose Maybelline thinks they are saving money, but when people stop buying this latter replacement Maybelline will loose money overall.  </li>
            <li> it is soooo soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> at first it was weird when i opened the little container</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and hate that it is discontinued.  </li>
            <li> it shoud be priced at $2.99---or less.  </li>
            <li> just know it is small.  </li>
            <li> so I will at least have some for a while.  </li>
            <li> BUT NOT FOR ME VERY SMALL CASE</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product is not available anymore</li>
            <li> So sorry it&#x27;s been discontinued!</li>
            <li> Bad color and cakey.  </li>
            <li> Bouncy\\&quot; which is terrible.  </li>

            <li> Maybelline replaced this nice Dream Moose blush with a very inferior \\&quot;Dream Bouncy\\&quot; which is terrible.  Bad color and cakey.  I suppose Maybelline thinks they are saving money, but when people stop buying this latter replacement Maybelline will loose money overall.  It doesn&#x27;t go on well and fades easily--instead of $7.00 it shoud be priced at $2.99---or less.  Do not buy the Dream Bouncy product--it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I actually found this in the clearance trays...I absolutely love this product and hate that it is discontinued.  Had I known it would be, I would have grabbed as many as I can.  This product goes perfect with my skin, it blends very well and gives just the shimmer that I am looking for.  I love it because it highlights the cheek areas well..I even use it under my eyes for a quick shimmer.  Please bring this product back!!!</li>
            <li> I order this product alot and like it.  Will order again in different colors and blushes for my skin.Thank you</li>
            <li> The is a fun and effective blush. Great color payoff and nice feel on the skin. Why o why did they discontinue this to replace it with the inferior bouncy blushes?</li>
            <li> A+ product reccomend to buy before they sell out good price nice blush buy it good product I love it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was going to be the right color for my skin tone but I&#x27;m very happy that I ordered this product, it&#x27;s perfect, my skin tone is light brown, I use maybelline dream matte powder and mousse foundation, medium 2-2.5. The only thing that ppl may not like is that Is smaller than what it looks in the picture, it&#x27;s not like the ones that you buy at the store for foundation but for the price it&#x27;s perfect since you only need to use just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I really like this blush works great and can&#x27;t beat the price,. It makes your face look really soft and don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> My daughter is an aspiring makeup artis, she likes to use this bronzer. A nice color, looks natural not cakey.</li>
            <li> DONT LIKE IT NOT GOOD COLOR FOR ME  GOOD PRICE VERY SMALL IT OK BUT NOT FOR ME VERY SMALL CASE</li>
            <li> Was a small bottle but looks as good a mac liquid blush!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  A jar lasts forever!</li>
            <li> This is great if you are a cast member on Jersey Shore, but didn&#x27;t work so well for me. The color was orangey, more like a bronzer. I straight up looked like Deena. Also, it&#x27;s has a pearlized, glowy finish, which actually just looked shiney.</li>
            <li> This blush is actually gorgeous, it&#x27;s so smooth and goes well on skin, also last for a good amount of hours before it starts to fade, would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> me gustó mucho el producto y llego a tiempo , según lo acordado y comprado, gracias por el servicio. pilar</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and melts into my skin for a natural finish. So sorry it&#x27;s been discontinued! I really like it.</li>

            <li> Great color, it blends on your skin so naturally, easy to use and looks like you are not even wearing make up...it works great for me! Would buy it again...</li>
            <li> it is soooo soft and subtle. I love it and I do not use my fingers as per the instructions. I use a flat liquid foundation application brush but maybe some day i will go by the instructions but it is just fine for me right now.  I have used this in the cloud wine color for years and it has never disappointed. always remember to seal properly after use or else it will lose its fluffy mousey texture quickly.</li>
