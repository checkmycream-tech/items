            <li>Now have a good day</li>
            <li>This is as good as any that are out there at this price.</li>
            <li>So test it out and return immeditely if doesnt work exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the trimmer that I would order more heads if I knew where or how to get them.</li>
            <li>This does trim nice and close</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I bought the Magic Touch before this and it broke on me after about six months.</li>
            <li>perfect for ear nose brow etc...battery last longer than others..</li>
            <li>one of the best personal trimmers</li>
            <li>but this one works so much better.  </li>
            <li>I really would have loved to have had that information with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It was the best trimmer I have found, but it died after about a year and a half.</li>
            <li>I was immediately happy with this Remington MPT-3000 Titanium Personal Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The trimming is fast and effective.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic while it lasted.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>After a few months with the Remington, it still works great and is going strong.</li>
            <li>The motor is on the powerful side.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>it is much better than the other stuff out there I had try many of them</li>
            <li>Mine is 5 years old and going strong with a drop now and then.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish it would have had was information on where a person could order more heads for it.  </li>
            <li>You will probably get about a year or so out of this trimmer with consistent use before it concedes.  </li>
            <li>It needs to be played with first before it starts working</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this exact model for a while.</li>
            <li>I would be willing to pay more for a similar model that lasted longer.</li>
            <li>All you have too do is hold it up in the air flat ways and drop it on the counter from a foot :)</li>
            <li>, product preformed better than I expected, would buy another when needed.  </li>
            <li>The infection would most likely be Step or the dreaded Staph ( the more common bacteria within the nose).  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to anyone unless I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time but so far I&#x27;m happy, and it&#x27;s far superior to other rotary clippers used in the past.  </li>
            <li>Since the blades are really small the cut is very smooth as if shaving.</li>
            <li>The cutting with rotation is most important.    </li>
            <li>63 years old</li>
            <li>The units are a little balky and need disassembling to clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not much to look at, but the trimmer does a great job of cutting ear and nose hairs very close without pulling.</li>
            <li>It barely trims hair.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because the head is super small and the handle is like a pencil.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised and small enough to fit in various orifices.  </li>
            <li>One thing I lost my first one (do not get the waste basket too close to the sink).</li>
            <li>It will cut if you&#x27;re not careful, but so far not much blood let.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was immediately happy with this Remington MPT-3000 Titanium Personal Trimmer.  The motor is on the powerful side.  The trimming is fast and effective.  The only thing I wish it would have had was information on where a person could order more heads for it.  All trimmers I have order does not have information on where you can get replacement heads for them.  I really would have loved to have had that information with this trimmer.  I am so happy with the trimmer that I would order more heads if I knew where or how to get them.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this product !!! Sorry but is very bad. !!!! need to said.!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much to look at, but the trimmer does a great job of cutting ear and nose hairs very close without pulling. I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time but so far I&#x27;m happy, and it&#x27;s far superior to other rotary clippers used in the past.  Update after about 6 months of use: Not worth the trouble.It lost it&#x27;s sharpness and the speed of the cutter often stops or is so slow that it pulls on your hair. Changed batteries multiple times, but it&#x27;s not a battery problem. I will try to return it.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer I have used. I have used $40 ones that did nothing but pull hair and hurt or not get close. This does trim nice and close so alight touch is usefull. This is the only one that gets in the knooks and tight spots. That&#x27;s because the head is super small and the handle is like a pencil. Translates in longer between trims. It does eat up battery&#x27;s but it&#x27;s worth it. One thing I lost my first one (do not get the waste basket too close to the sink). They both did the same thing, quit working. All you have too do is hold it up in the air flat ways and drop it on the counter from a foot :) Also it will not start if battery&#x27;s are low. If this seems like a lot it is not. It takes no room up for traveling. I am getting another in case they stop making it. Mine is 5 years old and going strong with a drop now and then.</li>
            <li> Well, it cuts hair alright, but it also damages my skin too. I used it one time and it left my skin red and sore for sometime. I would not recommend this to anyone unless I wasn&#x27;t particularly fond of them.</li>
            <li> 63 years old and I have nose hair, product preformed better than I expected, would buy another when needed.  Now have a good day</li>
            <li> I like the metal casing.  You will probably get about a year or so out of this trimmer with consistent use before it concedes.  But for $9, that is about all you can ask for.  This is as good as any that are out there at this price.</li>
            <li> Just got it and it does what it says it will.  I&#x27;m very impressed with it.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these and one works well- does its job. It needs to be played with first before it starts working but at least it works. The other one does not work well at all. It barely trims hair. So test it out and return immeditely if doesnt work exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> I love this. I have been looking for this exact model for a while.</li>
            <li> Awesome item , love it.</li>
            <li> Very good I rreally like this peace it is much better than the other stuff out there I had try many of them</li>
            <li> Had a different brand, that gave up the ghost. Went online found this Remington MPT-3000  is the kitty&#x27;s whiskers . Shipped to my house in record time thank you I&#x27;ll tell a friend. Than You!!!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I bought the Magic Touch before this and it broke on me after about six months. After a few months with the Remington, it still works great and is going strong.</li>
            <li> The Remington MPT-2000  is an excellent device.  It cuts hairs (if used by rotating the clipper inside the nasal passage).   The cutting with rotation is most important.    Pulling or jerking hair leads to possible infection.  The infection would most likely be Step or the dreaded Staph ( the more common bacteria within the nose).  The brass cutting device is important since it tends to retard or interfere with bacterial growth ( picked up when the cutting portion is within the nasal passage).      I would use only one and the same one clipper for the nose so as not to cross contaminate the other areas where such a clipper might be used.      The units are a little balky and need disassembling to clean.  Be careful not to turn the switch to the motor \\&quot;on\\&quot;  or you will have to realign the cutting portion with a linkage from the motor.  The cutting head is disassembled easily by snapping a locking device back from the cutting head.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimer for the people who have hair growing in unwanted places.  Since the blades are really small the cut is very smooth as if shaving.</li>
            <li> perfect for ear nose brow etc...battery last longer than others..one of the best personal trimmers</li>
            <li> I use this product every week for eyebrows, etc.  I&#x27;ve had cheaper products but this one works so much better.  It will cut if you&#x27;re not careful, but so far not much blood let.</li>
            <li> Fantastic while it lasted. It was the best trimmer I have found, but it died after about a year and a half. I would be willing to pay more for a similar model that lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and small enough to fit in various orifices.  Never taught in school about this hair thing . . .</li>
