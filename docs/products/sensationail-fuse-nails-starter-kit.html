    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think this product is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>great!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I was completely impressed.</li>
            <li>For the best outcome you have to do nails one at a time.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this hasn&#x27;t gotten very good reviews.</li>
            <li>within about fifteen minutes the enamel has it&#x27;s beautiful shine again.</li>
            <li>A couple days in and my nails are still flawless, and I love not having to worry about chips or smudges!</li>
            <li>Thought it was a great deal for enamel</li>
            <li>, my nails looked great</li>
            <li>and I am overwhelmingly happy with it.</li>
            <li>If you are unsure if you will be happy with your purchase my recommendation would be save your receipt and return it if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Yes, you get gorgeous nails, so shiny that you can see your reflection nails...</li>
            <li>I reapplied it on Mothers Day, and they looked good that Sunday and Monday.</li>
            <li>Someone commented it&#x27;s good for touch up during travels-</li>
            <li>The concept of being able to get gel nails from the comfort of your home is a great concept.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many great ones.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions, you will get a great result, although I do recommend leaving your nail under the light for two rounds as  opposed to one.</li>
            <li>I had an AMAZING result.</li>
            <li>but this one is so much easier, lasts even longer and looks the best out of all of them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing my own soak-off-gel nails for about 6 months.</li>
            <li>The nice thing is this stuff self levels.  </li>
            <li>This gives a very pretty polish with great shine.  </li>
            <li>They have great colors and for the price it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>This looks great for 2 days maximum, and then the &amp;#34;gelnamel&amp;#34; peels right off.</li>
            <li>I bought this in store, not on Amazon and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>You can use the top piece to do toes.    </li>
            <li>I thought this &amp;#34;gelnamel&amp;#34; might have more staying power.  </li>
            <li>I cant wait until they start selling more colors.</li>
            <li>Yeah sure.....  </li>
            <li>If you want it to look like it does on the box you will need much more then that.</li>
            <li>I think polish from the dollar store covers better and looks nicer.  </li>
            <li>BUT for the tiny LED and 30 seconds a nail I think it is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>and I still had to push/scrape most of the polish off</li>
            <li>- it would NOT wipe off with a cotton ball as most gel polishes would.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more colors from this brand and keep testing it out.</li>
            <li>you can do nail art on top of it.</li>
            <li>Better to get them done t the salon.</li>
            <li>the more</li>
            <li>but I wanted to throw this out there knowing many people probably/have or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sitting here now typing with a beautiful set of shiny sonic blue nails that I just love!  </li>
            <li>The application is easy, and my kids really liked being able to use the light and see the polish curing.</li>
            <li>First the good points.  </li>
            <li>I use this, the more comfortable I&#x27;ll become with it and the better</li>
            <li>It last and is beautiful, shiny and only one coat and is perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had gel nails done professionally, and they look great for 3 weeks</li>
            <li>People were saying it chips too easily</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy and affordable to go to.</li>
            <li>Removing the gelnamel is a bit longer a process as you have to sit with acetone polish remover on your nails for a while until it peels or chips easily away.  </li>
            <li>It took about an hour before the streakiness went away, and I am left with a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>But a top coat fixes that right away, so it&#x27;s an easy fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I figured it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss</li>
            <li>I got the fuse nailpolishes for christmas but didn&#x27;t have the light or kit</li>
            <li>LED light is 2 pieces that can be taken part.  </li>
            <li>I chose a low rating because it&#x27;s not as great as they advertise.  </li>
            <li>It says to let them set a minute or two (since it&#x27;s self leveling) then use the light to set it.</li>
            <li>I thought I could skimp and use this storebought version of gel nail polish, with a UV light sealer included.</li>
            <li>It comes with a bottle of gelnamel, a LED dryer, a charger (USB adapted), 12 lint free cloths, an orange stick, a file and cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Place finger under LED light and turn on.  </li>
            <li>The light will automatically go out in 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews state that the polish is tacky after curing under the light.  </li>
            <li>Buffing your nails beforehand seems to be an important step as it gives the polish something to cling to.  </li>
            <li>Went on easy and quick.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li>and I was excited.</li>
            <li>The process is easy and kindda fun but don&#x27;t wast your money...</li>
            <li>This is the reason you clean the nail after.  </li>
            <li>It was super easy to apply, the color is so pretty and after following all the instructions and finishing my nails, they looked great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than most other good polishes.</li>
            <li>However, it is worth the price of you&#x27;re looking for skmething quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>and I was super excited to use it.</li>
            <li>LOL I&#x27;ve had pink streaks on my fingernails for weeks now because I can&#x27;t get all the color off.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s cheap, but you&#x27;re better off investing in a better system or just buying regular nail polish!</li>
            <li>AND I make sure to get all oils of my nail before I apply the gel by using straight acetone.</li>
            <li>It lasted 1 week, which is better than regular nail polish, but not as good as the 2 weeks that you get from real gel polish.</li>
            <li>and it worked so so much better and went so much faster than before I knew the acetone trick.  </li>
            <li>This gives you a polished look quickly and you don&#x27;t have to haul stuff everywhere</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve removed plenty of gel manicures before and none have them have been quick, but this took me FOREVER.</li>
            <li>Chips off rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and for any new people to gel polishes</li>
            <li>I love how the gel nails last a long time, cure quickly, and have that great shine.</li>
            <li>The finish is rock hard and the shine is brilliant.</li>
            <li>If you need a nice manicure for a SHORT time, it is good.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>(I used the tip on the package about putting the bowl of acetone in a larger bowl of warm water, it did not help)</li>
            <li>I did my full set and the first nail I did, still sticky.</li>
            <li>It is quick, easy, looks fantastic and last forever.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a cheap product, but regular nail polish lasts so much longer than this stuff!</li>
            <li>The polish is thicker than most SOG brands I&#x27;ve tried, and I only needed one coat to get full coverage.</li>
            <li>The directions are easy, it&#x27;s fast, and the polish dries so fast you don&#x27;t have to worry about it smudging.  </li>
            <li>Before I tried it, I watched a few YouTube tutorials to make sure there wasn&#x27;t anything more I should do.</li>
            <li>Wipe very gently and don&#x27;t be alarmed that a smidgen of polish comes off on the pad.  </li>
            <li>If you follow the directions exactly then it&#x27;ll wear as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will last a lot longer on those nails.</li>
            <li>The product works exactly like it says it does.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions exactly, don&#x27;t skip steps.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying an at home gel kit.</li>
            <li>The only way I&#x27;ve been able to avoid chipping is with acrylic nails, which I am incapable of doing by myself</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the various brands and have mostly been using harmony gelish.</li>
            <li>Fuse may be cheaper and quicker than standard gel, but you&#x27;ll have to do your nails more often, so in the end</li>
            <li>First of all, the color looked nothing like the bottle.</li>
            <li>I can be done in 10 minutes (I use a bigger LED light) and if one chips, I can fix it really quickly.</li>
            <li>I had to soak the first hand for 30 minutes before I was able to gently scrape it off, and even then I still had lots of residue left over.</li>
            <li>, I get the same effect without damaging my real nails and save more money.</li>
            <li>The light packs a powerful punch despite its tiny casing.</li>
            <li>It goes on quick and easy (although a little streaky) and dries to quickly.</li>
            <li>After a quick buff and wipe, the color goes right on and cures, no other steps.</li>
            <li>This system is the first I&#x27;ve used that really works.</li>
            <li>I would tell you how long each nail took, but I lost count of how many times they were cured, plus I applied two coats of polish which took longer.  </li>
            <li>I then tried using it with the full Sensational system (primer, base and top coat, curing under the light for 1 minute after each coat, etc).</li>
            <li>I quickly put a single coat on just those tips and processed under the light.  </li>
            <li>i have discovered that it&#x27;s easier to just buff down the existing polish and apply new polish instead.......not ideal and that only works if you are going to a darker color.</li>
            <li>easy enough to put on.</li>
            <li>and unlike regular Polish it drys quickly!</li>
            <li>I will admit I did not have high expectations at first but after trying it out</li>
            <li>So much easier than going for a polish change after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>After going through 6 or 7 - 30 sec cycles in the UV light it was still sticky!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re on the fence about it, you should really give it a try.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle, but it is a bit discouraging.  </li>
            <li>I can see this product being a savior for those who need painted nails fast (prom, dates...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not noticeable and I have to really look to see where it is.  </li>
            <li>Still highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But - mission accomplished</li>
            <li>It also states not to clean the nail if you apply a second layer.</li>
            <li>(They INSTRUCT you not to clean the nail if doing a second coat...</li>
            <li>clean it after the final coat)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this stuff is thick, it&#x27;s NOT that easy to get a really thin coat, but i did my best.  </li>
            <li>Base coat helps keep it for my chemistry on my nail but on other people it stays without anything and is beautiful for them too, they always seem happy about it.</li>
            <li>- I learned that I can do it and am back on Amazon to order a drying light that will hold all five fingers and am happy to find that they are not as expensive as I thought.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to a T and my nail polish chipped within the first day or it completely peeled off in one sheet.</li>
            <li>Still, it is no easier to use than regular polish, and the light does not completely dry it on the first pass (it stays tacky)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new for gel products, I have had gel products done on my professionally but never thought I personally could easily do it myself.</li>
            <li>Because of the light, there is no waiting time for it to dry after applied according to directions.  </li>
            <li>I will go back to the regular 3 step gel polish and use the fuse light to dry for a much more satisfactory result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought it at Walmart for a decent price for a LED lamp, cleanser, battery, and polish all in one.</li>
            <li>I do like the small one finger light however, and will pack it along with me if I need a quick touchup at work.</li>
            <li>I Love mines....takes a little bit longer than going to the shop...</li>
            <li>This kit includes the LED lamp, a bottle of pink nail polish, \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot; (which is just rubbing alcohol), lint free pads, nail file/buffer and cuticule pick.</li>
            <li>It says that it dries the nail in 30 seconds but it took about 5 tries with the light for mine to harden/dry and that was with the thinest of coats.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on any product, but I&#x27;m here to defend this product from the overwhelming amount of negative reviews.</li>
            <li>I use a nail growth formula and a green tea + bamboo strengthener under and on top of the colors.</li>
            <li>Even better about it is after it is done and dried up</li>
            <li>The nail quality was extremely low and the light barely worked.</li>
            <li>Normally I wouldn&#x27;t review something so soon after purchase, but.....</li>
            <li>Being a realitively new product, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll improve in the future, so don&#x27;t give up if the first try lets you down.  </li>
            <li>You can buy the kit(which comes with one polish), plus 4 more polishes for less than that!</li>
            <li>first time i did dishes less than an hour later most nails were visibly chipped</li>
            <li>Later that day I went to a friends house and right</li>
            <li>I bought this kit a few months ago and it is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li>I thought the first time was a fluke, but I took it all off and tried it again and got the same results.</li>
            <li>FIRST one coat is NOT enough, i did three coats</li>
            <li>I followed all the directions exactly how they were given, I even went further and capped my nails with the polish (which is what you are suppose to do with gel polish).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time for pretty nails on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>For 24-48 hours of pretty, I only invested 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Two weeks later, I can say the first application lasted almost 5 days before it all went chippy.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about 3 days more than my usual nailpolish wear.  </li>
            <li>At first my light was broken and I was very upset, but as soon as I contacted the seller they sent me a new one immediately.</li>
            <li>My favorite so far is the sparkling nude color they have (not sure of the name).</li>
            <li>, so I did and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li>So far works as it said it would.</li>
            <li>but I completely agree.</li>
            <li>So much for lasting 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>i buff my nails well, so the surface is etched enough for the gel to adhere really well.</li>
            <li>I have the regular Sensationail gel kit, which works really well.  </li>
            <li>As with any nail products, it takes practice before it looks professional.  </li>
            <li>So I do a few drops on each nail and lightly wipe as per instructed  NADA....</li>
            <li>It is a little time consuming but so worth it!</li>
            <li>Secondly, it chipped off the first nail the SAME day!</li>
            <li>It lasted 4-5 days before any major chips, so can&#x27;t complain about that, but when it was time to come off HOLY COW I have never had soooo much difficulty with removal!!</li>
            <li>I have the normal array of nail polishe and laquer, as well as traditional gel and the gel polish without the need for a lamp.</li>
            <li>Within 20 minutes, I had a full, dried manicure...</li>
            <li>I have used the &amp;#34;Watt&#x27;s Your Color&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Gone Fission&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Na-No Way&amp;#34; and all of them have worked really well, had equal staying power, however the Watt&#x27;s Your Color only needed one coat, as the others needed 3 coats.</li>
            <li>The LED lamp is salon strong, the nail polishes are thick</li>
            <li>My one small complaint is that when you clean your nail off after you cure the polish, it kind of dulls the shine.</li>
            <li>By the end of the second day, three nails had completely fallen off!</li>
            <li>Major bummer.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a high quality nail polish that last without having to over pay a nail salon to do the same job this kit does.</li>
            <li>but at least its free....</li>
            <li>Not 24 hours later, the polish on one nail completely fell off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several DIY gel nail setups and even one professional lamp by OPI.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not for natural nails.</li>
            <li>With regular polishes, no matter how many layers I put on or whether I use a base coat, top coat, or both, they always chip.</li>
            <li>Lasted two weeks on top of my Kiss false nails.  </li>
            <li>And boy was I wrong in thinking that this would become my new favorite</li>
            <li>I had no prior experience with gels, so I read the directions very carefully and followed them exactly.  </li>
            <li>chipped within hours and regular (though the expensive kind) polish remover didn&#x27;t make a dent in taking it off.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy enough, but parts of the polish will peel off in a few hours, while other parts won&#x27;t come off at all.</li>
            <li>coming from me, who always smudges my nails before they can dry completely.)</li>
            <li>the plus side, although it is thin looking, this polish is super shiny, and I imagine that it peeled so easily for the same reason that I have trouble with other polishes, must be my chemistry.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I think this product is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was completely impressed.</li>
            <li> For the best outcome you have to do nails one at a time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this hasn&#x27;t gotten very good reviews.</li>
            <li> within about fifteen minutes the enamel has it&#x27;s beautiful shine again.</li>
            <li> A couple days in and my nails are still flawless, and I love not having to worry about chips or smudges!</li>
            <li> Thought it was a great deal for enamel</li>
            <li> , my nails looked great</li>
            <li> and I am overwhelmingly happy with it.</li>
            <li> If you are unsure if you will be happy with your purchase my recommendation would be save your receipt and return it if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Yes, you get gorgeous nails, so shiny that you can see your reflection nails...</li>
            <li> I reapplied it on Mothers Day, and they looked good that Sunday and Monday.</li>
            <li> Someone commented it&#x27;s good for touch up during travels-</li>
            <li> The concept of being able to get gel nails from the comfort of your home is a great concept.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many great ones.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions, you will get a great result, although I do recommend leaving your nail under the light for two rounds as  opposed to one.</li>
            <li> I had an AMAZING result.</li>
            <li> but this one is so much easier, lasts even longer and looks the best out of all of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own soak-off-gel nails for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> The nice thing is this stuff self levels.  </li>
            <li> This gives a very pretty polish with great shine.  </li>
            <li> They have great colors and for the price it is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> This looks great for 2 days maximum, and then the &amp;#34;gelnamel&amp;#34; peels right off.</li>
            <li> I bought this in store, not on Amazon and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> You can use the top piece to do toes.    </li>
            <li> I thought this &amp;#34;gelnamel&amp;#34; might have more staying power.  </li>
            <li> I cant wait until they start selling more colors.</li>
            <li> Yeah sure.....  </li>
            <li> If you want it to look like it does on the box you will need much more then that.</li>
            <li> I think polish from the dollar store covers better and looks nicer.  </li>
            <li> BUT for the tiny LED and 30 seconds a nail I think it is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> and I still had to push/scrape most of the polish off</li>
            <li> - it would NOT wipe off with a cotton ball as most gel polishes would.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy more colors from this brand and keep testing it out.</li>
            <li> you can do nail art on top of it.</li>
            <li> Better to get them done t the salon.</li>
            <li> the more</li>
            <li> but I wanted to throw this out there knowing many people probably/have or</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sitting here now typing with a beautiful set of shiny sonic blue nails that I just love!  </li>
            <li> The application is easy, and my kids really liked being able to use the light and see the polish curing.</li>
            <li> First the good points.  </li>
            <li> I use this, the more comfortable I&#x27;ll become with it and the better</li>
            <li> It last and is beautiful, shiny and only one coat and is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had gel nails done professionally, and they look great for 3 weeks</li>
            <li> People were saying it chips too easily</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy and affordable to go to.</li>
            <li> Removing the gelnamel is a bit longer a process as you have to sit with acetone polish remover on your nails for a while until it peels or chips easily away.  </li>
            <li> It took about an hour before the streakiness went away, and I am left with a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> But a top coat fixes that right away, so it&#x27;s an easy fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figured it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss</li>
            <li> I got the fuse nailpolishes for christmas but didn&#x27;t have the light or kit</li>
            <li> LED light is 2 pieces that can be taken part.  </li>
            <li> I chose a low rating because it&#x27;s not as great as they advertise.  </li>
            <li> It says to let them set a minute or two (since it&#x27;s self leveling) then use the light to set it.</li>
            <li> I thought I could skimp and use this storebought version of gel nail polish, with a UV light sealer included.</li>
            <li> It comes with a bottle of gelnamel, a LED dryer, a charger (USB adapted), 12 lint free cloths, an orange stick, a file and cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Place finger under LED light and turn on.  </li>
            <li> The light will automatically go out in 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews state that the polish is tacky after curing under the light.  </li>
            <li> Buffing your nails beforehand seems to be an important step as it gives the polish something to cling to.  </li>
            <li> Went on easy and quick.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> and I was excited.</li>
            <li> The process is easy and kindda fun but don&#x27;t wast your money...</li>
            <li> This is the reason you clean the nail after.  </li>
            <li> It was super easy to apply, the color is so pretty and after following all the instructions and finishing my nails, they looked great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than most other good polishes.</li>
            <li> However, it is worth the price of you&#x27;re looking for skmething quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> and I was super excited to use it.</li>
            <li> LOL I&#x27;ve had pink streaks on my fingernails for weeks now because I can&#x27;t get all the color off.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s cheap, but you&#x27;re better off investing in a better system or just buying regular nail polish!</li>
            <li> AND I make sure to get all oils of my nail before I apply the gel by using straight acetone.</li>
            <li> It lasted 1 week, which is better than regular nail polish, but not as good as the 2 weeks that you get from real gel polish.</li>
            <li> and it worked so so much better and went so much faster than before I knew the acetone trick.  </li>
            <li> This gives you a polished look quickly and you don&#x27;t have to haul stuff everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve removed plenty of gel manicures before and none have them have been quick, but this took me FOREVER.</li>
            <li> Chips off rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and for any new people to gel polishes</li>
            <li> I love how the gel nails last a long time, cure quickly, and have that great shine.</li>
            <li> The finish is rock hard and the shine is brilliant.</li>
            <li> If you need a nice manicure for a SHORT time, it is good.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> (I used the tip on the package about putting the bowl of acetone in a larger bowl of warm water, it did not help)</li>
            <li> I did my full set and the first nail I did, still sticky.</li>
            <li> It is quick, easy, looks fantastic and last forever.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a cheap product, but regular nail polish lasts so much longer than this stuff!</li>
            <li> The polish is thicker than most SOG brands I&#x27;ve tried, and I only needed one coat to get full coverage.</li>
            <li> The directions are easy, it&#x27;s fast, and the polish dries so fast you don&#x27;t have to worry about it smudging.  </li>
            <li> Before I tried it, I watched a few YouTube tutorials to make sure there wasn&#x27;t anything more I should do.</li>
            <li> Wipe very gently and don&#x27;t be alarmed that a smidgen of polish comes off on the pad.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the directions exactly then it&#x27;ll wear as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will last a lot longer on those nails.</li>
            <li> The product works exactly like it says it does.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions exactly, don&#x27;t skip steps.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying an at home gel kit.</li>
            <li> The only way I&#x27;ve been able to avoid chipping is with acrylic nails, which I am incapable of doing by myself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the various brands and have mostly been using harmony gelish.</li>
            <li> Fuse may be cheaper and quicker than standard gel, but you&#x27;ll have to do your nails more often, so in the end</li>
            <li> First of all, the color looked nothing like the bottle.</li>
            <li> I can be done in 10 minutes (I use a bigger LED light) and if one chips, I can fix it really quickly.</li>
            <li> I had to soak the first hand for 30 minutes before I was able to gently scrape it off, and even then I still had lots of residue left over.</li>
            <li> , I get the same effect without damaging my real nails and save more money.</li>
            <li> The light packs a powerful punch despite its tiny casing.</li>
            <li> It goes on quick and easy (although a little streaky) and dries to quickly.</li>
            <li> After a quick buff and wipe, the color goes right on and cures, no other steps.</li>
            <li> This system is the first I&#x27;ve used that really works.</li>
            <li> I would tell you how long each nail took, but I lost count of how many times they were cured, plus I applied two coats of polish which took longer.  </li>
            <li> I then tried using it with the full Sensational system (primer, base and top coat, curing under the light for 1 minute after each coat, etc).</li>
            <li> I quickly put a single coat on just those tips and processed under the light.  </li>
            <li> i have discovered that it&#x27;s easier to just buff down the existing polish and apply new polish instead.......not ideal and that only works if you are going to a darker color.</li>
            <li> easy enough to put on.</li>
            <li> and unlike regular Polish it drys quickly!</li>
            <li> I will admit I did not have high expectations at first but after trying it out</li>
            <li> So much easier than going for a polish change after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> After going through 6 or 7 - 30 sec cycles in the UV light it was still sticky!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re on the fence about it, you should really give it a try.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle, but it is a bit discouraging.  </li>
            <li> I can see this product being a savior for those who need painted nails fast (prom, dates...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not noticeable and I have to really look to see where it is.  </li>
            <li> Still highly recommended!</li>
            <li> But - mission accomplished</li>
            <li> It also states not to clean the nail if you apply a second layer.</li>
            <li> (They INSTRUCT you not to clean the nail if doing a second coat...</li>
            <li> clean it after the final coat)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this stuff is thick, it&#x27;s NOT that easy to get a really thin coat, but i did my best.  </li>
            <li> Base coat helps keep it for my chemistry on my nail but on other people it stays without anything and is beautiful for them too, they always seem happy about it.</li>
            <li> - I learned that I can do it and am back on Amazon to order a drying light that will hold all five fingers and am happy to find that they are not as expensive as I thought.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a T and my nail polish chipped within the first day or it completely peeled off in one sheet.</li>
            <li> Still, it is no easier to use than regular polish, and the light does not completely dry it on the first pass (it stays tacky)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new for gel products, I have had gel products done on my professionally but never thought I personally could easily do it myself.</li>
            <li> Because of the light, there is no waiting time for it to dry after applied according to directions.  </li>
            <li> I will go back to the regular 3 step gel polish and use the fuse light to dry for a much more satisfactory result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought it at Walmart for a decent price for a LED lamp, cleanser, battery, and polish all in one.</li>
            <li> I do like the small one finger light however, and will pack it along with me if I need a quick touchup at work.</li>
            <li> I Love mines....takes a little bit longer than going to the shop...</li>
            <li> This kit includes the LED lamp, a bottle of pink nail polish, \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot; (which is just rubbing alcohol), lint free pads, nail file/buffer and cuticule pick.</li>
            <li> It says that it dries the nail in 30 seconds but it took about 5 tries with the light for mine to harden/dry and that was with the thinest of coats.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on any product, but I&#x27;m here to defend this product from the overwhelming amount of negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I use a nail growth formula and a green tea + bamboo strengthener under and on top of the colors.</li>
            <li> Even better about it is after it is done and dried up</li>
            <li> The nail quality was extremely low and the light barely worked.</li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t review something so soon after purchase, but.....</li>
            <li> Being a realitively new product, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll improve in the future, so don&#x27;t give up if the first try lets you down.  </li>
            <li> You can buy the kit(which comes with one polish), plus 4 more polishes for less than that!</li>
            <li> first time i did dishes less than an hour later most nails were visibly chipped</li>
            <li> Later that day I went to a friends house and right</li>
            <li> I bought this kit a few months ago and it is my favorite by far!</li>
            <li> I thought the first time was a fluke, but I took it all off and tried it again and got the same results.</li>
            <li> FIRST one coat is NOT enough, i did three coats</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions exactly how they were given, I even went further and capped my nails with the polish (which is what you are suppose to do with gel polish).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time for pretty nails on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> For 24-48 hours of pretty, I only invested 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later, I can say the first application lasted almost 5 days before it all went chippy.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about 3 days more than my usual nailpolish wear.  </li>
            <li> At first my light was broken and I was very upset, but as soon as I contacted the seller they sent me a new one immediately.</li>
            <li> My favorite so far is the sparkling nude color they have (not sure of the name).</li>
            <li> , so I did and made a huge mess.</li>
            <li> So far works as it said it would.</li>
            <li> but I completely agree.</li>
            <li> So much for lasting 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> i buff my nails well, so the surface is etched enough for the gel to adhere really well.</li>
            <li> I have the regular Sensationail gel kit, which works really well.  </li>
            <li> As with any nail products, it takes practice before it looks professional.  </li>
            <li> So I do a few drops on each nail and lightly wipe as per instructed  NADA....</li>
            <li> It is a little time consuming but so worth it!</li>
            <li> Secondly, it chipped off the first nail the SAME day!</li>
            <li> It lasted 4-5 days before any major chips, so can&#x27;t complain about that, but when it was time to come off HOLY COW I have never had soooo much difficulty with removal!!</li>
            <li> I have the normal array of nail polishe and laquer, as well as traditional gel and the gel polish without the need for a lamp.</li>
            <li> Within 20 minutes, I had a full, dried manicure...</li>
            <li> I have used the &amp;#34;Watt&#x27;s Your Color&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Gone Fission&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Na-No Way&amp;#34; and all of them have worked really well, had equal staying power, however the Watt&#x27;s Your Color only needed one coat, as the others needed 3 coats.</li>
            <li> The LED lamp is salon strong, the nail polishes are thick</li>
            <li> My one small complaint is that when you clean your nail off after you cure the polish, it kind of dulls the shine.</li>
            <li> By the end of the second day, three nails had completely fallen off!</li>
            <li> Major bummer.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a high quality nail polish that last without having to over pay a nail salon to do the same job this kit does.</li>
            <li> but at least its free....</li>
            <li> Not 24 hours later, the polish on one nail completely fell off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several DIY gel nail setups and even one professional lamp by OPI.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not for natural nails.</li>
            <li> With regular polishes, no matter how many layers I put on or whether I use a base coat, top coat, or both, they always chip.</li>
            <li> Lasted two weeks on top of my Kiss false nails.  </li>
            <li> And boy was I wrong in thinking that this would become my new favorite</li>
            <li> I had no prior experience with gels, so I read the directions very carefully and followed them exactly.  </li>
            <li> chipped within hours and regular (though the expensive kind) polish remover didn&#x27;t make a dent in taking it off.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy enough, but parts of the polish will peel off in a few hours, while other parts won&#x27;t come off at all.</li>
            <li> coming from me, who always smudges my nails before they can dry completely.)</li>
            <li> the plus side, although it is thin looking, this polish is super shiny, and I imagine that it peeled so easily for the same reason that I have trouble with other polishes, must be my chemistry.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how it wears just yet, but if the above is any indicator it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint there is the glitter coat hasn&#x27;t bounced back in shine level as much as the original pink color did and still looks slightly dull...</li>
            <li> I looked down at my nails literally the next day and maybe 7/10 of my nails were wither chipped off partially or completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously I don&#x27;t know how long this will last realistically.</li>
            <li> tried two different colors to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a bad polish - a traditional red and a white-pink sparkly one.</li>
            <li> I took the time to properly prepare my nails and then applied a very thin coat of the &amp;#34;gelnamel&amp;#34; to one nail and treated it under the light.  </li>
            <li> I have read a bunch of bad reviews on this product, but it honestly is up to trial and error.  </li>
            <li> The lamp is programmed to shine for only 30 sec, and then it turns off.  </li>
            <li> When used as directed, there is absolutely no advantage to this polish over regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> (It dulls after the final &#x27;cleaning&#x27;.....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They seem to be lasting me just as long as my other gel colors, so you can count me a fan.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I just spent over TWO HOURS trying to get this polish off of my fingernails!</li>
            <li> The finished product was still very thin, it looked like I had on a single coat of cheap polish.  </li>
            <li> well, almost dry.  </li>
            <li> By the time I got home that evening 7 of my nails were polish free as the &amp;#34;gelnamel&amp;#34; had peeled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed the polish, which was a difficult process, but that was expected.  </li>
            <li> However, the product does not live up to it&#x27;s name, and so it receives two stars.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using the red carpet nails kit and it took me so long to do my nails (over an hour)</li>
            <li> so it is no more convenient, and when you are finished it is a thin product that you can still see your nails through, while two coats of regular polish more than cover in less time for less money.</li>
            <li> so she doesn&#x27;t have to wait for them to dry!</li>
            <li> so I was assuming it would be pretty expensive, but it was only $12.</li>
            <li> that peel off in big pieces in a day, sometimes less.  </li>
            <li> It lasts less time than traditional nail polish.</li>
            <li> Still, it beats having to do a base and top coat!</li>
            <li> Even though I followed the instructions and applied as thin of a layer as possible (the polish is super thick)</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very closely and still had a poor result.</li>
            <li> It begins to wear thin after only one day(I used 2coats) , and by 2nd or 3rd day it chips!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money in salons to avoid chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used polishes from Nars, OPI, and Formula X (Sephora brand) to N.Y.C., Rimmel London, and other drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I did some research on it, and from the Fuse website, it states that it will be tacky due to the moisture released while curing.  </li>
            <li> The Fuse website goes against applying a base coat due to the gelnamel having it in it already, including a top coat.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I followed the application directions explicitly - half the polish chipped within 2 days, the other half has been on for over a month, despite me trying to remove it with everything but a sandblaster.</li>
            <li> Typically when I paint my nails within 2 - 3 days the polish begins peeling off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second coat, three zaps, still a mess....</li>
            <li> By day two half my pinky was missing polish.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this little guy at the drugstore and just as previous reviewers commented, it starts to chip and peel within a few days...</li>
            <li> While it feels a little time consuming doing just one nail at a time, the benefits are unreal (</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> ever again it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Probably worse than regular polish.</li>
            <li> I have had this polish for a week and have probably re painted everyday</li>
            <li> I can also do my daughter&#x27;s toenails in a few minutes</li>
            <li> This makes it a messy experience.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a HUGE investment, so</li>
            <li> I mean less than $15</li>
            <li> BUT what a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I tried removing with acetone as directed, but after soaking for more than 20 minutes, my nails were horribly damaged and this stuff didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> I wish I could return it, what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> When I woke up this morning, I did have one itty bitty chip peel off my nail, but it is so small</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m left with badly stained and very rough nails and a crappy gel light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now here&#x27;s a slight issue they want a thin coat</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fathom why it has any negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Granted, I wasn&#x27;t expecting salon quality that lasts 2-3 weeks, but I was hoping for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> If the review is negative it&#x27;s probably because they did not read the directions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a nail polish junkie lately and decided to take the plunge and try gel.</li>
            <li> These polishes are quite thick and they level off after you apply them.</li>
            <li> I hate that I now have a lamp I can&#x27;t do much with, maybe I&#x27;ll give it away...</li>
            <li> It was not the easiest to apply - the polish is thick, hard it&#x27;s really hard to apply thin coats, and you could still see through my nail tips after 2 or 3 coats.</li>
            <li> For me I have to have a base coat because no nail polish with my chemistry will stay without a base coat or the whole clear nail will come off all in one.</li>
            <li> This has been the case with expensive &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; nail polish on down to the 99cent polish.  </li>
            <li> $40 for acrylics is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a do-it-yourself-er that failed miserably at acrylic nails, so I wanted to give gel a try without wasting a lot more money.  </li>
            <li> Considering the amount of time and damage to natural nails required by soaking in acetone to remove,  this product is a very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> It is thick, and applying a thin layer with a gelly substance is always difficult, but after a few nails it became easier.</li>
            <li> in conclusion, don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews!</li>
            <li> The polish is thick!</li>
            <li> I used to be the person who always got acrylics because my nails were thin</li>
            <li> nails with a thin layer of polish  </li>
            <li> Again I did three coats, which still looked thin.  </li>
            <li> My nails are streaky and thinly covered.  </li>
            <li> (By the way, the white-pink sparkly one looked considerably worse applied than it did in the bottle.)</li>
            <li> Apply a thin layer of gelnamel.  </li>
            <li> seriously!</li>
            <li> During the curing, you will feel some heat and a weird sensation as the polish dries, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say that taking the polish off can be tedious.</li>
            <li> I found the gelnamel a bit difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> This product is very falsely reviewed in my opinion.</li>
            <li> OMG this is the worst product I have purchased in a very long time!</li>
            <li> Worst nail product I&#x27;ve ever wasted money on!</li>
            <li> for the BAD points.  </li>
            <li> To bad I didn&#x27;t read all the reviews before I bought this.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I too tried this &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; and am totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> (My job is brutal on my polish)</li>
            <li> and I hated it.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So mad at myself for buying three colors along with the starter kit!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I Love mines....takes a little bit longer than going to the shop...but at least its free....and unlike regular Polish it drys quickly!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Kroger for $5.99 on clearance. I was hoping for a product that would last on my nails for a week or so. However, I did not get it with this kit! I followed the instructions very closely and still had a poor result. Not 24 hours later, the polish on one nail completely fell off. By the end of the second day, three nails had completely fallen off! Sure, it&#x27;s a cheap product, but regular nail polish lasts so much longer than this stuff! Yes, it&#x27;s cheap, but you&#x27;re better off investing in a better system or just buying regular nail polish!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product. I have the normal array of nail polishe and laquer, as well as traditional gel and the gel polish without the need for a lamp. I think this product is AWESOME. It is quite resistant to chipping and peeling. If you follow the directions exactly then it&#x27;ll wear as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> So far works as it said it would. Went on easy and quick. I bought from local store not amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this in store, not on Amazon and LOVE it. I saw it at Walmart and there was no price so I was assuming it would be pretty expensive, but it was only $12. If you follow the instructions, you will get a great result, although I do recommend leaving your nail under the light for two rounds as  opposed to one. I had an AMAZING result. Not to mention the polish itself is only $5 after you buy the kit. It&#x27;s cheaper than most other good polishes. I used to be the person who always got acrylics because my nails were thin and I&#x27;d bite or rip them off, with this, I get the same effect without damaging my real nails and save more money. $40 for acrylics is ridiculous. You can buy the kit(which comes with one polish), plus 4 more polishes for less than that! It is a little time consuming but so worth it!</li>
            <li> great! everything worked</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! I can&#x27;t fathom why it has any negative reviews. It is quick, easy, looks fantastic and last forever. So much easier than going for a polish change after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> First the good points.  This gives a very pretty polish with great shine.  Because of the light, there is no waiting time for it to dry after applied according to directions.  If you need a nice manicure for a SHORT time, it is good.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the BAD points.  It begins to wear thin after only one day(I used 2coats) , and by 2nd or 3rd day it chips!  Considering the amount of time and damage to natural nails required by soaking in acetone to remove,  this product is a very disappointing purchase. I will go back to the regular 3 step gel polish and use the fuse light to dry for a much more satisfactory result.&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend &amp;#34;Fuse&amp;#34; polish.  Save your money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this hasn&#x27;t gotten very good reviews. I really like this kit! I had previously been using the red carpet nails kit and it took me so long to do my nails (over an hour) and I hated it. I got the fuse nailpolishes for christmas but didn&#x27;t have the light or kit so I bought it on here. At first my light was broken and I was very upset, but as soon as I contacted the seller they sent me a new one immediately. It goes on quick and easy (although a little streaky) and dries to quickly. I have no complaints. People were saying it chips too easily but I completely agree. I actually tried taking it off and found that it wouldn&#x27;t come off of my nails! LOL I&#x27;ve had pink streaks on my fingernails for weeks now because I can&#x27;t get all the color off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several DIY gel nail setups and even one professional lamp by OPI. The polish never cured properly for me. This system is the first I&#x27;ve used that really works. They are cured within 30 seconds. If you need another coat you can apply and recure prior to cleaning. The light packs a powerful punch despite its tiny casing. The finish is rock hard and the shine is brilliant. My favorite so far is the sparkling nude color they have (not sure of the name). This product is very falsely reviewed in my opinion. 5 stars all the way</li>
            <li> bought at walmart. easy enough to put on. first time i did dishes less than an hour later most nails were visibly chipped</li>
            <li> This kit includes the LED lamp, a bottle of pink nail polish, \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot; (which is just rubbing alcohol), lint free pads, nail file/buffer and cuticule pick. There is NO remover included in this kit; the directions recommend soaking nails in 100% acetone.  The directions are simple:    -Push back cuticules  -Buff nails with file  -Remove any oil, lotions, etc, using the cleanser  -Cover nails with a thin layer of polish  -Cure under the LED lamp by placing finger nail in the groove under the bulb.  The lamp is programmed to shine for only 30 sec, and then it turns off.  During the curing, you will feel some heat and a weird sensation as the polish dries, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  -Cleanse nail again to remove excess polish  -Repeat with rest of nails  -The LED light is 2 pieces that can be taken part.  You can use the top piece to do toes.    The directions are easy, it&#x27;s fast, and the polish dries so fast you don&#x27;t have to worry about it smudging.  BUT what a waste of money!  Yes, you get gorgeous nails, so shiny that you can see your reflection nails... that peel off in big pieces in a day, sometimes less.  I was so disappointed.  I even tried different brands of polish, like Sally Hansen, only to have the same result.  They chip and peel off.  So much for lasting 2 weeks. Granted, I wasn&#x27;t expecting salon quality that lasts 2-3 weeks, but I was hoping for at least a week.  A day is just pathetic. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Fuse starter kit because I was looking for a nail polish that would last a while.  Typically when I paint my nails within 2 - 3 days the polish begins peeling off. This has been the case with expensive &amp;#34;high quality&amp;#34; nail polish on down to the 99cent polish.  I thought this &amp;#34;gelnamel&amp;#34; might have more staying power.  It does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions and waited until I had plenty of time to devote to my manicure.  I took the time to properly prepare my nails and then applied a very thin coat of the &amp;#34;gelnamel&amp;#34; to one nail and treated it under the light.  I repeated this with each nail for a total of 3 coats.  The finished product was still very thin, it looked like I had on a single coat of cheap polish.  The next morning when I got out of the shower the tips of three of my nails had peeled.  I quickly put a single coat on just those tips and processed under the light.  By the time I got home that evening 7 of my nails were polish free as the &amp;#34;gelnamel&amp;#34; had peeled off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed the polish, which was a difficult process, but that was expected.  I then re-read the directions and tried it again.  This time I put a thin layer on each nail on one hand and then processed each under the light twice.  Again I did three coats, which still looked thin.  This time it lasted 3 days before it began peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, although it is thin looking, this polish is super shiny, and I imagine that it peeled so easily for the same reason that I have trouble with other polishes, must be my chemistry.  Still, it is no easier to use than regular polish, and the light does not completely dry it on the first pass (it stays tacky) so it is no more convenient, and when you are finished it is a thin product that you can still see your nails through, while two coats of regular polish more than cover in less time for less money.</li>
            <li> I filed my nails and then applied 3 coats... Like the instructions said. The polish popped off the next morning!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted long lasting nail polish that would not chip in the first few days. I followed the instructions to a T and my nail polish chipped within the first day or it completely peeled off in one sheet. I have tried different methods and the same thing happened. It says that it dries the nail in 30 seconds but it took about 5 tries with the light for mine to harden/dry and that was with the thinest of coats. I would not by this product ever again it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit a few months ago and it is my favorite by far! I have used various different gel nail kits (Sensationail, Gelish, CND, IBD, etc) and I&#x27;m still a fan of them but this one is so much easier, lasts even longer and looks the best out of all of them. I cant wait until they start selling more colors. I follow the directions to the T AND I make sure to get all oils of my nail before I apply the gel by using straight acetone. i buff my nails well, so the surface is etched enough for the gel to adhere really well. My nails lasted two weeks with NO CHIPPING! seriously! I have used the &amp;#34;Watt&#x27;s Your Color&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Gone Fission&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Na-No Way&amp;#34; and all of them have worked really well, had equal staying power, however the Watt&#x27;s Your Color only needed one coat, as the others needed 3 coats. Still, it beats having to do a base and top coat! These polishes are quite thick and they level off after you apply them. I do have to say that taking the polish off can be tedious. i have discovered that it&#x27;s easier to just buff down the existing polish and apply new polish instead.......not ideal and that only works if you are going to a darker color.</li>
            <li> I too tried this &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; and am totally disappointed. I thought the first time was a fluke, but I took it all off and tried it again and got the same results. I reapplied it on Mothers Day, and they looked good that Sunday and Monday. By Tuesday the polish had already started peeling and today it looks like hamsters have been chewing on my fingers :P. I am pretty sure I will not be buying this again. I hate that I now have a lamp I can&#x27;t do much with, maybe I&#x27;ll give it away...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great concept, but improvements are definately needed.</li>
            <li> I chose a low rating because it&#x27;s not as great as they advertise.  They claim one coat is enough. Yeah sure.....  If you want it to look like it does on the box you will need much more then that. Two coats still left my nails visible underneath. They also look streaky. It says to let them set a minute or two (since it&#x27;s self leveling) then use the light to set it. Once again that didn&#x27;t work. My nails are streaky and thinly covered.  I think polish from the dollar store covers better and looks nicer.  I can&#x27;t say how it wears just yet, but if the above is any indicator it won&#x27;t last long. To bad I didn&#x27;t read all the reviews before I bought this. Now to try and get my money back!</li>
            <li> This polish is not salon manicure grade...BUT for the tiny LED and 30 seconds a nail I think it is perfect for travel. Who has time to touch up nail polish on vacation? This gives you a polished look quickly and you don&#x27;t have to haul stuff everywhere and you can touch things in 30 seconds. I haven&#x27;t done it on my toes yet but I&#x27;m sure it will last a lot longer on those nails.</li>
            <li> FIRST one coat is NOT enough, i did three coats and I can still see through to the nail in some places. Secondly, it chipped off the first nail the SAME day! I&#x27;ve had it on like four days and my nails look terrible. So mad at myself for buying three colors along with the starter kit!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had gel nails done professionally, and they look great for 3 weeks but they cost $35 a go. I thought I could skimp and use this storebought version of gel nail polish, with a UV light sealer included. No. This looks great for 2 days maximum, and then the &amp;#34;gelnamel&amp;#34; peels right off. It lasts less time than traditional nail polish. No, it doesn&#x27;t chip, but what&#x27;s the difference if it peels off in two days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried two different colors to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a bad polish - a traditional red and a white-pink sparkly one. (By the way, the white-pink sparkly one looked considerably worse applied than it did in the bottle.) Nope, they both did the same thing. What a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money! By the second day all my nails had chiped!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It goes on easy enough, but parts of the polish will peel off in a few hours, while other parts won&#x27;t come off at all. I tried removing with acetone as directed, but after soaking for more than 20 minutes, my nails were horribly damaged and this stuff didn&#x27;t budge. I had to file it off. This is definitely not for natural nails.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. It was super easy to apply, the color is so pretty and after following all the instructions and finishing my nails, they looked great. Until the next day. I had chipped polish within 24 hours. Major bummer. By day two half my pinky was missing polish.  So of course I had to remove it at the point, what a pain. I&#x27;ve removed plenty of gel manicures before and none have them have been quick, but this took me FOREVER. I had to soak the first hand for 30 minutes before I was able to gently scrape it off, and even then I still had lots of residue left over. (I used the tip on the package about putting the bowl of acetone in a larger bowl of warm water, it did not help) After the initial chipping I had planned on giving it another shot, I&#x27;m not above thinking I could have made an error during application, however after the difficulty removing it, I don&#x27;t think I will be using this again.</li>
            <li> The concept of being able to get gel nails from the comfort of your home is a great concept. However, the product does not live up to it&#x27;s name, and so it receives two stars. The application is easy, and my kids really liked being able to use the light and see the polish curing. BUT the polish didn&#x27;t last a day. We had a nail painting party, and bought this kit with three additional colors. Everyone read the directions, and everyone&#x27;s polish was peeling off in sheets before 24 hours was even up. For the time it takes to do this, I would not recommend. I&#x27;ll be looking for a different product.</li>
            <li> Probably worse than regular polish. I looked down at my nails literally the next day and maybe 7/10 of my nails were wither chipped off partially or completely.</li>
            <li> Purchased this polish with excitement. Thought it was a great deal for enamel but like everyone else has said it does not last but for a day or two sometimes shorter. .. I have had this polish for a week and have probably re painted everyday</li>
            <li> The product works exactly like it says it does.  Lasted two weeks on top of my Kiss false nails.  Very happy with this purchase.  Follow the directions exactly, don&#x27;t skip steps.</li>
            <li> I got the starter kit from Walgreens and I was super excited to use it. I followed all the directions exactly how they were given, I even went further and capped my nails with the polish (which is what you are suppose to do with gel polish). Anyway, it took a while but finally I finished, my nails looked great and I was excited. Later that day I went to a friends house and right after I got there the polish peeled off of one of my nails!&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve tried to use this polish again to see if I got a different result but the same thing happened, so I have given up on this polish and switched to Sensationail, by Nailene and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a high quality nail polish that last without having to over pay a nail salon to do the same job this kit does. If the review is negative it&#x27;s probably because they did not read the directions. I purchased this kit at the store and I am overwhelmingly happy with it. I will admit I did not have high expectations at first but after trying it out I was completely impressed. The LED lamp is salon strong, the nail polishes are thick but then again its GEL and if applied correctly according to the instructions their should not be any issues. No, the kit does not come with remover because if you go to nail salon they will also use acetone to remove gel from nails as directed in the instructions. They have great colors and for the price it is completely worth it. If you are unsure if you will be happy with your purchase my recommendation would be save your receipt and return it if you don&#x27;t like it. BTW.....I have had the nail polish on for 5 days and have not had one chip after typing all day at work, washing dishes, etc. ;)</li>
            <li> I have the regular Sensationail gel kit, which works really well.  This one does not.  I did my nails about 3 hours ago.  Already, 3 have come off.  I followed the directions, which are simple.  This simply does not work.  I would recommend taking the time and money for the regular Sensaitonail gel manicure.</li>
            <li> OMG this is the worst product I have purchased in a very long time! Even though I followed the instructions and applied as thin of a layer as possible (the polish is super thick) it never cured! After going through 6 or 7 - 30 sec cycles in the UV light it was still sticky! I though it was because I still needed to apply the cleanser, so I did and made a huge mess. I wish I could return it, what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on any product, but I&#x27;m here to defend this product from the overwhelming amount of negative reviews. I bought this product in store, not on Amazon. This is my first time trying an at home gel kit. I&#x27;ve used polishes from Nars, OPI, and Formula X (Sephora brand) to N.Y.C., Rimmel London, and other drug store brands. With regular polishes, no matter how many layers I put on or whether I use a base coat, top coat, or both, they always chip. Always. I&#x27;ve even gotten gel manicures at salons and they&#x27;ve chipped. The only way I&#x27;ve been able to avoid chipping is with acrylic nails, which I am incapable of doing by myself so I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money in salons to avoid chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is what led me to try this. I can&#x27;t afford any of the $50 UV lamps, so when I say this one for $12, I was beyond sold. While it feels a little time consuming doing just one nail at a time, the benefits are unreal (esp. coming from me, who always smudges my nails before they can dry completely.) A couple days in and my nails are still flawless, and I love not having to worry about chips or smudges! My one small complaint is that when you clean your nail off after you cure the polish, it kind of dulls the shine. But a top coat fixes that right away, so it&#x27;s an easy fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews! It&#x27;s not a HUGE investment, so if you&#x27;re on the fence about it, you should really give it a try.</li>
            <li> I picked this kit up at walmart. It was not the easiest to apply - the polish is thick, hard it&#x27;s really hard to apply thin coats, and you could still see through my nail tips after 2 or 3 coats. I cured for 3 cycles per nail and the polish was still tacky. It lasted 4-5 days before any major chips, so can&#x27;t complain about that, but when it was time to come off HOLY COW I have never had soooo much difficulty with removal!! It took an hour or so to soak it off in 100% acetone and I still had to push/scrape most of the polish off - it would NOT wipe off with a cotton ball as most gel polishes would. It also left some stain on my nails. Overall I will be ditching this kit and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing my own soak-off-gel nails for about 6 months. I&#x27;ve tried all the various brands and have mostly been using harmony gelish. I love how the gel nails last a long time, cure quickly, and have that great shine. My big gripe is that the various layers end up taking forever. This is why the fuse polish rocks! After a quick buff and wipe, the color goes right on and cures, no other steps. I can be done in 10 minutes (I use a bigger LED light) and if one chips, I can fix it really quickly. The polish is thicker than most SOG brands I&#x27;ve tried, and I only needed one coat to get full coverage. They seem to be lasting me just as long as my other gel colors, so you can count me a fan. I can also do my daughter&#x27;s toenails in a few minutes so she doesn&#x27;t have to wait for them to dry!</li>
            <li> Worst nail product I&#x27;ve ever wasted money on! I&#x27;ve become a nail polish junkie lately and decided to take the plunge and try gel. I mean less than $15 and you get the lamp? No chipping? (My job is brutal on my polish) I was sold. And boy was I wrong in thinking that this would become my new favorite product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It chipped within hours and regular (though the expensive kind) polish remover didn&#x27;t make a dent in taking it off. In fact, it made it shinier! Long story short, I just spent over TWO HOURS trying to get this polish off of my fingernails! And that&#x27;s using a remover specifically for gel nails. Now I&#x27;m left with badly stained and very rough nails and a crappy gel light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely dissapointed in this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tomboy. I don&#x27;t have time for pretty nails on a regular basis. I do like to dress up now and then, and that&#x27;s when I use this polish. I cure each nail twice for a total of 60 seconds. It takes about 15 minutes, double that if I do a second coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At midnight my coach turns back into a pumpkin, and I go back to using my nails for screwdrivers, so I don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s chipping off in the morning. It&#x27;s a snap to take off compared to the mangling my nails suffer from a salon soak-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it&#x27;s a trade off that works for me. For 24-48 hours of pretty, I only invested 30 minutes. A salon mani with gel takes 2 hours plus travel time, and it realistically lasts about a week, not two. That&#x27;s not even taking the cost of the salon mani into account.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured! Thank you!</li>
            <li> When used as directed, there is absolutely no advantage to this polish over regular nail polish. It chips within 1 day. I then tried using it with the full Sensational system (primer, base and top coat, curing under the light for 1 minute after each coat, etc). It lasted 1 week, which is better than regular nail polish, but not as good as the 2 weeks that you get from real gel polish. Fuse may be cheaper and quicker than standard gel, but you&#x27;ll have to do your nails more often, so in the end it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> First of all, the color looked nothing like the bottle. I followed the application directions explicitly - half the polish chipped within 2 days, the other half has been on for over a month, despite me trying to remove it with everything but a sandblaster. So upset with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new for gel products, I have had gel products done on my professionally but never thought I personally could easily do it myself. I bought it at Walmart for a decent price for a LED lamp, cleanser, battery, and polish all in one. It last and is beautiful, shiny and only one coat and is perfect. For me I have to have a base coat because no nail polish with my chemistry will stay without a base coat or the whole clear nail will come off all in one. Base coat helps keep it for my chemistry on my nail but on other people it stays without anything and is beautiful for them too, they always seem happy about it. I plan to buy more colors from this brand and keep testing it out. I use a nail growth formula and a green tea + bamboo strengthener under and on top of the colors. Even better about it is after it is done and dried up you can do nail art on top of it. I love this brand and for any new people to gel polishes it&#x27;s easy and affordable to go to.</li>
            <li> Purchased this little guy at the drugstore and just as previous reviewers commented, it starts to chip and peel within a few days... I tried it again a week later and same thing happened. The process is easy and kindda fun but don&#x27;t wast your money... Someone commented it&#x27;s good for touch up during travels- that&#x27;s probably what I will be using mine for.... Better to get them done t the salon.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit and was very disappointed. The nail quality was extremely low and the light barely worked. Very overall low quality.</li>
            <li> I picked up my Fuse kit at a Kroger for $12.  It comes with a bottle of gelnamel, a LED dryer, a charger (USB adapted), 12 lint free cloths, an orange stick, a file and cleaner.  The instructions are simple: 1.  Buff and apply cleanser to nails, push back cuticles.  2.  Apply a thin layer of gelnamel.  3.  Place finger under LED light and turn on.  The light will automatically go out in 30 seconds.  4.  Remove finger and apply cleaner again.  Before I tried it, I watched a few YouTube tutorials to make sure there wasn&#x27;t anything more I should do. Within 20 minutes, I had a full, dried manicure...well, almost dry.  It took an additional 10 minutes before I could click my nails together. I have read a bunch of bad reviews on this product, but it honestly is up to trial and error.  I have a feeling the more I use this, the more comfortable I&#x27;ll become with it and the better I&#x27;ll get.  Some reviews state that the polish is tacky after curing under the light.  I did some research on it, and from the Fuse website, it states that it will be tacky due to the moisture released while curing.  This is the reason you clean the nail after.  It also states not to clean the nail if you apply a second layer. I found the gelnamel a bit difficult to apply.  It is thick, and applying a thin layer with a gelly substance is always difficult, but after a few nails it became easier. Buffing your nails beforehand seems to be an important step as it gives the polish something to cling to.  The Fuse website goes against applying a base coat due to the gelnamel having it in it already, including a top coat. It took about an hour before the streakiness went away, and I am left with a beautiful shine. I have rated this product 3 stars for two reasons.  1.  For the best outcome you have to do nails one at a time.  This isn&#x27;t too much of a hassle, but it is a bit discouraging.  2.  The polish is thick! I&#x27;m used to painting and covering my nails in 3 strokes only.  With this, I found myself takinga couple of dozen strokes to the nail before it was covered.  This makes it a messy experience. However, it is worth the price of you&#x27;re looking for skmething quick and easy.  I can see this product being a savior for those who need painted nails fast (prom, dates...etc). When I woke up this morning, I did have one itty bitty chip peel off my nail, but it is so small it&#x27;s not noticeable and I have to really look to see where it is.  Being a realitively new product, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll improve in the future, so don&#x27;t give up if the first try lets you down.  As with any nail products, it takes practice before it looks professional.  Edit: Two weeks later, I can say the first application lasted almost 5 days before it all went chippy.  That&#x27;s about 3 days more than my usual nailpolish wear.  I have just applied my second painting and did find it easier since I knew what to expect.  Removing the gelnamel is a bit longer a process as you have to sit with acetone polish remover on your nails for a while until it peels or chips easily away.  I added a star because of the ease of applying and the lasting of the polish itself.  Still highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a do-it-yourself-er that failed miserably at acrylic nails, so I wanted to give gel a try without wasting a lot more money.  I had no prior experience with gels, so I read the directions very carefully and followed them exactly.  I&#x27;m sitting here now typing with a beautiful set of shiny sonic blue nails that I just love!  I&#x27;ll admit that it did take a lot of coaxing to get the gel to set.  But I was mindlessly watching TV, so I would just reinsert each nail until I felt it was ready to be wiped with cleanser.  Wipe very gently and don&#x27;t be alarmed that a smidgen of polish comes off on the pad.  I would tell you how long each nail took, but I lost count of how many times they were cured, plus I applied two coats of polish which took longer.  But - mission accomplished - I learned that I can do it and am back on Amazon to order a drying light that will hold all five fingers and am happy to find that they are not as expensive as I thought. I do like the small one finger light however, and will pack it along with me if I need a quick touchup at work.</li>
            <li> Normally I wouldn&#x27;t review something so soon after purchase, but.....I&#x27;ll explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier today I was at the store needing some polish for a formal dinner, when this kit, which I&#x27;ve never seen before caught my eye.  I&#x27;ve never tried gel polish but have always been intrigued, I just never wanted to pay 50+ for a kit.  So when I saw this for 12.99 at target I figured it wasn&#x27;t a huge loss if it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came home, read the instructions and looked at reviews, and kicked myself.  There aren&#x27;t many great ones.  But I figured I&#x27;d give it a whirl anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followed the directions, pushed cuticles back, buffed the nail, cleaned...painted....now here&#x27;s a slight issue they want a thin coat, this stuff is thick, it&#x27;s NOT that easy to get a really thin coat, but i did my best.  The nice thing is this stuff self levels.  So if you have streaks just wait a minute before putting your finger in the lamp, it&#x27;ll level out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;put my finger in and zapped it.  No difference....I zapped them three times....still sticky.....I did my full set and the first nail I did, still sticky. (They INSTRUCT you not to clean the nail if doing a second coat...clean it after the final coat)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UGH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second coat, three zaps, still a mess....but maybe it has to do with the cleaner?  So I do a few drops on each nail and lightly wipe as per instructed  NADA....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sit rotating my nails in the UV lamp for an HOUR..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTHING Still sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give up....I grab my acetone and pour a bunch on a napkin and scrub one hand. pull the napkin away and.............Everything has miraculously hardened....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do it on my next hand.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard again....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And within about fifteen minutes the enamel has it&#x27;s beautiful shine again. (It dulls after the final &#x27;cleaning&#x27;.....)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went on and I did a coat of glitter as well...and it worked so so much better and went so much faster than before I knew the acetone trick.  My only complaint there is the glitter coat hasn&#x27;t bounced back in shine level as much as the original pink color did and still looks slightly dull...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I don&#x27;t know how long this will last realistically. but I wanted to throw this out there knowing many people probably/have or will experience the same frustration I did...</li>
            <li> Chips off rather quickly. I&#x27;ve tried it twice and only made it 4 days both times. A and then can&#x27;t get it off even after soaking.</li>
