    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think the best way to go.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>I seek medium volume because that makes the mascara perfect for day or night.</li>
            <li>Great!  </li>
            <li>The brush forms to your eyelashes perfectly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone who desires beautiful eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I was really happy within a week</li>
            <li>For all the great value it represents I would like to rate this mascara FIVE STARS</li>
            <li>I was happy with how the brush flared my lashes and separated, plus I did get what I would call a medium rating when it comes to volume.</li>
            <li>and I did see what I call great “lash health”.</li>
            <li>but happy there is a remdy.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>I loved the ease of applying the mascara to my lashes and also it looked amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been using the mascara for about 5 weeks and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Great mascara, clump free look that gives falsies effect, doesn&#x27;t flake, very moist and the best part is that it grows lashes and make them thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>is really nice.</li>
            <li>but I think it is healthy for your lashes and looks good.</li>
            <li>The product does build up nicely and you don’t get that “spider look”</li>
            <li>It’s very easy to remove.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara and lash treatment all in one tube out there.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara i have EVER used.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara i have EVER used.</li>
            <li>EnvyDerm uses Moroccan Argan oil, vitamins, amino acids and just a more suitable and nourishing formula.</li>
            <li>It curls my lashes upwards for a beautiful bright open eye.  </li>
            <li>i wish the wand wasnt&#x27; so flexible, but love the mascara</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I just haven&#x27;t had the chance to buy any more serum.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this mascara is removing it-</li>
            <li>I am hoping that over time the conditioning property  that is advertised as integral to this product will enhance my eyelashes so that even without using Envyderm mascara, my lashes will look noticeably better.</li>
            <li>I received this item for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>EnvyDerm enhances your lashes by making them look better, longer, and strengthening.</li>
            <li>, my lashes tended to never fall (shed) or break, they just remained healthy and even stronger with time and this was just using one oil.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I like to apply the mascara to both sides of the top eyelashes for a more pronounced look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will receive a .27 fl-oz mascara in a cute silver tube.</li>
            <li>On normal days, I experienced zero flaking or smudging.</li>
            <li>The color was a nice pigmented black, which looked beautiful but also highlighted the eye area nicely.</li>
            <li>It goes on quite easy - I love the wand.</li>
            <li>Just FYI , I love how the ingredients are organic and how the formula is chemical free.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am thoroughly impressed with this mascara.</li>
            <li>THE RESULTS.IT IS EASY TO USE AND TO TAKE OFF.I RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>The Lash Enhancement &amp; Conditioning serum contains Hydrolyzed Keratin and Peptides, which help nourish and encourage positive results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Application: The tube is a nice size</li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>

            <li>This is an amazing product that really works as advertised with the minimum of fuss.</li>
            <li>It has an amazing brush that doesn&#x27;t get too goopy at the tips, and applies a very even amount to every lash.</li>
            <li>It has an amazing brush that doesn&#x27;t get too goopy at the tips, and applies a very even amount to every lash.</li>
            <li>I won this on a blog contest and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>My lashes were breaking from some of the more popular brands that I&#x27;d been using so I went in search of something different and came across Envyderm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras, so by the time I got to Envyderm, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>Often when I receive a product that I do not deem worthy of using, I change to another product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that it would work better on someone younger.</li>
            <li>The directions are simple, you apply one coat and within one minute’s time, apply one more coat or more if desired.</li>
            <li>I did not experience growth but because they remained healthy, they did look fuller (thicker) and felt super soft when the mascara was off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the tub is pretty cool looking with the detailing and the silver metal look</li>
            <li>It is more of a volumizing mascara than a lengthening mascara, the color is also super black, which I love.</li>
            <li>So, I went right into trying out the mascara.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t want to worry about trying to add it on the lid right up to your lashes</li>
            <li>only use the mascara on my top lashes and it does not extend them any longer than a normal cheap drugstore brand.  </li>
            <li>even sometimes forgetting to curl my lashes before hand, it still never fails me.</li>
            <li>even sometimes forgetting to curl my lashes before hand, it still never fails me.</li>
            <li>IT.IT IS THE FIRST TIME I BUY IT</li>
            <li>i bought this because i had lost most of my eyelashes putting on individual eyelashes for halloween</li>
            <li>I only use all natural products on my face and this mascara is chemical free!!</li>
            <li>I am a very picky person when it comes to mascaras, if one doesn&#x27;t do the trick, I will layer different kinds on top of one another.</li>
            <li>I am a very picky person when it comes to mascaras, if one doesn&#x27;t do the trick, I will layer different kinds on top of one another.</li>
            <li>The only downside thus far is that I dont think it comes in waterproof which would be nice for summer time when Im around water so much.</li>
            <li>I have used a tube of this product continually for 5 weeks now and it has continued to produce, from my stubby thin lashes, unusually beautiful looking eyelashes each day.</li>
            <li>As a contact lens wearer,&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how many products I&#x27;ve used and thrown away because they were too strong or not effective.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice mascara, definitely don&#x27;t have to spend this much, can go with drugstore options and still get the same results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if the mascara alone makes my eyelashes grow because I do use the serum, but this mascara falls into the \\&quot;D\\&quot; category.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wand is also very bendable, does not provide a sturdy grip when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems with clumping and it really lasted all day which are two things I really like a lot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mascara didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use to much on the bottom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from EnvyDerm.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from EnvyDerm.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>The mascara comes off very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow, I was totally surprised and delighted from the first application--a few strokes and voila:</li>
            <li>but because the formula is light, you can get away without curling and get some minor lift but never compared to what a lash curler can do.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to make my lashes thick, long, spread out evenly and curl beautifully.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to make my lashes thick, long, spread out evenly and curl beautifully.</li>
            <li>However, the price is too high for what it delivers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I was happy that my lashes did not feel heavy and weighed down by the product.</li>
            <li>Right now, even though it’s Fall, I’m in Southern California</li>
            <li>Looking for a new mascara?</li>
            <li>new hair growth&lt;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump and it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I searched the internet for a mascara that would miraculously transform my sparse short eyelashes into beautiful long thick lashes.</li>
            <li>and you get a generous 0.27 fluid ounces, Easy to open and the brush on the wand does separate and apply a fluid and even coat to my lashes.</li>
            <li>As far as my eyelashes getting longer or thicker...</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and pliable, almost like soft rubber.</li>
            <li>My lashes were soft and not dehydrated after removing the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that the mascara is not too thick</li>
            <li>but after three uses, I expected that slight movement and was able to learn to adjust around it.</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks other people where able to see the difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mascara but a little too dark and heavy for me.</li>
            <li>The bristles bend and the brush is impossible to use effectively in applying the mascara even if it were in new condition.  </li>

            <li> The bristles bend and the brush is impossible to use effectively in applying the mascara even if it were in new condition.  </li>
            <li> I think my eyelashes were falling out due to old age (52) and female pattern baldness of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> and I have had to constantly wipe away the flakes all day long.</li>
            <li> However, for a nice stay-at-home or errand day, it isn&#x27;t a bad product.</li>
            <li> My only negative is that the applicator (not the wand stick portion) tends to “boing” a bit and is not as solid and fixed in one place.</li>
            <li> the price, I expected long lasting mascara.  </li>
            <li> surely enough it had worked, less than a month my eyelashes started growing.</li>
            <li> desperately i looked for a mascara to help me grow them back quickly.</li>
            <li> So, no thanks.</li>
            <li> Basically, I give this one star because I received no product and absolutely no customer service.</li>
            <li> Wet days, again some smudging and slight flaking that tended to occur when I entered a store that was blasting the heater (after about 7.5 hours of wear).</li>
            <li> If you wait too long, the mascara will dry on your lashes and it becomes too hard to apply another coat.</li>
            <li> I never touch my face and much less my eye area due to my fears of bacteria and messing up my make-up.</li>
            <li> This is either a poor product or is so old that it is muddled in gunk.  </li>
            <li> After 3 hours or so, the mascara falls down to my lower eyelash lid ends.  </li>
            <li> I trim my lashes as it is (I know sounds odd)</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a mascara that I would wear for a night out or any sort of event because I spend my time scrubbing black from under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Mascara comes in black and espresso.</li>
            <li> I chose to try the black mascara.</li>
            <li> It was hot, humid, cold, to even some rain when I used the product.</li>
            <li> luxurious, very long thick lashes appeared out of nowhere.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> It actually makes me look tired.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that after a few month&#x27;s use, my eyelashes were growing longer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on thick</li>
            <li> It gives my lashes some serious \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; without being too overdone.</li>

            <li> I will not return or ask for replacement or refund.  Often when I receive a product that I do not deem worthy of using, I change to another product.  This is either a poor product or is so old that it is muddled in gunk.  The bristles bend and the brush is impossible to use effectively in applying the mascara even if it were in new condition.  So, no thanks.</li>
            <li> Like the mascara, definitely enhances the length of lashes, but in no way does it help them grow. If you&#x27;re looking for a nice mascara, definitely don&#x27;t have to spend this much, can go with drugstore options and still get the same results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara along with the envyderm conditioning serum.  The serum works hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use the mascara on my top lashes and it does not extend them any longer than a normal cheap drugstore brand.  After 3 hours or so, the mascara falls down to my lower eyelash lid ends.  It actually makes me look tired.  I can&#x27;t really say if the mascara alone makes my eyelashes grow because I do use the serum, but this mascara falls into the \\&quot;D\\&quot; category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand is also very bendable, does not provide a sturdy grip when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I expected long lasting mascara.  I still have to use an eyelash curler to make my lashes look pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, I will not be purchasing the mascara again.</li>
            <li> i wish the wand wasnt&#x27; so flexible, but love the mascara</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I only use all natural products on my face and this mascara is chemical free!! My lashes were breaking from some of the more popular brands that I&#x27;d been using so I went in search of something different and came across Envyderm. I had already tried EnvyDerm conditioning serum and was told that using them both together would give a 24hr lash growth system. So I used the serum at night, and the mascara during the day. The only downside thus far is that I dont think it comes in waterproof which would be nice for summer time when Im around water so much. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> It has been a while since I have used my last product from EnvyDerm not because I didn&#x27;t want to I just simply ran out. I just haven&#x27;t had the chance to buy any more serum. So, I went right into trying out the mascara. I loved the ease of applying the mascara to my lashes and also it looked amazing. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with clumping and it really lasted all day which are two things I really like a lot. Also, the tub is pretty cool looking with the detailing and the silver metal look is really nice. I was really happy within a week I could see a change in my length and also the fullness. Within a few weeks other people where able to see the difference. If you are wanting to have length and fullness but you don&#x27;t want to worry about trying to add it on the lid right up to your lashes this is I think the best way to go.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I have ever used!  It doesn&#x27;t clump and it looks very natural.  It curls my lashes upwards for a beautiful bright open eye.  My favorite part about this mascara is removing it- it washes off simply with soap and water, no scrubbing, no leftover raccoon eyes!  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiance. This is an amazing product that really works as advertised with the minimum of fuss. Great mascara, clump free look that gives falsies effect, doesn&#x27;t flake, very moist and the best part is that it grows lashes and make them thicker and longer. This is by far the best mascara and lash treatment all in one tube out there. I will definitely buy again. For all the great value it represents I would like to rate this mascara FIVE STARS*****</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mascara but a little too dark and heavy for me. I&#x27;m sure that it would work better on someone younger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this mascara for 8 hours now and I have had to constantly wipe away the flakes all day long. Horrible!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the mascara for about 5 weeks and LOVE it! I put it on in the morning and it lasts all day. It goes on quite easy - I love the wand. I have not used one like this before but it coats all lashes evenly.</li>
            <li> I searched the internet for a mascara that would miraculously transform my sparse short eyelashes into beautiful long thick lashes. I&#x27;ve tried many mascaras, so by the time I got to Envyderm, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  Wow, I was totally surprised and delighted from the first application--a few strokes and voila: luxurious, very long thick lashes appeared out of nowhere.  I have used a tube of this product continually for 5 weeks now and it has continued to produce, from my stubby thin lashes, unusually beautiful looking eyelashes each day. I am hoping that over time the conditioning property  that is advertised as integral to this product will enhance my eyelashes so that even without using Envyderm mascara, my lashes will look noticeably better. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone who desires beautiful eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I received this item for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara didn&#x27;t do much for me. It doesn&#x27;t go on thick but you can tell that you are wearing some mascara. As far as my eyelashes getting longer or thicker...I didn&#x27;t see that happen at all.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on well and it is not clumpy. It does smudge a bit on the lower lashes so I don&#x27;t use to much on the bottom. It&#x27;s a little pricey but I think it is healthy for your lashes and looks good.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara i have EVER used. I am a very picky person when it comes to mascaras, if one doesn&#x27;t do the trick, I will layer different kinds on top of one another. I wanted something to make my lashes thick, long, spread out evenly and curl beautifully. This mascara doesn&#x27;t even need a 3rd coat in my opinion. It has an amazing brush that doesn&#x27;t get too goopy at the tips, and applies a very even amount to every lash. even sometimes forgetting to curl my lashes before hand, it still never fails me. Please try this, you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> EnvyDerm enhances your lashes by making them look better, longer, and strengthening. Their patent serum boosts and repairs, plus it also promotes length and thicker lashes. The Lash Enhancement &amp; Conditioning serum contains Hydrolyzed Keratin and Peptides, which help nourish and encourage positive results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of Application: The tube is a nice size and you get a generous 0.27 fluid ounces, Easy to open and the brush on the wand does separate and apply a fluid and even coat to my lashes. The directions are simple, you apply one coat and within one minute’s time, apply one more coat or more if desired. The product does build up nicely and you don’t get that “spider look” we fear when applying additional coats. I’m a 2.5 coats girl when it comes to application. One coat to cover and a second for volume, .5 to get corners and any places that need extra attention. My only negative is that the applicator (not the wand stick portion) tends to “boing” a bit and is not as solid and fixed in one place. The brush is soft and pliable, almost like soft rubber. I don’t like that bounce back but after three uses, I expected that slight movement and was able to learn to adjust around it. I attribute this to being kinder on lashes and it’s just a learning curve. The hourglass shape and bristles make up for this shortcoming alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I was using coconut oil at night to condition my lashes and I saw in 1 month’s time, my lashes tended to never fall (shed) or break, they just remained healthy and even stronger with time and this was just using one oil. EnvyDerm uses Moroccan Argan oil, vitamins, amino acids and just a more suitable and nourishing formula. I stopped the coconut oil use to see how EnvyDerm could pick-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nourishing- The product does help when it comes to overall lash health. My lashes were soft and not dehydrated after removing the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance- I was happy with how the brush flared my lashes and separated, plus I did get what I would call a medium rating when it comes to volume. I seek medium volume because that makes the mascara perfect for day or night. I don’t want to look like I have feather dusters for lashes no matter what trends say. The color was a nice pigmented black, which looked beautiful but also highlighted the eye area nicely. My eyes looked open and I look awake even with 5 hours of sleep!&lt;br /&gt;Endurance- I never touch my face and much less my eye area due to my fears of bacteria and messing up my make-up. Right now, even though it’s Fall, I’m in Southern California so I get all that the weather has to offer and even windy days. It was hot, humid, cold, to even some rain when I used the product. On normal days, I experienced zero flaking or smudging. If it was above 90 degrees, I did get some smudging and stopped applying the product to the lower lashes. Wet days, again some smudging and slight flaking that tended to occur when I entered a store that was blasting the heater (after about 7.5 hours of wear). I gave it an 8 out of 10 when it came to handling the roller-coaster ride of temperatures we get in California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was happy that my lashes did not feel heavy and weighed down by the product. EnvyDerm’s formula nourished and I did see what I call great “lash health”. I did not have to do anything but wear my mascara in the day and throughout the afternoon to keep up with the results I was getting from my coconut oil treatments. I still had to curl before applying because it was my way to insure I was getting the look I wanted but because the formula is light, you can get away without curling and get some minor lift but never compared to what a lash curler can do. I trim my lashes as it is (I know sounds odd) because if I don’t, my lashes hit my sunglasses and that bothers me. I did not experience growth but because they remained healthy, they did look fuller (thicker) and felt super soft when the mascara was off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from EnvyDerm.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.a was off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from EnvyDerm.

            <li> I didn&#x27;t think these would make my eye lashes grow back but it did!  I think my eyelashes were falling out due to old age (52) and female pattern baldness of my scalp.  I&#x27;ve used this irregularly (twice weekly) and I&#x27;ve gotten results.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara i have EVER used. I am a very picky person when it comes to mascaras, if one doesn&#x27;t do the trick, I will layer different kinds on top of one another. I wanted something to make my lashes thick, long, spread out evenly and curl beautifully. This mascara doesn&#x27;t even need a 3rd coat in my opinion.

            <li> I really like this mascara. It gives my lashes some serious \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; without being too overdone. It is more of a volumizing mascara than a lengthening mascara, the color is also super black, which I love. Just FYI , I love how the ingredients are organic and how the formula is chemical free.</li>
            <li> I AM WATCHING THE RESULTS.IT IS EASY TO USE AND TO TAKE OFF.I RECOMMEND IT.IT IS THE FIRST TIME I BUY IT BUT I SHALL REPEAT IT.</li>
            <li> I won this on a blog contest and was excited to try it. As a mascara, it does darken the lashes but doesn&#x27;t add volume in any way. It also falls under my eyes, constantly. This isn&#x27;t a mascara that I would wear for a night out or any sort of event because I spend my time scrubbing black from under my eyes. However, for a nice stay-at-home or errand day, it isn&#x27;t a bad product. I did notice that after a few month&#x27;s use, my eyelashes were growing longer. However, the price is too high for what it delivers.</li>
            <li> Buy now they are always sold out</li>
            <li> Great!  I&#x27;ve finally found an eyelash growth conditioner that doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my eyes.  As a contact lens wearer,&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how many products I&#x27;ve used and thrown away because they were too strong or not effective.  I can see an&lt;br /&gt;increase of lashes plus length has improved.  I will use this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this item, the EnvyDerm Mascara, one star because I never got the product to even try.&lt;br /&gt;Instead I got the EnvyDerm Eyeliner even though all my invoices stated Mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I sent 2 emails to the providers of this product neither of which were answered.  Basically, I give this one star because I received no product and absolutely no customer service.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i had lost most of my eyelashes putting on individual eyelashes for halloween so when i took them (should of bought correct solution and waited) i had no eyelashes. desperately i looked for a mascara to help me grow them back quickly. surely enough it had worked, less than a month my eyelashes started growing. learned a lesson. but happy there is a remdy. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Looking for a new mascara? EnvyDerm’s mascara instantly increases lash volume while giving definition and curl to your eyelashes. This mascara instantly curls your eyelashes and is clump-free. There’s no need for all those extra eyelash utensils like a curler or comb. With continues use, your lashes will become longer and thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EnvyDerm Mascara benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Longer, thicker, luscious lashses&lt;br /&gt;-Stimulate new hair growth&lt;br /&gt;-Repairs damaged hairs&lt;br /&gt;-Conditions and Moisturizes&lt;br /&gt;-Adds Volume&lt;br /&gt;-Smudge Proof&lt;br /&gt;-Clump-free&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn’t flake or run&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EnvyDerm’s Mascara comes in black and espresso. I chose to try the black mascara. I love that the mascara is not too thick so it does not clump your eyelashes. It has an hourglass shape brush which helps to separate your eyelashes. I don’t even need to use a comb with this product. The brush forms to your eyelashes perfectly. I like to apply the mascara to both sides of the top eyelashes for a more pronounced look. I apply one coat, then apply the second coat within one minute after. If you wait too long, the mascara will dry on your lashes and it becomes too hard to apply another coat. It takes two to three coats to achieve the look that I want. The mascara is smudge proof and does not run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will receive a .27 fl-oz mascara in a cute silver tube. I believe that it is a bit difficult to get the brush in and out of the tube. I have to apply some pressure. It seems that there may be a smaller hole because it takes the extra excess of mascara of the brush. I still wish it was a bit easier to insert the brush into the tube. I feel like I may end up breaking the brush, but I have not yet. Other than that, I am thoroughly impressed with this mascara. It’s very easy to remove. I like to use a facial wipe at night. The mascara comes off very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
