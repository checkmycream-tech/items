            <li>It&#x27;s a good  product.  </li>
            <li>I tried and been fair about giving it a chance</li>
            <li>Worked mainly as a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>for everything it states, I feel it did not produce, a good skin cream</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but is over priced.</li>
            <li>Good product, delivers wat</li>
            <li>, didn&#x27;t they look good for their age.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>, didn&#x27;t they look good for their age.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I am a good candidate for it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good wrinkle cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I saw those reviews and now I knew what is the truth, this is a good anti-aging product.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a good try.</li>
            <li>fortunately I have an awesome credit card and proof</li>
            <li>I love really happy with this buy.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for over 5 years and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I really love this product!  </li>
            <li>These products cost way more!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels and looks better than it has in years!</li>
            <li>I should have know better!</li>
            <li>THE SCAM TO GET FREE!!</li>
            <li>Aaaahhh ... much better again!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I am glad I read them!</li>
            <li>In my opinion the cream quality is perfect and there are no fake ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems many of the Positve Reviews may be posted by LifeCell workers!</li>
            <li>My face is refreshing now, as well!</li>
            <li>and you feel amazing because of it</li>
            <li>However, when I received the product and started using it, I have found that it is actually amazing.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that LifeCell formula has great result for me because I used many brand which does not cause any result to me.</li>
            <li>and I see really effective.</li>
            <li>Then came the really nice credit card charge of 252.86.  </li>
            <li>I was really struggling to find a good product to make my skin look better, so I was very happy to find LifeCell.</li>
            <li>Its nice, but I have no intentions to reorder.</li>
            <li>She really liked it.</li>
            <li>Thank you all for being honest.</li>
            <li>And I get a lot more comments on how great and smooth my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 5 months so far and am mildly impressed with its results.</li>
            <li>Unlike many reviewers I notice a difference in very fine lines and all over evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>This product is really effective and easy product.</li>
            <li>Better yet don&#x27;t purchase under the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>advertisement because it might not be free!</li>
            <li>Oh, the rep also stressed strongly to be sure to include a tracking number with the return, as they won&#x27;t provide a refund if the package is lost and doesn&#x27;t have a tracking number.</li>
            <li>Oh, the rep also stressed strongly to be sure to include a tracking number with the return, as they won&#x27;t provide a refund if the package is lost and doesn&#x27;t have a tracking number.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>One more of Dr Oz&#x27;s kick backs.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder how many more of us are out there who had this problem.</li>
            <li>love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>It has been around for many years and he swears by it.</li>
            <li>I get more results from Olay ProX cream...</li>
            <li>The Costco Oil of Olay felt better from that point but didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li>Without your knowledge they will send more items to you and they will charge to the credit</li>
            <li>Love it not sticky or oily in the heat of the summer.  </li>
            <li>My skin has become smoother and more elastic.</li>
            <li>I’m glad I took a chance on it</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Some people can get away with it for a couple more years, but Mother Nature means for us to age.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, you would be better off going to a dermatologist and obtaining a Retin A perscription, getting a chemical peel, or having microdermabrasion done.</li>
            <li>and after two more weeks everyone was complimenting my skin.</li>
            <li>Just okay....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Skin has a better look immediately after applying it</li>
            <li>This was suppose to be such a great product!  </li>
            <li>Her skin feels softer and looks better than.</li>
            <li>and now I have stuck to it for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying many products and never seen any change</li>
            <li>I wish they had more products.</li>
            <li>I wish I had done much more research on this company and claims they make about their products.</li>
            <li>I found a website that had so many complaints about this company&#x27;s billing practices that I was stunned.  </li>
            <li>but it kept sending more and more of this yucky cream</li>
            <li>I had never been able to use a primer before be because makeup didn&#x27;t go on well afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Now my complexion is more even and smoother.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>and they said they&#x27;d be glad to look into it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love This cream because is without smell, I&#x27;m not allergic to this one</li>
            <li>and my face looks better</li>
            <li>Will be sure to re order.</li>
            <li>I use this product along with Lovely Skin&#x27;s 2-part eye product.</li>
            <li>I would love to continue with lifecell, but cannot afford the hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews before trying this product</li>
            <li>Even color is better.</li>
            <li>Affect is supposed to be better after continued use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for a 19 or 20 dollar product</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The cream does have a nice, non-greasy consistency that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The product itself is only just OK, I got just as good of results from drug-store products and a lower cost than 189.00!</li>
            <li>like the texture of the cream right out of the tube, warm it with your fingers and spread it all over with no greasy feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lets just call this product by its true name LieTell!</li>
            <li>- Repechage is BY FAR a more superior product.</li>
            <li>honestly, this s my first time</li>
            <li>It smoothies my fine line and wrinkle.</li>
            <li>works just fine for my wife</li>
            <li>Read the fine print.</li>
            <li>Lifecell has reduce my wrinkle and faded fine lines.</li>
            <li>&quot; then fine.</li>
            <li>Helps fine lines and skin discoloration.</li>
            <li>I quickly noticed that the benefits of Life Cell disappeared and lines reappeared!  </li>
            <li>Who knew such a great could be available so and so easy to sign up for auto shipments and often as you need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>news was that my allergies are fine with it, and I am happy with the moderate price.</li>
            <li>I am a fair person, I feel if you spend that amount of money that you should be pleased at the results, they claim this is fantastic product, well in my own personal experience, it did absolutely NOTHING for me at all</li>
            <li>I ordered lifecell before reading the reviews and then was horrified, thinking I had made a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Lifecell free 30 day sample which I paid the shipping of $ 4.25 on March 17 2015.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the product result is great and delivers on just described in the product description.</li>
            <li>I had some sun damage and light spots after having 2 kids</li>
            <li>In fact, I received a free sample of the face cleanser</li>
            <li>I thought I was washing my face with cheap dollar store dish detergent.</li>
            <li>The creamy product has minimized the wrinkles of advanced age and weight loss.</li>
            <li>Has research been done on why  a minority of women find it fantastic and the majority say it doesn&#x27;t work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they say free</li>
            <li>friend gave me a free sample of this stuff (she had two for some reason).  </li>
            <li>Send for the free sample and you&#x27;re stuck for an automatic refill AND AUTOMATIC CREDIT CHARGE whether you like it or not.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is for free.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; will cost you $189.00 NOT the $4.95  they advertise.</li>
            <li>free sample?</li>
            <li>received this product as free for exchange unbiased review.</li>
            <li>They offer a 30 day \\&quot;free trial\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me it was a prepaid card</li>
            <li>I did the free trial on their website.</li>
            <li>Celebs - enjoy.</li>
            <li>I used it for a couple of years and it was good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Best way to make your own conclusions is to click on a reviewer&#x27;s name and see what else they have reviewed and if their reviews are skewed in any way to be false.</li>
            <li>and you can get as good or better results buying anti-aging cream at your local retail or drug store</li>
            <li>If you ask me, the best skin care currently on the market, and I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;The price will really get your attention, but so will the results, I&#x27;m not kidding.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with the results and am looking forward to my continued use.  </li>
            <li>Each is pricy, but worth saving your pennies for!</li>
            <li>Its no joke that this must be what all those celebrities use to keep themselves looking young into their old age because this stuff is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>If you buy the item on the special trial offer of $4 you will be billed $189 in 30 days.</li>
            <li>Not a substitute for a facelift, but certainly a visible, more youthful, difference.</li>
            <li>I just find it disconcerting that companies like this are clearly  leaving their own unverified, five star reviews.</li>
            <li>This really is a good product and I will continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li>Then try getting your money back- good luck.</li>
            <li>I use this as pert of a daily skin routine along with La Mer and its just as good of a product.</li>
            <li>I decided to look further and checked with the BBB for good measure.  </li>
            <li>When will people stop being so vain and realize that aging is not a BAD thing, and that no one looks 25 forever?  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is odorless.  </li>
            <li>It would sure be nice to find a wrinkle treatment that really does what it&#x27;s advertised to do, but Lifecell is definitely not that treatment.</li>
            <li>However something was very interesting about my friend&#x27;s comments in the last month: &amp;#34; you look terrific&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; you are looking good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;were</li>
            <li>Bottom line - I did not appreciate a salesperson calling my home to inquire why I had not purchased their product, based on my first attempt!</li>
            <li>I got her hooked after giving her the first tube!</li>
            <li>She reviewed a plus sized woman&#x27;s long-sleeve cardigan she loves to wear, but then also reviews a performance enhancing pill &amp;#34;My wife finally told me to try this.&amp;#34; WHICH GOES TO SHOW THAT MOST OF THESE REVIEWS OF LIFECELL MAY ALSO BE BOGUS!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the free gift product from friend</li>
            <li>The wrinkles around my eyes are gone and my laugh lines around my mouth have almost disappeared also.  </li>
            <li>it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Even though it takes time, but it still work and worth for me.</li>
            <li>And really, you get absolutely nothing for being the most unwrinkled, smooth-faced person in the morgue - if you happen to go there in that condition.  </li>
            <li>you can afford it, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I regret ever allowing Life Cell into my house because of business practices and onto my face because it took 8 days to clear up after two nights of using appropriate amount.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel young and healthy too..</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the price, and I&#x27;ll get it again.</li>
            <li>Only 7 days, it starts effectively.</li>
            <li>Thank You LifeCell for being my own personal fountain of youth!</li>
            <li>I order it based on its good reviews for other people.</li>
            <li>This made a noticeable (to me, anyway) difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical because I was happy with the very fine products I had been using.  </li>
            <li>The anti-aging product is working good on my face or hand, it gives me another new looks when I show my face on public.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it until this tube is complete in the hope that more time is necessary for it to work its magic.....</li>
            <li>Lifecell works great, 2.54 is enough to last awhile.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t pay for tracking, do returns have a higher chance of getting lost...</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t pay for tracking, do returns have a higher chance of getting lost...</li>
            <li>Although can&#x27;t buy Lifecell in general store, but I definately love this shipping service very well.</li>
            <li>I have not used this product yet, but please look at all the most recent ratings.  </li>
            <li>I am 84 years old, in good physical shape, but really needed something to help eliminate the lines on my face; inherited from my Dad.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li>This is much appreaciate!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but what you should be aware of is that once they have your credit card info they will charge you every month with 189 dollars until you cancel your card.</li>
            <li>The first time I did purchase from the company and then cancelled.</li>
            <li>Read first don&#x27;t complain later.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first two weeks I didn&#x27;t notice any change.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and noticed a difference immediately, especially in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>At first it appears to work then after a week or so</li>
            <li>I began using it at first just for daytime.  </li>
            <li>Like with any product being consistent helps.</li>
            <li>Not a substitute for a surgical facelift but most definitely a lift.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have anticipated for my first time usage with Lifecell.</li>
            <li>First let me say this is not a fake review staged by LifeCell, secondly this is the first review I have ever left which is surprising because I do ALL my shopping online.  </li>
            <li>Lots of creams I’ve had would only last a couple of weeks; lifecell gives a good amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li>Get online and you will find a lot of positive comments on the product.</li>
            <li>online positive review sites written by South Beach themselves.</li>
            <li>but ebay doesn&#x27;t list this product on their rejuvenation cream pages, maybe because ebay would never tolerate a 29 per cent positive feedback rating.</li>
            <li>Now, these are real reviews from real people!</li>
            <li>Having said that, I am getting compliments on how good I look and can see a small difference.  </li>
            <li>To my mind, if a company has a superior product, they would be assured that the customers who try the \\&quot;30 day trial\\&quot; would be so enamored with their products that they wouldn&#x27;t need to use shady business practices in order to make money.  </li>
            <li>I look 5 years younger and my skin has become more vibrant.</li>
            <li>The single most reliable assessment I&#x27;ve ever heard of anti-aging products applies to this one--&#x27;it works for some people but not everyone.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>maybe it doesn&#x27;t work after a certain age ?</li>
            <li>I still have fine lines of course, but I do not expect those to diminish this soon after starting the product.  </li>
            <li>I used as directed morning and night and noticed that my skin was very dry in the morning and more wrinkled than when I use my Olay Regenerest Micro sculpting cream.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little, and produces GREAT results.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for all the reviews .</li>
            <li>Thanks for all the reviews I&#x27;m NOT buying.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that if you ordered a free trial and DID NOT cancel after 30 days, you will continue to be charged in future months.  </li>
            <li>and it was a real</li>
            <li>and I was hoping the hype was for real.......</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for wrinkles, crows feet, tightening skin, nothing at all.</li>
            <li>A product that works well does not have to advertise so much.</li>
            <li>So like Cinderella at midnight, you take off your makeup and see the real you.  </li>
            <li>, I really don&#x27;t know that I can afford to keep using it, I have no idea what they put in it to make it so pricy, but if i could afford it I would use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I really like the LifeCell Anti-Aging Wrinkle South Beach Skin Care product.  </li>
            <li>but really is THAT</li>
            <li>what you&#x27;re really all about?  </li>
            <li>and i share my opinion after tried to post the ready content for review the product</li>
            <li>WAY to much money</li>
            <li>This ceam does absolutely nothing except drain your wallet.</li>
            <li>So much softer...</li>
            <li>no results.&lt;br /&gt;Too much money for it not to work.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>Inc.  I was ready to pull the handle for this \\&quot;revolutionary\\&quot; product and enter my credit card info.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have that much in the account.</li>
            <li>The Olay does keep me moisturized all night and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Too much for this teacher.  </li>
            <li>you probably won&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>Thanks for my mother gift it to me</li>
            <li>Before you drop a lot of cash on this, it&#x27;s a good idea to pay attention to all the negative reviews of it in the Amazon comment section.</li>
            <li>When will people begin concentrating on more important meaningful things and quit staring adoringly at their own reflections in the mirror day after day, while also believing themselves to have all sorts of dreadful flaws like wrinkles and some sagging skin?  </li>
            <li>Of course you&#x27;ll need to buy an endless supply of this \\&quot;magic in a tube.\\</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem much better than any other moisturizer</li>
            <li>It does not work any better than any other moisturizer that you can buy over the counter.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products on the market and like its results over theirs.</li>
            <li>It simply works and you can really see that form the very first time you use it.</li>
            <li>Not only did I not receive anything, sample or full size, my credit card was charged $189.  </li>
            <li>You live and learn!</li>
            <li>MAKES YOU LOOK 20 YEARS OLDER.  </li>
            <li>You will be lucky if you get your money back in one call without yelling over the robot you are taking to.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all of the ladies.  </li>
            <li>I will be reporting this company to the BBB; I highly recommend that everyone else do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought Lancome&#x27;s Ultimate Rose Elixir, an even more expensive face cream</li>
            <li>like the way it feels and soaks in fast, but don&#x27;t see any difference yet as far as firming or wrinkle improvement</li>
            <li>I returned it and ended up buying an Australian mdae organic cream which leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and smooth every day and only cost $25.00.  </li>
            <li>have resumed using my Natural Advantage Retinol based cream and my face feels and looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>PRODUCT ACTUALLY MADE UNDER EYES DRY AND MORE WRINKLES .</li>
            <li>After I finally ran out a couple years later, I decided to try some other products instead --- but have to say, nothing felt as good.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a fair chance, well, after spending over 400.00 almost on 2 tubes, it has NOT done a single thing for me, I did not just buy it and quit after a week or so, I have been using this for a few months and NOTHING at all has changed.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by my new skin doctor - who is also a plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>Now, I am planning to get a new one from here.</li>
            <li>Live and learn~</li>
            <li>After two weeks I enjoy just using one product and a very minimal amount.</li>
            <li>It really surprises me to see all the negative reviews on this product, as this product has worked FANTASTIC for me!  </li>
            <li>I am a young looking 63 with my main problem being some wrinkling under my eyes, that has just started.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>After four faithful weeks with daily progressive photos taken in exact location with measured distance, I have proof</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I love it and have been using it for the past two years.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I used the Lifecell cream for 30 days - twice daily and exactly as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;There was no improvement in my skin texture or reduction of wrinkles or the appearance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>Be aware of the so called &amp;#34;free 30 day trial offer&amp;#34;, I thought I was only paying 4.99 for the shipping and handling, just as the advertisement stated, I put in my credit card info, and they tried to charge me 189.00.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this first from company and asked very specific questions.</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old and have tried everything regardless of price - this product is my favourite!</li>
            <li>There are a lot of natural things for much less than this that can help moisturize the skin - things as easy as olive oil.</li>
            <li>I am not very wrinkled and in fact already look pretty good for my age, which is 67, but I fell for all this hype hook line and sinker duh!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second tube and can see and feel positive differences.  </li>
            <li>Makes a lot of false promises and super cheap packaging for 189.00</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a month, so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to know for sure, but so far, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on and is dry right away.  </li>
            <li>Despite cancelling any future purchases, I was repeatedly charged large amounts I didn&#x27;t authorize.</li>
            <li>Just to be clear, I have not purchased or used this product.</li>
            <li>I am a 38 year old women who has had a complete hysterectomy, so my skin has made a complete change from hormones.  </li>
            <li>Lots of flaking, then clear skin.</li>
            <li>Just thinkin&#x27; out loud...</li>
            <li>ITS A COMPLETE SCAM</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my skin didn&#x27;t feel as soft as when I was using Boots #7 products.  </li>
            <li>I tried this because a 75 year old friend who has done everything to fight aging recommended it.  </li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>I am 69 years old and no one can believe I am that old.</li>
            <li>My skin has been so soft and my budding age spots have begun to disappear.</li>
            <li>Youthful beauty is reserved for those who ARE young.</li>
            <li>my membership/subscription because I used the product much slower than their regular shipments.  </li>
            <li>like - leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>This product did not come with we&#x27;ll constructed instructions, I found the product to be very drying to my skin but the directions offered nothing in the way of what to do or next steps to counter the drying effect.</li>
            <li>This whole thing is one big scam!</li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>People comment on my skin routinely with regard to how few wrinkles I have and how smooth my skin is.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft, moisturized, and even toned.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for a friend and he loves it so far.</li>
            <li>And LC is Not a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of dodging LC countless sales calls with more &amp;#34;offers&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The packaging I liked until it slipped behind the bathroom counter drawer.</li>
            <li>All these options are less expensive (if you use Groupon or Living social), and are more effective.</li>
            <li>I researched a couple of reviewers of this product and as an example, &amp;#34;Jordan&amp;#34; has other reviews and this &amp;#34;person&amp;#34; reviews both woman&#x27;s and men&#x27;s products so it is very suspicious to me that this is a REAL PERSON.</li>
            <li>Like previous posts, it says that it stated that I had to return the product after the 30 day trial if I didn&#x27;t want to be charged the full amount.  </li>
            <li>In reply to Lynda&#x27;s “LYNDA”comment, I don&#x27;t usually write reviews either but just has to tell you a big thank you, I too ended up having more wrinkles than I started with and stopped using this product.</li>
            <li>I have seen great results since using this product and I am usually very skeptical.</li>
            <li>My friend did receive the sample and found it to be nothing exciting, certainly not worth $189.</li>
            <li>SORRY, I expected great things based on the recommendations, but nothing happened.  </li>
            <li>, I honestly expected some positive results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did not see any major changes.</li>
            <li>In my case, it turned out to be a major rip off.</li>
            <li>If you are young and your skin is still pretty tight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 years old with lines around my eyes and upper lip.</li>
            <li>and now I can barely see them</li>
            <li>I have warned my friends to stay as far away from this product as possible as it will become like a cancer in their computer!</li>
            <li>When will they stop believing that if a product promises to return them to their once youthful appearance (only happens when you&#x27;re young)</li>
            <li>After using Lifecell my wrinkles are definitely lessening and my skin feels really soft and supple and it looks brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li>used for three months straight, not much difference in my skin after that amount of time.  </li>
            <li>though Lifecell has a satisfaction guarantee, it is only returnable/refundable if you buy directly from Lifecell/South Beach.&lt;br /&gt;South</li>
            <li>Makes my skin younger looking and so soft.</li>
            <li>Humankind is WAY TOO obsessed with their own image, their perceived flaws, and staying 25 forever.  </li>
            <li>Kind of expensive though.</li>
            <li>None of this stuff works or does what it says it does, but it is no worse than any other so called anti-Aging cream</li>
            <li>My facial skin has gotten a little less \\&quot;energetic\\&quot; and Lifecell tightens things up better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>And to just blindly speculate, notwithstanding their glowing list of really amazing ingredients, what&#x27;s actually in this cream and where is it made?</li>
            <li>I thought it made my skin soft and moist but it did nothing above what my daily moisturizer would do and my over the counter moisturizer is a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>3 times before I finally called the company (and usually the vm is full) and spoke to someone who stopped the orders four months ago...</li>
            <li>and I look much more like myself (as opposed to that tired looking stranger I&#x27;ve been seeing recently).  </li>
            <li>you can look fresher with facial fillers or face lift there is no other way.</li>
            <li>I decided to do a little sleuthing around on the internet first.  </li>
            <li>Skin is less lax, fine lines less noticeable  </li>
            <li>I first started to order the trial online at lifecellcream.com, but had to stop and return to my computer a little later to start the process</li>
            <li>There is no better product on the market right now unless of course you pay some bloated cost.</li>
            <li>have really dry sensitive skin and it moisturize my skin without making it shiny or sticky..</li>
            <li>too much money, could find it for less</li>
            <li>In my 50&#x27;s, wrinkles and lines are harder and harder to hide - this really helps!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery but very slow reply from the company when I developed a reaction to their product.</li>
            <li>Considering the very high price and the promises made, I will not purchase again as I see no significant change in the look or feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>after reading many reviews, I was expecting at least a little something, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>well, I am done spending my money I work for to get  ripped off on a product that is a scam more or less, who does that seriously to a working person</li>

            <li> for everything it states, I feel it did not produce, a good skin cream</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but is over priced.</li>

            <li> , didn&#x27;t they look good for their age.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> , didn&#x27;t they look good for their age.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am a good candidate for it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good wrinkle cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I saw those reviews and now I knew what is the truth, this is a good anti-aging product.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a good try.</li>

            <li> And I get a lot more comments on how great and smooth my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months so far and am mildly impressed with its results.</li>
            <li> Unlike many reviewers I notice a difference in very fine lines and all over evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This product is really effective and easy product.</li>
            <li> Better yet don&#x27;t purchase under the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> advertisement because it might not be free!</li>
            <li> Oh, the rep also stressed strongly to be sure to include a tracking number with the return, as they won&#x27;t provide a refund if the package is lost and doesn&#x27;t have a tracking number.</li>
            <li> Oh, the rep also stressed strongly to be sure to include a tracking number with the return, as they won&#x27;t provide a refund if the package is lost and doesn&#x27;t have a tracking number.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> One more of Dr Oz&#x27;s kick backs.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder how many more of us are out there who had this problem.</li>
            <li> love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> It has been around for many years and he swears by it.</li>
            <li> I get more results from Olay ProX cream...</li>
            <li> The Costco Oil of Olay felt better from that point but didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> Without your knowledge they will send more items to you and they will charge to the credit</li>
            <li> Love it not sticky or oily in the heat of the summer.  </li>
            <li> My skin has become smoother and more elastic.</li>
            <li> I’m glad I took a chance on it</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Some people can get away with it for a couple more years, but Mother Nature means for us to age.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, you would be better off going to a dermatologist and obtaining a Retin A perscription, getting a chemical peel, or having microdermabrasion done.</li>
            <li> and after two more weeks everyone was complimenting my skin.</li>
            <li> Just okay....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Skin has a better look immediately after applying it</li>
            <li> This was suppose to be such a great product!  </li>
            <li> Her skin feels softer and looks better than.</li>
            <li> and now I have stuck to it for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying many products and never seen any change</li>
            <li> I wish they had more products.</li>
            <li> I wish I had done much more research on this company and claims they make about their products.</li>
            <li> I found a website that had so many complaints about this company&#x27;s billing practices that I was stunned.  </li>
            <li> but it kept sending more and more of this yucky cream</li>
            <li> I had never been able to use a primer before be because makeup didn&#x27;t go on well afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Now my complexion is more even and smoother.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and they said they&#x27;d be glad to look into it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love This cream because is without smell, I&#x27;m not allergic to this one</li>
            <li> and my face looks better</li>
            <li> Will be sure to re order.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with Lovely Skin&#x27;s 2-part eye product.</li>
            <li> I would love to continue with lifecell, but cannot afford the hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews before trying this product</li>
            <li> Even color is better.</li>
            <li> Affect is supposed to be better after continued use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for a 19 or 20 dollar product</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The cream does have a nice, non-greasy consistency that absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The product itself is only just OK, I got just as good of results from drug-store products and a lower cost than 189.00!</li>
            <li> like the texture of the cream right out of the tube, warm it with your fingers and spread it all over with no greasy feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lets just call this product by its true name LieTell!</li>
            <li> - Repechage is BY FAR a more superior product.</li>
            <li> honestly, this s my first time</li>
            <li> It smoothies my fine line and wrinkle.</li>
            <li> works just fine for my wife</li>
            <li> Read the fine print.</li>
            <li> Lifecell has reduce my wrinkle and faded fine lines.</li>
            <li> &quot; then fine.</li>
            <li> Helps fine lines and skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> I quickly noticed that the benefits of Life Cell disappeared and lines reappeared!  </li>
            <li> Who knew such a great could be available so and so easy to sign up for auto shipments and often as you need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> news was that my allergies are fine with it, and I am happy with the moderate price.</li>
            <li> I am a fair person, I feel if you spend that amount of money that you should be pleased at the results, they claim this is fantastic product, well in my own personal experience, it did absolutely NOTHING for me at all</li>
            <li> I ordered lifecell before reading the reviews and then was horrified, thinking I had made a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Lifecell free 30 day sample which I paid the shipping of $ 4.25 on March 17 2015.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the product result is great and delivers on just described in the product description.</li>
            <li> I had some sun damage and light spots after having 2 kids</li>
            <li> In fact, I received a free sample of the face cleanser</li>
            <li> I thought I was washing my face with cheap dollar store dish detergent.</li>
            <li> The creamy product has minimized the wrinkles of advanced age and weight loss.</li>
            <li> Has research been done on why  a minority of women find it fantastic and the majority say it doesn&#x27;t work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they say free</li>
            <li> friend gave me a free sample of this stuff (she had two for some reason).  </li>
            <li> Send for the free sample and you&#x27;re stuck for an automatic refill AND AUTOMATIC CREDIT CHARGE whether you like it or not.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is for free.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; will cost you $189.00 NOT the $4.95  they advertise.</li>
            <li> free sample?</li>
            <li> received this product as free for exchange unbiased review.</li>
            <li> They offer a 30 day \\&quot;free trial\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me it was a prepaid card</li>
            <li> I did the free trial on their website.</li>
            <li> Celebs - enjoy.</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of years and it was good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Best way to make your own conclusions is to click on a reviewer&#x27;s name and see what else they have reviewed and if their reviews are skewed in any way to be false.</li>
            <li> and you can get as good or better results buying anti-aging cream at your local retail or drug store</li>
            <li> If you ask me, the best skin care currently on the market, and I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;The price will really get your attention, but so will the results, I&#x27;m not kidding.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with the results and am looking forward to my continued use.  </li>
            <li> Each is pricy, but worth saving your pennies for!</li>
            <li> Its no joke that this must be what all those celebrities use to keep themselves looking young into their old age because this stuff is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> If you buy the item on the special trial offer of $4 you will be billed $189 in 30 days.</li>
            <li> Not a substitute for a facelift, but certainly a visible, more youthful, difference.</li>
            <li> I just find it disconcerting that companies like this are clearly  leaving their own unverified, five star reviews.</li>
            <li> This really is a good product and I will continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li> Then try getting your money back- good luck.</li>
            <li> I use this as pert of a daily skin routine along with La Mer and its just as good of a product.</li>
            <li> I decided to look further and checked with the BBB for good measure.  </li>
            <li> When will people stop being so vain and realize that aging is not a BAD thing, and that no one looks 25 forever?  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is odorless.  </li>
            <li> It would sure be nice to find a wrinkle treatment that really does what it&#x27;s advertised to do, but Lifecell is definitely not that treatment.</li>
            <li> However something was very interesting about my friend&#x27;s comments in the last month: &amp;#34; you look terrific&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; you are looking good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;were</li>
            <li> Bottom line - I did not appreciate a salesperson calling my home to inquire why I had not purchased their product, based on my first attempt!</li>
            <li> I got her hooked after giving her the first tube!</li>
            <li> She reviewed a plus sized woman&#x27;s long-sleeve cardigan she loves to wear, but then also reviews a performance enhancing pill &amp;#34;My wife finally told me to try this.&amp;#34; WHICH GOES TO SHOW THAT MOST OF THESE REVIEWS OF LIFECELL MAY ALSO BE BOGUS!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the free gift product from friend</li>
            <li> The wrinkles around my eyes are gone and my laugh lines around my mouth have almost disappeared also.  </li>
            <li> it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Even though it takes time, but it still work and worth for me.</li>
            <li> And really, you get absolutely nothing for being the most unwrinkled, smooth-faced person in the morgue - if you happen to go there in that condition.  </li>
            <li> you can afford it, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I regret ever allowing Life Cell into my house because of business practices and onto my face because it took 8 days to clear up after two nights of using appropriate amount.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel young and healthy too..</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the price, and I&#x27;ll get it again.</li>
            <li> Only 7 days, it starts effectively.</li>
            <li> Thank You LifeCell for being my own personal fountain of youth!</li>
            <li> I order it based on its good reviews for other people.</li>
            <li> This made a noticeable (to me, anyway) difference right away.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I was happy with the very fine products I had been using.  </li>
            <li> The anti-aging product is working good on my face or hand, it gives me another new looks when I show my face on public.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it until this tube is complete in the hope that more time is necessary for it to work its magic.....</li>
            <li> Lifecell works great, 2.54 is enough to last awhile.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t pay for tracking, do returns have a higher chance of getting lost...</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t pay for tracking, do returns have a higher chance of getting lost...</li>
            <li> Although can&#x27;t buy Lifecell in general store, but I definately love this shipping service very well.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet, but please look at all the most recent ratings.  </li>
            <li> I am 84 years old, in good physical shape, but really needed something to help eliminate the lines on my face; inherited from my Dad.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li> This is much appreaciate!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but what you should be aware of is that once they have your credit card info they will charge you every month with 189 dollars until you cancel your card.</li>
            <li> The first time I did purchase from the company and then cancelled.</li>
            <li> Read first don&#x27;t complain later.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first two weeks I didn&#x27;t notice any change.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and noticed a difference immediately, especially in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> At first it appears to work then after a week or so</li>
            <li> I began using it at first just for daytime.  </li>
            <li> Like with any product being consistent helps.</li>
            <li> Not a substitute for a surgical facelift but most definitely a lift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have anticipated for my first time usage with Lifecell.</li>
            <li> First let me say this is not a fake review staged by LifeCell, secondly this is the first review I have ever left which is surprising because I do ALL my shopping online.  </li>
            <li> Lots of creams I’ve had would only last a couple of weeks; lifecell gives a good amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li> Get online and you will find a lot of positive comments on the product.</li>
            <li> online positive review sites written by South Beach themselves.</li>
            <li> but ebay doesn&#x27;t list this product on their rejuvenation cream pages, maybe because ebay would never tolerate a 29 per cent positive feedback rating.</li>
            <li> Now, these are real reviews from real people!</li>
            <li> Having said that, I am getting compliments on how good I look and can see a small difference.  </li>
            <li> To my mind, if a company has a superior product, they would be assured that the customers who try the \\&quot;30 day trial\\&quot; would be so enamored with their products that they wouldn&#x27;t need to use shady business practices in order to make money.  </li>
            <li> I look 5 years younger and my skin has become more vibrant.</li>
            <li> The single most reliable assessment I&#x27;ve ever heard of anti-aging products applies to this one--&#x27;it works for some people but not everyone.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> maybe it doesn&#x27;t work after a certain age ?</li>
            <li> I still have fine lines of course, but I do not expect those to diminish this soon after starting the product.  </li>
            <li> I used as directed morning and night and noticed that my skin was very dry in the morning and more wrinkled than when I use my Olay Regenerest Micro sculpting cream.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little, and produces GREAT results.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for all the reviews .</li>
            <li> Thanks for all the reviews I&#x27;m NOT buying.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that if you ordered a free trial and DID NOT cancel after 30 days, you will continue to be charged in future months.  </li>
            <li> and it was a real</li>
            <li> and I was hoping the hype was for real.......</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for wrinkles, crows feet, tightening skin, nothing at all.</li>
            <li> A product that works well does not have to advertise so much.</li>
            <li> So like Cinderella at midnight, you take off your makeup and see the real you.  </li>
            <li> , I really don&#x27;t know that I can afford to keep using it, I have no idea what they put in it to make it so pricy, but if i could afford it I would use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I really like the LifeCell Anti-Aging Wrinkle South Beach Skin Care product.  </li>
            <li> but really is THAT</li>
            <li> what you&#x27;re really all about?  </li>
            <li> and i share my opinion after tried to post the ready content for review the product</li>
            <li> WAY to much money</li>
            <li> This ceam does absolutely nothing except drain your wallet.</li>
            <li> So much softer...</li>
            <li> no results.&lt;br /&gt;Too much money for it not to work.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Inc.  I was ready to pull the handle for this \\&quot;revolutionary\\&quot; product and enter my credit card info.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have that much in the account.</li>
            <li> The Olay does keep me moisturized all night and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Too much for this teacher.  </li>
            <li> you probably won&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> Thanks for my mother gift it to me</li>
            <li> Before you drop a lot of cash on this, it&#x27;s a good idea to pay attention to all the negative reviews of it in the Amazon comment section.</li>
            <li> When will people begin concentrating on more important meaningful things and quit staring adoringly at their own reflections in the mirror day after day, while also believing themselves to have all sorts of dreadful flaws like wrinkles and some sagging skin?  </li>
            <li> Of course you&#x27;ll need to buy an endless supply of this \\&quot;magic in a tube.\\</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem much better than any other moisturizer</li>
            <li> It does not work any better than any other moisturizer that you can buy over the counter.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products on the market and like its results over theirs.</li>
            <li> It simply works and you can really see that form the very first time you use it.</li>
            <li> Not only did I not receive anything, sample or full size, my credit card was charged $189.  </li>
            <li> You live and learn!</li>
            <li> MAKES YOU LOOK 20 YEARS OLDER.  </li>
            <li> You will be lucky if you get your money back in one call without yelling over the robot you are taking to.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to all of the ladies.  </li>
            <li> I will be reporting this company to the BBB; I highly recommend that everyone else do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought Lancome&#x27;s Ultimate Rose Elixir, an even more expensive face cream</li>
            <li> like the way it feels and soaks in fast, but don&#x27;t see any difference yet as far as firming or wrinkle improvement</li>
            <li> I returned it and ended up buying an Australian mdae organic cream which leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and smooth every day and only cost $25.00.  </li>
            <li> have resumed using my Natural Advantage Retinol based cream and my face feels and looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> PRODUCT ACTUALLY MADE UNDER EYES DRY AND MORE WRINKLES .</li>
            <li> After I finally ran out a couple years later, I decided to try some other products instead --- but have to say, nothing felt as good.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a fair chance, well, after spending over 400.00 almost on 2 tubes, it has NOT done a single thing for me, I did not just buy it and quit after a week or so, I have been using this for a few months and NOTHING at all has changed.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my new skin doctor - who is also a plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Now, I am planning to get a new one from here.</li>
            <li> Live and learn~</li>
            <li> After two weeks I enjoy just using one product and a very minimal amount.</li>
            <li> It really surprises me to see all the negative reviews on this product, as this product has worked FANTASTIC for me!  </li>
            <li> I am a young looking 63 with my main problem being some wrinkling under my eyes, that has just started.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> After four faithful weeks with daily progressive photos taken in exact location with measured distance, I have proof</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I love it and have been using it for the past two years.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I used the Lifecell cream for 30 days - twice daily and exactly as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;There was no improvement in my skin texture or reduction of wrinkles or the appearance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> Be aware of the so called &amp;#34;free 30 day trial offer&amp;#34;, I thought I was only paying 4.99 for the shipping and handling, just as the advertisement stated, I put in my credit card info, and they tried to charge me 189.00.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this first from company and asked very specific questions.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and have tried everything regardless of price - this product is my favourite!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of natural things for much less than this that can help moisturize the skin - things as easy as olive oil.</li>
            <li> I am not very wrinkled and in fact already look pretty good for my age, which is 67, but I fell for all this hype hook line and sinker duh!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second tube and can see and feel positive differences.  </li>
            <li> Makes a lot of false promises and super cheap packaging for 189.00</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a month, so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to know for sure, but so far, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It goes on and is dry right away.  </li>
            <li> Despite cancelling any future purchases, I was repeatedly charged large amounts I didn&#x27;t authorize.</li>
            <li> Just to be clear, I have not purchased or used this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 38 year old women who has had a complete hysterectomy, so my skin has made a complete change from hormones.  </li>
            <li> Lots of flaking, then clear skin.</li>
            <li> Just thinkin&#x27; out loud...</li>
            <li> ITS A COMPLETE SCAM</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my skin didn&#x27;t feel as soft as when I was using Boots #7 products.  </li>
            <li> I tried this because a 75 year old friend who has done everything to fight aging recommended it.  </li>
            <li> WOW....</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and no one can believe I am that old.</li>
            <li> My skin has been so soft and my budding age spots have begun to disappear.</li>
            <li> Youthful beauty is reserved for those who ARE young.</li>
            <li> my membership/subscription because I used the product much slower than their regular shipments.  </li>
            <li> like - leaves skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> This product did not come with we&#x27;ll constructed instructions, I found the product to be very drying to my skin but the directions offered nothing in the way of what to do or next steps to counter the drying effect.</li>
            <li> This whole thing is one big scam!</li>
            <li> Not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> People comment on my skin routinely with regard to how few wrinkles I have and how smooth my skin is.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft, moisturized, and even toned.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for a friend and he loves it so far.</li>
            <li> And LC is Not a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of dodging LC countless sales calls with more &amp;#34;offers&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The packaging I liked until it slipped behind the bathroom counter drawer.</li>
            <li> All these options are less expensive (if you use Groupon or Living social), and are more effective.</li>
            <li> I researched a couple of reviewers of this product and as an example, &amp;#34;Jordan&amp;#34; has other reviews and this &amp;#34;person&amp;#34; reviews both woman&#x27;s and men&#x27;s products so it is very suspicious to me that this is a REAL PERSON.</li>
            <li> Like previous posts, it says that it stated that I had to return the product after the 30 day trial if I didn&#x27;t want to be charged the full amount.  </li>
            <li> In reply to Lynda&#x27;s “LYNDA”comment, I don&#x27;t usually write reviews either but just has to tell you a big thank you, I too ended up having more wrinkles than I started with and stopped using this product.</li>
            <li> I have seen great results since using this product and I am usually very skeptical.</li>
            <li> My friend did receive the sample and found it to be nothing exciting, certainly not worth $189.</li>
            <li> SORRY, I expected great things based on the recommendations, but nothing happened.  </li>
            <li> , I honestly expected some positive results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did not see any major changes.</li>
            <li> In my case, it turned out to be a major rip off.</li>
            <li> If you are young and your skin is still pretty tight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old with lines around my eyes and upper lip.</li>
            <li> and now I can barely see them</li>
            <li> I have warned my friends to stay as far away from this product as possible as it will become like a cancer in their computer!</li>
            <li> When will they stop believing that if a product promises to return them to their once youthful appearance (only happens when you&#x27;re young)</li>
            <li> After using Lifecell my wrinkles are definitely lessening and my skin feels really soft and supple and it looks brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> used for three months straight, not much difference in my skin after that amount of time.  </li>
            <li> though Lifecell has a satisfaction guarantee, it is only returnable/refundable if you buy directly from Lifecell/South Beach.&lt;br /&gt;South</li>
            <li> Makes my skin younger looking and so soft.</li>
            <li> Humankind is WAY TOO obsessed with their own image, their perceived flaws, and staying 25 forever.  </li>
            <li> Kind of expensive though.</li>
            <li> None of this stuff works or does what it says it does, but it is no worse than any other so called anti-Aging cream</li>
            <li> My facial skin has gotten a little less \\&quot;energetic\\&quot; and Lifecell tightens things up better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> And to just blindly speculate, notwithstanding their glowing list of really amazing ingredients, what&#x27;s actually in this cream and where is it made?</li>
            <li> I thought it made my skin soft and moist but it did nothing above what my daily moisturizer would do and my over the counter moisturizer is a lot cheaper.  </li>
            <li> 3 times before I finally called the company (and usually the vm is full) and spoke to someone who stopped the orders four months ago...</li>
            <li> and I look much more like myself (as opposed to that tired looking stranger I&#x27;ve been seeing recently).  </li>
            <li> you can look fresher with facial fillers or face lift there is no other way.</li>
            <li> I decided to do a little sleuthing around on the internet first.  </li>
            <li> Skin is less lax, fine lines less noticeable  </li>
            <li> I first started to order the trial online at lifecellcream.com, but had to stop and return to my computer a little later to start the process</li>
            <li> There is no better product on the market right now unless of course you pay some bloated cost.</li>
            <li> have really dry sensitive skin and it moisturize my skin without making it shiny or sticky..</li>
            <li> too much money, could find it for less</li>
            <li> In my 50&#x27;s, wrinkles and lines are harder and harder to hide - this really helps!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery but very slow reply from the company when I developed a reaction to their product.</li>
            <li> Considering the very high price and the promises made, I will not purchase again as I see no significant change in the look or feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> after reading many reviews, I was expecting at least a little something, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> well, I am done spending my money I work for to get  ripped off on a product that is a scam more or less, who does that seriously to a working person</li>
            <li> I believe this is false advertising implying the product is free when it is not.  </li>
            <li> so I tried life cell, laugh lines got toned down and dark circles did vanish, but I started breaking out</li>
            <li> There are a number of highly rated skin care products out there, and my guess is that they cost less than $189 a tube.  </li>
            <li> My feedback is just like all the other negative feedback--quasi-concealed terms and conditions, wildly over-priced, ineffective and useless, a web page composed of nothing but puff, and frequently misleading at that--the nobel laureates actually talking about something else--highly questionable effusive praise for this amazing product from Dave P. from Pittsburgh or  Darlene C. from Phoenix, their own before/after photos showing little or no difference, a before/after photo of a woman apparently in her 60&#x27;s who&#x27;s clearly had a face lift instead, or another man who looks like he&#x27;s just had a peal--they can get images from anywhere, can&#x27;t they--</li>
            <li> This product made slight changes to my face in a good way, and made slight changes in a bad way as well, I&#x27;m 32 and noticed the fine lines and dark circles coming in</li>
            <li> never use any other product keeps skin young and refreshed</li>
            <li> I have been using LifeCell for over a year, and there is  an enormous difference in my appearance; far less lines.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a small percentage of women have a type of skin, like mine, where it is really miraculous in erasing wrinkles?  </li>
            <li> I called customer service just to thank them and rave some more...and to make a long story short, she gave discounts to all of us!</li>
            <li> It has enough moisture for skin that is in dry climate, and 65 yrs.</li>
            <li> It was really oddly thick and just not a nice feel on the skin, I thought it would not send us more until I would order it</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing but break me out, caused a red itchy rash and caused me serious hassles.</li>
            <li> What are the chances that most of the five star reviews include a first name only and have terrible English.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I began to see the long term effect.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, save your money for less expensive products that work so, so much better.</li>
            <li> The company is impossible to reach and you will not be able to get your money back.</li>
            <li> Also it makes my face really look dull, not vibrant at all.  </li>
            <li> go to your local drug store &amp; give other products a chance.  </li>
            <li> This cream is expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel dry.  </li>
            <li> This cream does nothing for your wrinkles except dry out your skin and emphasize the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> With Life cell I also felt dry in the morning and had to use another moisturizer also.</li>
            <li> I was dubious about the hype on this product, plus my allergies make all but the most expensive a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I’m not very old to be using wrinkle cream, at least I don’t think I am very old.</li>
            <li> I have found Lifecell anti aging wrinkle  to reduce the wrinkles I have developed over the past 70+ years.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and a half, and only get compliments on how young my skin looks, and how small the pores are.</li>
            <li> Their membership for $189.00 fee is hidden in their website to make you believe you are simply getting a trial, but it is a monthly charge with a membership.  </li>
            <li> I find the moisturizer to be different from my previous purchases of LifeCell - the packaging</li>
            <li> It does not make wrinkles less obvious nor does it even moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li> a friend introduced me to another product that is less expensive and actually works -- i&#x27;m getting fantastic results in less than 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and my skin has become very dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin was starting to get very dry, tight and noticeable wrinkles were popping up.</li>
            <li> If you notice the bad reviews, you will see that most of them have to do with billing or cost.</li>
            <li> Most of these complaints are not about  the product being bad, it&#x27;a about their billiing practices.</li>
            <li> The young woman wasn&#x27;t exactly rude, but tenacious in her attempt to charge my credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please be careful about this item if you buy it for the 30 day trial period.  </li>
            <li> I have used 4 bottles of this stuff and have spent a fortune on it, no</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a week &amp; it has just dried my skin.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I won&#x27;t have as much trouble getting my money back like</li>
            <li> The owners of this company should go to jail.  </li>
            <li> They are all from June 2015, they are all 5-star, and they all use the same types of phrases, like &amp;#34;formulation&amp;#34;, and the same type of poor English.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, I was aged 40, the circulation was slowing and the anti-aging cream still take time to get effect of smoothier to my face.</li>
            <li> I only started using this a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> I have used hundreds of products, but this actually made a difference I could see in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am open minded and I will try anything once, but this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It came as expected, well-packaged and on time.  </li>
            <li> It plain and simply doesn&#x27;t make any difference in your skin.  </li>
            <li> I could tell an improvement in my skin right away after using Lifecell, and even though it is quite expensive, I won&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
            <li> I am surprised as I read other people&#x27;s negative reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li> Previously, my skin is often dry.</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a change from my regular anti aging cream as it had very little effect on my screen until i came across this product.</li>
            <li> Very clever and slick presentation--these people whoever they are invested some serious money in their marketing program--but bandits from start to finish.</li>
            <li> I ordered Lifecell anti aging wrinkle cream and couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> CHECK YELP FOR OTHER REVIEWS</li>
            <li> Like every other product I just gave it a try</li>
            <li> Other companies have find this to me before when trying to return and cancel.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first due to no changes but once I continued to use the LifeCell</li>
            <li> , I never in my life had problems with acne before, a month into this product and small pimples just kept creeping in all different areas on my face, I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I am very careful about the products I use on my face.  </li>
            <li> A couple friends have spent big money on this product, but they&#x27;re completely negative about their experiences.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and have european skin, so it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to maintan my skin, but this felt worse.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist felt so bad for me that he treated me for free from the reaction I had from Life cell.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am a long time customer, this product usually comes sealed.</li>
            <li> It goes down to 149 a month</li>
            <li> Another beauty product scam to soak up our money without giving any results other than a lighter wallet &amp; wasted time.  </li>
            <li> I have provided previous reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> If I could have given this grease less than one star I would have.  </li>
            <li> My sister-in-law is has curious the secret that my appearance looks younger.</li>
            <li> Previously used SkinMedica and SkinCeuticals.</li>
            <li> It seems to reducing the slight puffiness I had under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I guess if you have a couple less wrinkles</li>
            <li> In less than a quater of a year</li>
            <li> Received pkg ,  it had been previously opened.  </li>
            <li> This is typical of a scam company.</li>
            <li> So, the effect is starting-up actively and few amount of wrinkles were reduced.</li>
            <li> However, face lifts and Botux injections are far more expensive and horribly invasive and don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Very strange to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Did not work even a little.</li>
            <li> he said it does no more than any other moisture cream...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is alright as a moisturizer; however, I think that the small results that you do see, is due to the Retin A that it contains.</li>
            <li> A customer service rep insisted that I use it a little longer to try since I had 120 days to return it.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT worth the money!</li>
            <li> It help both of us gradually reduce appearance of under-eye puffiness and dark circles!</li>
            <li> The cost is not justified.</li>
            <li> I did notice results after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Lifecell doesn&#x27;t work as a sun screen without heavy SPF effect.</li>
            <li> and it only gets worse.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> I thought that visible difference would go away in a few minutes or so.  </li>
            <li> Few weeks using it, but it is as was recommended.</li>
            <li> No wonder they advertise so heavily.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I am 72, have a thin face, thin skin and was starting to have lines setting in around my eyes and upper lip.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to waste a drop as it is pricey.</li>
            <li> After I used for 1 month, my appearance was looks radiant and get firm.</li>
            <li> But you&#x27;ll be dead so you won&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> But you&#x27;ll be dead so you won&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> NOT NOT FREE</li>
            <li> SO YOU DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  </li>
            <li> So once I had a few backup tubes, I canceled without a problem.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, its just a scam like all the others.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed that my frown lines between my eyes had lessened.  </li>
            <li> Used the product faithfully for a few weeks and see no change.</li>
            <li> As for the product itself, I saw no more results than the average over the counter moisturizer for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I say don&#x27;t even waste your time with a trial.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> So I went back to Life Cell which, although expensive, is half the price of the</li>
            <li> Not worth $189.00, a JOKE!!</li>
            <li> It is extremely overpriced and doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
            <li> It was terrible, I asked to send a little tester from the actual website and it was very inefficient.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this, it is NOT what they claim it to be and using celebrities to endorse their products is insane, I am sure they are NOT  using this product, why would they?</li>
            <li> I feel the offer was simply a scam to get money, and it is difficult to get out of their agreement.</li>
            <li> I cut the end of the tube in order to get every bit of the cream out and store it in a small container.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and neck before putting on my usual moisturizer and make-up.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied and trying to return to company.</li>
            <li> They always have a slick response when you call them on the misinformation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> the only difference is this is very expensive, its just like any other cream...</li>
            <li> The one negative, unfortunately, is that I can&#x27;t afford to spend $189.00 per container (I believe that is supposed to last 2 months)  - so $1134.00 per year.  </li>
            <li> The cream itself is actually not too bad and absorbs quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy or anything.  </li>
            <li> Keep your hard earned money in the bank.</li>
            <li> i feel i waisted my hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> , I had high expectations after doing my research on this product, I am terribly disappointed.......</li>
            <li> I can wash my face &amp; at least get a glow.</li>
            <li> After reading mostly negative reviews I will stay away from this product</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained of having repeated charges on their accounts.  </li>
            <li> My bank has marked them as fraud so that they are unable to illegally charge me again.</li>
            <li> and I get told at least three times a day</li>
            <li> I had high expectations since it was so widely advertised and was so pricey, but am very disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> I mean, do you think?  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t believe everything you see or hear and save your money for less expensive products that do work.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> So much less expensive also</li>
            <li> I really love this product, but hate, hate, hate the high price.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked when I noticed my younger appearance after used for a month.</li>
            <li> Guess there is no miracle topical out there!! :(</li>
            <li> Less money, less hassle, and you won&#x27;t feel like an idiot for believing the advertising HYPE for Life-Cell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> NOT FREE!!!</li>
            <li> This company is criminal.  </li>
            <li> She is eagerly to what&#x27;s the secret that I used since 1 month.</li>
            <li> In fact, it made the lines worse.  </li>
            <li> The texture is hard to describe but it pits a very thin film between the skin and makeup that feels like silk.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product it did not live up to the hype</li>
            <li> I had a real mess in an awkward spot.</li>
            <li> not to mention it dried out my skin badly.  </li>
            <li> Beauty fades, folks, but dumb is forever!</li>
            <li> Seriously start monitoring your reviews or your rating system will be meaningless!</li>
            <li> The sales tactics are highly questionable.</li>
            <li> but it is too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> Remember it does not have to be expensive to work for our skin.  </li>
            <li> Price wouldn&#x27;t matter if it worked as supposed to, but having the opposite effect is terrible.</li>
            <li> Last shipment made me break out in a terrible itchy rash.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use it for any length of time.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> The biggest drawback is that it is so expensive</li>
            <li> I will say it is expensive, but when you take into consideration that this cream is the eye cream, wrinkle cream, moisturizer ALL IN ONE...</li>
            <li> I would say give it a try, you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptical person</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a scam, unfortunately authorized by our governments.  </li>
            <li> don’t buy anything from this company, products are lousy quality</li>
            <li> Sorry, that&#x27;s the deal, no exceptions.</li>
            <li> I am truly sorry to give this a 1 star.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a bottom of the line wanabe anti-aging cream, but they have the nerve to charge premium prices; added to that they have worst costumer services and advert policies.</li>
            <li> Definitely not impressed.  </li>
            <li> and I would never EVER use it as I am sick &amp; tired of their offensive, tasteless forced advertisements.</li>
            <li> Poor and Useless product!</li>
            <li> A very expensive rip-off.  </li>
            <li> It was the worst money I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> They are obviously fake ratings to compensate for all the bad ratings this product has received.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive to perform so badly.</li>
            <li> #34;free trial,&amp;#34; plus, the trial was disappointing and drying.  </li>
            <li> Whoever thinks this stuff works is crazy.</li>
            <li> I did not see any of the claimed results and it was very expensive.....</li>
            <li> The product does not work and is basically a very expensive cream.</li>
            <li> Impossible.  </li>
            <li> Like a bad joke.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t understand the bad reviews for this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the bad reviews on this product except maybe on account of the differences of people&#x27;s skin?&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> It was a painful lesson considering the atrocious cost of this</li>
            <li> though doubtful.</li>
            <li> I was given bad information!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been very disappointed with this product after reading all the information on the product!  </li>

            <li> I purchased the Lifecell free 30 day sample which I paid the shipping of $ 4.25 on March 17 2015.  It didn&#x27;t work for me but furthermore I was notified 30 days later that I needed to pay a charge of 189.00 for the product.  I believe this is false advertising implying the product is free when it is not.  Please be careful about this item if you buy it for the 30 day trial period.  Keep in contact with them and cancel if you don&#x27;t see any results.  Better yet don&#x27;t purchase under the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; advertisement because it might not be free!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good  product.  Overpriced.</li>
            <li> I am using LifeCell All In One, but can&#x27;t tell any difference at this time. Will continue using and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> My name is Mary and I&#x27;m using my husband&#x27;s account to write this review. I am returning the product today, as I see no difference at all in my skin after four weeks. Two contacts with representatives also left me feeling almost harassed. I first started to order the trial online at lifecellcream.com, but had to stop and return to my computer a little later to start the process over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After completing the order the second time around, a representative called my home number within an hour asking me why I decided not to get the trial - was it because of cost? I told him I had ordered the trial and had the confirmation email. I have since been bombarded by emails from this company. Bottom line - I did not appreciate a salesperson calling my home to inquire why I had not purchased their product, based on my first attempt! If I hadn&#x27;t ordered the product, that&#x27;s my business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally get the product, try it and feel nothing, no tingling sensation, no 17-second change in the appearance of my skin. The cream does have a nice, non-greasy consistency that absorbs quickly. However, after 4 weeks, I see no change in my skin or wrinkles. I&#x27;m 52 years old with lines around my eyes and upper lip. No change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called to return the product just now (you have to call to get the return information; it&#x27;s not included in your product packaging...), I was again asked why I was returning the product and was read a script about how some skin takes longer to see results and I had 120 days to try it and get my money back, and on and on. I had to talk over her to get her to stop reading the script and state explicitly and loudly a third time that I did NOT want my credit card charged and I will be returning the product. The young woman wasn&#x27;t exactly rude, but tenacious in her attempt to charge my credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this product is no different than anything else over the counter. The cost is not justified. The sales tactics are highly questionable. I&#x27;m heading to the Post Office now. I want it returned before they try to charge my card. Oh, the rep also stressed strongly to be sure to include a tracking number with the return, as they won&#x27;t provide a refund if the package is lost and doesn&#x27;t have a tracking number. I wonder... if you don&#x27;t pay for tracking, do returns have a higher chance of getting lost... Just thinkin&#x27; out loud...questionable. I&#x27;m heading to the Post Office now.

            <li> I love it but it is too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I have used 4 bottles of this stuff and have spent a fortune on it, no it doesn&#x27;t improve any wrinkles no matter what people are saying, they need to put on their glasses if they think that it does.  Also it makes my face really look dull, not vibrant at all.  Nuvaderm is the best product out there.</li>
            <li> This cream does nothing to help wrinkles or skin.  Nothing!  I feel the offer was simply a scam to get money, and it is difficult to get out of their agreement.</li>
            <li> I thought it made my skin soft and moist but it did nothing above what my daily moisturizer would do and my over the counter moisturizer is a lot cheaper.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a week &amp; it has just dried my skin. My face has no glow what so ever. I can wash my face &amp; at least get a glow. It is nothing like it says. I&#x27;m sending it back. Hopefully I won&#x27;t have as much trouble getting my money back like some of the people have. If they send me another one, it will automaticaly be sent back.</li>
            <li> I ordered the $4 sample. Not only did I not receive anything, sample or full size, my credit card was charged $189.  I am in the process of having it formally disputed which is a time consuming hassle in itself, for a product I never even received. My friend did receive the sample and found it to be nothing exciting, certainly not worth $189. He states it is equivalent to any Oil of Olay or Neutragena product. Just another hype. One more of Dr Oz&#x27;s kick backs. If you ever have the time, explore some of the comments from physicians who state that can&#x27;t believe he hasn&#x27;t lost his license.</li>
            <li> This company is criminal.  This is a fraudulent company with fraudulent claims!  The product does not work and then they bill your credit card over and over for more of their fake product.  After I told my bank that I did not authorize Lifecell to debit my account, they changed the name of the company and kept charging me!!  The owners of this company should go to jail.  Do not give them any of your money - and AMAZON you need to stop advertising for them!</li>
            <li> I have been using St. Ives that has collagen dermatologists promote. Get online and you will find a lot of positive comments on the product. Remember it does not have to be expensive to work for our skin.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Not worth $189.00, a JOKE!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for all the reviews . After reading mostly negative reviews I will stay away from this product</li>
            <li> Another beauty product scam to soak up our money without giving any results other than a lighter wallet &amp; wasted time.  After four faithful weeks with daily progressive photos taken in exact location with measured distance, I have proof This does not work.  And LC is Not a free sample.&lt;br /&gt;Instead of dodging LC countless sales calls with more &amp;#34;offers&amp;#34; go to your local drug store &amp; give other products a chance.  Olay has been around forever and has proven results. Less money, less hassle, and you won&#x27;t feel like an idiot for believing the advertising HYPE for Life-Cell.</li>
            <li> I have the item for almost one month and no sign of any results. Still waiting.</li>
            <li> Thanks for all the reviews I&#x27;m NOT buying.</li>
            <li> Although can&#x27;t buy Lifecell in general store, but I definately love this shipping service very well. The anti-aging product is working good on my face or hand, it gives me another new looks when I show my face on public. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lifecell cream for 6 months without any regretful. It helps to reduce my skin discoloration and my face has being lift up. Now, my appearance looks younger and healthier weekly!</li>
            <li> Just to be clear, I have not purchased or used this product. I just find it disconcerting that companies like this are clearly  leaving their own unverified, five star reviews. What are the chances that most of the five star reviews include a first name only and have terrible English.</li>
            <li> In reply to Lynda&#x27;s “LYNDA”comment, I don&#x27;t usually write reviews either but just has to tell you a big thank you, I too ended up having more wrinkles than I started with and stopped using this product. Price wouldn&#x27;t matter if it worked as supposed to, but having the opposite effect is terrible. Makes me wonder how many more of us are out there who had this problem.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  Unlike many reviewers I notice a difference in very fine lines and all over evening out my skin tone. I did notice results after a few minutes. I&#x27;m sixty and I will continue ordering this product.  Some reviewers complained of having repeated charges on their accounts.  Keep in mind that if you ordered a free trial and DID NOT cancel after 30 days, you will continue to be charged in future months.  That is an automatic payment plan.  I&#x27;ve used probably 80 products over the years and I think this is the best!</li>
            <li> Lifecell doesn&#x27;t work as a sun screen without heavy SPF effect. Its function as sunscreen as well. Overall, the product result is great and delivers on just described in the product description. It smoothies my fine line and wrinkle.</li>
            <li> never use any other product keeps skin young and refreshed</li>
            <li> What a BIG FAT CON. I ordered this product and waited forever for it to be delivered.  Used it twice daily as recommended and NADA NOTHING.  I am not very wrinkled and in fact already look pretty good for my age, which is 67, but I fell for all this hype hook line and sinker duh!  Don&#x27;t say you haven&#x27;t been warned, it doesn&#x27;t work simple as that.  Keep your hard earned money in the bank.</li>
            <li> the only difference is this is very expensive, its just like any other cream... found no difference....</li>
            <li> love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have really dry sensitive skin and it moisturize my skin without making it shiny or sticky.. just like magic!!&lt;br /&gt;and I had some sun damage and light spots after having 2 kids and now I can barely see them</li>
            <li> Lifecell works great, 2.54 is enough to last awhile. Lots of creams I’ve had would only last a couple of weeks; lifecell gives a good amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have provided previous reviews of this product. I used it for a couple of years and it was good for my sensitive skin. Not any more. Last shipment made me break out in a terrible itchy rash. So off to the garbage it went. It was a painful lesson considering the atrocious cost of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now switched to Repechage which I find to be absolutely awesome. It was recommended by my new skin doctor - who is also a plastic surgeon. It has been around for many years and he swears by it. Now I do too - Repechage is BY FAR a more superior product. And a fraction of the cost. And I get a lot more comments on how great and smooth my skin looks.</li>
            <li> I gave it a fair chance, well, after spending over 400.00 almost on 2 tubes, it has NOT done a single thing for me, I did not just buy it and quit after a week or so, I have been using this for a few months and NOTHING at all has changed. In fact, I received a free sample of the face cleanser and I swear, I thought I was washing my face with cheap dollar store dish detergent. I am a fair person, I feel if you spend that amount of money that you should be pleased at the results, they claim this is fantastic product, well in my own personal experience, it did absolutely NOTHING for me at all and I have used it 3 times a day for months. Don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money on this, it is NOT what they claim it to be and using celebrities to endorse their products is insane, I am sure they are NOT  using this product, why would they? IT don&#x27;t work.........I tried and been fair about giving it a chance well, I am done spending my money I work for to get  ripped off on a product that is a scam more or less, who does that seriously to a working person, I had high expectations after doing my research on this product, I am terribly disappointed.......please think twice about buying this......</li>
            <li> If I could have given this grease less than one star I would have.  ITS A COMPLETE SCAM</li>
            <li> This skin care didnt work for me. I was unable to use it for any length of time.I had an allergic reaction .</li>
            <li> Wow! I have seen great results since using this product and I am usually very skeptical.</li>
            <li> works just fine for my wife</li>
            <li> There is no better product on the market right now unless of course you pay some bloated cost.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Lived up to my expectations with regard to removing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I did not see any of the claimed results and it was very expensive.....they claimed it would be so sudden too !....sorry</li>
            <li> The creamy product has minimized the wrinkles of advanced age and weight loss. Very happy how it makes me look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a month, so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to know for sure, but so far, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ll edit this review later, if anything changes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and a half, and only get compliments on how young my skin looks, and how small the pores are.</li>
            <li> I am being bombarded by lifecell advertising not only daily, But literally every 5 minutes an add for this pops up. This product could be the fountain of youth and I would never EVER use it as I am sick &amp; tired of their offensive, tasteless forced advertisements. I have tried everything to stop seei9ng this and it only gets worse. Like a bad joke. I have warned my friends to stay as far away from this product as possible as it will become like a cancer in their computer!</li>
            <li> Worked mainly as a good moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I don&#x27;t recommend this product, especially when you consider that it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s suppose to and the rediculous price. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Ladies. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  It plain and simply doesn&#x27;t make any difference in your skin.  I had high expectations since it was so widely advertised and was so pricey, but am very disappointed in the product.  It would sure be nice to find a wrinkle treatment that really does what it&#x27;s advertised to do, but Lifecell is definitely not that treatment.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet, but please look at all the most recent ratings.  They are all from June 2015, they are all 5-star, and they all use the same types of phrases, like &amp;#34;formulation&amp;#34;, and the same type of poor English.  They are obviously fake ratings to compensate for all the bad ratings this product has received.  I don&#x27;t know if this product works or not but it ANGERS me that someone is faking the reviews and trying to dupe the public.</li>
            <li> LifeCell great. Have not received applicator sticks or brush set below.</li>
            <li> I buy this product for both my sister and me. I got her hooked after giving her the first tube!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer yet...</li>
            <li> I am 84 years old, in good physical shape, but really needed something to help eliminate the lines on my face; inherited from my Dad.  Have been bothered with that since in my fifties.  I have been using LifeCell for over a year, and there is  an enormous difference in my appearance; far less lines.  The minute I put it on my face I see a difference.  When I first started using it I thought that visible difference would go away in a few minutes or so.  It didn&#x27;t.  I bought Lancome&#x27;s Ultimate Rose Elixir, an even more expensive face cream and it was a real dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an experiment ...  I wanted to test Lancome vs. Life Cell.  I stopped using Life Cell for a week and used only the Lancome product.  I quickly noticed that the benefits of Life Cell disappeared and lines reappeared!  Very strange to say the least.  So I went back to Life Cell which, although expensive, is half the price of the Lancome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t understand the bad reviews for this product.  Maybe a small percentage of women have a type of skin, like mine, where it is really miraculous in erasing wrinkles?  Has research been done on why  a minority of women find it fantastic and the majority say it doesn&#x27;t work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s expensive.  However, face lifts and Botux injections are far more expensive and horribly invasive and don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Did not work even a little. There was no change</li>
            <li> a total rip off don&#x27;t purchase this product</li>
            <li> I have found Lifecell anti aging wrinkle  to reduce the wrinkles I have developed over the past 70+ years.  One needs to try it to see for themself.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and I was hoping the hype was for real.......NOT for me. I used this twice a day as directed for over a month and didn&#x27;t see one iota of difference. I took pictures before I started and again after 30 day. No change whatsoever.  I also noticed that my skin didn&#x27;t feel as soft as when I was using Boots #7 products.  I&#x27;m definitely going back to Boots. So don&#x27;t believe everything you see or hear and save your money for less expensive products that do work.</li>
            <li> This is a bogus product that does not work.  Their membership for $189.00 fee is hidden in their website to make you believe you are simply getting a trial, but it is a monthly charge with a membership.  The product does not work and is basically a very expensive cream.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product. Few weeks using it, but it is as was recommended.</li>
            <li> One of the best creams I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Yes, it&#x27;s expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for wrinkles, crows feet, tightening skin, nothing at all. It was the worst money I have ever spent. No wonder they advertise so heavily. A product that works well does not have to advertise so much. They need to use those advertising dollars to revamp and totally redo their product. Do yourself a favor, save your money for less expensive products that work so, so much better.</li>
            <li> I ordered Lifecell anti aging wrinkle cream and couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed. I see no change in my skin,,.. and it is not as moisturizing as they claimed it to be. Not worth the money. I get more results from Olay ProX cream... and it is cheaper. Will not be reordering.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m 58 and very critical.  I tried this because a 75 year old friend who has done everything to fight aging recommended it.  She looked great.  I have not yet used it a month but I think it is working.  It does lighten your skin.  It does not promise to remove wrinkles, it promises to hide them.  So like Cinderella at midnight, you take off your makeup and see the real you.  Having said that, I am getting compliments on how good I look and can see a small difference.  So I will order again and see if I get improvement.  It is great for under make up.  I have very dry skin and it makes my skin feel dry.  The Costco Oil of Olay felt better from that point but didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> for everything it states, I feel it did not produce, a good skin cream yes I would agree but nothing that made me go WOW....not the drastic difference that it said it would deliver...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to see a difference; it claims to basically be instantly noticeable, however I couldn&#x27;t see any difference yet and it&#x27;s been a few weeks now.  WAY too costly given that it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Dont buy Life Cell products they are cheaters and they say free and they will charge 189 dollars. Without your knowledge they will send more items to you and they will charge to the credit card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I request everyone dont buy this item and dont fall in the trap.</li>
            <li> I’m not very old to be using wrinkle cream, at least I don’t think I am very old. But even at younger ages lifecell can make a big difference</li>
            <li> The single most reliable assessment I&#x27;ve ever heard of anti-aging products applies to this one--&#x27;it works for some people but not everyone.&#x27;  It works for me.</li>
            <li> Save your money!  It doesn&#x27;t work!  I would not purchase again.  I have been very disappointed with this product after reading all the information on the product!  Doesn&#x27;t do a thing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but is over priced. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and don&#x27;t see a noticeable improvement so no re-order...</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and no one can believe I am that old. I can tell some of the lighter wrinkles have disappeared since using LifeCell. It takes the place of several creams.</li>
            <li> I got this product from one of their fancy banners online, and have been really impressed. My skin has been so soft and my budding age spots have begun to disappear. Its no joke that this must be what all those celebrities use to keep themselves looking young into their old age because this stuff is pretty awesome. The biggest drawback is that it is so expensive, I really don&#x27;t know that I can afford to keep using it, I have no idea what they put in it to make it so pricy, but if i could afford it I would use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I am 72, have a thin face, thin skin and was starting to have lines setting in around my eyes and upper lip. They have practically disappeared. Have been using Lifecell since Dec. Began my second tube in the middle of March. I cut the end of the tube in order to get every bit of the cream out and store it in a small container. Don&#x27;t want to waste a drop as it is pricey. I recommend buying it on Amazon because the Life Cell company will automatically send a tube Every Month. Read the fine print.</li>
            <li> I was dubious about the hype on this product, plus my allergies make all but the most expensive a waste of money. However something was very interesting about my friend&#x27;s comments in the last month: &amp;#34; you look terrific&amp;#34; and &amp;#34; you are looking good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;were heard several times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the texture of the cream right out of the tube, warm it with your fingers and spread it all over with no greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Best news was that my allergies are fine with it, and I am happy with the moderate price.</li>
            <li> Love it not sticky or oily in the heat of the summer.  My makeup stays on longer.</li>
            <li> Marketing lies... when you get a 5 star review you can bet it&#x27;s someone connected with the product..  I asked a dermatologist about this Life Cell&lt;br /&gt;and he said it does no more than any other moisture cream... you can look fresher with facial fillers or face lift there is no other way.</li>
            <li> First let me say this is not a fake review staged by LifeCell, secondly this is the first review I have ever left which is surprising because I do ALL my shopping online.  So now about the product....I am a 38 year old women who has had a complete hysterectomy, so my skin has made a complete change from hormones.  It really surprises me to see all the negative reviews on this product, as this product has worked FANTASTIC for me!  I use it twice a day, and my face looks and feels incredible.  The wrinkles around my eyes are gone and my laugh lines around my mouth have almost disappeared also.  It only takes a little, and produces GREAT results.  I will say it is expensive, but when you take into consideration that this cream is the eye cream, wrinkle cream, moisturizer ALL IN ONE...it is worth it.  I would say give it a try, you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for result. Irritated skin</li>
            <li> This is the best gift that I have received from my mom.  She is lookism person. Perhaps I was being heritable by her talent gene, I am a lookism person as well. After I used for 1 month, my appearance was looks radiant and get firm. Lifecell has reduce my wrinkle and faded fine lines. Now, I am planning to get a new one from here. Wish my sharing can help.</li>
            <li> Good product, delivers wat it promises</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law is has curious the secret that my appearance looks younger. She is eagerly to what&#x27;s the secret that I used since 1 month. I am glad that LifeCell formula has great result for me because I used many brand which does not cause any result to me. LifeCell moturize my skin and reduce my appearance of discolorations and imperfections. This is much appreaciate!</li>
            <li> I received the anti-aging cream on 14th day after I requested a trial from seller. I&#x27;m a skeptical person and I had considered a lot of problems before I order this. With the encouragement by my mother and sister, so I decided to order it, they also a fan of LifeCell user, actually. From 1st day until 7th day, my wrinkle still obviously shown. Then, I persist to use it because I already paid and want to prove something. Perhaps, I was aged 40, the circulation was slowing and the anti-aging cream still take time to get effect of smoothier to my face. I remind myself never give up and continue applied until the middle of 2nd months. I could feel my face muscle has tighten and sometimes is itches! So, the effect is starting-up actively and few amount of wrinkles were reduced. In additional, my face was become smoothies and moturize after wash face with facial foam every time. Even though it takes time, but it still work and worth for me. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like the LifeCell Anti-Aging Wrinkle South Beach Skin Care product.  It is rated the #1 best anti-aging wrinkle South Beach Skin Care of all the anti-aging products on the market today.  I highly recommend this product to all of the ladies.  Barbara</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I have ever tried. I love it and have been using it for the past two years. If you notice the bad reviews, you will see that most of them have to do with billing or cost. All I can say is it is the best product I have ever used!!!! Previously used SkinMedica and SkinCeuticals. These products cost way more!</li>
            <li> Previously, my skin is often dry. In one accident is one friend I recommend this product. I have used it are one month and I see really effective. My skin has become smoother and more elastic. This really is a good product and I will continue using it in the future.</li>
            <li> I saw an ad for lifecell in US weekly, and decided to order it off of Amazon. Very effective product and I’m glad I took a chance on it</li>
            <li> I researched a couple of reviewers of this product and as an example, &amp;#34;Jordan&amp;#34; has other reviews and this &amp;#34;person&amp;#34; reviews both woman&#x27;s and men&#x27;s products so it is very suspicious to me that this is a REAL PERSON. He/She reviewed a plus sized woman&#x27;s long-sleeve cardigan she loves to wear, but then also reviews a performance enhancing pill &amp;#34;My wife finally told me to try this.&amp;#34; WHICH GOES TO SHOW THAT MOST OF THESE REVIEWS OF LIFECELL MAY ALSO BE BOGUS! Best way to make your own conclusions is to click on a reviewer&#x27;s name and see what else they have reviewed and if their reviews are skewed in any way to be false. I too wanted this to be a great product but now I will pass.</li>
            <li> Lots of flaking, then clear skin.</li>
            <li> I only started using this a few days ago.  I put it on my face and neck before putting on my usual moisturizer and make-up.  My skin feels smoother and firmer already.  It seems to reducing the slight puffiness I had under my eyes.  So far, I am very pleased with the results and am looking forward to my continued use.  I&#x27;ll have to wait and see if this will reduce or remove my liver spots.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this cream, why not, it was a trial period for 30 days.  I used it faithfully from the day I received it.  The cream itself is actually not too bad and absorbs quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy or anything.  I was hopeful that it would work to some degree.  I have not seen any results like they are advertising, not even a close comparison. It&#x27;s just like an over-priced moisturizer!  Very disappointed.  Then came the really nice credit card charge of 252.86.  Like previous posts, it says that it stated that I had to return the product after the 30 day trial if I didn&#x27;t want to be charged the full amount.  What is the point of the trial period if they are going to charge you regardless of whether or want it or not?  I think it&#x27;s a scam, unfortunately authorized by our governments.  Had to have the return procedures emailed to me in order to return the product.  Not one call, follow up from this company at all during this time.  Just charge the card and hope I don&#x27;t say anything???  What a joke!</li>
            <li> This Treatment Totally change my skin texture. I love really happy with this buy. I use this after I wash my face in the morning. It seems to have improved the texture of my skin. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> on second bottle.  like the way it feels and soaks in fast, but don&#x27;t see any difference yet as far as firming or wrinkle improvement</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product it did not live up to the hype and you can get as good or better results buying anti-aging cream at your local retail or drug store I would not recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I was really struggling to find a good product to make my skin look better, so I was very happy to find LifeCell. I&#x27;ve been using it faithfully for about a month now and I can see the change in the quality of my features, especially around eyes and mouth. I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> don’t buy anything from this company, products are lousy quality but what you should be aware of is that once they have your credit card info they will charge you every month with 189 dollars until you cancel your card. Someone must stop them this is a scam!!!</li>
            <li> When oh when will humankind STOP believing in the Fountain of Youth?!  Never, I guess.  When will they stop believing that if a product promises to return them to their once youthful appearance (only happens when you&#x27;re young) it&#x27;s snake oil?  When will people stop being so vain and realize that aging is not a BAD thing, and that no one looks 25 forever?  When will people begin concentrating on more important meaningful things and quit staring adoringly at their own reflections in the mirror day after day, while also believing themselves to have all sorts of dreadful flaws like wrinkles and some sagging skin?  Beauty fades, folks, but dumb is forever! Youthful beauty is reserved for those who ARE young. If that&#x27;s not you, then stop trying to recapture something you can never have again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend gave me a free sample of this stuff (she had two for some reason).  I used it for the heck of it and all it did was irritate my skin.  Of course, I could have been allergic to one of the ingredients.  I used it for awhile then stopped because of reddening skin.  If this worked for you and you feel that you now look \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; then fine. Of course you&#x27;ll need to buy an endless supply of this \\&quot;magic in a tube.\\&quot; I guess if you have a couple less wrinkles and you feel amazing because of it, that&#x27;s okay but really is THAT what you&#x27;re really all about?  Wow!  Humankind is WAY TOO obsessed with their own image, their perceived flaws, and staying 25 forever.  Can&#x27;t be done. Impossible.  You are the age you are and you CANNOT change that fact! You also cannot look 25 when you&#x27;re 50.  You can&#x27;t look 25 except when you ARE 25.  Some people can get away with it for a couple more years, but Mother Nature means for us to age.  Everything ages and eventually dies.  Sorry, that&#x27;s the deal, no exceptions. Get on to something else because it&#x27;s later than you think.  And really, you get absolutely nothing for being the most unwrinkled, smooth-faced person in the morgue - if you happen to go there in that condition.  Well, maybe those who work there will look at your naked body and say, \\&quot;My, didn&#x27;t they look good for their age.\\&quot;  But you&#x27;ll be dead so you won&#x27;t know. Seriously.o there in that condition.  Well, maybe those who work there will look at your naked body and say, \\&quot;My, didn&#x27;t they look good for their age.\\&quot;  But you&#x27;ll be dead so you won&#x27;t know. Seriously.</li>
            <li> Do not fall for this product line. I email requested terminating my account 3 times before I finally called the company (and usually the vm is full) and spoke to someone who stopped the orders four months ago...and today I started receiving it again!  Send for the free sample and you&#x27;re stuck for an automatic refill AND AUTOMATIC CREDIT CHARGE whether you like it or not.  The product itself is only just OK, I got just as good of results from drug-store products and a lower cost than 189.00!</li>
            <li> Do NOT give this company your financial information. I cancelled my 30 day trail after 7 days, returned the unused portion, and they still charged me! My bank has marked them as fraud so that they are unable to illegally charge me again. Thank goodness that I retained the email of cancellation; otherwise, I would of been out $189.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is alright as a moisturizer; however, I think that the small results that you do see, is due to the Retin A that it contains. Therefore, you would be better off going to a dermatologist and obtaining a Retin A perscription, getting a chemical peel, or having microdermabrasion done. All these options are less expensive (if you use Groupon or Living social), and are more effective. I will be reporting this company to the BBB; I highly recommend that everyone else do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO NOT recommend that anyone use this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this!!!! It is extremely overpriced and doesn&#x27;t work!!! Then try getting your money back- good luck.</li>
            <li> I am surprised as I read other people&#x27;s negative reviews of this product.  Maybe they were expecting it to do what a facelift will - it will not do that, nothing will.  I had a facelift 16 years ago, and I know that this surgery is not the only thing one needs in order to stay younger looking - we must also have a great skincare regimen.  I could tell an improvement in my skin right away after using Lifecell, and even though it is quite expensive, I won&#x27;t be without it now.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!  Best treatment I ever used and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the bad reviews on this product except maybe on account of the differences of people&#x27;s skin?&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m 52,  I&#x27;ve used the product for about 6 months and I absolutely LOVE it!  My skin was starting to get very dry, tight and noticeable wrinkles were popping up. After using Lifecell my wrinkles are definitely lessening and my skin feels really soft and supple and it looks brighter and healthier. I&#x27;m very happy with the product! The first time I did purchase from the company and then cancelled. It is explained that it&#x27;s a 3 month auto delivery program, I knew that because I read the information provided during the process. Read first don&#x27;t complain later.&lt;br /&gt;I continue to buy it online and my skin feels and looks better than it has in years!</li>
            <li> honestly, this s my first time used it one side of my face. i saw a diference between both sides immediately, for me, it was extremely impressive and has kept me around.i received this product from my friend. and i share my opinion after tried to post the ready content for review the product</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical about this product. I order it based on its good reviews for other people. The first two weeks I didn&#x27;t notice any change. A customer service rep insisted that I use it a little longer to try since I had 120 days to return it. I did just that and after two more weeks everyone was complimenting my skin. This product is great! Will definitely be recommending it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Just okay....used for three months straight, not much difference in my skin after that amount of time.  Guess there is no miracle topical out there!! :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem much better than any other moisturizer</li>
            <li> If you ask me, the best skin care currently on the market, and I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;The price will really get your attention, but so will the results, I&#x27;m not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Total scam.  Don&#x27;t ever go with &amp;#34;free trial,&amp;#34; plus, the trial was disappointing and drying.  Nothing is for free.  I should have know better!</li>
            <li> Its nice, but I have no intentions to reorder. Didnt notice any difference in my skin, and tube is almost gone. WAY to much money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Skin has a better look immediately after applying it but I don&#x27;t think it makes your skin firmer as it claims it does. I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I did not see any major changes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference but it has only been a month.  This product is quite expensive and from what I have read liquid is more absorbent and faster than a cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am a good candidate for it. Still see the 10 years.</li>
            <li> This stuff is spectacular! I have been looking all over for something to tighten my skin without putting a ton of stuff on my face. Since this cream is all-in-one, all I do is wash my face and put it on twice a day. I was so impressed that I told my sister and two friends about it. I called customer service just to thank them and rave some more...and to make a long story short, she gave discounts to all of us! They are so nice and the product works to boot!</li>
            <li> A very expensive rip-off.  This ceam does absolutely nothing except drain your wallet.</li>
            <li> I have used hundreds of products, but this actually made a difference I could see in just a few weeks.  In my 50&#x27;s, wrinkles and lines are harder and harder to hide - this really helps!</li>
            <li> Not satisfied and trying to return to company. They aren&#x27;t yet cooperating.</li>
            <li> After one month useing it waiting to see any result, I can&#x27;t see any results, sdo expensivie for a product that no makes results.</li>
            <li> Scam!!! It&#x27;s not marketing it&#x27;s fraud!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am 47 years of age, I started using this product over a year ago! And I look and feel 12 younger. The under eye cooling  treatment cream is another  excellent this product line has. As well as the  body butter cream they have. Oh it&#x27;s like heaven,  silky feeling is great for elbows, arms, hands and legs too. Who knew such a great could be available so and so easy to sign up for auto shipments and often as you need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy customer,&lt;br /&gt;Henry Melian</li>
            <li> The article was delivered on time with no problems.  I find the moisturizer to be different from my previous purchases of LifeCell - the packaging is the same but consistency, colour and results seem different.?</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and noticed a difference immediately, especially in the texture of my skin.  So much softer...</li>
            <li> This was suppose to be such a great product!  Well you may like it .&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase it again.  At first it appears to work then after a week or so no results.&lt;br /&gt;Too much money for it not to work.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; will cost you $189.00 NOT the $4.95  they advertise. This product is NOT worth the money! It does not work any better than any other moisturizer that you can buy over the counter. The company is impossible to reach and you will not be able to get your money back.</li>
            <li> Did NOT see any difference what-so-ever. after reading many reviews, I was expecting at least a little something, especially for the price! In my case, it turned out to be a major rip off. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> free sample? NOT FREE!!! THEY CHARGE YOUYR CREDIT CARD YOU USED TO PAY FOR SHIPPING!!! $180.00&lt;br /&gt;WHAT A SCAM!! PRODUCT ACTUALLY MADE UNDER EYES DRY AND MORE WRINKLES . TRY DERMA E VITAMIN A IT IS INEXPENSIVE A VITAMIN STORE AND WORK ! lifecell ugh all the way scam&lt;br /&gt;HATE THE SCAM TO GET FREE!! sample and then they CHARGE THE CREDIT CARD USED TO PAY FOR SHIPPING 180DOLLARS SURPRISE NOT NOT FREE</li>
            <li> Lifecell is a great product. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> did not do as the package claims.</li>
            <li> OMG STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCAM.  CHECK YELP FOR OTHER REVIEWS SO YOU DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  MAKES YOU LOOK 20 YEARS OLDER.  TRIAL ORDER IS A SCAM TOO IF YOU ORDER FROM JUVACELL WEBSITE.  DON&#x27;T MAKE MY MISTAKE.</li>
            <li> I have seen some of the complaints about the company, but didn&#x27;t have that experience myself.  I did &amp;#34;cancel&amp;#34; my membership/subscription because I used the product much slower than their regular shipments.  So once I had a few backup tubes, I canceled without a problem.  After I finally ran out a couple years later, I decided to try some other products instead --- but have to say, nothing felt as good.  I finally just bought a &amp;#34;one-off&amp;#34; here on Amazon.  Aaaahhh ... much better again!  Guess this is what I will be using from now on!</li>
            <li> Whoever thinks this stuff works is crazy. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I  give my girlfriend this product for 4 month ago. She really liked it. Her skin feels softer and looks better than.This product is really effective and easy product.All she can say is it is the best product she has ever used! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good wrinkle cream.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as free for exchange unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a change from my regular anti aging cream as it had very little effect on my screen until i came across this product. Like every other product I just gave it a try and now I have stuck to it for more than 3 months. In less than a quater of a year I look 5 years younger and my skin has become more vibrant. I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve been trying many products and never seen any change and I never thought  I could write a review like this one. Lifecell does it! It simply works and you can really see that form the very first time you use it. I stop looking and trying. This is the cream I will use from now on. I wish they had more products.</li>
            <li> Great product, great quality , 100% recommended</li>
            <li> Received pkg ,  it had been previously opened.  I would like a. Sealed container.  I am a long time customer, this product usually comes sealed.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream, still using it and do  see some improvements.</li>
            <li> like - leaves skin feeling soft.  doesn&#x27;t look shiny</li>
            <li> Quick delivery but very slow reply from the company when I developed a reaction to their product. Did absolutely nothing but break me out, caused a red itchy rash and caused me serious hassles. I wish I had done much more research on this company and claims they make about their products. The cream is drying. Does not moisturize at all. As for wrinkles,  this does nothing. It did not absorb well at all and caused me a great deal of itching.  I was promised money back but that has been a problem as well. My dermatologist felt so bad for me that he treated me for free from the reaction I had from Life cell. This product should come with warning lables. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> This product did not come with we&#x27;ll constructed instructions, I found the product to be very drying to my skin but the directions offered nothing in the way of what to do or next steps to counter the drying effect.</li>
            <li> This cream does nothing for your wrinkles except dry out your skin and emphasize the wrinkles.  Would not recommend it to anyone.  It does not make wrinkles less obvious nor does it even moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!! I bought it recently using it for 6 weeks with the hope it would help my wrinkles on my forehead and it did not.  In fact, it made the lines worse.  not to mention it dried out my skin badly.  I am 43 years old and have european skin, so it shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to maintan my skin, but this felt worse.  I returned it and ended up buying an Australian mdae organic cream which leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and smooth every day and only cost $25.00.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product, its just a scam like all the others.</li>
            <li> This whole thing is one big scam!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and great for any skin type. It&#x27;s not greasy and would be perfect for oily skin too. The texture is hard to describe but it pits a very thin film between the skin and makeup that feels like silk. I use this as pert of a daily skin routine along with La Mer and its just as good of a product.</li>
            <li> Folks, DO NOT get sucked into the LifeCell revolving door of South Beach Skin Care, Inc.  I was ready to pull the handle for this \\&quot;revolutionary\\&quot; product and enter my credit card info.  I decided to do a little sleuthing around on the internet first.  I found a website that had so many complaints about this company&#x27;s billing practices that I was stunned.  I decided to look further and checked with the BBB for good measure.  It turns out that they have had 228 complaints against them in three years.  Most of these complaints are not about  the product being bad, it&#x27;a about their billiing practices. They offer a 30 day \\&quot;free trial\\&quot;. They offer to send you a tube of LifeCell cream and if you don&#x27;t like it, you pay nothing IF... you return the remainder of the product you didn&#x27;t use within 30 days.  What they actually do, is ship you the \\&quot;trial\\&quot; tube of product and ding your debit/credit card immediately, and make you jump through hoops in order to get a refund for your $189.  The BBB has contacted South Beach Skin Care, Inc. and tried to get them to make changes in their business and billing practices, to no avail.  The BBB has given them an \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating. To my mind, if a company has a superior product, they would be assured that the customers who try the \\&quot;30 day trial\\&quot; would be so enamored with their products that they wouldn&#x27;t need to use shady business practices in order to make money.  There are a number of highly rated skin care products out there, and my guess is that they cost less than $189 a tube.  Unless you crave being scammed, find another one of those beauty products, people.</li>
            <li> I used the Lifecell cream for 30 days - twice daily and exactly as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;There was no improvement in my skin texture or reduction of wrinkles or the appearance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;While using the cream I had several blemishes appear - I haven&#x27;t had blemishes in years.&lt;br /&gt;For the price and the hype of the product, I honestly expected some positive results.&lt;br /&gt;I have resumed using my Natural Advantage Retinol based cream and my face feels and looks much better.&lt;br /&gt;Even though Lifecell has a satisfaction guarantee, it is only returnable/refundable if you buy directly from Lifecell/South Beach.&lt;br /&gt;South Beach informed my I had to go to Amazon for a refund and once the 30 days has passed, it cannot be returned&lt;br /&gt;through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt; P.S.&lt;br /&gt;I just chatted with an Amazon representative and will receive a return label for the product.  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> It was terrible, I asked to send a little tester from the actual website and it was very inefficient. It was really oddly thick and just not a nice feel on the skin, I thought it would not send us more until I would order it but it kept sending more and more of this yucky cream and it was charging 150 dollars of my credit card every time please don&#x27;t make the same mistake that I made</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me about a year ago.  I was skeptical because I was happy with the very fine products I had been using.  I began using it at first just for daytime.  It is a great makeup primer.  I had never been able to use a primer before be because makeup didn&#x27;t go on well afterwards.  But this is an excellent primer. I began to use it both morning and night.  After a few weeks I noticed that my frown lines between my eyes had lessened.  Then I noticed that the lines on either side of my mouth we we lessened.  Now my complexion is more even and smoother.  People worrying about the price should consider the cost of alternatives:  fillers and Botox.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t believe it works</li>
            <li> My husband noticed results after 2-3 days.  This cream is expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> Be aware of the so called &amp;#34;free 30 day trial offer&amp;#34;, I thought I was only paying 4.99 for the shipping and handling, just as the advertisement stated, I put in my credit card info, and they tried to charge me 189.00.  Fortunately for me it was a prepaid card and I didn&#x27;t have that much in the account.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Used for 3 days and do notice a difference.  Have used LaMer for years but this is one procedure rather than 4 different bottles.  Actually feel the tightening and wrinkles around the eye seem to have disappeared.  So far so good.  So much less expensive also which is a plus.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> My feedback is just like all the other negative feedback--quasi-concealed terms and conditions, wildly over-priced, ineffective and useless, a web page composed of nothing but puff, and frequently misleading at that--the nobel laureates actually talking about something else--highly questionable effusive praise for this amazing product from Dave P. from Pittsburgh or  Darlene C. from Phoenix, their own before/after photos showing little or no difference, a before/after photo of a woman apparently in her 60&#x27;s who&#x27;s clearly had a face lift instead, or another man who looks like he&#x27;s just had a peal--they can get images from anywhere, can&#x27;t they--online positive review sites written by South Beach themselves. I noticed a brief ad on ebay but ebay doesn&#x27;t list this product on their rejuvenation cream pages, maybe because ebay would never tolerate a 29 per cent positive feedback rating. And to just blindly speculate, notwithstanding their glowing list of really amazing ingredients, what&#x27;s actually in this cream and where is it made? China? I mean, do you think?  Very clever and slick presentation--these people whoever they are invested some serious money in their marketing program--but bandits from start to finish. Oh, and from Miami. Surprise! So I contacted Consumer Reports and they said they&#x27;d be glad to look into it. Stay tuned.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Did not work at all. Too expensive to perform so badly.</li>
            <li> Love this product. You see results within a week. Not heavy or greasy. Helps fine lines and skin discoloration.</li>
            <li> I love This cream because is without smell, I&#x27;m not allergic to this one and my face looks better all in one eyes and face</li>
            <li> I ordered this first from company and asked very specific questions. I was given bad information! Beware! They always have a slick response when you call them on the misinformation. The product caused my skin to break out. I regret ever allowing Life Cell into my house because of business practices and onto my face because it took 8 days to clear up after two nights of using appropriate amount. The packaging I liked until it slipped behind the bathroom counter drawer. It&#x27;s slim. I had a real mess in an awkward spot. Oh well! Live and learn~</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 months so far and am mildly impressed with its results. I have tried many other products on the market and like its results over theirs.</li>
            <li> Now, these are real reviews from real people! Thank you all for being honest. I am glad I read them! Other companies have find this to me before when trying to return and cancel. You live and learn! You will be lucky if you get your money back in one call without yelling over the robot you are taking to.</li>
            <li> I am truly sorry to give this a 1 star. It is what it is and it does NOT work perform or produce what their advertising suggest. I am open minded and I will try anything once, but this was a waste of money. Too bad.</li>
            <li> Hoax!  My friend bought it for me and believe me, it does nothing!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the free gift product from friend and I wrote this unbiased review after tested. I saw those reviews and now I knew what is the truth, this is a good anti-aging product. In my opinion the cream quality is perfect and there are no fake ingredients. It feels smoother and it has greatly reduced the imperfections on face. It makes me feel young and healthy too..So I give it 5/5 star</li>
            <li> I am 62. I have used this product for almost 2 months. It has made no difference in my appearance. My wrinkles are still there. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This made a noticeable (to me, anyway) difference right away.  I think it&#x27;s worth the price, and I&#x27;ll get it again.</li>
            <li> I used to use a product called Hydroxatone but it is effectless. So, I decided switched to use Lifecell. I used it after 10 days, the final outcome is difference about night and day. Recommend!</li>
            <li> My partner and I also have use this Lifecell cream. It help both of us gradually reduce appearance of under-eye puffiness and dark circles! My friends have keeping ask me for what product that I used. Only 7 days, it starts effectively.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product</li>
            <li> After two weeks I enjoy just using one product and a very minimal amount. It has enough moisture for skin that is in dry climate, and 65 yrs. Like with any product being consistent helps. Still waiting for the deep lines to subside, but I think&lt;br /&gt;there is improvement. Want to stay with it and see how it will progress in the coming months. Will let you know how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to the skin cleanser. Thank You Life Cell</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel softer and smoother. Will be sure to re order. A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  People comment on my skin routinely with regard to how few wrinkles I have and how smooth my skin is.  I use this product along with Lovely Skin&#x27;s 2-part eye product.</li>
            <li> Over priced and under promised!  Used the product faithfully for a few weeks and see no change. Company stated you would see results immediately. I see no change!  Feel like I was ripped off!</li>
            <li> I have never felt compelled to write a review, but wanted to share my experience with the lifecell product.  I have very sensitive and acne prone skin.  I am very careful about the products I use on my face.  I ordered lifecell before reading the reviews and then was horrified, thinking I had made a huge mistake.  I even called my credit card company to prepare them for a block on my card.  However, when I received the product and started using it, I have found that it is actually amazing.  My skin is soft, moisturized, and even toned.  It absorbs quickly and is odorless.  I still have fine lines of course, but I do not expect those to diminish this soon after starting the product.  I would love to continue with lifecell, but cannot afford the hefty price tag.  I plan on paying for one shipment and making it last, then canceling.  The price is the only drawback.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a good try. But after 5 months of use, no change in my skin or wrinkles...I gave it 1 star  only because I had to give it something.  It deserves zero stars.</li>
            <li> I did the free trial on their website. Despite cancelling any future purchases, I was repeatedly charged large amounts I didn&#x27;t authorize. This is typical of a scam company. As for the product itself, I saw no more results than the average over the counter moisturizer for a fraction of the cost. Save your money and do not allow this company to get your credit card info.</li>
            <li> Did not work , would not recommend it  i feel i waisted my hard earned money.  Never again will i fall for this hype</li>
            <li> Poor and Useless product!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first due to no changes but once I continued to use the LifeCell I began to see the long term effect. Now I&#x27;m on my second tube and I get told at least three times a day how Great I look! Thank You LifeCell for being my own personal fountain of youth!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for a friend and he loves it so far. Kind of expensive though.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before trying this product and I did have great expectations. I also believe different products work for different people. I am a young looking 63 with my main problem being some wrinkling under my eyes, that has just started. This product did nothing for my skin. I used as directed morning and night and noticed that my skin was very dry in the morning and more wrinkled than when I use my Olay Regenerest Micro sculpting cream.The Olay does keep me moisturized all night and is much cheaper.With Life cell I also felt dry in the morning and had to use another moisturizer also. I tried to use just the LifeCell, but it was just too drying.I will not be using this product again and think it is way overpriced.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a 0* star I would. Not only is it a bottom of the line wanabe anti-aging cream, but they have the nerve to charge premium prices; added to that they have worst costumer services and advert policies. I say don&#x27;t even waste your time with a trial. Lets just call this product by its true name LieTell!</li>
            <li> This is cream is over priced and overrated by their ads.  If you buy the item on the special trial offer of $4 you will be billed $189 in 30 days.</li>
            <li> Amazon! These reviews worry me! Seriously start monitoring your reviews or your rating system will be meaningless!</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and my skin has become very dry.  The minute I applied LifeCell I felt such soothing, healing relief.  It is not greasy - AT ALL.  It goes on and is dry right away.  The one negative, unfortunately, is that I can&#x27;t afford to spend $189.00 per container (I believe that is supposed to last 2 months)  - so $1134.00 per year.  Too much for this teacher.  Celebs - enjoy.</li>
            <li> Returned the product,Still waiting for my refund.Did not like this made my face break out all over.Would not recommend for my friends</li>
            <li> works great, but pricey.  that was the only reason I didn&#x27;t give the 5th star</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t support a company that practices DECEPTIVE SALES PRACTICES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems many of the Positve Reviews may be posted by LifeCell workers!</li>
            <li> SORRY, I expected great things based on the recommendations, but nothing happened.  maybe it doesn&#x27;t work after a certain age ?</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I&#x27;m on my second tube and can see and feel positive differences.  It came as expected, well-packaged and on time.  I&#x27;m happy and will deal with this product and company again.</li>
            <li> Hi. I&#x27;m on Day 2 and can say unequivocally that there is a difference - even on my neck. Skin is less lax, fine lines less noticeable  and I look much more like myself (as opposed to that tired looking stranger I&#x27;ve been seeing recently).  Even color is better. Affect is supposed to be better after continued use. No way to know.  Not a substitute for a surgical facelift but most definitely a lift.&lt;br /&gt;*********&lt;br /&gt;Still using product 2x day, 3 weeks later. Still very happy with result and have changed from 4 to 5 stars. If you are young and your skin is still pretty tight you probably won&#x27;t see much difference. My facial skin has gotten a little less \\&quot;energetic\\&quot; and Lifecell tightens things up better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Not a substitute for a facelift, but certainly a visible, more youthful, difference.</li>
            <li> People, please do not buy this product.  The price alone is obnoxious.  There are a lot of natural things for much less than this that can help moisturize the skin - things as easy as olive oil.</li>
            <li> A couple friends have spent big money on this product, but they&#x27;re completely negative about their experiences. I won&#x27;t buy it because of their reviews. Before you drop a lot of cash on this, it&#x27;s a good idea to pay attention to all the negative reviews of it in the Amazon comment section.</li>
            <li> too much money, could find it for less</li>
            <li> None of this stuff works or does what it says it does, but it is no worse than any other so called anti-Aging cream</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It goes down to 149 a month and I stopped the auto order last July and they continued to ship and charged my card and I had moved fortunately I have an awesome credit card and proof I wrot them cancelli g three months prior. It&#x27;s ok for a 19 or 20 dollar product but it&#x27;s no miracle</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I noticed my younger appearance after used for a month. I have anticipated for my first time usage with Lifecell. Well, it has reduce my puffy eyes. My face is refreshing now, as well! Thanks for my mother gift it to me and I share my personal opinion after used.</li>
            <li> Considering the very high price and the promises made, I will not purchase again as I see no significant change in the look or feel of my skin. I will continue to use it until this tube is complete in the hope that more time is necessary for it to work its magic.....though doubtful.</li>
            <li> Definitely not impressed.  Makes a lot of false promises and super cheap packaging for 189.00</li>
            <li> This product made slight changes to my face in a good way, and made slight changes in a bad way as well, I&#x27;m 32 and noticed the fine lines and dark circles coming in so I tried life cell, laugh lines got toned down and dark circles did vanish, but I started breaking out, I never in my life had problems with acne before, a month into this product and small pimples just kept creeping in all different areas on my face, I don&#x27;t think I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Although pricey for my budget, a tube will last me for almost 5 months and I use it every day. I have been using this cream for over 5 years and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I will buy another one, my wife is very happy with the results</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and have tried everything regardless of price - this product is my favourite! My second favourite is Le Mer.  Each is pricy, but worth saving your pennies for!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin younger looking and so soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, but hate, hate, hate the high price.  So I doubt that this will ever be a staple for me.</li>
            <li> not what I thought it would do.</li>
            <li> i know someone that tried this and it didn&#x27;t work for them and they kept charging her bank card which took forever to get resolved.  a friend introduced me to another product that is less expensive and actually works -- i&#x27;m getting fantastic results in less than 3 weeks.  wish i had a photo on this computer to show you my results</li>
