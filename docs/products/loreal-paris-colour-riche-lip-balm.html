            <li>This is a great lip balm - with a very sheer color.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many tinted lip balms and this by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>picked up another tube this winter when I was feeling dry and chapped and it works great for any season.  </li>
            <li>They feel AMAZING, so soft smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>It is is a beautiful shade, if you do not like dark colors on your lips.</li>
            <li>A beautiful nude colour on dark skinned tones.</li>
            <li>I was pleased at how fast it arrived and that they shipped to Afghanistan.</li>
            <li>Terrific color for fair skinned people.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pretty in its little tube and a lovely color the tender mauve is too!!!</li>
            <li>Over these last couple of months though I have tried my best to step out of my comfort zone when it comes to different shades of the lip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty color.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and really feels good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like anything to bright or to dark</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast and it was in the twenty-five dollar group items that ships together.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing formula!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more lipsticks in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;nice size, pretty case</li>
            <li>The other ones however do add a great sheer color that I adore.&lt;br /&gt;Colour</li>
            <li>i was heartbroken when my toddler smashed the whole tube.</li>
            <li>The color I selected is very suble.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>REVLON Colorburst Lip Butters, which have more visible colors than the L&#x27;Oreal Colour Riche Le Balms (do your research because the shimmery/frosty ones are less buttery).</li>
            <li>This product is very sheer and wears off rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I just have to adapt to the color on this particular one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I must say when I applied this I was pleasntly surprised!</li>
            <li>So I would use this perhaps as a summer lip balm as it&#x27;s so light and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>It also glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or tacky on the lips.</li>
            <li>lips have a natural rosy hue</li>
            <li>but as far as color</li>
            <li>It is so natural looking.</li>
            <li>I can even put it on with no mirror because the color is so natural and creamy.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this last summer at the local drugstore when I had lost or forgotten mine that day.  </li>
            <li>I have used it everyday and plan on buying more in other colors as well.  </li>
            <li>If you are trying to choose something that gives more color, try L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colour Riche Anti-Aging Serum Lipcolour (the least drying lipstick because there is a serum in the center - do not use if you do not like lip plumpers) or</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too thick and smelled sweet.</li>
            <li>I bought it, and it is pretty sheer and the same color of my lips, so it is a little different than I thought.</li>
            <li>My only peeve its not long lasting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like wearing too much makeup, but just wanted a little zing to my lips.</li>

            <li> soft , moisturizing with a hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;i would like to try some other colors</li>
            <li> I only gave four stars because it doesn&#x27;t last long as opposed to Neutrogena&#x27;s Revitalizing Lip balm.</li>
            <li> Doesnt last long on the lip, not quite the color I expected... thats what I get for ordering online!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips like some lipsticks can do.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is a lot less than my local stores.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitate , bc I simply don&#x27;t do lipstick...</li>
            <li> color on this was a lot lighter than I expected.  </li>
            <li> No funny taste to this lip balm.</li>
            <li> 4 stars due to there being no color.</li>
            <li> I use this lip balm as a base before I apply other lip products on top.</li>
            <li> After researching what other people have said about these lip balms, I chose Caramel Comfort because this color was the least transparent.</li>
            <li> I often use this as a base or primer prior to applying lipstick.</li>
            <li> Poor color application</li>
            <li> I was unhappy because I could not use the lip balm without using a lip brush to apply it, because the tube came broken during shipping and there is hardly any color at all.</li>
            <li> Some women probably don&#x27;t find that as annoying as I do.</li>
            <li> But it WAS really annoying</li>

            <li> Smooth and nourishing yet no color.</li>
            <li> This product is very sheer and wears off rather quickly.  It&#x27;s barely-there color that just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> The color I sent my sister</li>
            <li> I got this one in heavenly berry shade and it looks really nice on me. It also glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or tacky on the lips. I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing formula!</li>
            <li> This is very sheer but it moisturizers and softens my lips excellently.  I wear it alone and sometimes with lipgloss.  It&#x27;s a great just wear around the house or if you just want a sheer pop of color just to run errands.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t lie , I&#x27;m not a big lipstick person at all! Over these last couple of months though I have tried my best to step out of my comfort zone when it comes to different shades of the lip. I must say though when I purchased this product at my local drugstore I was a little hesitate , bc I simply don&#x27;t do lipstick... or so I thought! Well I must say when I applied this I was pleasntly surprised! It goes on great , &amp; compliments my caramel skin tone well! I actually love this ! I will be purchasing more lipsticks in the future.</li>
            <li> I only gave four stars because it doesn&#x27;t last long as opposed to Neutrogena&#x27;s Revitalizing Lip balm. I got this as a replacement for my Petal Glow that I lost in a cab. It&#x27;s a nice alternative to lipstick. I don&#x27;t like wearing too much makeup, but just wanted a little zing to my lips. It has just a hint of color which is great and keeps your lips moisturized as well. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it seemed to wear off as soon as I applied it! I had to keep retouching which I didn&#x27;t have to do with the Neutrogena. I guess they use different ingredients. But this was nice to have and the price was right too. It wasn&#x27;t too thick and smelled sweet. The only thing is I don&#x27;t think I should have to keep applying it, even for a lip balm. I would try another color just because I like L&#x27;Oreal and the colors they offer on this lip balm are really nice. So I would use this perhaps as a summer lip balm as it&#x27;s so light and doesn&#x27;t last long. It&#x27;s still a good deal though and good to have a lip balm with a hint of color to boot. So would I recommend? Sure, why not? Give it a whirl...just don&#x27;t don&#x27;t get too attached! But if you find a color you like, just be prepared to keep applying. Some women probably don&#x27;t find that as annoying as I do. But it WAS really annoying cause it&#x27;s so pretty in its little tube and a lovely color the tender mauve is too!!!</li>
            <li> I like the texture, it has a light pleasant almost no fragrance, they say colors but when you put it on and I do not see any color will not reorder as there is no color in it. It is is a beautiful shade, if you do not like dark colors on your lips.</li>
            <li> I have this in another color and love it.  When I saw this one on amazon I wanted to try it as I find this to be my HG lip product.&lt;br /&gt;The color on this was a lot lighter than I expected.  It seemed more beigy/sandy and to me it looked darker on the picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips have a natural rosy hue so this did not provide any color for me.  I love the line of balms however.  The are creamy, smooth and do not feather or wear off unnaturally. I just have to adapt to the color on this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give this 5 stars for the product..but as far as color I would only give 3 as for me there is none.  Just a sandy shine which doesn&#x27;t go well with my coloring. .  The other ones however do add a great sheer color that I adore.&lt;br /&gt;Colour Riche is the only color I use on my lips.  It has been love at first wear.</li>
            <li> A beautiful nude colour on dark skinned tones. Love it. My only peeve its not long lasting. Have to &#x27;re-apply a bit during the coarse of the day</li>
            <li> The color I selected is very suble. When I buy another tube, I will choose another color. Perhaps I will choose a couple of colors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve extremely happy with this lip balm/lip stick. It&#x27;s a very natural/neutral color and goes on very easy. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips like some lipsticks can do.</li>
            <li> Got this and the Heavenly Berry too. Balms with a hint of color, not like regular lipsticks. Looks very natural as if you were born with it and feels great. A must in every purse to take along for the day! Seller was great too.</li>
            <li> Awesome nude lip color that seems to be the best of both worlds of lipcolor and a chapstick. Not sticky, and goes on smoothly and easy. I don&#x27;t see that this would be a long wearing lipstick though at all, however it is just what I was looking for and the color is perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many tinted lip balms and this by far my favorite.  I want my lipsticks and balms to penetrate my lips without leaving a waxy film or painted on look.  I first purchased this last summer at the local drugstore when I had lost or forgotten mine that day.  I feel in love with this.  It has SPF 15 plus it smells and tastes great, like a mild vanilla.  It goes on smoothly and really feels good.&lt;br /&gt;I picked up another tube this winter when I was feeling dry and chapped and it works great for any season.  I often use this as a base or primer prior to applying lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love this shade of lip color. It is so natural looking. Its very moisturizing and stays on fairly well.</li>
            <li> Nice color but drying</li>
            <li> This is a great lip balm - with a very sheer color. After researching what other people have said about these lip balms, I chose Caramel Comfort because this color was the least transparent. If you are trying to choose something that gives more color, try L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colour Riche Anti-Aging Serum Lipcolour (the least drying lipstick because there is a serum in the center - do not use if you do not like lip plumpers) or REVLON Colorburst Lip Butters, which have more visible colors than the L&#x27;Oreal Colour Riche Le Balms (do your research because the shimmery/frosty ones are less buttery). I use this lip balm as a base before I apply other lip products on top.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account but I just wanted to say I love this lipstick. It&#x27;s a very pretty color. I don&#x27;t like anything to bright or to dark so this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It was a bit pricy for lipstick but it is a great lipstick feels smooth goes on easy and no clumping.</li>
            <li> Great neutral color.  Goes on with the feel of lip balm but with a shimmery color.  I can even put it on with no mirror because the color is so natural and creamy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.  It is the perfect neutral color, exeptionally moist and looks fabulous.  It is moist enough to be a gloss, but it has enough density to be a lipstick.  Of course, if you eat or drink, it will come off, but it looks great if you leave your lips alone.  I have used it everyday and plan on buying more in other colors as well.  It is also a great price.</li>
            <li> I like this because it stays on and the color is transparent. It is not too shiny. I like it.</li>
            <li> This is great for air travel- my lips felt great after a 17 hour flight. Great tint and love how this feels. I was pleased at how fast it arrived and that they shipped to Afghanistan.</li>
            <li> I was unhappy because I could not use the lip balm without using a lip brush to apply it, because the tube came broken during shipping and there is hardly any color at all.</li>
            <li> Terrific color for fair skinned people.  Adds just a light touch of color with moisture to the lips.  The price on Amazon is a lot less than my local stores.  No funny taste to this lip balm.</li>
            <li> Poor color application</li>
            <li> I originally saw this pinned on Pinterest as a great color. I bought it, and it is pretty sheer and the same color of my lips, so it is a little different than I thought. The texture and feel of the product on my lips is good. It&#x27;s basically like lip colored chap-stick with a different price.</li>
            <li> Doesnt last long on the lip, not quite the color I expected... thats what I get for ordering online! Thanks</li>
            <li> 4 stars due to there being no color. I bought 2 &amp;#34;Caring Coral&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;Pink Satin&amp;#34; no color to either. They feel AMAZING, so soft smooth &amp; silky. If this were nourishing for overnight or add SPF for day more color I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with my &amp;#34;eos&amp;#34; ball...</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast and it was in the twenty-five dollar group items that ships together. It is just as shown on website it was even still in plastic wrap. Wonderful color.</li>
            <li> soft , moisturizing with a hint of color.&lt;br /&gt;i would like to try some other colors&lt;br /&gt;nice size, pretty case</li>
