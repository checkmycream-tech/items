            <li>I was so delightred to see it is still available and even in the same large size bottle that looks just like the original bottle when first introduced.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have such a good smell memory to say it is the same than 10 years ago or not.</li>
            <li>and I do not like to go to the large malls and then find out they do not carry it any longer.  </li>
            <li>I really like this scent.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why people like to complain so much.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>Seems to be the real deal.</li>

            <li>Very prompt delivery and to my surprise</li>
            <li>Thanks, but I can&#x27;t tell you bc</li>
            <li>I was surprised that a large tube of Body Lotion was included with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Smells very stong and old ...</li>
            <li>Tt is priced very reasonablely for the large content of the bottle and seems to last forever.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy for daily use and nice for evenings out as well.</li>

            <li>That being said though what this ad offers is not what I got.</li>
            <li>The product IS the real deal and everything inside and out was sealed properly.</li>
            <li>and it would last for a very lo.grime a d</li>
            <li>She has been using this particular scent for several years.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I thought I was only ordering the perfume and was surprised when I opened the package to see a larger box with the lotion inside too!</li>

            <li> So I ordered just a little weary of what exactly it was.</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of my favourite scents so when I see I could buy it at a cheaper price I did, but to my surprise I don&#x27;t think it was the real one in the box because just a small amount of that perfume I had to used</li>
            <li> My little secret:)</li>
            <li> Have wanted it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other fragrances, but I always go back to Escape.</li>
            <li> Due to the low price, I have to believe this was a counterfeit product.</li>
            <li> Size was bigger than I expected!!</li>
            <li> I bought another one at the store and it smells as expected.</li>
            <li> But the perfume has no fragrance other than a chemical scent.</li>
            <li> UPS box was bashed in but not the product inside the box due to the bubble wrap packing.  </li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding it in my local stores.</li>
            <li> the product is old and stale.</li>
            <li> This is one fragrance that I can and do wear everyday.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the few complaints are about.</li>
            <li> I was estatic when I found this for my mother as it is terribly hard to find.</li>
            <li> I always get tons of compliments even when it&#x27;s late in the day</li>
            <li> The product was not what I expected, I think this fragrance is not original, I hate to buy something that is not original.</li>
            <li> Put it on if you don&#x27;t want him to watch a football game or do something else, you&#x27;ll get him to go where you want immediately!</li>
            <li> Disappointed I am unable to return this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best perfume for me.  As a vet, I need to be concerned about scents when dealing with animals, cats especially, and Escape, on me, is a \\&quot;Kitty Acceptable\\&quot; scent.  This allows me to smell great for my human clients and myself without offending my 4 legged clients.</li>
            <li> This item is not the genuine perfume! Package wasn&#x27;t sealed and neither were the individual items. Disappointed I am unable to return this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.  I have used it for years.  It&#x27;s not too heavy for daily use and nice for evenings out as well.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume !!  It&#x27;s all I wear.  I always get tons of compliments even when it&#x27;s late in the day and I think it&#x27;s worn off.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic Price !!  Fast shipping !!  I will definitely order again !!  Thank You !!</li>
            <li> the product is old and stale.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the few complaints are about. That being said though what this ad offers is not what I got. I got something better!! Not only did I get the 3.4 oz perfume it was a gift set that also had the 6.7 oz body lotion in it as well. The product IS the real deal and everything inside and out was sealed properly. It also smells just like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> nice big lotion was a plus!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people like to complain so much. This perfume is awesome. I don&#x27;t have such a good smell memory to say it is the same than 10 years ago or not. But I can say that as soon as I smelled it on my skin I LOVED it and kinda remembered why my memory loved the memory. It smells great, lasts what any normal perfume lasts and it&#x27;s a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Good product and on time</li>
            <li> Great price. Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> The wife&#x27;s favorite.  She loves it.  Made my day.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> Good price for the ounces.</li>
            <li> Great price!  Love the way it makes me smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume and so very happy that amazon can equip me with being able to get this cuz no longer avai. in dept stores.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I have been wearing it since it began back in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for my daughter as a Christmas Present. She has been using this particular scent for several years. It was very difficult to obtain in the stores therefore, I purchased it through Amazon and was very pleased.  Thanks  Amazon made her as well as me a very satisified customer.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Size was bigger than I expected!! I love this perfume!</li>
            <li> Good scent, good price - not over powering.  My friend loves it I would recommend this product I bought it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have worn Escape since its debut in 1991.Since it has been discontinued by Calvin Klein, I now try to find it on the internet. This is one fragrance that I can and do wear everyday. I get numerous compliments! I&#x27;ve tried other fragrances, but I always go back to Escape.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  AND such a great deal too.</li>
            <li> The Calvin Klein Escape Eau de Parfum Spray for Women, 3.4 Fluid Ounce is my wife&#x27;s favorite and mine too</li>
            <li> I love this scent, I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years. I get many compliments everytime I wear it....Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that this was a counterfeit product as I&#x27;ve worn this brand for years now. It looks real-- packaging looks legit. But the perfume has no fragrance other than a chemical scent. I bought another one at the store and it smells as expected. Due to the low price, I have to believe this was a counterfeit product. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my order. I received it promptly.</li>
            <li> Have wanted it for a long time. Just love the scent and receive many compliments when I wear it. Would recommend it to&lt;br /&gt;everyone.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. It was exactly what I expected. I was having a hard time finding it in my local stores. It is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it and it looks small but its a pretty good size loved it i have been looking for it and it smell ahhh super nice.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find my favorite parfum-&amp;#34;Escape&amp;#34; and the price was also good. I found the service excellent and will definitely order again. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This use to be one of my favorites. I am very familiar with the scent. This is a very good attempt, but is much stronger than the original.</li>
            <li> got this as a gift for my aunt who always wears it and she couldnt have been happier</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of my favourite scents so when I see I could buy it at a cheaper price I did, but to my surprise I don&#x27;t think it was the real one in the box because just a small amount of that perfume I had to used and it would last for a very lo.grime a d I also would get Compliment when ever I wire it this time, it was nothing like that and the scent of it was just off, so it went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Good Product.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth what you pay for, I am satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> Awesome product for a good price.  UPS box was bashed in but not the product inside the box due to the bubble wrap packing.  One thing I want to mention is that mine came with the big bottle of lotion as well as the perfume.  Don&#x27;t know if it was a mistake but both of those at this price is a steal.</li>
            <li> I only wished CK still made it.  So glad to know it&#x27;s &amp;#34;still&amp;#34; out there!</li>
            <li> The order arrived very fast and as described condition. The perfume smell excellent and it last for long time. I am very happy with the whole process.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this spray</li>
            <li> Smells very stong and old ... I has always been a favorite of mine till I got this one</li>
            <li> What a great savings! Loving it!</li>
            <li> The product was not what I expected, I think this fragrance is not original, I hate to buy something that is not original.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume. The price was great!</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery and to my surprise I also receive a full size of Escape body lotion.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this fragance more than 20 years ago! Im so happy I can get it for such a low price!</li>
            <li> I remember when this new Parfum first was introduced in the local department stores in the early &#x27;80s.  Women were drawn to it!  They must have sprayed the whole store with this fragrnace as women were flocking to the cosmetic counters for this marvelous new scent.  Their introduction worked as it became THE fragrance to wear at the time!  I was so delightred to see it is still available and even in the same large size bottle that looks just like the original bottle when first introduced.  Tt is priced very reasonablely for the large content of the bottle and seems to last forever.  If you like a light fresh floral fragrance that is not too strong, you will enjoy this one! I even use it in my closets and lingerie drawers!  Many Thanks to Amazon for carrying this product and for Calvin Klein to continue to offer this beautiful fragrance!</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter love it.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Escape is my sister&#x27;s favorite perfume! Can really only find it online. Perfume came with the lotion. Thought I was getting just the perfume. The cost was awesome for the product. The full size body lotion was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. me too</li>
            <li> Its always been my favorite. And I got ot in great time</li>
            <li> a  wonderful fragrance at a great price.</li>
            <li> I was estatic when I found this for my mother as it is terribly hard to find. So I ordered just a little weary of what exactly it was. No need to be this package arrived brand new still in the retail box. So impressed and pleased. Great seller and product would recommened and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on it. My Dr. &amp; staff, Dentist, and Chiro asks.... Thanks, but I can&#x27;t tell you bc then everybody would smell like me!! Lol!!! My little secret:)</li>
            <li> Not as described. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, love it</li>
            <li> I love the scent,very reasonably priced.I was surprised that a large tube of Body Lotion was included with my purchase.Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be blunt.  If you wear this to entice your husband or boyfriend, I can guarantee you the second he smells it all he is going to think about is making love!  Put it on if you don&#x27;t want him to watch a football game or do something else, you&#x27;ll get him to go where you want immediately!</li>
            <li> I never know who carries what perfume anymore and I do not like to go to the large malls and then find out they do not carry it any longer.  This is my favorite fragrance and I will definitely continue to purchase it this way.</li>
            <li> I love the perfume had worn it for years.love the price and shipping and packaging was awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume waiting to buy more ran out of stock my favorite I buy it frequently stays on for many hours thats what I like the most</li>
            <li> Received  on time plus received body lotion, love the scent, would buy again</li>
            <li> It is my FAVORITE parfum.  Calvin Klein discontinued it and when I found it here, I bought the only 2 you had.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this about 5 years ago and it took about two squirts and I could smell periodically throughout the day.  This one I literally put on about 10 pumps and cannot smell it.</li>
            <li> good experience, would definitely buy</li>
            <li> This is an oldy but goody my go to fragrance.</li>
            <li> The scent is not the same</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, I get compliments on it all the time, it must blend in with my skin perfectly</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I was only ordering the perfume and was surprised when I opened the package to see a larger box with the lotion inside too! Seller also sent samples of aftershave gel! Love it!!! Great price too!</li>
            <li> Perfect, smells lovely, and now so do I.</li>
