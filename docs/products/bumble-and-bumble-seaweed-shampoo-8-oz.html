            <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
            <li>I have super oily hair and when I wash my hair with the Seaweed Shampoo and conditioner I can easily stay 2 days without washing my hair and it does not get oily!</li>
            <li>I have used this fine shampoo for years.</li>
            <li>Though I do occasionally wonder about the kind of mind that would consider that washing your hair with seaweed might be a good thing ;-)</li>
            <li>I always follow this with a rich conditioner.</li>
            <li>It gets your hair squeaky clean without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing and effective, I especially like this shampoo because it&#x27;s not too fragrant.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s fairly weightless, so if you have super fine hair like mine, this doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  </li>

            <li>I am religious about keeping my hair healthy and free of unnatural products that are damaging, and this product makes that possible.</li>
            <li>Left residue in my healthy, normal hair.</li>
            <li>I really looked forward to trying it</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure there  has to be a less expensive shampoo just as good!  </li>

            <li> It was entirely too expensive to have this issue.</li>
            <li> I can count on my hair looking awful when I wash it with this shampoo, so I only use it on days</li>
            <li> -- I&#x27;ve read about this brand for years -- and I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this shampoo and the conditioner that went along with it.</li>

            <li> great product very cleanifying</li>
            <li> Recommended by a NYC hairdresser, I purchased this &amp; it&#x27;s perfect for not only color treated hair but for those of us with thin, fine hair. Not chemically harsh &amp; helps to preserve &amp; prolong next  tint  apptmt. The conditioner is also great!</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service will be  ordering more products soon.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband; I love how it smells, cleans hair nicely, great!  I always like BB products and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Baa, it&#x27;s just shampoo and way overpriced at that. It&#x27;s not BAD shampoo. Smells good but the scent is too faint and washes out completely. The reason for 2 stars is because I have no idea how they justify this high price for a small bottle of basic shampoo. Save your money.</li>
            <li> The product works great for my hair and never leaves any residue. I am religious about keeping my hair healthy and free of unnatural products that are damaging, and this product makes that possible.</li>
            <li> Just the perfect shampoo. Leaves hair clean and soft. Great for the scalp. I will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble makes very good quality hair products. This seaweed shampoo is our preferred shampoo. It makes our hair feel clean and smell good. It is a little pricey but worth the price.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean feeling shampoo.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble Seaweed Shampoo is perfect for my hair, which is shoulder-length, fairly thick, and colored. The shampoo cleans thoroughly and rinses well, leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this seawood shampoo is the best - it leaves the hair healthy and full.  it arrived sealed good so no leakage from bottle.  give it a try and about 7-10 days you notice and see a difference - and the smells good too...</li>
            <li> There is no issue with this product. It is exactly what it said it was and nothing questionable about it. I only mention that because I&#x27;ve read reviews for other B&amp;B products.</li>
            <li> I find this shampoo drying and i have oily hair.  I will not be buying this product again.  Not enough moisture.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo we have found for oily hair - leaves it clean &amp; no flakes - will continue to purchase this item</li>
            <li> Left residue in my healthy, normal hair.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!!!!!! This shampoo is the best one ever! I have super oily hair and when I wash my hair with the Seaweed Shampoo and conditioner I can easily stay 2 days without washing my hair and it does not get oily! Also it is super gentle on the hair and scalp. I guess I&#x27;ve found my shampoo and conditioner :)</li>
            <li> I have used this fine shampoo for years. I&#x27;ve tried others, but have never found another product that does such a thorough job. It even comes in a small size for travel. The conditioner is equally good.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for fine hair.  Cleans w/o stripping and leaving dry.  Hair is fuller and soft.  Plus, nice scent.  Though I do occasionally wonder about the kind of mind that would consider that washing your hair with seaweed might be a good thing ;-)</li>
            <li> Soft hair after, just had to use a lot for my curly hair shoulder length</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it has a nice mild smell and lathers up well. It is a bit runnier than in stores and I don&#x27;t think I will purchase it from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I always manage to fint the best items on Amazon.  This is one of them.But I&#x27;m sure there  has to be a less expensive shampoo just as good!  I&#x27;ll keep looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, this price is for 8 ounces!!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem the same as the salon grade quality I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> this is a good shampoo but was not the one i was looking for b &amp; b seaweed shampoo with sea silk extract</li>
            <li> This seems to be popular with young girls right now and it smells great.  However it doesn&#x27;t work all that well and we switched back to the tried and true brands.</li>
            <li> I can count on my hair looking awful when I wash it with this shampoo, so I only use it on days I don&#x27;t care what I look like.  it leaves my hair flat, without sheen and completely without body.  I really looked forward to trying it -- I&#x27;ve read about this brand for years -- and I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for years. It&#x27;s got a pleasant light scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm. New formula eliminates the parabens. This is the best price I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
            <li> smells awesome, it&#x27;s pretty lightweight which i need for my hair and... well what can I say? Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s products are excellent and always worth their price</li>
            <li> This shampoo foams up nicely and smells good.  It gets your hair squeaky clean without drying it out.  This is a good shampoo for removing product buildup.  I always follow this with a rich conditioner.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and effective, I especially like this shampoo because it&#x27;s not too fragrant. I recommend it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo that cleans a man&#x27;s hair in not time and leaves it fresh and not oily. Just as I read about this product&lt;br /&gt;in Men&#x27;s magazine that recommended it, I thought I give it a try and I am very happy with this shampoo. Just what a&lt;br /&gt;man needs to keep his hair clean, if you are active and shower everyday.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and I hate how cheaper shampoo makes it feel. This is awesome shampoo; it leaves my hair feeling light and silky. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because of how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have scalp psoriasis, and in the description it says it&#x27;s good for dry, flaky scalp.  I haven&#x27;t really seen any improvement from this and the matching conditioner, but my psoriasis is pretty bad.  This is probably good if you have mild psoriasis or just a bit of dandruff.  It IS super moisturizing though, so if you do have dry or chemically treated hair, I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.  The smell is okay; I personally prefer the smell of the thickening shampoo, but the odor on this one isn&#x27;t unpleasant or anything.  It&#x27;s fairly weightless, so if you have super fine hair like mine, this doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  I still use it once or twice a week, mixing it up with the B&amp;B thickening shampoo and a medicated one for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this shampoo and the conditioner that went along with it. Not sure which one was worse, but I showered one night and woke up the next morning to find my hair appearing more greasy than it probably would have been if I had not showered at all. It was horrible. It was entirely too expensive to have this issue. Will not recommend to others or purchase again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful!  It smells delicious and feels silky.  It lathers beautifully, too.  I only wish the matching conditioner was as delightful.  Instead, it&#x27;s thin and you have to use twice as much as the shampoo.</li>
