            <li>My husband and daughter&#x27;s eczema eased significantly.</li>

            <li>Good price compared to local pricing.  </li>

            <li>This is the only liquid hand soap we&#x27;ve ever really liked, and we like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, always have, and it is not drying like so many other hand soaps.  </li>
            <li>There are so many different lotions and potions on the market</li>
            <li>first time trying these..</li>
            <li>And it is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Used this many times before but it starting to go away everywhere</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the fact that they open and close for packing is helpful.  </li>
            <li>I really like the soft feel, smooth feel, and scent of the Jergens soap.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain too much with the price being so low, but I was hoping to be able to use it after playing with my ferrets without needing to walk to the bathroom every time.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry them out like most hand soap.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it beats other brands in making your hands soft and clean with each use.</li>
            <li>I first found this soap at the Seattle airport and was surprised how good is smelled,  especially for a public restroom.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this on Amazon because the 4 pack is so economical and everything is quite expensive up here</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this to take to work (where soap provided is very drying).</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this soap (even though some people I know think it smells like the pink soap from gas station bathrooms).</li>
            <li>and I have very chapped hands .</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, mild fragrance (not overwhelming) and does dry out my hands.  </li>
            <li>It was a very light scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nice subtle fragrance and washes right off you hands.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.it keeps  my hands soft during the winter when they tend to get really dry.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it online though it is a bit more expensive</li>
            <li>This mild liquid soap packs a BIG punch:  </li>
            <li>I wish it moisturized a little better though.</li>
            <li>It keeps hands not only clean and soft.</li>
            <li>but this has solved out problems i strongly recommend over other brand</li>
            <li>This product is very sudsy and leaves my hands soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out gets hands clean.</li>
            <li>I wash my sensitive hands often, but they are left feeling clean and soft after using Jergens extra moisturizing hand wash.</li>
            <li>I like how soft and silky my frequently washed hands smell!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite liquid soap and it is hard to find in the stories.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Makes my hands feel soft.</li>
            <li>I like the lotion-like consistency and the almond fragrance, and I use it as a gentle facial cleanser as well.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it leaves my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>My (young) children prefer this soap as well.</li>
            <li>Makes my hands and face so soft.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to fragrances and this product doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent hand washer and suffer from cracked skin in the winter because of it.</li>
            <li>After I received this order from amazon, however, I once again found it at The Dollar Tree, so I bought a few more there - only $1 each.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore, and was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon, and for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>my hands are usually destroyed by the dry, winter air.. even more by antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li>I have Sjogrens and have very dry skin, I have been using Jergens Extra Moisturizing Liquid Hand Wash for years because it is very gentle and does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many other soaps, we never get the sticky hard clump at the end of the pump, nor does the pump ever clog.  </li>
            <li>and I do live in a dry climate (CO), which are big factors.</li>
            <li>It also does help with my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>One of them did come loose in shipping when originally purchased which was very messy.</li>
            <li>My hands are very dry, and many soaps just make the problem worse.  </li>
            <li>For the value Its a good deal, the soap just has a bad smell.</li>

            <li> Sometimes a classic is just better than the rest.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> They smell pretty good, and last quite a while per bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the only liquid hand soap we&#x27;ve ever really liked, and we like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent, always have, and it is not drying like so many other hand soaps.  </li>
            <li> There are so many different lotions and potions on the market</li>
            <li> first time trying these..</li>
            <li> And it is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Used this many times before but it starting to go away everywhere</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the fact that they open and close for packing is helpful.  </li>
            <li> I really like the soft feel, smooth feel, and scent of the Jergens soap.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really complain too much with the price being so low, but I was hoping to be able to use it after playing with my ferrets without needing to walk to the bathroom every time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry them out like most hand soap.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it beats other brands in making your hands soft and clean with each use.</li>
            <li> I first found this soap at the Seattle airport and was surprised how good is smelled,  especially for a public restroom.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this on Amazon because the 4 pack is so economical and everything is quite expensive up here</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this to take to work (where soap provided is very drying).</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this soap (even though some people I know think it smells like the pink soap from gas station bathrooms).</li>
            <li> and I have very chapped hands .</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, mild fragrance (not overwhelming) and does dry out my hands.  </li>
            <li> It was a very light scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nice subtle fragrance and washes right off you hands.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.it keeps  my hands soft during the winter when they tend to get really dry.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it online though it is a bit more expensive</li>
            <li> This mild liquid soap packs a BIG punch:  </li>
            <li> I wish it moisturized a little better though.</li>
            <li> It keeps hands not only clean and soft.</li>
            <li> but this has solved out problems i strongly recommend over other brand</li>
            <li> This product is very sudsy and leaves my hands soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out gets hands clean.</li>
            <li> I wash my sensitive hands often, but they are left feeling clean and soft after using Jergens extra moisturizing hand wash.</li>
            <li> I like how soft and silky my frequently washed hands smell!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite liquid soap and it is hard to find in the stories.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Makes my hands feel soft.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion-like consistency and the almond fragrance, and I use it as a gentle facial cleanser as well.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it leaves my hands soft.  </li>
            <li> My (young) children prefer this soap as well.</li>
            <li> Makes my hands and face so soft.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to fragrances and this product doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent hand washer and suffer from cracked skin in the winter because of it.</li>
            <li> After I received this order from amazon, however, I once again found it at The Dollar Tree, so I bought a few more there - only $1 each.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore, and was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon, and for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> my hands are usually destroyed by the dry, winter air.. even more by antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogrens and have very dry skin, I have been using Jergens Extra Moisturizing Liquid Hand Wash for years because it is very gentle and does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many other soaps, we never get the sticky hard clump at the end of the pump, nor does the pump ever clog.  </li>
            <li> and I do live in a dry climate (CO), which are big factors.</li>
            <li> It also does help with my sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> One of them did come loose in shipping when originally purchased which was very messy.</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry, and many soaps just make the problem worse.  </li>
            <li> For the value Its a good deal, the soap just has a bad smell.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like other soap.  </li>
            <li> Only this hand wash save my dry hands.</li>
            <li> This is on of the few soaps that doesn&#x27;t hurt my hands with frequent hand washing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years and only recently learned that it was not available any longer in our local stores.  </li>
            <li> Long Kansas Winter - now my hands will survive!</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t leave my hands dry.  </li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hands from the tough winter dryness, this soap will really help to heal and soften your the dry hands.</li>
            <li> My hands felt very dry after washing with this soap.</li>
            <li> This is a soap, not really a \\&quot;hand wash\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I then found it at The Dollar Tree, where I bought it for a few years but recently it seems they stopped selling it, too.  </li>
            <li> The cap on one bottle was loose and leaked over the other bottles.  </li>
            <li> i alternate between this and my usual antibacterial soap</li>
            <li> Grew up using this brand and prefer it to the other choices.</li>
            <li> other products cause the hubbys hands to crack in winter</li>
            <li> It works just like any other hand wash.  </li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and my hands dry out due to the cold, and this soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands or make them itch.</li>
            <li> What a mess and a waste.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if the smell was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> We usually bought a rather expensive brand of hand soaps that claimed to have extra vitamins and nutrients to help dry hands, needless to say, those particular hand soaps ended up exacerbating the issue.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of all manner of dirt, grime and grease... without being too harsh.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not overwhelming for those of you who don&#x27;t care for that sort of thing.  </li>
            <li> Has no anti-bacterial additives which seem to be the topic of discussion lately.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this liquid hand soap because it left my hands chapped, cracked and raw.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to find .</li>
            <li> Sorry it is hard to find!</li>
            <li> If you are like me and hate all the sweet, sickening smelling hand soaps on the market...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought smaller bottles of this soap a couple of times from my local Dollar Tree. It&#x27;s a really good soap with a nice light scent that fades quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with the scent of my perfume. It also does help with my sensitive dry skin. Will buy this again</li>
            <li> Hand lotion smells nice with that original Jergens scent, rinses easily, and was priced right!</li>
            <li> Smells great and is easy on the my dry hands.Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is very sudsy and leaves my hands soft. Can&#x27;t complain about that. I would definitely order this  again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand soap and can not find anywhere</li>
            <li> Love the Jergens fragrance!  Sorry it is hard to find!</li>
            <li> Still love the cherry almond scent from Jergens.  There are so many different lotions and potions on the market and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch.  I still go back to Jergens.</li>
            <li> Leaves hands soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> We usually bought a rather expensive brand of hand soaps that claimed to have extra vitamins and nutrients to help dry hands, needless to say, those particular hand soaps ended up exacerbating the issue. We saw this type of soap with the extra moisturizers, and gave it a shot. It paid off! My husband and daughter&#x27;s eczema eased significantly. We got to use fewer prescriptions, and these soaps came through subscribe and save in a pack of 4, so we saved money too. They smell pretty good, and last quite a while per bottle.</li>
            <li> TWO of my 8 bottles had leaked all over in the package.  What a mess and a waste.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.it keeps  my hands soft during the winter when they tend to get really dry. AND it smells good. And it was shipped well. (One time I ordered soap that spilled out during shipping. But I was pleased with this shipment)</li>
            <li> Good price compared to local pricing.  Great product overall.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogrens and have very dry skin, I have been using Jergens Extra Moisturizing Liquid Hand Wash for years because it is very gentle and does not dry out my skin.  Amazon either shrink raps their liquid soaps or packs multiples in a zip lock bag, perhaps the shrink rap works a bit better, but this order arrived in good condition, in a zip lock bag. As long as heavier bulky items are not ordered and shipped with liquids, the results are very good, and always received on time as promised.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Really love the scent.</li>
            <li> my hands are usually destroyed by the dry, winter air.. even more by antibacterial soap. this stuff is GREAT! i alternate between this and my usual antibacterial soap and this stuff works wonders for my hands. it has a great smell to it and my hands are no longer like sandpaper. will buy again!</li>
            <li> Jergens Extra Moisturizing Liquid Hand Wash Plump in a high lather soap which had a very pleasant smell.  It keeps hands not only clean and soft.</li>
            <li> first time trying these.. but im pleased.  they have the same great cherry scent as the lotion and they don&#x27;t leave my hands dry.  and cant beat the price for the 4pk!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap.  I love the scent, it&#x27;s just like the lotion and it&#x27;s not overwhelming for those of you who don&#x27;t care for that sort of thing.  It lathers beautifully, rinses away nicely and my kids like it.  I live in Alaska and my hands dry out due to the cold, and this soap doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands or make them itch. I am so happy I found this on Amazon because the 4 pack is so economical and everything is quite expensive up here so it&#x27;s great to not have to pay a fortune for something you love to use everyday. It&#x27;s also a great item to add to a gift basket, it&#x27;s just so economical for that purpose, and people seem to love it.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and hate all the sweet, sickening smelling hand soaps on the market... this is for you. It is mild, works excellent and leaves your hands nice and soft and clean!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent smelling hand soap. We were looking for a non-antibacterial soap and found this and have been happy with the scent. Amazon has a great price as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  The smell reminds me of my childhood when we&#x27;d go visit our country cousins.  This is the brand of soap and lotion that my aunt kept on hand.</li>
            <li> Just love the scent of this soap. Grew up using this brand and prefer it to the other choices. Has no anti-bacterial additives which seem to be the topic of discussion lately. Like using it to wash my face because it does not irritate or cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I cant find this in the store, Lathers well smells good I would give it 5 stars if the smell was a little stronger. Doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out gets hands clean.</li>
            <li> Great moisture and smells just like original cherry vanilla we all love.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite liquid soap and it is hard to find in the stories.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad you carry it.</li>
            <li> I love Jergens lotion and I love the hand soap just as much. I didn&#x27;t even know Jergens made hand soap. I&#x27;m just glad I found itðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> This is a soap, not really a \\&quot;hand wash\\&quot;. I was thinking it meant hand sanitizer because of what they called it. The difference is that hand sanitizer has ingredients to kill bacteria such as alcohol, and isn&#x27;t soapy so it doesn&#x27;t need to be used with water. Instead, this is just liquid soap with moisturizer in it. I can&#x27;t really complain too much with the price being so low, but I was hoping to be able to use it after playing with my ferrets without needing to walk to the bathroom every time.</li>
            <li> It was a very light scent and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good for work restrooms!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this liquid hand soap because it left my hands chapped, cracked and raw.  I wash my hands frequently and was hoping that this hand wash would be kind to my hands.  It wasn&#x27;t!  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for many years.  I like it because it&#x27;s NOT anti-bacterial; it&#x27;s just regular soap.  It has a pleasant, mild fragrance (not overwhelming) and does dry out my hands.  It used to be sold in retail stores but several years ago it disappeared from the shelves.  I then found it at The Dollar Tree, where I bought it for a few years but recently it seems they stopped selling it, too.  So, what to do?  Look online, of course!  After I received this order from amazon, however, I once again found it at The Dollar Tree, so I bought a few more there - only $1 each.</li>
            <li> other products cause the hubbys hands to crack in winter but this has solved out problems i strongly recommend over other brand</li>
            <li> Nice scent, keeps hands soft and moisturized better than the honey milks, softsoaps, etc. I&#x27;ve tried. Easy to rinse clean. My favorite &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I was looking for hand soap like the one on United Airlines, which has a very pleasant almond smell.  This came the closest.</li>
            <li> I suffer from cracked hands in the winter. This is on of the few soaps that doesn&#x27;t hurt my hands with frequent hand washing.</li>
            <li> I really like the soft feel, smooth feel, and scent of the Jergens soap. Makes my hands feel soft. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars because it was delivered on time and there was no leakage.  It works just like any other hand wash.  It cleans just fine and smells nice.  I wish it moisturized a little better though.</li>
            <li> This is great hand soap.  If you have dry hands from the tough winter dryness, this soap will really help to heal and soften your the dry hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years and only recently learned that it was not available any longer in our local stores.  I like the lotion-like consistency and the almond fragrance, and I use it as a gentle facial cleanser as well.  I was so glad that it was still available and I could order it on line.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Original Jergens. My hands felt very dry after washing with this soap. Using lotion was a must. I do wash my hands often and I do live in a dry climate (CO), which are big factors.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to take to work (where soap provided is very drying). My hands really feel good after using, so I ordered more to have it at home as well.</li>
            <li> Cannot find it anywhere else but Amazon. It&#x27;s the best for my sensitive skin. Am grateful to you for carrying it.</li>
            <li> For the value Its a good deal, the soap just has a bad smell. Smells like soap you would use from a public bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is the only liquid hand soap we&#x27;ve ever really liked, and we like it a lot.  I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore, and was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon, and for such a reasonable price.  I&#x27;ve always loved that almond/maraschino cherry fragrance.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Not only is this an incredible value, but it smells like Italian cookies my hubby happily proclaims!  I like how soft and silky my frequently washed hands smell!  Thinking of Subscribing and saving even more money with Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this hand wash.  It truly  does moisturize as well as clean. I have used this for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> The smell is addictive. The soap is mild. This is a great product that I will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry, and many soaps just make the problem worse.  I do not have that problem with Jergens extra moisturizing hand soap.  In fact, it leaves my hands soft.  I love the cherry almond smell, too.  It&#x27;s light and pleasant.  Unlike many other soaps, we never get the sticky hard clump at the end of the pump, nor does the pump ever clog.  My (young) children prefer this soap as well.</li>
            <li> Great product...just wish it had all been delivered in the bottles rather than spilled all over the inside of the shipping carton and bag.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a classic is just better than the rest. I have tried dozens of hand soaps over the years and this one is still the best. Not too drying and the classic scent is awesome.</li>
            <li> My hands are SOOO much better since switching.  Good value!  I love this product! Long Kansas Winter - now my hands will survive!</li>
            <li> I have always liked Jergens hand lotion, so figured I would like this and I do.  And it is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this soap (even though some people I know think it smells like the pink soap from gas station bathrooms). The scent is mild and not overpowering. Best of all, this soap cleans well without stripping my skin and drying it out, especially since I have to wash my hands many times each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I likely won&#x27;t buy this again since I don&#x27;t need the pump bottles - why? Because I found refill jugs here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I do wish this product was a bit more moisturizing though, my hands have been like sandpaper this winter.  Love the scent though, it&#x27;s reminiscent of cherries or almonds or something.</li>
            <li> Love this soap... but you can buy at any Dollar Tree store for $1... they want almost $15.??? When I can get 4 for $4.??? Also, discovered this has parabens, so will discontinue use, just hope I find something parabens free that works as good!!!</li>
            <li> Great handsoap. I first found this soap at the Seattle airport and was surprised how good is smelled,  especially for a public restroom.  Lol Actually had to use Google to find it but was glad I did. Soft soap with nice smell.  Bath and body doesn&#x27;t offer soap in the cherry/almond smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best for my hands. Doesn&#x27;t dry them out like most hand soap. If you wash your hands for 20 seconds as you should it works as well as hand sanitizers. Love it</li>
            <li> Used this many times before but it starting to go away everywhere I looked so I am glad Amazon carries it.  I love the scent, always have, and it is not drying like so many other hand soaps.  I am a Jergen&#x27;s loyalist, always will be.</li>
            <li> Excellent service, great product</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the soap they have in public bathrooms/grade school</li>
            <li> Love this jergens soap. Makes my hands and face so soft. Thanks for a great product</li>
            <li> this is the best soap I have found for dry skin and I have tried them ALL. I HAVE Eczema and Im picky about my soaps, but this is great.</li>
            <li> I  love the smell of original Jergens.</li>
            <li> Like the fagrance of cherry and almond. Love the fact that it beats other brands in making your hands soft and clean with each use.</li>
            <li> The absolute best hand wash out there . The smell is cherry and I have very chapped hands . This keeps my hands from getting chapped . My skin stays moisturized. . It is very hard to find . So please keep this item so people who can&#x27;t find it can order thru Amazon !</li>
            <li> Purchased these to take on vacation to a rented beach house.  Love the smell and the fact that they open and close for packing is helpful.  One of them did come loose in shipping when originally purchased which was very messy.</li>
            <li> Love the product, used to be able t buy it locally for $1, no longer available. Glad I found it online though it is a bit more expensive then I wish it was.</li>
            <li> I love this product that is why i bought it.  I have sensitive skin and this product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like other soap.  I recommend it to friends :)</li>
            <li> If you have ever used Jergen&#x27;s Hand Lotion with the cherry-almond scent, you will LOVE the moisturizing liquid soap! They work together to help your hands look and feel softer. Plus that unmistakable cherry-almond scent.... Aaah!!!</li>
            <li> This mild liquid soap packs a BIG punch:  It gets rid of all manner of dirt, grime and grease... without being too harsh.  It even smells great!</li>
            <li> I use Jergens Extra Moisturizing Hand wash daily to keep my hands from drying out when I wash them. It&#x27;s a great product. I am sensitive to fragrances and this product doesn&#x27;t bother me. I rely on it.</li>
            <li> This hand soap is great because it cleans hands without drying them out.  I have two boys so we do a lot of hand washing in between all their experiments.</li>
            <li> I wash my sensitive hands often, but they are left feeling clean and soft after using Jergens extra moisturizing hand wash.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I am a frequent hand washer and suffer from cracked skin in the winter because of it. This is the best soap you can use that won&#x27;t dry out your hands. It is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> The cap on one bottle was loose and leaked over the other bottles.  Packing could have been better.</li>
            <li> Good value for a nice neutral hand soap. Nice subtle fragrance and washes right off you hands. No anti-bacterial either.</li>
            <li> This is a hand soap. It works fine.</li>
            <li> Only this hand wash save my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this one</li>
            <li> Great scented soap will not overdry your skin.  I use this along with a tiny pump of dial at the same time (for antibacterial---the jergens is NOT antibacterial...it doesn&#x27;t claim to be).  A good value on amazon.</li>
