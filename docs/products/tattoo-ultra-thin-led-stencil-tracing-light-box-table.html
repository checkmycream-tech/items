            <li>x 14&amp;#34; drawing pad perfect...</li>
            <li>Works perfect!</li>
            <li>so it fits perfectly.  </li>
            <li>and this is perfect, will be great to work on</li>
            <li>Maybe the lucite, or whatever the material is, isn&#x27;t ideal for tracing.</li>
            <li>Great price as well...</li>
            <li>Works great transferring to freezer paper.  </li>
            <li>But it works great .</li>
            <li>This product is not as great as your description.</li>
            <li>The light box is perfect for my needs for punchneedle.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to use it at a shop, spend the money for a good one</li>
            <li>Unlike the other reviewer, mine arrived in perfect condition and everything works great.  </li>
            <li>It is very light weight and easily portable and plenty bright.</li>
            <li>I can say that it&#x27;s a great purchase not only for tattoo artists (great for conventions) but also for artists who need any sort of light</li>
            <li>They work great delivery was fast</li>
            <li>So while this was a great table, and still is good for traveling, it&#x27;s not very high quality so don&#x27;t expect it to be your go to table.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re doing fine</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this light table quite a lot!</li>
            <li>not as well as most cheaper light boxes.</li>
            <li>Got this instead of a huge light table (box style) for scroll saw projects.</li>
            <li>I still need a light table</li>
            <li>Great flat surface to use</li>
            <li>Super light weight and portable, will also work for my son to do some tracing also for his school work.</li>
            <li>I received my light table well packaged and quickly.  </li>
            <li>love it, am working on an applique and needed a large surface to work on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve included several photos so you can see the actual light table as it is lit up, with an image on it, how that image looks through the light table with and without paper on top and for reference the paper is 8.5 x 11</li>
            <li>But the benefit of that is that the light is consistent everywhere, not just in certain places like with traditional light</li>
            <li>It lit up a grand total of 5 times but I had to manipulate the wire.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This make it so much nicer for him to work his drawings.</li>
            <li>this light table was rebuilt using after market parts, and put back together by someone that didn&#x27;t know what they were doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pictures you display does not the the real size justice...</li>
            <li>this little table does a fine job of allowing me to see exactly what I need.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works alright at first... Not extremely bright but good enough...</li>
            <li>If you only need it for personal use it would be fine...</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was listed as new condition, but it was not.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s much more difficult for light to pass through it -- and</li>
            <li>The light is decently strong but with it being 100% flat its hard to draw on.</li>
            <li>This item came on time but it was smaller then the picture showed in one of the pictures it shows a full sheet of paper sitting on it and still room left</li>
            <li>Steer clear of these sellers and this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE January 2014: the light started to flicker a few months ago, there&#x27;s a connection that&#x27;s off in the plug part.</li>
            <li>long as you keep in mind that this is LED driven so the light is smooth but not bright like an incandescent.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected, incredibly thin, portable, and provided and even and steady light.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it really works well so far.</li>
            <li>Same concerns as other reviewers on this product: Loose exposed wires, foggy and scratch/dent marks on top surface &amp; uneven wavy light due to bottom support.</li>
            <li>I thought the fact that the light table is so thin would be a benefit, but the picture that I&#x27;m attempting to trace shows through very blurry, so I actually couldn&#x27;t use it at all.  </li>
            <li>I did, however, tape the extending cable down to the underside (a photo of that is shown as well) to keep it in a consistent place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great but some design flaws are a little difficult to ignore.  </li>
            <li>Light is not bright.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so thin that it&#x27;s easy to take anywhere.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I enjoy using this light table quite a lot! It fits the paper from my 11&amp;#34; x 14&amp;#34; drawing pad perfect...Great price as well...Works perfect! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> It works great but some design flaws are a little difficult to ignore.  The power cord is a two part system and even when put together a little short.  If you have a wide desk and your wall plugs are standard, about 10-14 inches off the floor; you might have issues with it reaching you.  Other than that it really works well so far.</li>
            <li> love it, am working on an applique and needed a large surface to work on and this is perfect, will be great to work on</li>
            <li> Came scratched and poorly made.  The contact number that came with it didn&#x27;t work and just arrived in a white box with a made in china stamp across it.  Light is not bright.  Steer clear of these sellers and this product.</li>
            <li> The light box is perfect for my needs for punchneedle. It is very light weight and easily portable and plenty bright.</li>
            <li> Got this instead of a huge light table (box style) for scroll saw projects. Super light weight and portable, will also work for my son to do some tracing also for his school work.</li>
            <li> I bought these for tattoo artist so I have no idea how they&#x27;re doing but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re doing fine</li>
            <li> I thought the fact that the light table is so thin would be a benefit, but the picture that I&#x27;m attempting to trace shows through very blurry, so I actually couldn&#x27;t use it at all.  Maybe the lucite, or whatever the material is, isn&#x27;t ideal for tracing.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating for my husband. He loves to draw and do art stuff but hate not having enough light to go into the detail work. This make it so much nicer for him to work his drawings.</li>
            <li> Works alright at first... Not extremely bright but good enough... After about two months it began to flicker and has done so ever since.... If you only need it for personal use it would be fine... If you&#x27;re trying to use it at a shop, spend the money for a good one</li>
            <li> Want to use for tracing out patterns for quilting.  Works great transferring to freezer paper.  Great flat surface to use</li>
            <li> This this came with a snaped cord, have to solder it back myself.</li>
            <li> The light is decently strong but with it being 100% flat its hard to draw on. And the screws/nuts on the corners come lose all the time.</li>
            <li> DOA.  Would not light up. There were numerous imperfections and cloudy areas in the glass.  The product was dusty and dirty as if it had been setting on a shelf.</li>
            <li> I still need a light table and I thought I&#x27;d try this one.  It didn&#x27;t work and was used looking.  Poor.</li>
            <li> When i recieved the item it had a short in the wiring and the item did not work. It has discouraged me from purchasing another of this type.</li>
            <li> The wiring has issues. It lit up a grand total of 5 times but I had to manipulate the wire.&lt;br /&gt;Tossing around wheather to fix the wire issue myself (I&#x27;d rather not have to do this) or send it back.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely think twice if you are thinking of purchasing this lightbox.</li>
            <li> It works well so far and was less expensive then other sites however it did look a little bit beat up when I received it.</li>
            <li> This item came on time but it was smaller then the picture showed in one of the pictures it shows a full sheet of paper sitting on it and still room left well  this is really a small led tracing table it only fits one regular size piece of paper I was disappointed seeing I could have got one bigger for the price.But it works great .</li>
            <li> I received my light table well packaged and quickly.  It was exactly what I expected, incredibly thin, portable, and provided and even and steady light.  I&#x27;ve included several photos so you can see the actual light table as it is lit up, with an image on it, how that image looks through the light table with and without paper on top and for reference the paper is 8.5 x 11 so it fits perfectly.  The paper used in the photo with the image is a thick card stock so it&#x27;s much more difficult for light to pass through it -- and this little table does a fine job of allowing me to see exactly what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of something like this are its size and energy draw.  It&#x27;s so thin that it&#x27;s easy to take anywhere.  Unlike the other reviewer, mine arrived in perfect condition and everything works great.  I did, however, tape the extending cable down to the underside (a photo of that is shown as well) to keep it in a consistent place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this table for about six hours so far, not much use, but considering you only use it for 30-60 minutes per session I can say that it&#x27;s a great purchase not only for tattoo artists (great for conventions) but also for artists who need any sort of light table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you keep in mind that this is LED driven so the light is smooth but not bright like an incandescent.  But the benefit of that is that the light is consistent everywhere, not just in certain places like with traditional light bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE January 2014: the light started to flicker a few months ago, there&#x27;s a connection that&#x27;s off in the plug part. And several LEDs burnt out in the strip. So while this was a great table, and still is good for traveling, it&#x27;s not very high quality so don&#x27;t expect it to be your go to table.</li>
            <li> For the price paid, this item is slightly overpriced. Overall, this item was poorly designed. I should&#x27;ve looked at the reviews/rating before purchasing. That&#x27;s why you should never judge a book by it&#x27;s cover. Especially when online shopping! Same concerns as other reviewers on this product: Loose exposed wires, foggy and scratch/dent marks on top surface &amp; uneven wavy light due to bottom support. Had it for 2 days now and it&#x27;s still doing it&#x27;s job so it still functional.. but definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase it for $45 if seen in person. Will revise the review if it decides to crap out.</li>
            <li> Two sets of LEDs have already quit functioning.  Have gotten one set to come back on, the other set simply blinks three times and goes out.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected, works for small projects.</li>
            <li> They work great delivery was fast</li>
            <li> this light table was rebuilt using after market parts, and put back together by someone that didn&#x27;t know what they were doing.&lt;br /&gt;it was listed as new condition, but it was not. i would have returned it if my friend didn&#x27;t buy it from me at a discounted price.&lt;br /&gt;representation was false....hated it.</li>
            <li> This product is not as great as your description. Ya it does help you trace but. not as well as most cheaper light boxes. The pictures you display does not the the real size justice...</li>
