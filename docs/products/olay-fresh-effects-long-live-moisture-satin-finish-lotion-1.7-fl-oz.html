            <li>I thought that maybe it was time and this product presented itself - perfect</li>
            <li>So this lotion provides a perfect conjunction from a seller&#x27;s perspective:  </li>
            <li>My skin fells great!  </li>
            <li>And the best remedy is PREVENTATIVE according to my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>The pump is perfect as the cream jars are a microcosm for bacteria.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, the pump bottle is great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall just which one it was, but it was wonderful and Olay has always been a brand I trusted.  </li>
            <li>It suggests to put it on as needed, but for me the once-a-day application is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Also, works really great under makeup and perfect for traveling in my cosmetic case.</li>
            <li>Once they do these things, they will not have a good product; they will have a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>

            <li>it lasts all day and is really great.</li>
            <li>It is truly a great combination of lotion/gel, but not too oily.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Nothing Great about it.</li>
            <li>and this is great for summer moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Great product for acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t happen to you, I think this would be a great product to try.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>, NEVER makes my face break out, and helps GREAT on combination skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a great buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;The smell</li>

            <li>Great.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels great and looks great without the greasy blob sensation.</li>
            <li>Smells great, great formula and good for oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li>the best part of all this is this; my skin looks 100% better since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>Once they do these things, they will not have a good product; they will have a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a gel moisturizer, and it is mattifying in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Because of this, it makes an insanely good makeup primer as well.  </li>
            <li>There is no one moisturizer that is good for every person.</li>
            <li>My bestfriend told me to buy this product because she absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>I also have not had any irritation or breakouts from the product, which is always a good thing.  </li>
            <li>think if you need an oil control moisturizer then this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li>&quot; connotates the correct nature, for this is a product that succeeds in its aim to moisturize.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The rest of us looking for a good moisturizer, however, will rejoice in</li>
            <li>I use this with the olay foaming face wash and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>After all, their primary function is to keep your skin supple, ideally without blocking your pores and causing an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>is so light and dainty.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love putting this on before I put on make up!</li>
            <li>It is way better than using a primer!</li>
            <li>Words can not contain my love for this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Feels so goo on my face and have ordered 3 more bottles for stock!</li>
            <li>I love the finish on this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin silky smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li>but oh, it felt amazing.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel</li>
            <li>And best of all, it hydrates but even hours later, my face feels great and there are no oil spots.</li>
            <li>Gotta have me a nice tan</li>
            <li>The lotion has a kind of gel feeling to it, yet it is not oily.  </li>
            <li>found it amusing that this lotion does not have any advertised capability to block ultraviolet rays.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed that this product lived up to it&#x27;s own hype.  </li>
            <li>I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I really liked this lotion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what it has it in, honestly.</li>
            <li>A nice addition to my cabinet of potions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lotion/gel combo description is certainly an apt one, for I can&#x27;t think of another way to describe the consistency.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Olay makes many fine products, and I think this product is a perfect fit with Olay.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is wonderful and it does a great job at making your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, smells great and makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect and it makes my makeup go on much smoother and more evenly.  </li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find the scent of it to be very strong, not compared to, say, the Olay night creams.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you don&#x27;t care for the Olay signature scent, Satin Finish has its own very light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleasantly surprised that quality seems to have been at the forefront of their minds when they made this product, because it is just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It smells really really good and feels satiny/velvety smooth when I apply it.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best face creams I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Is the perfect moisturizer for young skins.</li>
            <li>A lot of lotions on the market make great claims, but rarely do they all hold weight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is what I love about Olay products - they try to find effective products without digging their paws into our wallets until we beg for mercy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has a really nice gel-like feel and spreads nicely, leaving my face feeling supple and smooth.</li>
            <li>Very light and non-greasy</li>
            <li>Very, very light scent.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent...</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the smooth texture!</li>
            <li>Very very happy with this, would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li>I do not need to reapply to make sure all area is covered.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this lotion and will buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love all of the Olay products.  </li>
            <li>This one made my face feel so nice and velvety smooth.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and will be sticking with it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and I get many compliments on my &#x27;senior&#x27; skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found most moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I need a more moisturizing moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Now that is #GirlGotGlitterApproved :)</li>
            <li>yet I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>My most favorite face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I will be using this more this summer after laying out in the sun to help keep my skin from peeling.  </li>
            <li>Please do not be misled by SPF in any product that is not a sunblock, appropriately applied.  </li>
            <li>Of course, many people do not apply and maintain sunblock appropriately anyway, so</li>
            <li>I felt like it gave my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>: more money, not any better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spread a bit on my clean dry face and it feels wonderful - so good on my skin,</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I might like it better in the summer when there is more humidity</li>
            <li>Really lovely</li>
            <li>and I like it much better than a tinted foundation for improving the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this based off the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Has a very unique texture too</li>
            <li>However, I got stuck in a blizzard a while ago and the wind chapped my face pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is not greasy and that it feels great on my skin, leaving it soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a lighter moisturizer as summer approached to help keep me from becoming a grease ball.  </li>
            <li>When I put foundation on top of this lotion, it made my skin look extremely smooth and reduced the size and appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li>love how light it is</li>
            <li>I do love how smoothly the satin finish lotion glides on and the feel of it on my skin, but I had to keep reapplying it after washing my face in order to get rid of the tightness.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mom for the good genes.  </li>
            <li>if you see it on here for a good price, I highly recommend buying it!</li>
            <li>my absolute fav moisturizer b/c its not greasy, has a very light NICE not obnoxious scent..</li>
            <li>This lotion has a really excellent feel to it, unlike any other lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is so smooth and light, I love the satin touch.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>It applies easily and dries to what I would call a matte not satin finish.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, however, it does have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>so I researched the best approach to avoid eye area problems (dark circles, fine lines).</li>
            <li>I guarantee it&#x27;s amazing because it can be no less for me to buy it again since I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the next best thing or something that one-ups it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think anyone who wants just a light moisturizer will find this very appealing.</li>
            <li>I think the scent is fabulous and not too strong.</li>
            <li>Took me years to find something that actually works great with my skin.</li>
            <li>Really light, and truly non greasy.</li>
            <li>Light feel</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smooth and the satin finish keeps the make up from caking during the day.</li>
            <li>Light, but wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is light, moisturizing without making me oily, and plays well under make up.</li>
            <li>Light but moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a light weight moisturizer for my combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I tried this lotion and while if fit the light weight bill, it was too floral smelling for my tastes.  </li>
            <li>This product is so light.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light, non-offensive floral scent.</li>
            <li>This lotion leaves my face smooth &amp; fresh!  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite moisturizer and I&#x27;m a picky one because of my fair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My favorite was the original moisturizer that came first in glass bottles and then in plastic jars.</li>
            <li>Indeed, I want to keep putting it on because it feels, to me, unique.  </li>
            <li>Its so soft and light and has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>This would be a great product for dry skinned individuals.</li>
            <li>Most people will not find much SPF value in any product that is primarily a lotion, with a sunblock as a side benefit.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel no moisture, everything kind of absorbed and my face got very stretchy around my cheeks like ahhh</li>
            <li>If only, I thought, I could find a MOISTURIZER that made my skin feel so good.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I have not yet seen one advertisement or commercial for this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I even wrote about it on my website Girl</li>
            <li>sorta cucumbery and fresh, oil free</li>
            <li>However, as I have noticed many times, some people find some odors quite intense, and others do not.  </li>
            <li>Just because it feels so good, that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong, although pleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love how soft and smooth my skin feels and for those reasons alone, I will probably continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>odor of this product is quite mild, to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very pleased with the satin finish, as it adds a youthful appearance to the skin that I can definitely use.</li>
            <li>Just what phenomenal value does this new product bring that justifies its price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbed fairly quickly and did not leave a greasy look-who-just-moisturized impression.  </li>
            <li>lotion is good for the dry patches.</li>
            <li>This new product is great for my very sensitive complexion and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way most moisturizers feel on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin, use retinol products and this was a good product to address my dry areas, retinol sensitive areas, and not get more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I tired this lotion/gel through Vine and am very satisfied with the results!  </li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t know if you can really call it light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light in comparison to regular Olay facial lotion but still not the lightest I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I have to admit, I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent of it,</li>
            <li>Olay fresh effects moisturises my face without the oily feel and look.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer by far.</li>
            <li>I really like the satin finish since I really don&#x27;t need to make my face look more oily than it already is.</li>
            <li>This is one out of the 2 Olay products that I repurchase which is the sunscreen from the Fresh Effects line.</li>
            <li>I wish I can find the same kind for the body.</li>
            <li>Lotion is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>B009GEUPPG Olay Fresh Effects</li>
            <li>Satin Finish Lotion is a different kind of moisturizer than I&#x27;m used to seeing from Olay.</li>
            <li>however I&#x27;ve been using the Simple products for about two weeks and have been THRILLED with how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>Rarely to do I find myself fascinated by the way a lotion feels on my skin, but in the case of this lotion, I am fascinated.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice, light-weight facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I would prefer fewer, more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful moisturizer but not quite enough for my very dry winter face!</li>
            <li>though I only notice that during application, and it did take me several days to get used to the feel of it when first applied, as it feels like it sits more on top of the skin than provides penetrating moisture, but I do love how well it covers.</li>
            <li>As for the whole fresh effects thing, yes, this has a fresh and clean aroma that also applies to the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s main benefit was to smooth out my skin for makeup.</li>
            <li>Those few days I used the satin finish lotion, I did notice that it goes on smoothly and really does seem to give me a nice smooth look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, a great little moisturizer for those really needing it.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, but leaves my skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li>wet, but more like a mousse--amazing texture!</li>
            <li>I find to be very light on my skin when applied and unnoticeable a minute or two later.  </li>
            <li>While the product hasn&#x27;t knocked 20 years off of my appearance, it does make my skin feel good and look a little smoother.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when Olay released this moisturizer, because to me it looked like they were gearing this product to a younger audience who wouldn&#x27;t care about quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really illuminates skin and moisturizes well!</li>
            <li>It does indeed feel silky, it glides on, and I could instantly feel that my skin was more hydrated.</li>
            <li>This lotion is exactly what I&#x27;ve been dreaming of.  </li>
            <li>have never worn facial makeup, just eye makeup, as my skin was oily for many years - but that has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and truthfully I don&#x27;t see any visual difference yet.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight and yet sufficiently hydrating!</li>
            <li>It give me exactly what I need:</li>
            <li>I enjoyed it while it lasted and have enough for 6 months,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive, so</li>
            <li>It comes in a handy dispenser that will fit in a purse and pumps out just a small dot at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pump is a super idea because you can regulate how much you use at a time compared to the jars and also the whole product is not exposed to getting any particles in it from your dressing table.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;d like to tell you the positive things about this product first.</li>
            <li>I have been using Clinique&#x27;s oil-free different moisturing gel, but I like Olay&#x27;s new Fresh Effects oil-free lotion much better.</li>
            <li>Lesson i learned, before tryin out any new product, don&#x27;t buy more than 1, because it can disappoint you and more importantly, waste of money.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and soft and sufficiently hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Many high quality lotions exist that perform exactly this function, and they do so quite well for a moderate price.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean - and there&#x27;s a slight fragrance that I enjoy</li>
            <li>I guess I just don&#x27;t really know exactly what a moisturizer is suppose to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now a wonderfully new improved moisturizer in a slim pump that can be easily put in your purse and used for those times when you need a little bit more moisturizer on the go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay for dry skin many times.</li>
            <li>so when I put this on, it got even more dry like wht</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face feel as I have super dry sensitive skin and Olay</li>
            <li>After trying Olay Fresh Effects Lotion, I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>Within about ten minutes I could put on a powder foundation just fine.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is high quality, and it seems to do exactly what Olay claims it will do.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>However, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I really like the satin finish.</li>
            <li>It really reminds me of some silicone based stuff I used to use.  </li>
            <li>Hmm, Satin Finish...sounds promising.  </li>
            <li>This product is very lightweight and has a satiny feel to it.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t notice it too much during the day, when I decided to use it at night, it was just too much.</li>
            <li>When I got home, I tried my wife&#x27;s Olay Fresh Effects moisturizer to relieve the pain in my face and was surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>My fav and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>The finish of this lotion really is satin too</li>
            <li>very silky smooth-ahhhhh.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need the intense hydration that I need at this time of year.</li>
            <li>I can only assume there is some chemical in this lotion, of which there are many, to which some people are sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects {Long Live Moisture!} does what you want it to do: Without using very much, this moisturizes the skin, leaving it feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Just because I think the odor of this lotion is mild, apparently some people find the odor so intense as to be obnoxious.  </li>
            <li>you apply it to your face, {Long Live Moisture!} feels good and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Please note, this is based on information from my wife, who is using {Long Live Moisture!}</li>
            <li>For regular users of Olay, this fragrance will be familiar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having issues with dry skin on my face that no moisturizer has been able to resolve so far.</li>
            <li>This is a new lightweight moisturizer which my skin drinks in and thanks me for, showing it&#x27;s appreciation with a dewy glow.</li>
            <li>A real subtle moisturizer, perfect for oily skin and possibly for combination.</li>
            <li>The sandpaper feeling on the middle of my forehead has been replaced with smooth soft skin.</li>
            <li>and it really makes my skin incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend [[ASIN:B005TI7L7I</li>
            <li>even a high SPF sunblock may be ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended by the Olay website for my oily skin, too.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not a cream, it goes on very lightly and you only need a bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this lotion is gentle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and my skin felt wonderfully soft after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog the pores, it&#x27;s very gentle with damaged skin, mosturize perfect in dry and cold weather</li>
            <li>Then, I came across a bottle of Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in Florida where humidity is a factor, but I can already tell that Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li>Of all that I have tried, the Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li>Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li>so I use Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a dedicated Olay moisturizer user for years, so trying their new product was a no-brainer.</li>
            <li>(I have oily skin and live in Florida.)  </li>
            <li>, it says &amp;#34;long live moisture&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I live in the East Coast and turning 30 taught me that I was losing my youthful glow.</li>
            <li>After one use of this, my skin was very soft.  </li>
            <li>Light, disappears into your skin quickly, only lightly scented and not the least bit</li>
            <li>So difficult to find this kind of lotion!</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Olay and have been happy with almost every product I bought from them - at least two dozen different kinds.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I am well past the age when most women begin using a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a lot; the pump top releases a small amount at a time.  </li>
            <li>Gives that exact same effect, feel and look on my skin as does the ones that are made to control oil from the acne control</li>
            <li>First, it seems that the \\&quot;satiny\\&quot; feel is so addictive that I have a tendency to want to keep applying it.  </li>
            <li>It has a slight matte-satin effect which minimizes fine lines and skin roughness.</li>
            <li>In order for sun blocks to be effective, the sun block needs to be put on thickly, and most people do not leave thick lotion on their skin; they rub it in.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and its fragrance is quite pleasantly delicate.</li>
            <li>I think the dispenser is smart and the size is flexible for traveling and daily use.</li>
            <li>I have mixed skin and this Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li>With this you are assured that the product is clean coming out every time with just the right amount With Olay products a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>found that a little went a long way, and believe this is the kind of product where the individual can decide on an amount depending on the skin needs (though I would recommend this for normal skin).  </li>
            <li>It is soft and has no side effects.</li>
            <li>With the jar I sometimes would get too much on my fingers and would apply the extra to my hands.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I don&#x27;t have a whole daily beauty regime that I have to go through.  </li>
            <li>I like this moisturizer so far.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing that completely turns me off about this product</li>
            <li>not irritate my sensitive skins</li>
            <li>It has a soft, silky feeling to it.</li>
            <li>It is oil-free and non-comedogenic and, so far, I have not had any breakouts with it.</li>
            <li>The product claims to feel like a gel and act like a lotion, keeping skin soft for up to 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s not heavy, but just adds to my \\&quot;mmmmmm\\&quot; experience.</li>
            <li>And, as well, there is no irritation for my slightly sensitive skin and Rocasea - no redness, no stinging.</li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d either take the scent out or do something much more subtle.</li>
            <li>, there is a slight fragrance, and it&#x27;s mild on my touchy skin.</li>
            <li>lotion actually has one significant advantage over all other lotions I have used.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it dries quickly, and really does give a satin finish.</li>
            <li>With this new design there is no extra product to wipe off.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who has had a hard time finding the right moisturizer for their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li>My general feeling about moisturizers and hydrators is that they should be inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>As with the odor, the only way to know whether you are sensitive to this product is to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;skin type: slightly sensitive with occasional redness from Rosacea&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been slowly working my way through the new Fresh Effect line from Olay.</li>
            <li>I put it on everyday after I take a shower, and right before I put on makeup.</li>
            <li>I simply cannot use this product because it made me break out so profoundly.</li>
            <li>or if I will actually see a noticeable difference,  but I am going to continue to use it daily for at least another few months to give it a fair evaluation.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft but I seem to be back where I started by the next day.</li>
            <li>I never really felt like the Estee Lauder product did much for my skin, especially for the price,</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much of this moisturizer to be effective - which is nice, since I am sick of spending lots-o-cash on expensive facial cleansers and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s a great product for people without troubled skin, but unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t exactly worked for me.</li>
            <li>, it really didn&#x27;t do no good like seriously no difference.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I think it works best when you are going out for the evening or to an appointment where you need to look your best.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe it was time and this product presented itself - perfect</li>
            <li> So this lotion provides a perfect conjunction from a seller&#x27;s perspective:  </li>
            <li> My skin fells great!  </li>
            <li> And the best remedy is PREVENTATIVE according to my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> The pump is perfect as the cream jars are a microcosm for bacteria.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the pump bottle is great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall just which one it was, but it was wonderful and Olay has always been a brand I trusted.  </li>
            <li> It suggests to put it on as needed, but for me the once-a-day application is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Also, works really great under makeup and perfect for traveling in my cosmetic case.</li>
            <li> Once they do these things, they will not have a good product; they will have a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great product that does a wonderful job keeping my combination skin moisturized and feeling good.</li>
            <li> it lasts all day and is really great.</li>
            <li> It is truly a great combination of lotion/gel, but not too oily.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Nothing Great about it.</li>
            <li> and this is great for summer moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Great product for acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t happen to you, I think this would be a great product to try.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> , NEVER makes my face break out, and helps GREAT on combination skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a great buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;The smell</li>

            <li> Great.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels great and looks great without the greasy blob sensation.</li>
            <li> Smells great, great formula and good for oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li> the best part of all this is this; my skin looks 100% better since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Once they do these things, they will not have a good product; they will have a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a gel moisturizer, and it is mattifying in a good way.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, it makes an insanely good makeup primer as well.  </li>
            <li> There is no one moisturizer that is good for every person.</li>
            <li> My bestfriend told me to buy this product because she absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> I also have not had any irritation or breakouts from the product, which is always a good thing.  </li>
            <li> think if you need an oil control moisturizer then this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> &quot; connotates the correct nature, for this is a product that succeeds in its aim to moisturize.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The rest of us looking for a good moisturizer, however, will rejoice in</li>
            <li> I use this with the olay foaming face wash and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> After all, their primary function is to keep your skin supple, ideally without blocking your pores and causing an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> is so light and dainty.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love putting this on before I put on make up!</li>
            <li> It is way better than using a primer!</li>
            <li> Words can not contain my love for this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Feels so goo on my face and have ordered 3 more bottles for stock!</li>
            <li> I love the finish on this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin silky smooth and smells great.</li>
            <li> but oh, it felt amazing.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel</li>
            <li> And best of all, it hydrates but even hours later, my face feels great and there are no oil spots.</li>
            <li> Gotta have me a nice tan</li>
            <li> The lotion has a kind of gel feeling to it, yet it is not oily.  </li>
            <li> found it amusing that this lotion does not have any advertised capability to block ultraviolet rays.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed that this product lived up to it&#x27;s own hype.  </li>
            <li> I liked the smell.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what it has it in, honestly.</li>
            <li> A nice addition to my cabinet of potions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lotion/gel combo description is certainly an apt one, for I can&#x27;t think of another way to describe the consistency.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Olay makes many fine products, and I think this product is a perfect fit with Olay.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful and it does a great job at making your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, smells great and makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> The texture is perfect and it makes my makeup go on much smoother and more evenly.  </li>
            <li> It has a light, pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the scent of it to be very strong, not compared to, say, the Olay night creams.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you don&#x27;t care for the Olay signature scent, Satin Finish has its own very light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised that quality seems to have been at the forefront of their minds when they made this product, because it is just wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It smells really really good and feels satiny/velvety smooth when I apply it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face creams I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Is the perfect moisturizer for young skins.</li>
            <li> A lot of lotions on the market make great claims, but rarely do they all hold weight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is what I love about Olay products - they try to find effective products without digging their paws into our wallets until we beg for mercy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a really nice gel-like feel and spreads nicely, leaving my face feeling supple and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very light and non-greasy</li>
            <li> Very, very light scent.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent...</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and the smooth texture!</li>
            <li> Very very happy with this, would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I do not need to reapply to make sure all area is covered.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion and will buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love all of the Olay products.  </li>
            <li> This one made my face feel so nice and velvety smooth.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and will be sticking with it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> and I get many compliments on my &#x27;senior&#x27; skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found most moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I need a more moisturizing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Now that is #GirlGotGlitterApproved :)</li>
            <li> yet I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> My most favorite face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this more this summer after laying out in the sun to help keep my skin from peeling.  </li>
            <li> Please do not be misled by SPF in any product that is not a sunblock, appropriately applied.  </li>
            <li> Of course, many people do not apply and maintain sunblock appropriately anyway, so</li>
            <li> I felt like it gave my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> : more money, not any better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spread a bit on my clean dry face and it feels wonderful - so good on my skin,</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I might like it better in the summer when there is more humidity</li>
            <li> Really lovely</li>
            <li> and I like it much better than a tinted foundation for improving the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this based off the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Has a very unique texture too</li>
            <li> However, I got stuck in a blizzard a while ago and the wind chapped my face pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is not greasy and that it feels great on my skin, leaving it soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lighter moisturizer as summer approached to help keep me from becoming a grease ball.  </li>
            <li> When I put foundation on top of this lotion, it made my skin look extremely smooth and reduced the size and appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li> love how light it is</li>
            <li> I do love how smoothly the satin finish lotion glides on and the feel of it on my skin, but I had to keep reapplying it after washing my face in order to get rid of the tightness.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mom for the good genes.  </li>
            <li> if you see it on here for a good price, I highly recommend buying it!</li>
            <li> my absolute fav moisturizer b/c its not greasy, has a very light NICE not obnoxious scent..</li>
            <li> This lotion has a really excellent feel to it, unlike any other lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It is so smooth and light, I love the satin touch.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> It applies easily and dries to what I would call a matte not satin finish.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, however, it does have a strong scent.</li>
            <li> so I researched the best approach to avoid eye area problems (dark circles, fine lines).</li>
            <li> I guarantee it&#x27;s amazing because it can be no less for me to buy it again since I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the next best thing or something that one-ups it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think anyone who wants just a light moisturizer will find this very appealing.</li>
            <li> I think the scent is fabulous and not too strong.</li>
            <li> Took me years to find something that actually works great with my skin.</li>
            <li> Really light, and truly non greasy.</li>
            <li> Light feel</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smooth and the satin finish keeps the make up from caking during the day.</li>
            <li> Light, but wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It is light, moisturizing without making me oily, and plays well under make up.</li>
            <li> Light but moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light weight moisturizer for my combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I tried this lotion and while if fit the light weight bill, it was too floral smelling for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> This product is so light.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a light, non-offensive floral scent.</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves my face smooth &amp; fresh!  </li>
            <li> My absolute favorite moisturizer and I&#x27;m a picky one because of my fair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite was the original moisturizer that came first in glass bottles and then in plastic jars.</li>
            <li> Indeed, I want to keep putting it on because it feels, to me, unique.  </li>
            <li> Its so soft and light and has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product for dry skinned individuals.</li>
            <li> Most people will not find much SPF value in any product that is primarily a lotion, with a sunblock as a side benefit.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel no moisture, everything kind of absorbed and my face got very stretchy around my cheeks like ahhh</li>
            <li> If only, I thought, I could find a MOISTURIZER that made my skin feel so good.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I have not yet seen one advertisement or commercial for this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much I even wrote about it on my website Girl</li>
            <li> sorta cucumbery and fresh, oil free</li>
            <li> However, as I have noticed many times, some people find some odors quite intense, and others do not.  </li>
            <li> Just because it feels so good, that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> The scent is pretty strong, although pleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love how soft and smooth my skin feels and for those reasons alone, I will probably continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> odor of this product is quite mild, to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very pleased with the satin finish, as it adds a youthful appearance to the skin that I can definitely use.</li>
            <li> Just what phenomenal value does this new product bring that justifies its price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbed fairly quickly and did not leave a greasy look-who-just-moisturized impression.  </li>
            <li> lotion is good for the dry patches.</li>
            <li> This new product is great for my very sensitive complexion and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way most moisturizers feel on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin, use retinol products and this was a good product to address my dry areas, retinol sensitive areas, and not get more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I tired this lotion/gel through Vine and am very satisfied with the results!  </li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t know if you can really call it light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light in comparison to regular Olay facial lotion but still not the lightest I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent of it,</li>
            <li> Olay fresh effects moisturises my face without the oily feel and look.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer by far.</li>
            <li> I really like the satin finish since I really don&#x27;t need to make my face look more oily than it already is.</li>
            <li> This is one out of the 2 Olay products that I repurchase which is the sunscreen from the Fresh Effects line.</li>
            <li> I wish I can find the same kind for the body.</li>
            <li> Lotion is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> B009GEUPPG Olay Fresh Effects</li>
            <li> Satin Finish Lotion is a different kind of moisturizer than I&#x27;m used to seeing from Olay.</li>
            <li> however I&#x27;ve been using the Simple products for about two weeks and have been THRILLED with how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Rarely to do I find myself fascinated by the way a lotion feels on my skin, but in the case of this lotion, I am fascinated.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice, light-weight facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I would prefer fewer, more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer but not quite enough for my very dry winter face!</li>
            <li> though I only notice that during application, and it did take me several days to get used to the feel of it when first applied, as it feels like it sits more on top of the skin than provides penetrating moisture, but I do love how well it covers.</li>
            <li> As for the whole fresh effects thing, yes, this has a fresh and clean aroma that also applies to the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s main benefit was to smooth out my skin for makeup.</li>
            <li> Those few days I used the satin finish lotion, I did notice that it goes on smoothly and really does seem to give me a nice smooth look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, a great little moisturizer for those really needing it.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly, but leaves my skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li> wet, but more like a mousse--amazing texture!</li>
            <li> I find to be very light on my skin when applied and unnoticeable a minute or two later.  </li>
            <li> While the product hasn&#x27;t knocked 20 years off of my appearance, it does make my skin feel good and look a little smoother.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when Olay released this moisturizer, because to me it looked like they were gearing this product to a younger audience who wouldn&#x27;t care about quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really illuminates skin and moisturizes well!</li>
            <li> It does indeed feel silky, it glides on, and I could instantly feel that my skin was more hydrated.</li>
            <li> This lotion is exactly what I&#x27;ve been dreaming of.  </li>
            <li> have never worn facial makeup, just eye makeup, as my skin was oily for many years - but that has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and truthfully I don&#x27;t see any visual difference yet.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight and yet sufficiently hydrating!</li>
            <li> It give me exactly what I need:</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it while it lasted and have enough for 6 months,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive, so</li>
            <li> It comes in a handy dispenser that will fit in a purse and pumps out just a small dot at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pump is a super idea because you can regulate how much you use at a time compared to the jars and also the whole product is not exposed to getting any particles in it from your dressing table.</li>
            <li> That being said, I&#x27;d like to tell you the positive things about this product first.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clinique&#x27;s oil-free different moisturing gel, but I like Olay&#x27;s new Fresh Effects oil-free lotion much better.</li>
            <li> Lesson i learned, before tryin out any new product, don&#x27;t buy more than 1, because it can disappoint you and more importantly, waste of money.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean and soft and sufficiently hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Many high quality lotions exist that perform exactly this function, and they do so quite well for a moderate price.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean - and there&#x27;s a slight fragrance that I enjoy</li>
            <li> I guess I just don&#x27;t really know exactly what a moisturizer is suppose to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now a wonderfully new improved moisturizer in a slim pump that can be easily put in your purse and used for those times when you need a little bit more moisturizer on the go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay for dry skin many times.</li>
            <li> so when I put this on, it got even more dry like wht</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel as I have super dry sensitive skin and Olay</li>
            <li> After trying Olay Fresh Effects Lotion, I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> Within about ten minutes I could put on a powder foundation just fine.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is high quality, and it seems to do exactly what Olay claims it will do.  </li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> However, I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I really like the satin finish.</li>
            <li> It really reminds me of some silicone based stuff I used to use.  </li>
            <li> Hmm, Satin Finish...sounds promising.  </li>
            <li> This product is very lightweight and has a satiny feel to it.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t notice it too much during the day, when I decided to use it at night, it was just too much.</li>
            <li> When I got home, I tried my wife&#x27;s Olay Fresh Effects moisturizer to relieve the pain in my face and was surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> My fav and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> The finish of this lotion really is satin too</li>
            <li> very silky smooth-ahhhhh.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need the intense hydration that I need at this time of year.</li>
            <li> I can only assume there is some chemical in this lotion, of which there are many, to which some people are sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects {Long Live Moisture!} does what you want it to do: Without using very much, this moisturizes the skin, leaving it feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Just because I think the odor of this lotion is mild, apparently some people find the odor so intense as to be obnoxious.  </li>
            <li> you apply it to your face, {Long Live Moisture!} feels good and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Please note, this is based on information from my wife, who is using {Long Live Moisture!}</li>
            <li> For regular users of Olay, this fragrance will be familiar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues with dry skin on my face that no moisturizer has been able to resolve so far.</li>
            <li> This is a new lightweight moisturizer which my skin drinks in and thanks me for, showing it&#x27;s appreciation with a dewy glow.</li>
            <li> A real subtle moisturizer, perfect for oily skin and possibly for combination.</li>
            <li> The sandpaper feeling on the middle of my forehead has been replaced with smooth soft skin.</li>
            <li> and it really makes my skin incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend [[ASIN:B005TI7L7I</li>
            <li> even a high SPF sunblock may be ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was highly recommended by the Olay website for my oily skin, too.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not a cream, it goes on very lightly and you only need a bit to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this lotion is gentle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and my skin felt wonderfully soft after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog the pores, it&#x27;s very gentle with damaged skin, mosturize perfect in dry and cold weather</li>
            <li> Then, I came across a bottle of Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Florida where humidity is a factor, but I can already tell that Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li> Of all that I have tried, the Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li> Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li> so I use Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated Olay moisturizer user for years, so trying their new product was a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> (I have oily skin and live in Florida.)  </li>
            <li> , it says &amp;#34;long live moisture&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I live in the East Coast and turning 30 taught me that I was losing my youthful glow.</li>
            <li> After one use of this, my skin was very soft.  </li>
            <li> Light, disappears into your skin quickly, only lightly scented and not the least bit</li>
            <li> So difficult to find this kind of lotion!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Olay and have been happy with almost every product I bought from them - at least two dozen different kinds.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am well past the age when most women begin using a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot; the pump top releases a small amount at a time.  </li>
            <li> Gives that exact same effect, feel and look on my skin as does the ones that are made to control oil from the acne control</li>
            <li> First, it seems that the \\&quot;satiny\\&quot; feel is so addictive that I have a tendency to want to keep applying it.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight matte-satin effect which minimizes fine lines and skin roughness.</li>
            <li> In order for sun blocks to be effective, the sun block needs to be put on thickly, and most people do not leave thick lotion on their skin; they rub it in.  </li>
            <li> It is very light and its fragrance is quite pleasantly delicate.</li>
            <li> I think the dispenser is smart and the size is flexible for traveling and daily use.</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin and this Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li> With this you are assured that the product is clean coming out every time with just the right amount With Olay products a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> found that a little went a long way, and believe this is the kind of product where the individual can decide on an amount depending on the skin needs (though I would recommend this for normal skin).  </li>
            <li> It is soft and has no side effects.</li>
            <li> With the jar I sometimes would get too much on my fingers and would apply the extra to my hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I don&#x27;t have a whole daily beauty regime that I have to go through.  </li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer so far.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing that completely turns me off about this product</li>
            <li> not irritate my sensitive skins</li>
            <li> It has a soft, silky feeling to it.</li>
            <li> It is oil-free and non-comedogenic and, so far, I have not had any breakouts with it.</li>
            <li> The product claims to feel like a gel and act like a lotion, keeping skin soft for up to 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s not heavy, but just adds to my \\&quot;mmmmmm\\&quot; experience.</li>
            <li> And, as well, there is no irritation for my slightly sensitive skin and Rocasea - no redness, no stinging.</li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d either take the scent out or do something much more subtle.</li>
            <li> , there is a slight fragrance, and it&#x27;s mild on my touchy skin.</li>
            <li> lotion actually has one significant advantage over all other lotions I have used.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it dries quickly, and really does give a satin finish.</li>
            <li> With this new design there is no extra product to wipe off.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who has had a hard time finding the right moisturizer for their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Long Live Moisture!</li>
            <li> My general feeling about moisturizers and hydrators is that they should be inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> As with the odor, the only way to know whether you are sensitive to this product is to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;skin type: slightly sensitive with occasional redness from Rosacea&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been slowly working my way through the new Fresh Effect line from Olay.</li>
            <li> I put it on everyday after I take a shower, and right before I put on makeup.</li>
            <li> I simply cannot use this product because it made me break out so profoundly.</li>
            <li> or if I will actually see a noticeable difference,  but I am going to continue to use it daily for at least another few months to give it a fair evaluation.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft but I seem to be back where I started by the next day.</li>
            <li> I never really felt like the Estee Lauder product did much for my skin, especially for the price,</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much of this moisturizer to be effective - which is nice, since I am sick of spending lots-o-cash on expensive facial cleansers and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a great product for people without troubled skin, but unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t exactly worked for me.</li>
            <li> , it really didn&#x27;t do no good like seriously no difference.</li>
            <li> ANY MOISTURIZER WILL DO AS LONG AS IT IS DONE ON A DAILY BASIS!</li>
            <li> However, I believe an SPF for most lotions is a waste of money and leads to a false sense of security.  </li>
            <li> Of course you should rotate with other moisturizers every now and then too and use different ones for different seasons, skin types, and the time of day.</li>
            <li> Typically when you get a drug store moisturizer it feel slightly heavy and feels like it just sits on top, this stuff however feel exactly like the expensive lotions and moisturizers!</li>
            <li> time my skin had a bit of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the good:&lt;br /&gt;- Long lasting&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, my sensitive skin broke out after a few days of use of this product.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if I would trust it for long term use given my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to any other type.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that gets dry in the forehead, nose, and cheek area and oily everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> and I had visible dry patches on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin and am over 40</li>
            <li> This imparts that same feeling to my skin, which is the dimethicone in it imparting an artificial \\&quot;slip\\&quot;, a smoothness not inherantly there, but whihc makes my makeup layered over it look smooth.</li>
            <li> , I mean really greasy, other parts are dry and patchy, this works for BOTH areas.  </li>
            <li> If you typically utilize Olay products and have no issues, you likely can use this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is usually very dry</li>
            <li> Because I have very dry skin in a problem area over my eyebrows, I put on this product in the morning and in the evening.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a long time so no need to replace every couple of hours like you need to do with some other lotions.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a little smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> and my entire face was greasy within a few hours.</li>
            <li> such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just enough moisture without feeling greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> however i think that a little  product will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Two small squirts is enough to moisturize my face and neck all day.</li>
            <li> Sometimes with the jar moisturizer you can get flicks of make up or other residue.</li>
            <li> like I do from other lotions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To say the least, I am now buying only Olay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just tried another product (not Olay) that was $60 for this tiny tube and the pump bottle, in a word: sucked like the suckest sucker in suckland.</li>
            <li> has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I broke out a little with this, maybe due to what ever &amp;#34;matte finish&amp;#34; they used.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe this product was finally doing the trick, but alas the texture is still rough to the touch.</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t help but point out a couple of negative results specific to my experience: it dried out my hands from applying it to my face</li>
            <li> Sorry to be so gross, but if this is an issue you have with some facial moisturizers, just know that it happened to</li>
            <li> I can feel them sitting there, feeling slightly sticky, and it&#x27;s unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin, prone to rosacea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like Olay products and do like this one but it leaves just a slight greasy feel after application.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes expensive is better, and sometimes expensive is just that</li>
            <li> Thus, every time I see a new, relatively expensive lotion, I tend to roll my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It has very little scent, so that it blends with other products that you may put</li>
            <li> Nor can I see a shiney oil slick, as I sometimes can with other ones.</li>
            <li> I will probably continue to use it, until I find something a little fresher, not floral smelling.</li>
            <li> I found myself sweating a little after I&#x27;d applied</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped my skin recover a little elasticity.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find in my local stores</li>
            <li> this lightweight moisturizer is one of the few products I can use on my skin.</li>
            <li> Moisturized but not at all greasy, not too heavy, no oily sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt moisturized even in the harsh month of March.</li>
            <li> just seem heavy on my skin, probably because I&#x27;m not used to the weight of cosmetics on it.  </li>
            <li> It appears that Olay&#x27;s marketing department was dead on with their description of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is too heavy and my surface facial oil becomes worse throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was just so excited to use this product but crap</li>
            <li> I try to avoid putting prices into a review because prices are subject to constant change, and prices are thus meaningless.  </li>
            <li> I started using this toward the end of this past winter since my normal moisturizer wasn&#x27;t cutting it</li>
            <li> (a moisturizer is supposed to correct dryness not create more); &amp; I&#x27;ve been breaking out terribly since using it.</li>
            <li> And the redness has been non-existant since I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month.</li>
            <li> the product is addictive, to me, and the product is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I used to use olay as a base and then a satin finish cream on top before applying make up, NOW I can skip the satin finish expensive product and use this one for an all in one application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so watery as to make you wonder \\&quot;what the devil is in this stuff?\\&quot; nor is it so thick and creamy you fear an afternoon break-out or at least that heavy sensation of some moist layer upon the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For example I noticed that I could see under eye circles if I stood out late, whereas before I never had that problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with it for at least a month to see if my face adapts to it and there are results.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> but this isn&#x27;t too bad, though I think I&#x27;ll look for an unscented version next time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do no good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I put the wrong thing, or the wrong ingredient on my skin, it flares up and looks red and angry.</li>
            <li> , I agree it&#x27;s a dumb name, but neither my wife nor Olay asked my opinion, which is still distributed gratis.)</li>
            <li> The lotion did not make it worse</li>
            <li> so I always worry lotion is going to make it worse</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the only way to know whether you find this lotion annoying is to try it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores for some reason.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to be ambivalent.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it appears that this product does cause irritation for some people.  </li>
            <li> However, I can point out that dollars per ounce of lotion makes any lotion so priced relatively expensive in comparison to the alternatives.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy concealer or expensive eye creams</li>
            <li> Now here&#x27;s this Olay product that kicks the ass of the expensive one and doesn&#x27;t spit expensive product all over my walls, blouse, hair, mirror.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is somewhat frightening as well which is why I give it three stars</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated Olay moisturizer user for years, so trying their new product was a no-brainer. I have to admit, I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent of it, though I only notice that during application, and it did take me several days to get used to the feel of it when first applied, as it feels like it sits more on top of the skin than provides penetrating moisture, but I do love how well it covers. Two small squirts is enough to moisturize my face and neck all day. And that moisturized feeling does last all day, even, surprisingly enough, after I wash my eye makeup off after a day at work. I&#x27;m also very pleased with the satin finish, as it adds a youthful appearance to the skin that I can definitely use. This is another solid Olay product, one that will continue to be a part of my morning regimen.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when Olay released this moisturizer, because to me it looked like they were gearing this product to a younger audience who wouldn&#x27;t care about quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised that quality seems to have been at the forefront of their minds when they made this product, because it is just wonderful.  Light, disappears into your skin quickly, only lightly scented and not the least bit greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To say the least, I am now buying only Olay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And combined with the Olay Bead Me Up facial scrub, my skin has never been softer or smoother!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Took me years to find something that actually works great with my skin. It is very hard to find in my local stores so I try to stock up since I saw it on Amazon.......so thank you Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Love it! Difficult to find in stores for some reason. This is the best. My son, daughter and myself all use it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lighter moisturizer as summer approached to help keep me from becoming a grease ball.  (I have oily skin and live in Florida.)  This is a gel moisturizer, and it is mattifying in a good way.  Because of this, it makes an insanely good makeup primer as well.  When I put foundation on top of this lotion, it made my skin look extremely smooth and reduced the size and appearance of my pores.</li>
            <li> I am a skincare SNOB. I have always used Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder or Dior moisturizers around 80 bucks a pop. I have combination skin and an oily TZone. After a day in the sun I realized I&#x27;d left my makeup bag at home, so I borrowed some of this stuff from a girlfriend. And I was amazed. Typically when you get a drug store moisturizer it feel slightly heavy and feels like it just sits on top, this stuff however feel exactly like the expensive lotions and moisturizers! I&#x27;m on my second bottle and don&#x27;t plan on spending 80 bucks again any time soon. Also, works really great under makeup and perfect for traveling in my cosmetic case.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. Very light and non-greasy</li>
            <li> Nice smell, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel</li>
            <li> I use this lotion as a primer before makeup.  The texture is perfect and it makes my makeup go on much smoother and more evenly.  I don&#x27;t think this product has sunscreen in it, but my makeup does so it&#x27;s okay.  Finally, a face lotion where my face doesn&#x27;t look greasy but is moisturized!!!  Thank you, Olay!</li>
            <li> Olay fresh effects moisturises my face without the oily feel and look. it lasts all day and is really great.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that I can&#x27;t find on the shelf anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the best face lotion I have ever used. I use it every morning and night after I wash my face. Makes my skin silky smooth and smells great. Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the smooth texture! It&#x27;s a tad pricey for the amount you get though. I wish it came in a larger size and included SPF.</li>
            <li> This new product is great for my very sensitive complexion and is reasonably priced.  Has a very unique texture too</li>
            <li> This is the best face lotion I&#x27;ve used in a while and I have no idea why Target stopped selling it but thankfully I found it on Amazon so I hope they will always have it! Its so soft and light and has a nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product because my roommate threw it in the trash. I fished it out and gave it a try. Awesome. It is truly a great combination of lotion/gel, but not too oily. I have combo skin, use retinol products and this was a good product to address my dry areas, retinol sensitive areas, and not get more breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It smells really really good and feels satiny/velvety smooth when I apply it. However, I have very oily skin and my entire face was greasy within a few hours. The lotion did not make it worse but it definitely did not improve it any.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer by far. It soaks in quickly, but leaves my skin very moisturized. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and lives up to its name leaving me with a satiny, almost matte, glow. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I put it on everyday after I take a shower, and right before I put on makeup. Smells great, great formula and good for oily/combo skin.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite moisturizer and I&#x27;m a picky one because of my fair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it in the morning before putting on my make-up. A little goes a long way, it dries quickly, and really does give a satin finish. It doesn&#x27;t make me oily at all, and it smells delicious! Very very happy with this, would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I Love this lotion! It is so smooth and light, I love the satin touch.  I won&#x27;t go back to any other type.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that gets dry in the forehead, nose, and cheek area and oily everywhere else.  I started using this toward the end of this past winter since my normal moisturizer wasn&#x27;t cutting it and I had visible dry patches on my face.  After one use of this, my skin was very soft.  It didn&#x27;t make me break out at all.  I really like the satin finish since I really don&#x27;t need to make my face look more oily than it already is.</li>
            <li> Nothing Great about it.</li>
            <li> As a forty-something woman with oily skin (it&#x27;s not just for teenagers people) this lightweight moisturizer is one of the few products I can use on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues with dry skin on my face that no moisturizer has been able to resolve so far. I thought maybe this product was finally doing the trick, but alas the texture is still rough to the touch. And I can&#x27;t help but point out a couple of negative results specific to my experience: it dried out my hands from applying it to my face (a moisturizer is supposed to correct dryness not create more); &amp; I&#x27;ve been breaking out terribly since using it. Maybe it&#x27;s a great product for people without troubled skin, but unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t exactly worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive dry skin and this is great for summer moisturizing.  Very happy with the product and grateful to the people who took the time to review it, without them I would never have found it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best face creams I have used so far. It last longer. It is soft and has no side effects. If it suits your skin, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is one out of the 2 Olay products that I repurchase which is the sunscreen from the Fresh Effects line. I guarantee it&#x27;s amazing because it can be no less for me to buy it again since I&#x27;m always on the hunt for the next best thing or something that one-ups it. Of course you should rotate with other moisturizers every now and then too and use different ones for different seasons, skin types, and the time of day. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Think this is the best face lotion for women. It&#x27;s light, smells great and makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> Really light, and truly non greasy. So difficult to find this kind of lotion! I wish I can find the same kind for the body.</li>
            <li> I like the satin feel when putting it on my face and neck. I do not need to reapply to make sure all area is covered. I like the product.</li>
            <li> Great product for acne prone skin.  Really illuminates skin and moisturizes well! I use this with the olay foaming face wash and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Olay and have been happy with almost every product I bought from them - at least two dozen different kinds.&lt;br /&gt;This time my skin had a bit of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the good:&lt;br /&gt;- Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;- Light feel&lt;br /&gt;- Matte finish which can cover up a bit with out looking fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neutral:&lt;br /&gt;- The scent is pretty strong, although pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;- I broke out a little with this, maybe due to what ever &amp;#34;matte finish&amp;#34; they used.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Olay products for years and years. My favorite was the original moisturizer that came first in glass bottles and then in plastic jars. Now a wonderfully new improved moisturizer in a slim pump that can be easily put in your purse and used for those times when you need a little bit more moisturizer on the go. I really like the satin finish. I used to use olay as a base and then a satin finish cream on top before applying make up, NOW I can skip the satin finish expensive product and use this one for an all in one application. It makes my skin feel smooth and the satin finish keeps the make up from caking during the day.The pump is a super idea because you can regulate how much you use at a time compared to the jars and also the whole product is not exposed to getting any particles in it from your dressing table. Sometimes with the jar moisturizer you can get flicks of make up or other residue. With this you are assured that the product is clean coming out every time with just the right amount With Olay products a little goes a long way. With the jar I sometimes would get too much on my fingers and would apply the extra to my hands. With this new design there is no extra product to wipe off. I love the way it makes my face feel as I have super dry sensitive skin and Olay has never let me down. I will definitely buy this product from now on.</li>
            <li> There is no one moisturizer that is good for every person. That being said, I&#x27;d like to tell you the positive things about this product first. Olay touts this as a breakthrough in that it is a combination of a cream and a gel. It does indeed feel silky, it glides on, and I could instantly feel that my skin was more hydrated. Also, if you don&#x27;t care for the Olay signature scent, Satin Finish has its own very light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the next morning, there was the dreaded whitehead tucked in the crease of my nose. Sorry to be so gross, but if this is an issue you have with some facial moisturizers, just know that it happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that doesn&#x27;t happen to you, I think this would be a great product to try.</li>
            <li> If you typically utilize Olay products and have no issues, you likely can use this product.  However, my sensitive skin broke out after a few days of use of this product.  Those few days I used the satin finish lotion, I did notice that it goes on smoothly and really does seem to give me a nice smooth look. It really reminds me of some silicone based stuff I used to use.  It works well under make-up. I simply cannot use this product because it made me break out so profoundly. Historically speaking, I have had the same result with just about any Olay product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oil of Olay for dry skin many times. It helps but never seems to finish the job even after weeks of daily use. So I wanted to try this version. It leaves my skin feeling soft but I seem to be back where I started by the next day. So this is a temporary solution for me. I think it works best when you are going out for the evening or to an appointment where you need to look your best. It does have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Satiny finish. A real subtle moisturizer, perfect for oily skin and possibly for combination. Light, but wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Not wet, but more like a mousse--amazing texture!</li>
            <li> I think the scent is fabulous and not too strong. The feel is satiny and not oily at all. It absorbs very quickly. I am in love with this lotion and will buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;I am not breaking out at all from it like I do from other lotions. I have been using Clinique&#x27;s oil-free different moisturing gel, but I like Olay&#x27;s new Fresh Effects oil-free lotion much better.</li>
            <li> For YEARS I have been looking for a face moisturizer that imparts the same silky feeling as Estee Lauder&#x27;s Idealist, which is not a moisturizer.  I never really felt like the Estee Lauder product did much for my skin, especially for the price, but oh, it felt amazing.  If only, I thought, I could find a MOISTURIZER that made my skin feel so good.  I have literally checked out every department store brand, and every moisturizer that Ulta carried, and had given up hope.  Then, I came across a bottle of Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! Satin Finish Lotion in my local Walgreens.  Hmm, Satin Finish...sounds promising.  The cashier let me open up the bottle and squirt a bit of it on my hand. Hallelujah!  It&#x27;s a miracle!  This lotion is exactly what I&#x27;ve been dreaming of.  It&#x27;s lightweight, glides on my skin and leaves it feeling oh-so-silky-wonderful.  Moisturized but not at all greasy, not too heavy, no oily sunscreen.  I have sensitive skin, and this lotion is gentle.  I&#x27;m in Florida where humidity is a factor, but I can already tell that Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! Satin Finish Lotion will be my year-round moisturizer. Surprisingly, I have not yet seen one advertisement or commercial for this product.  If I hadn&#x27;t stumbled across it, I would never have known about it.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Olay products.  This one made my face feel so nice and velvety smooth.  Hope Olay continues to make this product.</li>
            <li> This product is very lightweight and has a satiny feel to it. Since it&#x27;s not a cream, it goes on very lightly and you only need a bit to go a long way. My skin felt moisturized even in the harsh month of March. Like others have said, however, it does have a strong scent. While I didn&#x27;t notice it too much during the day, when I decided to use it at night, it was just too much. I wish they&#x27;d either take the scent out or do something much more subtle.</li>
            <li> I have been slowly working my way through the new Fresh Effect line from Olay. Of all that I have tried, the Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! Lotion is by far my favorite. It goes on smoothly. No greasy feeling. Very, very light scent. And best of all, it hydrates but even hours later, my face feels great and there are no oil spots. I absolutely love this product and will be sticking with it.</li>
            <li> Mehh. I don&#x27;t even wanna write any review for this one but hey, im just gonna say it out there. My bestfriend told me to buy this product because she absolutely loved it so I went on amazon and ordered 2 of these products. It didn&#x27;t do no good on my skin. I was just so excited to use this product but crap, it really didn&#x27;t do no good like seriously no difference. My skin is usually very dry so when I put this on, it got even more dry like wht the hell, it says &amp;#34;long live moisture&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t feel no moisture, everything kind of absorbed and my face got very stretchy around my cheeks like ahhh! such a waste of money. but hey, everybody&#x27;s skin is different so it&#x27;s okay. Lesson i learned, before tryin out any new product, don&#x27;t buy more than 1, because it can disappoint you and more importantly, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am well past the age when most women begin using a moisturizer.  I never felt the need to and I get many compliments on my &#x27;senior&#x27; skin.  Thanks Mom for the good genes.  I thought that maybe it was time and this product presented itself - perfect timing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never worn facial makeup, just eye makeup, as my skin was oily for many years - but that has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waffled between giving it 3 or 4 stars, as I have been using it daily for almost a month now and truthfully I don&#x27;t see any visual difference yet.  I love that it is not greasy and that it feels great on my skin, leaving it soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long or if I will actually see a noticeable difference,  but I am going to continue to use it daily for at least another few months to give it a fair evaluation.  I am sorry to be ambivalent.  I guess I just don&#x27;t really know exactly what a moisturizer is suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love how soft and smooth my skin feels and for those reasons alone, I will probably continue to use it.  I will update this review if and when I see or don&#x27;t see any results after prolonged, regular usage.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so I don&#x27;t have a whole daily beauty regime that I have to go through.  But I&#x27;ve reached the age where my skin has changed and is drier now.  I&#x27;ve found most moisturizers that I&#x27;ve tried just seem heavy on my skin, probably because I&#x27;m not used to the weight of cosmetics on it.  [[ASIN:B009GEUPPG Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! Satin Finish Lotion 1.7 Fl Oz]] I find to be very light on my skin when applied and unnoticeable a minute or two later.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot; the pump top releases a small amount at a time.  I didn&#x27;t find the scent of it to be very strong, not compared to, say, the Olay night creams.  While the product hasn&#x27;t knocked 20 years off of my appearance, it does make my skin feel good and look a little smoother.  I also have not had any irritation or breakouts from the product, which is always a good thing.  This product is one that I could actually see myself continuing to use.</li>
            <li> Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! Satin Finish Lotion is a different kind of moisturizer than I&#x27;m used to seeing from Olay. It applies easily and dries to what I would call a matte not satin finish. It&#x27;s not greasy at all and feels like a powdery finish when it dries on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I don&#x27;t like this moisturizer, not for my skin type. I have dry skin and am over 40 so I need a different type of moisture than this provides. I need a more moisturizing moisturizer. My skin looks even drier after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of an oil-control lotion. Gives that exact same effect, feel and look on my skin as does the ones that are made to control oil from the acne control brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you need an oil control moisturizer then this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li> Being a man, I&#x27;ve never put any creams, balms, unguents, liniment, or moisturizers on my face.  However, I got stuck in a blizzard a while ago and the wind chapped my face pretty good.  When I got home, I tried my wife&#x27;s Olay Fresh Effects moisturizer to relieve the pain in my face and was surprised at how well it worked.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this for myself, but I&#x27;ll steal it from my wife when she buys it again.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and yet sufficiently hydrating! I like this moisturizer so far.  The bottle is a little smaller than i expected however i think that a little  product will go a long way.  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product for dry skinned individuals. I have the dreaded combination skin so I use Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! Satin Finish Lotion on my forehead and eyebrows. Anywhere else and it will give me pimples. If you have oily skin, this is NOT the product for you!</li>
            <li> Is the perfect moisturizer for young skins. Doesn&#x27;t clog the pores, it&#x27;s very gentle with damaged skin, mosturize perfect in dry and cold weather</li>
            <li> I absolutely love putting this on before I put on make up! It is way better than using a primer!</li>
            <li> Words can not contain my love for this moisturizer! It is light, moisturizing without making me oily, and plays well under make up. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the Subscribe &amp; Save price here on Amazon! I have gone threw two bottles already and have my third on the way in my October shipment. I love it so much I even wrote about it on my website Girl Got Glitter! Now that is #GirlGotGlitterApproved :)</li>
            <li> Feels so goo on my face and have ordered 3 more bottles for stock!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found an Olay product yet I don&#x27;t love. This is a new lightweight moisturizer which my skin drinks in and thanks me for, showing it&#x27;s appreciation with a dewy glow. I don&#x27;t like the way most moisturizers feel on my very sensitive skin. I can feel them sitting there, feeling slightly sticky, and it&#x27;s unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is different. I cannot feel it once I put it on. Nor can I see a shiney oil slick, as I sometimes can with other ones. I have slightly oily skin, prone to rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;If I put the wrong thing, or the wrong ingredient on my skin, it flares up and looks red and angry. This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t do that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how light it is, there is a slight fragrance, and it&#x27;s mild on my touchy skin. It give me exactly what I need: a moist feeling that lasts, a look of no oil on my face, and no scent that reminds me it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This reminds me of Estee Lauder Perfectionist CP+R, which is a dimethicone based moisturizer that&#x27;s main benefit was to smooth out my skin for makeup. This imparts that same feeling to my skin, which is the dimethicone in it imparting an artificial \\&quot;slip\\&quot;, a smoothness not inherantly there, but whihc makes my makeup layered over it look smooth. This is a gel formula, which is the hallmark of dimethicone based moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part of all this is this; my skin looks 100% better since I&#x27;ve been using it. The sandpaper feeling on the middle of my forehead has been replaced with smooth soft skin. The lines are almost invisible. And the redness has been non-existant since I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month. This one&#x27;s a keeper. I highly recommend this for anyone who has had a hard time finding the right moisturizer for their sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My most favorite face moisturizer. Love the scent.  Light but moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This lotion leaves my face smooth &amp; fresh!  I have oily skin so I always worry lotion is going to make it worse but that is not the case with this.  My fav and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of Olay products.  There is nothing that completely turns me off about this product but there is also nothing that excites me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did not irritate my sensitive skins but...  did not feel like it did a lot for me either.  I only used it a couple of days but I don&#x27;t know if I would trust it for long term use given my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be happier if it would lose the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a moistener that is unscented I would highly recommend [[ASIN:B005TI7L7I Simple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce]].  Both products don&#x27;t have sun protection which is a draw back for the Simple moisturizer however I&#x27;ve been using the Simple products for about two weeks and have been THRILLED with how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light weight moisturizer for my combination skin.  I tried this lotion and while if fit the light weight bill, it was too floral smelling for my tastes.  I will probably continue to use it, until I find something a little fresher, not floral smelling.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower.  Works great.</li>
            <li> My local retail stores discontinued this product but it was/IS my absolute fav moisturizer b/c its not greasy, has a very light NICE not obnoxious scent.. sorta cucumbery and fresh, oil free, NEVER makes my face break out, and helps GREAT on combination skin.  Parts of my face are oily/shiny and times greasy, I mean really greasy, other parts are dry and patchy, this works for BOTH areas.  Olay PLEASE bring it back!  I pick it up where EVER I find it anymore esp on Amazon.  I enjoyed it while it lasted and have enough for 6 months, if you see it on here for a good price, I highly recommend buying it!</li>
            <li> I like Olay products and do like this one but it leaves just a slight greasy feel after application.  The fragrance is wonderful and it does a great job at making your skin feel soft and smooth.  It lasts quite a long time so no need to replace every couple of hours like you need to do with some other lotions.  I will be using this more this summer after laying out in the sun to help keep my skin from peeling.  Gotta have me a nice tan and I think this will help quite a bit.</li>
            <li> My general feeling about moisturizers and hydrators is that they should be inexpensive.  After all, their primary function is to keep your skin supple, ideally without blocking your pores and causing an allergic reaction.  Many high quality lotions exist that perform exactly this function, and they do so quite well for a moderate price.  Thus, every time I see a new, relatively expensive lotion, I tend to roll my eyes.  Just what phenomenal value does this new product bring that justifies its price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion actually has one significant advantage over all other lotions I have used.  This lotion has a really excellent feel to it, unlike any other lotion I have ever used.  Indeed, I want to keep putting it on because it feels, to me, unique.  The lotion has a kind of gel feeling to it, yet it is not oily.  Olay claims that the lotion leaves your skin with a satiny feel, and I can attest to that.  Rarely to do I find myself fascinated by the way a lotion feels on my skin, but in the case of this lotion, I am fascinated.  It appears that Olay&#x27;s marketing department was dead on with their description of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor of this product is quite mild, to me.  However, as I have noticed many times, some people find some odors quite intense, and others do not.  Just because I think the odor of this lotion is mild, apparently some people find the odor so intense as to be obnoxious.  I can only assume there is some chemical in this lotion, of which there are many, to which some people are sensitive.  Unfortunately, the only way to know whether you find this lotion annoying is to try it yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it amusing that this lotion does not have any advertised capability to block ultraviolet rays.  However, I believe an SPF for most lotions is a waste of money and leads to a false sense of security.  In order for sun blocks to be effective, the sun block needs to be put on thickly, and most people do not leave thick lotion on their skin; they rub it in.  Once the lotion has been spread to the point where it is no longer visible to the naked eye, the SPF value is usually so miniscule that you may as well not have had any SPF value in the first place.  Please do not be misled by SPF in any product that is not a sunblock, appropriately applied.  Most people will not find much SPF value in any product that is primarily a lotion, with a sunblock as a side benefit.  Of course, many people do not apply and maintain sunblock appropriately anyway, so even a high SPF sunblock may be ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem with any product that you put on your skin that contains chemicals, and this product contains a lengthy list of chemicals, is that the product can cause irritation or breaking out.  Unfortunately, it appears that this product does cause irritation for some people.  As with the odor, the only way to know whether you are sensitive to this product is to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only know of two drawbacks to this product (overlooking possible objections to odor and irritation, neither of which affects me).  First, it seems that the \\&quot;satiny\\&quot; feel is so addictive that I have a tendency to want to keep applying it.  I consider that a drawback because of the second drawback, which is the price.  I try to avoid putting prices into a review because prices are subject to constant change, and prices are thus meaningless.  However, I can point out that dollars per ounce of lotion makes any lotion so priced relatively expensive in comparison to the alternatives.  So this lotion provides a perfect conjunction from a seller&#x27;s perspective:  the product is addictive, to me, and the product is expensive.  However, considering the cost, I suspect that my addiction to this product is one that I will break quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay makes many fine products, and I think this product is a perfect fit with Olay.  This lotion is high quality, and it seems to do exactly what Olay claims it will do.  Now Olay needs to figureout how to sell this product in larger quantities for a lower price.  Once they do these things, they will not have a good product; they will have a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!out how to sell this product in larger quantities for a lower price.  Once they do these things, they will not have a good product; they will have a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice, light-weight facial moisturizer. It has a soft, silky feeling to it. The fragrance is subtle and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt oft after using it. It is oil-free and non-comedogenic and, so far, I have not had any breakouts with it.</li>
            <li> I love the finish on this moisturizer! It&#x27;s a gel and a lotion and it really makes my skin incredibly soft! I will buy this over and over again. The finish of this lotion really is satin too and it feels like satin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s discontinued and I am stockpiling it.</li>
            <li> After trying Olay Fresh Effects Lotion, I was pleasantly surprised!  The product claims to feel like a gel and act like a lotion, keeping skin soft for up to 24 hrs. A lot of lotions on the market make great claims, but rarely do they all hold weight.  I was amazed that this product lived up to it&#x27;s own hype.  My skin fells great!  I&#x27;m really glad I tired this lotion/gel through Vine and am very satisfied with the results!  I will definitely be buying this regularly!</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that I have not taken care of my skin like I should because I always thought time was on my side. I wasn&#x27;t a makeup addict so I figured  I didn&#x27;t need a moisturizer. Boy was I wrong. I live in the East Coast and turning 30 taught me that I was losing my youthful glow. For example I noticed that I could see under eye circles if I stood out late, whereas before I never had that problem. I didn&#x27;t want to buy concealer or expensive eye creams so I researched the best approach to avoid eye area problems (dark circles, fine lines). The key is moisturizing on a daily basis. ANY MOISTURIZER WILL DO AS LONG AS IT IS DONE ON A DAILY BASIS! And the best remedy is PREVENTATIVE according to my dermatologist. On to the review, I have used this moisturizer for 30 + days and still have some left over. It is a great buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so light and dainty.  The pump is perfect as the cream jars are a microcosm for bacteria. It is portable-slim enough to throw in your make up bag or keep in your desk drawer at work.</li>
            <li> This product is so light. Just enough moisture without feeling greasy or heavy. And it smells great.</li>
            <li> PROS: I liked the smell. For regular users of Olay, this fragrance will be familiar. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and my skin felt wonderfully soft after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I don&#x27;t know if you can really call it light. It&#x27;s light in comparison to regular Olay facial lotion but still not the lightest I&#x27;ve ever experienced. (That accolade would go to Neutrogena with sunscreen.) I found myself sweating a little after I&#x27;d applied this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 STARS: I really liked this lotion. I felt like it gave my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Age: 55&lt;br /&gt;skin type: slightly sensitive with occasional redness from Rosacea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the pump bottle is great! I just tried another product (not Olay) that was $60 for this tiny tube and the pump bottle, in a word: sucked like the suckest sucker in suckland. Now here&#x27;s this Olay product that kicks the ass of the expensive one and doesn&#x27;t spit expensive product all over my walls, blouse, hair, mirror. yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much of this moisturizer to be effective - which is nice, since I am sick of spending lots-o-cash on expensive facial cleansers and moisturizers. Sometimes expensive is better, and sometimes expensive is just that: more money, not any better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what I love about Olay products - they try to find effective products without digging their paws into our wallets until we beg for mercy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I pump a bit of this product (and you don&#x27;t need a lot!), it has a luminescent look to it, and that I like. Maybe I&#x27;m fooling myself, but I feel that luminescence will be on my face as well, and it does seem to transfer in that way. I spread a bit on my clean dry face and it feels wonderful - so good on my skin, very silky smooth-ahhhhh. I don&#x27;t care what it has it in, honestly. Just because it feels so good, that&#x27;s enough for me. It&#x27;s not expensive, so why not? Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean - and there&#x27;s a slight fragrance that I enjoy -- it&#x27;s not heavy, but just adds to my \\&quot;mmmmmm\\&quot; experience. And, as well, there is no irritation for my slightly sensitive skin and Rocasea - no redness, no stinging. It&#x27;s not greasy, so there&#x27;s no clogged pores to create blemishes, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one I&#x27;ll buy.</li>
            <li> Olay&#x27;s Fresh Effects {Long Live Moisture!} does what you want it to do: Without using very much, this moisturizes the skin, leaving it feeling smooth and soft. It has very little scent, so that it blends with other products that you may put on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply it to your face, {Long Live Moisture!} feels good and lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Please note, this is based on information from my wife, who is using {Long Live Moisture!} daily.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Yes, I agree it&#x27;s a dumb name, but neither my wife nor Olay asked my opinion, which is still distributed gratis.)</li>
            <li> Because I have very dry skin in a problem area over my eyebrows, I put on this product in the morning and in the evening. It is very light and its fragrance is quite pleasantly delicate. It&#x27;s helped my skin recover a little elasticity. A nice addition to my cabinet of potions.</li>
            <li> One note I would like to make on this moisturizer is I don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;light\\&quot; connotates the correct nature, for this is a product that succeeds in its aim to moisturize.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a fault, but a person looking for only the barest bit of moisture for their skin might want to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of us looking for a good moisturizer, however, will rejoice in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used an Olay moisturizer since my college days and for the life of me I don&#x27;t know why I quit. I don&#x27;t recall just which one it was, but it was wonderful and Olay has always been a brand I trusted.  I consider this to be another product that simply lives up to the Olay standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion/gel combo description is certainly an apt one, for I can&#x27;t think of another way to describe the consistency.  It&#x27;s not so watery as to make you wonder \\&quot;what the devil is in this stuff?\\&quot; nor is it so thick and creamy you fear an afternoon break-out or at least that heavy sensation of some moist layer upon the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that a little went a long way, and believe this is the kind of product where the individual can decide on an amount depending on the skin needs (though I would recommend this for normal skin).  It absorbed fairly quickly and did not leave a greasy look-who-just-moisturized impression.  Within about ten minutes I could put on a powder foundation just fine.  The moisture?  Great.  My skin feels clean and soft and sufficiently hydrated.  It suggests to put it on as needed, but for me the once-a-day application is perfect.  As for the whole fresh effects thing, yes, this has a fresh and clean aroma that also applies to the sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, a great little moisturizer for those really needing it. Skin feels great and looks great without the greasy blob sensation.</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin and this Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! lotion is good for the dry patches. It comes in a handy dispenser that will fit in a purse and pumps out just a small dot at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light, non-offensive floral scent. It doesn&#x27;t have SPF rating so it won&#x27;t protect skin from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely keep this away from the eyes because it will cause them to burn and water. I found this out when I put some on my lower eyelid. The ingredient list is somewhat frightening as well which is why I give it three stars--it&#x27;s okay but I would prefer fewer, more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer but not quite enough for my very dry winter face! I might like it better in the summer when there is more humidity and I don&#x27;t need the intense hydration that I need at this time of year. I do love how smoothly the satin finish lotion glides on and the feel of it on my skin, but I had to keep reapplying it after washing my face in order to get rid of the tightness. It has a light, pleasant fragrance. It is supposed to be oil-free and non-comedogenic so it shouldn&#x27;t clog pores or cause any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think anyone who wants just a light moisturizer will find this very appealing.</li>
            <li> Great product that does a wonderful job keeping my combination skin moisturized and feeling good.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has a really nice gel-like feel and spreads nicely, leaving my face feeling supple and smooth. It has a slight matte-satin effect which minimizes fine lines and skin roughness. Really lovely and I like it much better than a tinted foundation for improving the appearance of my skin. It has a very light scent... I don&#x27;t care for scented products on my face but this isn&#x27;t too bad, though I think I&#x27;ll look for an unscented version next time.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this based off the great reviews. It was highly recommended by the Olay website for my oily skin, too. I think the dispenser is smart and the size is flexible for traveling and daily use. I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I must say, I don&#x27;t understand the hype. This moisturizer is too heavy and my surface facial oil becomes worse throughout the day. I&#x27;ll stick with it for at least a month to see if my face adapts to it and there are results.</li>
