    <ol>
            <li>I had  coupon and got it for a great price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a ton of makeup, which is especially nice in the summertime.</li>
            <li>The ivory/fair was a perfect match.</li>
            <li>;. I am a minimalist, and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy, lasts, perfect color,</li>
            <li>This works great in doing what I want.</li>
            <li>It gives great coverage and looks great once it soaks in.</li>
            <li>but is is a great product and layers well.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>this is good stuff</li>
            <li>My complexion is generally good with no problem whatsoever, just need something that can even it out and perhaps brighten it a bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>It is good to note that I do NOT use this as a foundation but rather a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The coverage is good</li>
            <li>So this product works great and makes my skin more even.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>This kind of buffs it out</li>
            <li>A very nice product for light, matte coverage.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena makes great products for a healthy clean face.  </li>
            <li>This is a good, light, non-greasy tinting moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is by far THE BEST foundation I&#x27;ve found for my combo oily-dry skin.</li>
            <li>It glides on effortlessly, blends beautifully, and really does improve skin&#x27;s appearance over time.</li>
            <li>Perfect for people who just need something to even out the complexion but has spf at the same time.</li>
            <li>and I always have to add a layer of powder on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Because I want to give it another chance (there aren&#x27;t that many day creams with so many benefitial properties)</li>
            <li>I purchased the lightest shade and I hope that by mixing both shades I will get a better match for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more. :)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with his product.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be more like a foundation.</li>
            <li>The ivory/fair is the lightest color but the picture makes it look a lot more orange than the fair/light one</li>
            <li>I decided to buy it at the store nearby to judge colors better.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s quite a bit more pricey</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but these days with the work I do, I put my face on a lot more.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li>#30/Buff\\&quot; on top of this.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a serum type product that has a tint.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tried many many products, including Rx strength.</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty fair skinned</li>
            <li>and then I top off with a light dusting of finishing powder and a spritz of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it lightly covers and that it has SPF protection.  </li>
            <li>try to order more before its no longer available.</li>
            <li>I cannot go w/o some kind of coverage w/o people asking \\&quot;oh are you hot?</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me, but if you have dry skin, and the color matches it, it might be a really good choice for you, since it does apply very smoothly and smells okay.</li>
            <li>Oil free and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I like this one because it is so light and airy.</li>
            <li>how smooth my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t emphasize lines or pores.  </li>
            <li>and I put it on over a light touch of moisturizer and</li>
            <li>I was looking for a light tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this &amp;#34;make</li>
            <li>its really light.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Its light coverage</li>
            <li>But this shade was just a bit too light for me.  </li>
            <li>Fits my skin well, and it makes my face feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>So even though it&#x27;s sheer don&#x27;t expect it to dissappear on your skin and make sure you find a good color match.</li>
            <li>Estee Lauder Day Wear is a superior product, giving a natural glow as well as sufficient moisture.  </li>
            <li>Been using for about a week and so far so good, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite foundation, even when my skin is not doing well, and it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out more.</li>
            <li>the coverage was wiped clean.  </li>
            <li>so I use the fair to light in the winter then go up to the light to neutral in the summer when I get a little more tanned.</li>
            <li>The coverage was good initially but because I had to keep applying moisturizer</li>
            <li>I tend to have red blotchy cheeks, and not the good kind that looks like a natural blush.</li>
            <li>(I have acne and mild rosacea) and provides some sun protection.  </li>
            <li>the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer did the same thing, and sometimes did it even better, for about 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer is a little more like a foundation, it&#x27;s not as liquid as the Olay, but it&#x27;s very light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores.</li>
            <li>The only issues I have is that is has a STRONG sunscreen smell (so my husband always knows when I wear it) and that it rubs off very easily.  </li>
            <li>Really like it!!</li>
            <li>Make sure you note the expiration date when you purchase it however, beyond this date the pump does tend to clump and it is less effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, and this was the only one that fit the bill.</li>
            <li>well it is well worth the $10 every so often.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since I was in high school, so about 10 years now, and I love it so much that I am never without it.</li>
            <li>Very very light so its barely visible on your face.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 years now and have less breakouts, my skin tone is more even, and it&#x27;s also given me a more youthful dewy glow.</li>
            <li>Small breakouts in the t zone and dryness around my nose are some of the things I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena Skin Enhancer goes on smoothly, spread evenly, and gives good coverage without being thick.</li>
            <li>Very light moisturizer, provides sheer coverage.</li>
            <li>but i totally am getting more</li>
            <li>I was looking for a \\&quot;bb\\&quot; cream but didn&#x27;t see anything that interested me, then I came across this.  </li>
            <li>not as heavy as foundation but pretty good coverage and</li>
            <li>I then use a foundation on top of this but only for under my eyes and around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>-- much cheaper just getting it at the drugstore!</li>
            <li>Light coverage, pretty matte, doesnt feel oily, Looks better when is dried.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, blue eyed, lt brown hair--I have perm sun damaged face (from my earlier years of sun bathing w/o sunscreen).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so happy about the clear packaging, I&#x27;m not sure the retinol and the vitamins remain stable.</li>
            <li>Two things I really like about this are the sun protection and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t offer as much coverage</li>
            <li>This will be going straight into the trash.</li>
            <li>So, even though I really like this product for the price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use as much</li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Enhancer technically isn&#x27;t a foundation, but gives a clear and oil-free look.</li>
            <li>Not too thick, but gives good coverage.  </li>
            <li>But I wanted a new tinted moisturizer with a higher SPF than the one I had been using.</li>
            <li>I used the light to neutral and it went on very chalky, not natural.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup normally...</li>
            <li>If you have sun damage, I would highly recommend this product--and try a shade or 2 darker than you might normally try!</li>
            <li>It used to be easy to find, but it&#x27;s getting harder.</li>
            <li>I bought this in the hopes that it would provide decent coverage without over drying my skin.  </li>
            <li>A tinted moisturizer should moisturize your face, that is one of it&#x27;s main functions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m been using it now for about two month, and not only did my skin not negatively react, but my skin actually looks better than it did before I started using this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t or at least not the kind of coverage</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this product makes my skin greasy (and now I&#x27;ve started breaking out, a problem I don&#x27;t normally have)</li>
            <li>I want a foundation with more even coverage and less oil!</li>
            <li>Since I have light skin, I wondered if this was too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this tinted moisturizer for more than half a year consistently on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It settled into the fine lines of my skin and did not retain any moisture but became dried out.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly with just a hint of color; The pump takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li>I use this as my &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s so light and has a little bit of tint to it.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to my younger and older sisters (I have 4 of them!)</li>
            <li>This has a near gel texture, with the benefits of retinol and spf 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, it is not excessively dry or oily.</li>
            <li>I got a bit older and actually was making some money</li>
            <li>I have tried a million different foundations since I was in high school for something that won&#x27;t clog my pores or makes me feel oily at noon.</li>
            <li>I am always reluctant to try any new facial product, because I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I go back a few days later and buy Neutrogena&#x27;s healthy skin enhancer again.</li>
            <li>It does add moisture to my dry skin but it is pretty sheer.</li>
            <li>Shipped from Amazon quickly and at a price slightly less than local drugstores.</li>
            <li>This had been recommended to me because of my acne-prone skin apparently since it includes a retinol, but since I already use a benzoyl peroxide product during the day and I&#x27;m not supposed to combine retinol and benzoyl, I had to return it.   </li>
            <li>I am a mid-40&#x27;s medical professional who has worked in dermatology</li>
            <li>It did not make my skin look better but worse over time.  </li>
            <li>The SPF is a big plus as well since certain other makeups with SPF tended to make me break out.</li>
            <li>also switched from using mineral foundation - something I should have quit a long time ago considering how old I am - and I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup.  </li>
            <li>I like to wear light coverage in the summer and to help avoid breakouts, and this fits the bill since I can hardly feel the layer of makeup when its on!</li>

            <li> Two things I really like about this are the sun protection and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t offer as much coverage</li>
            <li> This will be going straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> So, even though I really like this product for the price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use as much</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Enhancer technically isn&#x27;t a foundation, but gives a clear and oil-free look.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, but gives good coverage.  </li>
            <li> But I wanted a new tinted moisturizer with a higher SPF than the one I had been using.</li>
            <li> I used the light to neutral and it went on very chalky, not natural.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup normally...</li>
            <li> If you have sun damage, I would highly recommend this product--and try a shade or 2 darker than you might normally try!</li>
            <li> It used to be easy to find, but it&#x27;s getting harder.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hopes that it would provide decent coverage without over drying my skin.  </li>
            <li> A tinted moisturizer should moisturize your face, that is one of it&#x27;s main functions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using it now for about two month, and not only did my skin not negatively react, but my skin actually looks better than it did before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t or at least not the kind of coverage</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this product makes my skin greasy (and now I&#x27;ve started breaking out, a problem I don&#x27;t normally have)</li>
            <li> I want a foundation with more even coverage and less oil!</li>
            <li> Since I have light skin, I wondered if this was too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this tinted moisturizer for more than half a year consistently on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It settled into the fine lines of my skin and did not retain any moisture but became dried out.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly with just a hint of color; The pump takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> I use this as my &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s so light and has a little bit of tint to it.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to my younger and older sisters (I have 4 of them!)</li>
            <li> This has a near gel texture, with the benefits of retinol and spf 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, it is not excessively dry or oily.</li>
            <li> I got a bit older and actually was making some money</li>
            <li> I have tried a million different foundations since I was in high school for something that won&#x27;t clog my pores or makes me feel oily at noon.</li>
            <li> I am always reluctant to try any new facial product, because I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I go back a few days later and buy Neutrogena&#x27;s healthy skin enhancer again.</li>
            <li> It does add moisture to my dry skin but it is pretty sheer.</li>
            <li> Shipped from Amazon quickly and at a price slightly less than local drugstores.</li>
            <li> This had been recommended to me because of my acne-prone skin apparently since it includes a retinol, but since I already use a benzoyl peroxide product during the day and I&#x27;m not supposed to combine retinol and benzoyl, I had to return it.   </li>
            <li> I am a mid-40&#x27;s medical professional who has worked in dermatology</li>
            <li> It did not make my skin look better but worse over time.  </li>
            <li> The SPF is a big plus as well since certain other makeups with SPF tended to make me break out.</li>
            <li> also switched from using mineral foundation - something I should have quit a long time ago considering how old I am - and I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup.  </li>
            <li> I like to wear light coverage in the summer and to help avoid breakouts, and this fits the bill since I can hardly feel the layer of makeup when its on!</li>
            <li> Also, the shade I got should have matched my skin based on my use of other Neutrogena make-up products, and the Ulta salesclerk agreed on the color I chose, but when I actually applied it, it looked much too dark and way too yellowy for my skin.  </li>
            <li> The #30 gives me a little color, tones down any blemishes, but is light enough not to highlight the little lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product has never caused irritation, excessive drying or breakouts.</li>
            <li> so what i do is dab soaked cotton balls on the dry patches to even out the tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have permanent red blotches (not raised or bumpy and not rosacea) on my face that look like dark read veins running under the skin on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is an above average tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals and found it to be heavy and oily.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a little color, sun screen, and a moisturizer in one simple application.</li>
            <li> (of course I didn&#x27;t get my face wet.)</li>
            <li> 90% of foundations are too dark for me, or too pink, or too orange.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> being that its a tinted moisturizer, its coverage is not good enough...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 and a little worried about makeup accentuating my \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot;</li>
            <li> which means that this little tube lasts for quite a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the summer heat, it felt like it was sliding off my face the way heavy foundation will in the humidity.  </li>
            <li> so I was having trouble deciding which color to choose.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy.  </li>
            <li> so it feels heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> When I do decide to use something else, I usually regret it and</li>
            <li> I was usually a stickler about spending a lot of money on something like this, but since it works SO</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li> It leaves a gray-ish cast that makes my complexion look dull.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time finding a color match.</li>
            <li> but this coverage is no good if you have to keep applying moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t judge color by the pictures because I would have bought the wrong one if I did.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY I also have to use a ton so that I go through a tube every month</li>
            <li> I know it will be very difficult to find a replacement.</li>
            <li> You look like you just came out of the shower!\\&quot; :(  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the reviews however I was very disappointed.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not too thick, but gives good coverage.  It&#x27;s my favorite foundation, even when my skin is not doing well, and it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out more.</li>
            <li> i can actually tell that my face looks like it glows and looks healthier everytime in put this on i just ran out but i totally am getting more this is good stuff</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product! I had  coupon and got it for a great price! I would def. come back again and order!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of foundations and I like this one because it is so light and airy. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing a ton of makeup, which is especially nice in the summertime. I have very sensitive skin and this product has never caused irritation, excessive drying or breakouts. Shipped from Amazon quickly and at a price slightly less than local drugstores.</li>
            <li> I like how sheer the tint is. Its practically like I have nothing on my skin! My complexion is generally good with no problem whatsoever, just need something that can even it out and perhaps brighten it a bit. This works great in doing what I want. It has like 5% coverage? Very very light so its barely visible on your face. Perfect for people who just need something to even out the complexion but has spf at the same time.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hopes that it would provide decent coverage without over drying my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t or at least not the kind of coverage I was searching for.  I have combination skin and this product makes my skin greasy (and now I&#x27;ve started breaking out, a problem I don&#x27;t normally have) and I always have to add a layer of powder on top of it.  It also streaks when I put it on and I always have to double check that I have no swirls anywhere before I leave the house.  I want a foundation with more even coverage and less oil!</li>
            <li> I like this product; I have used the Olay Total Effects tinted moisturizer for years and wanted to try something different... The Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer is a little more like a foundation, it&#x27;s not as liquid as the Olay, but it&#x27;s very light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores. I give it a 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> Two things I really like about this are the sun protection and how smooth my skin feels after using it. I&#x27;m not so happy about the clear packaging, I&#x27;m not sure the retinol and the vitamins remain stable. And even though it&#x27;s very sheer it is still somehow noticeable. It leaves a gray-ish cast that makes my complexion look dull. Because I want to give it another chance (there aren&#x27;t that many day creams with so many benefitial properties) I purchased the lightest shade and I hope that by mixing both shades I will get a better match for my skin tone.  So even though it&#x27;s sheer don&#x27;t expect it to dissappear on your skin and make sure you find a good color match.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was too oily for my already oily skin. In the summer heat, it felt like it was sliding off my face the way heavy foundation will in the humidity.  This had been recommended to me because of my acne-prone skin apparently since it includes a retinol, but since I already use a benzoyl peroxide product during the day and I&#x27;m not supposed to combine retinol and benzoyl, I had to return it.   Also, the shade I got should have matched my skin based on my use of other Neutrogena make-up products, and the Ulta salesclerk agreed on the color I chose, but when I actually applied it, it looked much too dark and way too yellowy for my skin.  It didn&#x27;t work for me, but if you have dry skin, and the color matches it, it might be a really good choice for you, since it does apply very smoothly and smells okay.</li>
            <li> A very nice product for light, matte coverage.  I&#x27;m over 50 and a little worried about makeup accentuating my \\&quot;wrinkles\\&quot; but this product works well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of the reviews however I was very disappointed.  I used the light to neutral and it went on very chalky, not natural.  It settled into the fine lines of my skin and did not retain any moisture but became dried out. I have normal skin, it is not excessively dry or oily. I&#x27;m 42, however I look about 32, this product did nothing for me.  It did not make my skin look better but worse over time.  The coverage was good initially but because I had to keep applying moisturizer the coverage was wiped clean.  A tinted moisturizer should moisturize your face, that is one of it&#x27;s main functions.  Estee Lauder Day Wear is a superior product, giving a natural glow as well as sufficient moisture.  It doesn&#x27;t offer as much coverage but this coverage is no good if you have to keep applying moisturizer.  It defeats the purpose.  This will be going straight into the trash.</li>
            <li> This is a good, light, non-greasy tinting moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t provide a ton of moisture so I would recommend using face cream before applying it. I didn&#x27;t even break out from it! I always break out from everything. I will be buying more. :)</li>
            <li> I am always reluctant to try any new facial product, because I have extremely sensitive skin. But I wanted a new tinted moisturizer with a higher SPF than the one I had been using. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with his product. I&#x27;m been using it now for about two month, and not only did my skin not negatively react, but my skin actually looks better than it did before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals and found it to be heavy and oily.  The Neutrogena Skin Enhancer goes on smoothly, spread evenly, and gives good coverage without being thick. It&#x27;s is just what I need.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.  Reason is, being acne-prone, fair-skinned and pushing 50, I need something that gives me some color and coverage but doesn&#x27;t show up every line and wrinkle.  I&#x27;ve tried many, and this was the only one that fit the bill. The #30 gives me a little color, tones down any blemishes, but is light enough not to highlight the little lines around my eyes.  It used to be easy to find, but it&#x27;s getting harder. My only hope is that they don&#x27;t discontinue it - I know it will be very difficult to find a replacement.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is what I&#x27;ve been looking for--good coverage that evens out my skin tone (I have acne and mild rosacea) and provides some sun protection.  The only issues I have is that is has a STRONG sunscreen smell (so my husband always knows when I wear it) and that it rubs off very easily.  (But then again, this is just a tinted moisturizer and not a \\&quot;real\\&quot; foundation.)  I like to wear light coverage in the summer and to help avoid breakouts, and this fits the bill since I can hardly feel the layer of makeup when its on!</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t emphasize lines or pores.  But I won&#x27;t buy it again because it stains the necks of my shirts, and I can&#x27;t get the stains out even with pretreating.</li>
            <li> Oil free and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a \\&quot;bb\\&quot; cream but didn&#x27;t see anything that interested me, then I came across this.  This has a near gel texture, with the benefits of retinol and spf 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully, I&#x27;ve ignored spf and I&#x27;m seeing its effects - so girls?  Not only must you use under eye cream daily and religiously, DO use spf.  This has it all and I put it on over a light touch of moisturizer and my skin just drinks it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also switched from using mineral foundation - something I should have quit a long time ago considering how old I am - and I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup.  I basically just want to mute my skin tone.  This kind of buffs it out and then I top off with a light dusting of finishing powder and a spritz of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be more like a foundation.I was looking for a light tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really like it!! Light coverage, pretty matte, doesnt feel oily, Looks better when is dried.</li>
            <li> Been using for about a week and so far so good, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out. I wouldn&#x27;t judge color by the pictures because I would have bought the wrong one if I did. The ivory/fair is the lightest color but the picture makes it look a lot more orange than the fair/light one so I was having trouble deciding which color to choose. I decided to buy it at the store nearby to judge colors better. I have a really hard time finding a color match. 90% of foundations are too dark for me, or too pink, or too orange. The ivory/fair was a perfect match. It does add moisture to my dry skin but it is pretty sheer.</li>
            <li> not as heavy as foundation but pretty good coverage and also, spf</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34;. I am a minimalist, and this is perfect.  It gives me a little color, sun screen, and a moisturizer in one simple application. I use it daily and it works well in winter, especially for skiing.  I never put sun screen on my face while using this and no sunburns yet. I have used it for about 3-4 years.  Only wished it came in a water proof applications for scuba diving.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly with just a hint of color; The pump takes a little getting used to.  Convenient size for the make-up bag.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy.  It&#x27;s good.  I&#x27;ll never switch.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was in high school, so about 10 years now, and I love it so much that I am never without it. I am pretty fair skinned so I use the fair to light in the winter then go up to the light to neutral in the summer when I get a little more tanned. It is good to note that I do NOT use this as a foundation but rather a tinted moisturizer. It is very sheer but it evens out some of my blotchy spots. I tend to have red blotchy cheeks, and not the good kind that looks like a natural blush. So this product works great and makes my skin more even. I then use a foundation on top of this but only for under my eyes and around my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leaves my skin soft and smooth. I also like that it has a sunscreen in it. I have worn it, and it only, to the beach and didn&#x27;t get sunburned at all! (of course I didn&#x27;t get my face wet.) I also like the smell. It reminds me of summertime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got a bit older and actually was making some money I thought that I would try some more expensive department store brands and the one I like to compare this skin enhancer to is Clinque&#x27;s tinted moisturizer. Clinque&#x27;s is $27 so it&#x27;s quite a bit more pricey and it is a bit thicker so it feels heavy on my skin. It gives great coverage and looks great once it soaks in. UNFORTUNATELY I also have to use a ton so that I go through a tube every month and I just don&#x27;t have $27 bucks every month for that. So, even though I really like this product for the price the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Enhancer did the same thing, and sometimes did it even better, for about 10 bucks. Also because it is sheer I don&#x27;t feel like I have to use as much which means that this little tube lasts for quite a while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one product that I keep coming back to time and time again. I almost always have it in my makeup bag. When I do decide to use something else, I usually regret it and often times I go back a few days later and buy Neutrogena&#x27;s healthy skin enhancer again. I have recommended this product to my younger and older sisters (I have 4 of them!) and they all use it too now!</li>
            <li> This product goes well with the primer.  My makeup seems to stay on (and skin protected) all day.  PLUS it covers the blemishes in addition to antioxidents and sun protection.</li>
            <li> I have tried a million different foundations since I was in high school for something that won&#x27;t clog my pores or makes me feel oily at noon. This is it! Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Enhancer technically isn&#x27;t a foundation, but gives a clear and oil-free look. I started using it about 6 months ago and I will never try anything else again. I was usually a stickler about spending a lot of money on something like this, but since it works SO well it is well worth the $10 every so often. Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> I have been using this about 8 months or so now based on the reviews I saw on Amazon. I love it. I don&#x27;t wear much makeup normally...but these days with the work I do, I put my face on a lot more. I use this as my &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s so light and has a little bit of tint to it. I finish it off with my normal bare minerals makeup routine, but this is the step that I have been missing for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned, blue eyed, lt brown hair--I have perm sun damaged face (from my earlier years of sun bathing w/o sunscreen). I have permanent red blotches (not raised or bumpy and not rosacea) on my face that look like dark read veins running under the skin on my cheeks. I cannot go w/o some kind of coverage w/o people asking \\&quot;oh are you hot? your cheeks are so red! You look like you just came out of the shower!\\&quot; :(  SO a Neutrogena rep I know gave me a sample of \\&quot;Neutral to Tan #40\\&quot;. Since I have light skin, I wondered if this was too dark for my skin. But NO it is not! I think that&#x27;s been a problem for me all along--I think I chose lighter toned cosmetics aimed for \\&quot;fair/light skin\\&quot; and it has no coverage for me. LOVE this product! I apply my daily moisturizer, THEN THIS product. If I go out--or plan to see people--then I put on liquid Neutrogena face makeup \\&quot;Healthy Skin #30/Buff\\&quot; on top of this. If I just stay around the house, I don&#x27;t use the liquid makeup..just my moisturizer and then this product. If you have sun damage, I would highly recommend this product--and try a shade or 2 darker than you might normally try!</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Although I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll order it again. The coverage is good but my skin doesn&#x27;t necessarily like it. Small breakouts in the t zone and dryness around my nose are some of the things I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> I have been using this tinted moisturizer for more than half a year consistently on a daily basis. to start with the Pros.. it&#x27;s not too drying, it has retinol which has helped with healing my skin, it heals popped pimples and lightens up my skin..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cons are: being that its a tinted moisturizer, its coverage is not good enough... its really light. I cannot cover up my cystic pimples with this.. and sometimes it can become too drying so what i do is dab soaked cotton balls on the dry patches to even out the tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is an above average tinted moisturizer. it has never broke me out which i am thankful for. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a foundation but it&#x27;s more of a serum type product that has a tint.  It left my face looking too shiny so I didn&#x27;t enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it lightly covers and that it has SPF protection.  However, it&#x27;s gone way up in price here -- much cheaper just getting it at the drugstore!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Non-greasy, lasts, perfect color, no irritation.</li>
            <li> Very light moisturizer, provides sheer coverage. Camouflages freckles/spots just enough to make them not as noticeable, without looking like I&#x27;m wearing foundation. A little goes a long way, bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I am a mid-40&#x27;s medical professional who has worked in dermatology so I&#x27;ve tried many many products, including Rx strength. This is by far THE BEST foundation I&#x27;ve found for my combo oily-dry skin. It glides on effortlessly, blends beautifully, and really does improve skin&#x27;s appearance over time. I have been using it for 2 years now and have less breakouts, my skin tone is more even, and it&#x27;s also given me a more youthful dewy glow. The SPF is a big plus as well since certain other makeups with SPF tended to make me break out. Make sure you note the expiration date when you purchase it however, beyond this date the pump does tend to clump and it is less effective.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation.  Its light coverage but is is a great product and layers well.&lt;br /&gt;Will try to order more before its no longer available.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena makes great products for a healthy clean face.  But this shade was just a bit too light for me.  In the future I will get darker shades.</li>
            <li> Fits my skin well, and it makes my face feel smooth and silky. Hopefully it also protects my face from the sun, as it says it will!</li>
