    <ol>
            <li>Purchased for my daughter who is a gardener, a nurse practitioner, and what I would call an &amp;#34;Earth Mother&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;She says it works wonderfully</li>
            <li>Perfect softness for my toddler but still works.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent nail brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what else to say because it cleans magnificently under my nails and makes them look glorious.</li>
            <li>This is the best brand I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>I felt like Goldilocks searching for the perfect brush for my needs.  </li>
            <li>Great price also.</li>
            <li>Great product and delivery.</li>
            <li>If this were for a BABY, then I suppose it would be great.  </li>
            <li>I got him another one, PLASTIC THIS TIME, and it&#x27;s working out great.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush.</li>
            <li>Looked good...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It must be good for  babies.</li>
            <li>Feels good.</li>
            <li>This one cleans, but leaves my cuticles and skin in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this nail brush!</li>
            <li>This brush is great for scrubbing the hands but the bristles are too soft and don&#x27;t do a very good job of getting under the nails.  </li>
            <li>Brush is good for cleaning top of nails, not under nails.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, too.</li>
            <li>Nice nail brush, I would buy another one or suggest this to a friend.  </li>
            <li>I liked the density of the bristles, and the firmness held up well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
            <li>This one is solidly made, it works perfectly, and it has a nice quality of workmanship, feel and finish.</li>
            <li>Indeed, she said, &amp;#34;It is the best mother&#x27;s day present</li>
            <li>I love this nail brush.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>These are great just like my mom used when I was young.</li>
            <li>They put this cheap plastic ones to shame.</li>
            <li>I cook and bake a lot and having completely clean hands and nails is important to me.</li>
            <li>The bristles on one side are super soft, good for cleaning the tops of nails and cuticles.</li>
            <li>I had originally posted a review based on my frustration of not having received the product and had rated it a one star.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a brush, it helps clean your nails</li>
            <li>Good wooden block/base.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for the use although a bit out of the ordinary!  </li>
            <li>This is one of three &amp;#34;eco-friendly&amp;#34; nail brushes I recently purchased from Amazon, and it is best of the bunch, hence 2 stars instead of only one.  </li>
            <li>This nail brush sits right by my kitchen sink so that I can clean up after gardening.</li>
            <li>The bristles (softer than they should be - so hardly capable to brush out under-nail impurities) are not neatly inserted, glued in as if in a hurry, with some bristles are both ends glued - in neighbouring bunches, arching those together, pretty many - here and there, on both sides.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Otherwise this product is fine, I just want REALLY still bristles.</li>
            <li>The brush is inexpensive and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>However, if the bristles were more stiff, my daughter might put up more of a fuss when using it.</li>
            <li>A little scrubbing with this in a hot shower and some Burt&#x27;s Bees cuticle butter, and i&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>it cracked on first use.  </li>
            <li>This one does exactly that.  </li>
            <li>Bought 2 different kinds, this one is way better.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Pretty disposable.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft and the wood handle makes it very durable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Unlike synthetic brushes, this one really cleans the dirt under fingernails without the pain.</li>
            <li>Natural materials are nice for some things but not very practical.</li>
            <li>plus is more natural and less rough than the plastic kind.</li>
            <li>The brush overall looks nice, just not capable to do its job.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a brush locally that would get under and around my nails adequately.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Also the bristles are too soft to do much cleaning.</li>
            <li>This little brush works pretty good for a toddler&#x27;s little finger and toe nails.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, too soft to really get under the nails, and they are shedding like a cat in springtime.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t so stiff that it hurts my finger tips, but it gets my nails very clean.</li>
            <li>It looked pretty gross, and I was not about the boil it, so I ended up tossing it.</li>
            <li>Bristles are too soft!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine but for a serious scrubbing it&#x27;s not the right tool....</li>
            <li>The bristles on the other side are firmer and should be used to clean under the nails.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a stiff as I hoped for.  </li>
            <li>tough bristils, works nicely</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough that it does not seem to bother my almost two year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I like the natural brushes because I&#x27;m committed to products that do not hurt the environment.  </li>
            <li>and she likes that it is made of natural materials.  </li>
            <li>Some have said the bristles are too soft but for me the brush works well getting out garden dirt from under the nails.</li>
            <li>The bristles being on the soft side, it does not always get all of the dirt out of her nails.  </li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t get the dirt out from under your nails like this one does and because the bristles are so soft they don&#x27;t damage your nails.</li>
            <li>bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li>The brush is to soft.</li>
            <li>Not too soft either.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are way too soft and only get softer with use.</li>
            <li>is not heavy enough for me</li>
            <li>Not too stiff, just right.  </li>
            <li>A bit old fashioned but work very well and small enough to take on travel.</li>

            <li> The first nail brush I purchased, I use for scrubbing soap scum off the tub.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered other cheaper brushes from amazon and they do not work as well as Earth Therapeutics.</li>
            <li> Wood turned black.</li>
            <li> I keep this brush in a little dish on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> After just a few months the wood had black and green spots of mold on it</li>
            <li> Despite my efforts to drain this well, the wood turned very dark around the bristles.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t anyone make a heavy duty nail brush anymore??</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> for  someone with dirty nails and hands like me, a daily tool - another one at the end of a long day with tools and material</li>
            <li> do need to place it somewhere where it can dry out thoroughly between uses; if you leave it in a dish, it will get disgusting quickly, as it is wood.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give this as a gift unless you want the recipient to be disappointed a short time later.</li>
            <li> I want to find a nail brush with really stiff bristles!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and will continue to look for a brush that can really get under the nails.</li>
            <li> The worst of it is I can already see that this will begin to rot very soon - the bristles don&#x27;t seem to want to dry out, and after only two days they have an unpleasant squishy sort of feel to them.  </li>
            <li> That was not fair.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided that i was sick of polish and manicures, and especially sick of digging dirt out from under my fingernails, and so got this brush.  </li>
            <li> Worked bad...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I keep this brush in a little dish on my bathroom counter. I use it alot! It isn&#x27;t so stiff that it hurts my finger tips, but it gets my nails very clean. Great price also.</li>
            <li> Brush is good for cleaning top of nails, not under nails. Bristles are way too soft and only get softer with use.</li>
            <li> The nail brush was purchased for occupational therapy uses to stimulate fingers, hands and arms.  It is perfect for the use although a bit out of the ordinary!  I couldn&#x27;t find this product in the stores.</li>
            <li> I had originally posted a review based on my frustration of not having received the product and had rated it a one star.  That was not fair.  The product was promptly mailed again, and I found it to be quite helpful in removing dirt from underneath my fingernails.  The brush is inexpensive and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like the natural brushes because I&#x27;m committed to products that do not hurt the environment.  It doesn&#x27;t last that long, but it&#x27;s a natural product and nothing last as long as plastic</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter who is a gardener, a nurse practitioner, and what I would call an &amp;#34;Earth Mother&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;She says it works wonderfully and she likes that it is made of natural materials.  Indeed, she said, &amp;#34;It is the best mother&#x27;s day present I&#x27;ve ever received.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> use them all the time</li>
            <li> This nail brush sits right by my kitchen sink so that I can clean up after gardening. It looks nice, too.</li>
            <li> The wood started to mold almost immediately.  Also the bristles are too soft to do much cleaning.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nail brush whose bristles will not fall out and which will serve to do the job, this is the one. I tried out and rejected several with nylon bristles after the dog ate an earlier version of this one. Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> Wood turned black. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be mold. Perfect softness for my toddler but still works.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent nail brush. I don&#x27;t know what else to say because it cleans magnificently under my nails and makes them look glorious.</li>
            <li> Love it! Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> The bristles (softer than they should be - so hardly capable to brush out under-nail impurities) are not neatly inserted, glued in as if in a hurry, with some bristles are both ends glued - in neighbouring bunches, arching those together, pretty many - here and there, on both sides.

They just don&#x27;t get the dirt out from under your nails like this one does and because the bristles are so soft they don&#x27;t damage your nails. I highly recommend this product! UPDATE*** The bristles on one side are super soft, good for cleaning the tops of nails and cuticles. The bristles on the other side are firmer and should be used to clean under the nails. It WILL get the dirt out from under them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush, it helps clean your nails</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery. thanks</li>
            <li> I liked the density of the bristles, and the firmness held up well. Despite my efforts to drain this well, the wood turned very dark around the bristles. It looked pretty gross, and I was not about the boil it, so I ended up tossing it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Simple and functional.</li>
            <li> it cracked on first use.  Maybe I got a lemon?</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft!  If this were for a BABY, then I suppose it would be great.  NOT for a gardener though.</li>
            <li> tough bristils, works nicely</li>
            <li> I love this nail brush.  I cook and bake a lot and having completely clean hands and nails is important to me. plus is more natural and less rough than the plastic kind.</li>
            <li> Looked good... Worked bad... bristles are too soft. I come home from work and jump in the shower to get out that manly grease and grime and this brush doesn&#x27;t do the trick. Doesn&#x27;t anyone make a heavy duty nail brush anymore??</li>
            <li> I have been in maintenance for 20 years and after alot of nail brushes I finally found one that works!! I am purchasing one not only for work but now for home!!</li>
            <li> The brush is to soft.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a stocking stuffer for my husband last year. After just a few months the wood had black and green spots of mold on it and he had to throw it away. I got him another one, PLASTIC THIS TIME, and it&#x27;s working out great. Natural materials are nice for some things but not very practical. Don&#x27;t give this as a gift unless you want the recipient to be disappointed a short time later.</li>
            <li> I want to find a nail brush with really stiff bristles! They are nowhere to be found. Otherwise this product is fine, I just want REALLY still bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for scrubbing the hands but the bristles are too soft and don&#x27;t do a very good job of getting under the nails.  I was disappointed and will continue to look for a brush that can really get under the nails.</li>
            <li> These are great just like my mom used when I was young. They put this cheap plastic ones to shame.</li>
            <li> for  someone with dirty nails and hands like me, a daily tool - another one at the end of a long day with tools and material</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of plastic brushes, and I don&#x27;t like them. This one is solidly made, it works perfectly, and it has a nice quality of workmanship, feel and finish. It works, too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush but it&#x27;s not a stiff as I hoped for.  For your run of the mill applications it&#x27;s fine but for a serious scrubbing it&#x27;s not the right tool....the search continues!</li>
            <li> I make jewelry and use chemicals and paints all the time, including inks.  I couldn&#x27;t find a brush locally that would get under and around my nails adequately.  This one does exactly that.  It&#x27;s been perfect for me.  I highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my nails, but this doesn&#x27;t get under nor does the job, sorry.&lt;br /&gt;It must be good for  babies.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush. Feels good.</li>
            <li> A bit old fashioned but work very well and small enough to take on travel.</li>
            <li> I finally decided that i was sick of polish and manicures, and especially sick of digging dirt out from under my fingernails, and so got this brush.  A little scrubbing with this in a hot shower and some Burt&#x27;s Bees cuticle butter, and i&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to place it somewhere where it can dry out thoroughly between uses; if you leave it in a dish, it will get disgusting quickly, as it is wood.  I put mine in the bathroom windowsill and haven&#x27;t had any issues after three or four months</li>
            <li> Unlike synthetic brushes, this one really cleans the dirt under fingernails without the pain. And it cleans......</li>
            <li> Not too stiff, just right.  I felt like Goldilocks searching for the perfect brush for my needs.  The first nail brush I purchased, I use for scrubbing soap scum off the tub.  This one cleans, but leaves my cuticles and skin in good condition.  Not too soft either.  You feel it, but you control the pressure.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 different kinds, this one is way better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Love them.</li>
            <li> started splitting after using it with water a couple times. Pretty disposable.</li>
            <li> This is one of three &amp;#34;eco-friendly&amp;#34; nail brushes I recently purchased from Amazon, and it is best of the bunch, hence 2 stars instead of only one.  The bristles are soft, too soft to really get under the nails, and they are shedding like a cat in springtime.  The worst of it is I can already see that this will begin to rot very soon - the bristles don&#x27;t seem to want to dry out, and after only two days they have an unpleasant squishy sort of feel to them.  This was a waste of money.</li>
