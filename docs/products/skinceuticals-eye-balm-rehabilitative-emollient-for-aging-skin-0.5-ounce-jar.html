            <li>I love SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li>This eye cream is effective and does not burn or irritate.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if it makes a difference</li>
            <li>That way my own skin oils don&#x27;t get into the balm.</li>
            <li>So why not invest in the stuff that really works to keep it looking its best!</li>
            <li>I tried this but didn&#x27;t find it effective for my under eye skin sagging.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there was some kind of wax over it</li>
            <li>This product was not as effective as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>and she is not the kind who would spend her money for nothing and cares for the cents she spends.</li>
            <li>It has very good moisturising properties and really tranforms the look of the skin around the eyes as soon as i apply it.</li>
            <li>Excellent under eye balm for mature skin.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for one that is great on sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes yet addresses the concern of aging, moisturizes and leaves the skin feeling fresh and looking great!  </li>
            <li>Fine lines reduce A LOT!</li>
            <li>Irritates my eyes; makes wrinkles more prominent</li>
            <li>Love Skinceuticals eye balm.  </li>
            <li>I have used many eye creams and Skinceuticals Eye Balm has helped with those aging lines under the eye area.  </li>
            <li>My skin is allergic to many products, but Skinceuticals has solved that.</li>
            <li>I love their skin block.  </li>
            <li>and I do really love it.</li>
            <li>I had crepey skin on my eyelids and now it looks much better</li>
            <li>I use the top of my fingernail to get just a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying that this product will work for you because there are countless products that I have tried that received wonderful reviews and when I used them they did nothing for me</li>
            <li>I am falling in love with the Skinceuticals skin line.</li>
            <li>the customer service at Skinceuticals were most helpful.  </li>
            <li>and i love it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure it is the EYE BALM and not the eye cream...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my third jar of this wonderful cream.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this cream because I love the sun screen that SkinCeuticals makes(which</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used many....</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The eye balm was OK, but I no longer use it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite eye cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a year now and love it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff!</li>
            <li>I bought several Skinceutical products fo rthis purpose and all together they seem to be making my skin as perfect as can be.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Much better price than they offer.  </li>
            <li>It feels light, and it is very easy to absorb.  </li>
            <li>I,  from time to time, have tried many other eye creams just to make sure I have the best for me...</li>
            <li>The Balm is great if you have sensitive skin or eyes.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this eye balm at the recommendation of a professional and I am loving it!</li>
            <li>puff free and youthful.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this kind of preparation to a cream.</li>
            <li>Goes on light and makes a difference with my crows feet.</li>
            <li>Creamy &amp; smooth, but your make-up will stay put.</li>
            <li>Shipped promptly and packaged securely.</li>
            <li>that it glides on very easily and is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>Many so called eye balms end up being very greasy and running  or smearing all over</li>
            <li>The cream goes on cool to my skin and never stings even when I accidentally get some in my eye.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer their eye gel, which works better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hydrating, even my make up looks better and stays on longer, and it made make up application easier too.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye cream as it is very emollient and keeps the skin under my eyes moist.  </li>
            <li>I am truly a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>i have a skin condition that not all products are good for my skin but this product has been good, it definitly stands behind their word.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this three times now and can honesty say it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love many other product from Skinceuticals; just not this one.</li>
            <li>Product lasts so the price is right.</li>
            <li>but I would certainly spend full price on it if I could not longer find it for a discount.    </li>
            <li>I will continue using the product as long as it lasts, but I honestly cannot say that I can tell a difference after 2 months.</li>
            <li>and i like it very much.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>and when I apply makeup it goes on smoothly where is used to crinkle and make me look old.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>First time trying this product.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if it make me look any younger, but it does feel great and eliminates any dryness around my eyes, and gets rid of any dry spots that have appeared at times.  </li>
            <li>First time trying Skinceuticals, but was lured by all the positive feedback.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>Its texture is light and it has some iridescent light reflecting particles in to minimize the appearance of dark circles.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say the fine lines around my eyes disappeared after 2 weeks of use, but it definitely makes me feel the skin is firming up.</li>
            <li>It also brightens my eye area which at my stage in life is a real plus.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It really adds moisture to the area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The product tends to cling to the jar - not your fingertips, which requires \\&quot;scooping\\&quot; and using too much.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!  A+++</li>
            <li>Also, I have very oily skin and the balm would somehow slide into my eyes and irritate them.  </li>
            <li>Easier and cheaper than going to the store with fast delivery as well.  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating and soothing.  </li>
            <li>I know the person who ordered this cosmetic very well</li>
            <li>Fine lines and the crepey appearance improve significantly after using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Very gentle even on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Anyone out there find an eye cream or balm for &#x27;mature&#x27; eyes and sensitive skin that costs less - I&#x27;d love to know!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s here for 55$. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This balm is a strong yellow, almost a mustard yellow color.</li>
            <li>Read another online review of this product when I needed a new eye cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals Eye Balm since my dermatologist first recommended it to me several years ago.  </li>
            <li>The skin under your eyes really is different than the rest of your face, and this stuff is exactly what it needs.</li>
            <li>First eye cream that I actually notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I usually use the A.G.E. eye product and find that to be a better product for me (57 years old).  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to have significant changes yet, but hopeful that the outcome will be what I&#x27;m looking forward to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 40 years old</li>
            <li>I have been using the eye balm since early July.</li>
            <li>I feel as though the product is old.</li>
            <li>It feels light but keeps the eye moisturized without a heavy greasy feel or look.  </li>
            <li>do note that this product is for mature skin.</li>
            <li>I find it very moisturizing and will order for the third time.</li>
            <li>Almost 40 year old who was looking to prevent some issues before they happened.  </li>
            <li>I found a marked difference in the way my eyes looked after just a week.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints and would highly recommend to others looking for this or similar products.</li>
            <li>Much prefer less expensive l&#x27;Oreal under eye creams - which i bought quickly thereafter not beign satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and I think I have less wrinkles than most people my age due to the eye balm.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s creamy enough on delicate eye skin to feel</li>
            <li>This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
            <li>I liked the product but too expensive.</li>
            <li>Need a very small amount, is moisturizing, but not sticky, and smooths fine lines like nothing I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, but is a little difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>Skinceutical makes good products but very expensive.  </li>
            <li>When the temperature begins to drop the skin around my very sensitive eyes begins to get itchy and feel very dry.</li>

            <li> and when I apply makeup it goes on smoothly where is used to crinkle and make me look old.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it make me look any younger, but it does feel great and eliminates any dryness around my eyes, and gets rid of any dry spots that have appeared at times.  </li>
            <li> First time trying Skinceuticals, but was lured by all the positive feedback.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> Its texture is light and it has some iridescent light reflecting particles in to minimize the appearance of dark circles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say the fine lines around my eyes disappeared after 2 weeks of use, but it definitely makes me feel the skin is firming up.</li>
            <li> It also brightens my eye area which at my stage in life is a real plus.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It really adds moisture to the area around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The product tends to cling to the jar - not your fingertips, which requires \\&quot;scooping\\&quot; and using too much.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!  A+++</li>
            <li> Also, I have very oily skin and the balm would somehow slide into my eyes and irritate them.  </li>
            <li> Easier and cheaper than going to the store with fast delivery as well.  </li>
            <li> Very hydrating and soothing.  </li>
            <li> I know the person who ordered this cosmetic very well</li>
            <li> Fine lines and the crepey appearance improve significantly after using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Very gentle even on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Anyone out there find an eye cream or balm for &#x27;mature&#x27; eyes and sensitive skin that costs less - I&#x27;d love to know!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s here for 55$. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This balm is a strong yellow, almost a mustard yellow color.</li>
            <li> Read another online review of this product when I needed a new eye cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals Eye Balm since my dermatologist first recommended it to me several years ago.  </li>
            <li> The skin under your eyes really is different than the rest of your face, and this stuff is exactly what it needs.</li>
            <li> First eye cream that I actually notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I usually use the A.G.E. eye product and find that to be a better product for me (57 years old).  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to have significant changes yet, but hopeful that the outcome will be what I&#x27;m looking forward to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 40 years old</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye balm since early July.</li>
            <li> I feel as though the product is old.</li>
            <li> It feels light but keeps the eye moisturized without a heavy greasy feel or look.  </li>
            <li> do note that this product is for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I find it very moisturizing and will order for the third time.</li>
            <li> Almost 40 year old who was looking to prevent some issues before they happened.  </li>
            <li> I found a marked difference in the way my eyes looked after just a week.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints and would highly recommend to others looking for this or similar products.</li>
            <li> Much prefer less expensive l&#x27;Oreal under eye creams - which i bought quickly thereafter not beign satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> and I think I have less wrinkles than most people my age due to the eye balm.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s creamy enough on delicate eye skin to feel</li>
            <li> This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but too expensive.</li>
            <li> Need a very small amount, is moisturizing, but not sticky, and smooths fine lines like nothing I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, but is a little difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Skinceutical makes good products but very expensive.  </li>
            <li> When the temperature begins to drop the skin around my very sensitive eyes begins to get itchy and feel very dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using some other eye cream which was way more expensive than this one, but the result is about the same.  </li>
            <li> Left the skin around my eyes feeling dry and not at all hydrated.</li>
            <li> Beware of this product the company said that they are not selling from Amazon and may very well be &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and not effective.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF $ TRYING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li> The container lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and I was so surprised that Amazon carried the product for over $20 less than a laser center.  </li>
            <li> I recommend buying this product from your dermatologist or other local dealer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I found this eye balm to be very thick and gummy at first.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit -- it goes a long way and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in NYC where I live, but I have never had a problem finding it here online.  </li>
            <li> Works better than number of expensive creams i have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It started to clear the darkness under my eyes specialy after a few sugeries I&#x27;ve had,with less sleep&lt;</li>
            <li> I think I look a little younger.</li>
            <li> I have also had a problem with eye creams stinging the skin around my eyes and causing little red bumps.</li>
            <li> I also use their Phloretin CF which is expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Expensive - yes, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product back in November 2013 and have been using it everyday until I finished the product.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Tried other things, that didn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that are less expensive and more expensive and touted to be \\&quot;Amazing\\&quot;, but I am telling you, this is the only one I have found that truly does diminish lines around my eyes and truly make crows feet virtually disappear.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and at the rate of twice a day use, I go through about one jar every month to month and half.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles due to allergies and this helps reduce the darkness of them substantially.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will get rid of them because I read that dark circles from allergies are not reversible</li>
            <li> So I was basically shot down.</li>
            <li> I admit, I am a little worried using it.</li>
            <li> Even if it was a little.</li>
            <li> I am 48 and needed a little help around the eye area.</li>
            <li> I tried mixing it up again and in the process I wasted quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li> a friend recommended to me a few years ago).  </li>
            <li> Then she said that the product could be fake or old.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry, quite aging eye area, I had been seriously thinking of dermal fillers until I tried this product.</li>
            <li> Makes a small amount of difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Eye Balm for few months now, and I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it made, even after a week!</li>
            <li> It takes just a small dot application under each eye.</li>
            <li> It reduced the wrinkles, the dark circles, the puffiness, the dryness, no more tired look.</li>
            <li> but I at least feel like my eyes are getting moisturized.</li>
            <li> I wrote a negative review</li>
            <li> I used to get really dry skin under my eyes that would look awful with my foundation, but now I use this eye balm every night and the dryness has completely gone away, along with the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been disappointed by either product so far.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rank with other products like Replenix Eye Repair, so I saved the bottle for a rainy day when I run out of other products.</li>
            <li> I agree with those that say it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get out of the small jar...</li>
            <li> Non greasy and non irritating.  </li>
            <li> La Mere, Estee Lauder etc.</li>
            <li> They all fail in comparison to Skinceuticals Eye Balm.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, I know,</li>
            <li> but I think I accidentally ordered the wrong product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t see any change for my eyes which is a bummer because this product is expensive to not have results.</li>
            <li> Sounds crazy but within 2 days I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> or if it had been kept too cold.  </li>
            <li> What does the Skinceuticals company expect the buyer to do with this product, which I must say is VERY EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> and I had a bad reaction to the &#x27;cream&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This skin line caused a terrible reaction which included welts on my face and chest area for 2 days.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Irritates my eyes; makes wrinkles more prominent</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream every. I also use on my upper lip. It&#x27;s nice and feels great. I think I look a little younger. Might be the Botox</li>
            <li> Left the skin around my eyes feeling dry and not at all hydrated. Much prefer less expensive l&#x27;Oreal under eye creams - which i bought quickly thereafter not beign satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love Skinceuticals eye balm.  Very gentle even on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for about 4 years now.  It is the best and I was so surprised that Amazon carried the product for over $20 less than a laser center.  I have used many eye creams and Skinceuticals Eye Balm has helped with those aging lines under the eye area.  I&#x27;m almost 40 years old and I think I have less wrinkles than most people my age due to the eye balm.  Skinceuticals is a great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye balm since early July. I will continue using the product as long as it lasts, but I honestly cannot say that I can tell a difference after 2 months. I have stopped using it in the mornings (unless I am not wearing makeup). When I use the eye balm and my under eye concealer, my eye makeup smears.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinceuticals eye balm for over a year and have loved the results.   The skin around my eyes is smoother and younger looking and when I apply makeup it goes on smoothly where is used to crinkle and make me look old. I did have a problem with having it shipped. It separated. I tried mixing it up again and in the process I wasted quite a bit of it. I recommend buying this product from your dermatologist or other local dealer.</li>
            <li> Works better than number of expensive creams i have used in the past. I have been using this eye balm for over 6 month and i like it very much. It has very good moisturising properties and really tranforms the look of the skin around the eyes as soon as i apply it. This cream is not a cure for the wrinkles but it is a good maintenance cream for the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals Eye Balm since my dermatologist first recommended it to me several years ago.  I love that it&#x27;s creamy enough on delicate eye skin to feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing overnight, yet I can still apply it prior to make-up in the morning and the make-up/powders don&#x27;t shift at all throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My skin is allergic to many products, but Skinceuticals has solved that. This eye cream is effective and does not burn or irritate.  I love their skin block.  Worth every penny. You only need a little bit -- it goes a long way and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinceuticals products for four years now.  I ordered the eye balm from Amazon instead of the Skinceuticals webpage because of the price difference.  Amazon was almost $30 cheaper.  However when the balm arrived I was struck by how yellow the balm is.  I have used the product before and the balm should be a creamy off white color.  This balm is a strong yellow, almost a mustard yellow color. It doesn&#x27;t smell off, the texture is the same, but the color is off putting. My husband collected the product from our mail carrier so I know it did not sit out in the heat upon arrival.  I admit, I am a little worried using it. I feel as though the product is old.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but too expensive. Makes a small amount of difference. But not enough to buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Not as good as reviews say.</li>
            <li> Excellent under eye balm for mature skin. I will definitely purchase it again. Product lasts so the price is right. Great for morning and night time applications.</li>
            <li> I love this product it feels great going on. I honestly don&#x27;t know if it makes a difference but I at least feel like my eyes are getting moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar of the eye cream and I do really love it. I have tried others but  just come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Great product! Used if for approx 8 years with great results. I am over 55 and it is the only cream that keeps my eyes puff free and youthful. I,  from time to time, have tried many other eye creams just to make sure I have the best for me...La Mere, Estee Lauder etc. They all fail in comparison to Skinceuticals Eye Balm. It feels light but keeps the eye moisturized without a heavy greasy feel or look.  It also brightens my eye area which at my stage in life is a real plus.</li>
            <li> I just started using this eye balm at the recommendation of a professional and I am loving it! Sounds crazy but within 2 days I noticed a difference. I had crepey skin on my eyelids and now it looks much better (I&#x27;m 55). I use this at night so there is no issue with smearing makeup. A little bit goes a long way. I agree with those that say it&#x27;s a bit difficult to get out of the small jar...I use the top of my fingernail to get just a bit. That way my own skin oils don&#x27;t get into the balm. I will definitely order more from Amazon. I paid 81$ and it&#x27;s here for 55$. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When the temperature begins to drop the skin around my very sensitive eyes begins to get itchy and feel very dry. I am only 29 but I have had this problem now for about 3 years. Many so called eye balms end up being very greasy and running  or smearing all over and/or don&#x27;t work for me. I have also had a problem with eye creams stinging the skin around my eyes and causing little red bumps. This cream does none of those things! It is very moisturizing. Its texture is light and it has some iridescent light reflecting particles in to minimize the appearance of dark circles.I have dark circles due to allergies and this helps reduce the darkness of them substantially. I don&#x27;t think it will get rid of them because I read that dark circles from allergies are not reversible but I will continue to use this anyway because of how great it makes my eyes feel and look. I purchased it at a discounted price but I would certainly spend full price on it if I could not longer find it for a discount.    I&#x27;m not saying that this product will work for you because there are countless products that I have tried that received wonderful reviews and when I used them they did nothing for me but this one was a winner. I am falling in love with the Skinceuticals skin line. I also use their Phloretin CF which is expensive but worth every penny. I once read in a magazine that you have to spend your entire life wearing your face - showing it to the world constantly. So why not invest in the stuff that really works to keep it looking its best!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband after asking for help at the brand owners&#x27; website.  the customer service at Skinceuticals were most helpful.  I bought this item from amazon.com because that week, there was a discount.  Package came in good condition.  My husband said he has seen improvements at his eye area.  * do note that this product is for mature skin.</li>
            <li> Este es la unica crema que me ayuda con la zona delicada de los ojos. Otras cremas solo me dejan la piel mas seca e iritaa. Definitivamente recmiendo este producto a cualquier persona con piel seca y sensible.</li>
            <li> I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF $ TRYING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.  THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST FOR THE AREA AROUND THE EYES.</li>
            <li> Another terrific Skinceuticals product. I use it religiously every night when I go to bed. The best way to keep eye wrinkles away.</li>
            <li> I love the Skinsceuticals eye balm that arrived in perfect condition and fresh!  If you have eye wrinkles, then this cream pumps up the skin and looks great!</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinceuticals Eye Balm for 2 years now and i love it.  It is expensive, I know, but well worth the price.  I have tried other products that are less expensive and more expensive and touted to be \\&quot;Amazing\\&quot;, but I am telling you, this is the only one I have found that truly does diminish lines around my eyes and truly make crows feet virtually disappear.  It is hard to find in NYC where I live, but I have never had a problem finding it here online.  Make sure it is the EYE BALM and not the eye cream...they are two very different products and I had a bad reaction to the &#x27;cream&#x27;.  The Balm is great if you have sensitive skin or eyes.  April NYC[[ASIN:B000O88M80 Skin Ceuticals Eye Balm 14g/0.5oz]]</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream!  I am so happy!  I have been looking for one that is great on sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes yet addresses the concern of aging, moisturizes and leaves the skin feeling fresh and looking great!  This is a wonder product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third jar of this wonderful cream.  It really adds moisture to the area around my eyes.  I even use it every morning under my eye shadow(powder).  I decided to try this cream because I love the sun screen that SkinCeuticals makes(which a friend recommended to me a few years ago).  I&#x27;ve not been disappointed by either product so far.  A little bit goes a long way, and at the rate of twice a day use, I go through about one jar every month to month and half.  The cream goes on cool to my skin and never stings even when I accidentally get some in my eye.  I can&#x27;t say if it make me look any younger, but it does feel great and eliminates any dryness around my eyes, and gets rid of any dry spots that have appeared at times.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a drastic change</li>
            <li> First time trying Skinceuticals, but was lured by all the positive feedback. It doesn&#x27;t rank with other products like Replenix Eye Repair, so I saved the bottle for a rainy day when I run out of other products. Very disappointing. Just didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
            <li> I rated it as 1 star before... but I think I accidentally ordered the wrong product so it is my fault. I wish I could delete this review but I can&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> I used to get really dry skin under my eyes that would look awful with my foundation, but now I use this eye balm every night and the dryness has completely gone away, along with the appearance of wrinkles. The skin under your eyes really is different than the rest of your face, and this stuff is exactly what it needs. Expensive - yes, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It started to clear the darkness under my eyes specialy after a few sugeries I&#x27;ve had,with less sleep&lt;br /&gt;I like it so far,I would recomend it to frieds</li>
            <li> I tried this but didn&#x27;t find it effective for my under eye skin sagging. I much prefer their eye gel, which works better.</li>
            <li> Very nice, moisturizes well. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like this brans but not this eye balm it is the second time I bought it and doesn&#x27;t feel it works on me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinceuticals Eye Balm for 10 years now - every morning and evening.  I would never even think of trying another eye cream.  I am truly a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, but is a little difficult to use.  The product tends to cling to the jar - not your fingertips, which requires \\&quot;scooping\\&quot; and using too much.  Prefer the eye cream in pump bottle.</li>
            <li> Okay. No obvious effect</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks and I like it very much.  It feels light, and it is very easy to absorb.  I have been using some other eye cream which was way more expensive than this one, but the result is about the same.  I can&#x27;t say the fine lines around my eyes disappeared after 2 weeks of use, but it definitely makes me feel the skin is firming up.</li>
            <li> This product definitely a balm in that it glides on very easily and is absorbed quickly. I much prefer this kind of preparation to a cream. I find it very moisturizing and will order for the third time. The container lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Good service - great  product</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to have significant changes yet, but hopeful that the outcome will be what I&#x27;m looking forward to.</li>
            <li> I found this eye balm to be very thick and gummy at first. I don&#x27;t know if there was some kind of wax over it or if it had been kept too cold.  I wrote a negative review and now I&#x27;m changing it after using the eye balm at night for over a month.  It is soothing and moisturizing. Skinceutical makes good products but very expensive.  Anyone out there find an eye cream or balm for &#x27;mature&#x27; eyes and sensitive skin that costs less - I&#x27;d love to know!</li>
            <li> First time trying this product.  I usually use the A.G.E. eye product and find that to be a better product for me (57 years old).  This is good and not greasy if you want to use it day and night though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product back in November 2013 and have been using it everyday until I finished the product. I haven&#x27;t see any change for my eyes which is a bummer because this product is expensive to not have results. Even if it was a little. I called the company Skinceuticals customer service about their product. The lady basically told me that since I purchased the item off Amazon that they couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;guarantee&amp;#34; that the product would work because I purchased from a third party website. Then she said that the product could be fake or old. So I was basically shot down. Hopefully this product OFF Amazon works for others. Beware of this product the company said that they are not selling from Amazon and may very well be &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and not effective.</li>
            <li> this is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used many....highly recommend this product!  A+++</li>
            <li> I love SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li> Read another online review of this product when I needed a new eye cream. Took a chance and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am 48 and needed a little help around the eye area. This product fits the bill. Goes on light and makes a difference with my crows feet. Just bought another to put in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry, quite aging eye area, I had been seriously thinking of dermal fillers until I tried this product. I&#x27;ve been using this Eye Balm for few months now, and I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it made, even after a week! It reduced the wrinkles, the dark circles, the puffiness, the dryness, no more tired look. It&#x27;s really hydrating, even my make up looks better and stays on longer, and it made make up application easier too. Feeling like a twenty-something again. I&#x27;m incredibly happy to have found this product!</li>
            <li> Creamy &amp; smooth, but your make-up will stay put.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The eye balm was OK, but I no longer use it.  This product was not as effective as I had hoped.  Also, I have very oily skin and the balm would somehow slide into my eyes and irritate them.  I love many other product from Skinceuticals; just not this one.</li>
            <li> I have bought this for several years now and find it works to reduce my puffy eyes in the morning and gives me a healthier look.  It takes just a small dot application under each eye. It&#x27;s not sticky or too moist...it last throughout the day.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to go without it.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye cream</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this balm and I loved it! Now I need some time to use and wait for the results!!!</li>
            <li> First eye cream that I actually notice a difference. It was recommended by my dermatologist because she uses it and loves it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived matching the description. Easier and cheaper than going to the store with fast delivery as well.  I have no complaints and would highly recommend to others looking for this or similar products.</li>
            <li> THis is my day cream. I have been using this for a very long time. ALWAYS come back to this when I think I should try something else. Need a very small amount, is moisturizing, but not sticky, and smooths fine lines like nothing I have ever used. This is the bast eye cream I have ever used. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Works Great.  I have purchased this three times now and can honesty say it is worth the money.  Very hydrating and soothing.  Non greasy and non irritating.  Fine lines and the crepey appearance improve significantly after using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This skin line caused a terrible reaction which included welts on my face and chest area for 2 days.  When I approached the company  about this situation they refused a refund. I finally received my refund a couple of months later but not by them. This product may work for you or not but the fact that they would not provide a refund especially when their product caused such a severe reaction, as a consumer I would be very concerned.</li>
            <li> I know the person who ordered this cosmetic very well and she is not the kind who would spend her money for nothing and cares for the cents she spends. That&#x27;s why I can bet this is a good-for-the-purpose purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye cream as it is very emollient and keeps the skin under my eyes moist.  I&#x27;ve used it for a year now and love it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Great cream. I do think it is over priced for the amount of product.</li>
            <li> Have to wait and see results !</li>
            <li> it was the 1st time i tried anything from this line. i have a skin condition that not all products are good for my skin but this product has been good, it definitly stands behind their word.</li>
            <li> Almost 40 year old who was looking to prevent some issues before they happened.  I bought several Skinceutical products fo rthis purpose and all together they seem to be making my skin as perfect as can be.  I use this only at night with the night time face moisturizer.  Can&#x27;t say its a miracle product but its what I needed at this point in my life!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It works great</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference for the price I would expect some change to happen</li>
            <li> Directions on this product called &amp;#34;Eye Balm&amp;#34; read &amp;#34;avoid contact with eyes.&amp;#34; Are they kidding here?&lt;br /&gt;One buys Eye Balm to put on and around the eyes. What does the Skinceuticals company expect the buyer to do with this product, which I must say is VERY EXPENSIVE. If not designed for use around the eyes why call it Eye Balm?.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream EVER ! My plastic surgeon uses only this brand. I found a marked difference in the way my eyes looked after just a week. This tiny tub lasts and lasts. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years.  It was recommended by my dermatologist &#x27;s office.  Much better price than they offer.  Shipped promptly and packaged securely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and loved it. Tried other things, that didn&#x27;t compare. Fine lines reduce A LOT!</li>
            <li> This is great for day and night use.  My eyes look great, no sagging (I&#x27;m 61).  It also sets your eyelids up for eye shadows.</li>
