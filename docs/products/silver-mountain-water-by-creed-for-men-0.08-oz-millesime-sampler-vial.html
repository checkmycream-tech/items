            <li>excellent fragrance recommend!</li>
            <li>Vetiver works great!</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews of this legendary cologne, I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting -</li>
            <li>Best fragrance I&#x27;ve ever put on my body.</li>
            <li>Another excellent scent by Creed.</li>
            <li>Creed is an excellent  Cologne Company.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT!!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been incredible</li>
            <li>Make no mistake about it, SMW smells absolutely incredible</li>
            <li>The delivery was great</li>
            <li>Great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>The cologne was great</li>
            <li>It smelled great.</li>
            <li>Great smelling stuff.</li>
            <li>Stay away from the vials - they are good for 1 or 2 uses.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>It does smell good, but I prefer their Aventus line.</li>
            <li>good good</li>
            <li>Not as good as Aventus, that&#x27;s the best smell so far</li>
            <li>Wanted to see I liked this fragrance.</li>
            <li>About a year agoI would look at Creeds prices and thought they were kind of high, but after acouple of purchases I found that this is the best cologne on the market.</li>
            <li>First let me say that Silver Mountain Water smells absolutely incredible.</li>
            <li>To me it is very strong from the get-go, then mellows out in a hour</li>
            <li>The quality of ingredients is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Stands up to the Creed name, but not my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve been sampling it up until I can afford more.</li>
            <li>#love</li>
            <li>Just have to say the more</li>
            <li>I try Creed the more I am intrigued by their uniqueness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Green Irish Tweed would be an excellent alternative, or Aventus as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to Creed, Millesime is the most potent scent they produce as it has the highest concentrations of compounds (up to 40%).</li>
            <li>exotic , unique - one of creeds top 3 or 4 products ( 4 men)</li>
            <li>First let me say the Santal is NOT for me, it came off way to floral for my tastes and was very potent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s metallic notes are quite strong, and could give some a headache or have nausea (it did for me).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Creed colognes are hands down the best smelling thing on this planet.</li>
            <li>This cologne is fine.</li>
            <li>is fine if the man is over 60, I think.</li>
            <li>Genuine product.</li>
            <li>This is one of my two top favorites and my absolute favorite Creed.</li>
            <li>This is a unique scent.</li>
            <li>So, I originally sampled SMW at Nordstrom&#x27;s and was enthralled by it.</li>
            <li>IF you are going to order, please make sure you do your research and know exactly what strength you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>IF you are going to order, please make sure you do your research and know exactly what strength you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>May buy a full bottle if I enjoy this sample size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if it shifts from it&#x27;s top notes straight to the bottom notes within an hour</li>
            <li>However, after an hour or so it fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Realy fresh cool scent, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I love the smxell of this always wanted to try creed but didn&#x27;t know the smell of it because no one carrys this product where I live.</li>
            <li>but I think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The difference was so pronounced that i&#x27;d go so far to say that the Spring Mountain Water sample was more along the lines of an EDT or even a EDC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth getting a sample to test.</li>
            <li>I received my product right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different and this cologne could easily work well on you.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really like it.  </li>
            <li>It might be too much for people to wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough to order a sample vial and test it</li>
            <li>The Santal EDP was MUCH MUCH stronger of the two samples.  </li>
            <li>The card has richer golden embossed circles around the pictures of James Henry Creed on the left (original founder) and Oliver Henry Creed on the right (current head of Creed).</li>

            <li>And I can definitely understand why people say it&#x27;s just an overpriced version of Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>They are very strong and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Not a good value for the money - I have bought full size bottles of Creed and they are a better value.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Creed scents are top notch and their quality is always outstanding -</li>
            <li>I am new to Creed but after doing quite a bit of research i ordered two sample vials to test and see if i could find the \\&quot;one\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through and ordered different samples and the funny thing is the ones that i&#x27;ve ordered that are</li>

            <li>We both love Green Irish Tweed.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried about 4 different kinds and was never disappointed, I just cant afford a regular bottle  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way for sure.</li>
            <li>Looking for something new to use regularly.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fine but it comes in a tiny sampler vial that is ridiculously small for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>has a pretty masculine smell, pls dont ask me to describe it as I do not have the vocabulary to put it down in words!</li>
            <li>Possibly, however in comparison with my experience with the Santal EDP that i received, i&#x27;d say that the Silver Mountain Water i received clearly wasn&#x27;t Millesime or even EDP for that matter.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the photo of James Henry Creed has him turned slightly to the left, exposing the right side of his face.</li>

            <li> exotic , unique - one of creeds top 3 or 4 products ( 4 men)</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance recommend!</li>
            <li> I have the WORST time with lasting colognes except Polo green.  I like this smell but again, it doesn&#x27;t last.  Vetiver works great!</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews of this legendary cologne, I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting - but I didn&#x27;t really like it.  It&#x27;s too floral for me.  It smells dated.  And I can definitely understand why people say it&#x27;s just an overpriced version of Cool Water.  It reminds me of that too.</li>
            <li> The smell is out of this world.  The quality of ingredients is outstanding.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because of the price.  I can&#x27;t afford it so I have to buy these tester vials.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fine but it comes in a tiny sampler vial that is ridiculously small for the price I paid. Not a good value for the money - I have bought full size bottles of Creed and they are a better value. Stay away from the vials - they are good for 1 or 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase for my son he had smell the scent  from somewhere and wanted to test it out he knew it would be a expensive purchase so he test it out and I loved it. The delivery was great I received my product right away.</li>
            <li> Great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will order it again.</li>
            <li> This is a unique scent. It might be too much for people to wear. It&#x27;s metallic notes are quite strong, and could give some a headache or have nausea (it did for me).&lt;br /&gt;I would give this a try before buying the big bottle. It is a well done fragrance though. Only \\&quot;Silver\\&quot; by Al-Rehab is very similar to it for a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> Stands up to the Creed name, but not my favorite scent.  It does smell good, but I prefer their Aventus line.</li>
            <li> Genuine product. Several stickers were positioned over the message &amp;#34;Sample - not for sale&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Well...I received an entire bottle of Aventus as a gift, and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since!! I refused to by anything else;couldn&#x27;t go back to the mundane. So, unaware of the cost, i went online to buy more and was COMPLETELY shocked!! So, I&#x27;ve been sampling it up until I can afford more. Thx Amazon.... Best fragrance I&#x27;ve ever put on my body. #love</li>
            <li> The cologne was great but I ordered 4 samples and 2 came broken with shards of glass all over.</li>
            <li> Another excellent scent by Creed. About a year agoI would look at Creeds prices and thought they were kind of high, but after acouple of purchases I found that this is the best cologne on the market. I have only tried about 4 different kinds and was never disappointed, I just cant afford a regular bottle  so I will stick with the samples until my pockets get deeper.  Creed is an excellent  Cologne Company.</li>
            <li> The sampler smells slightly different than the stuff I buy at Sacks Fifth Ave. Not sure why. Might be a knock-off.</li>
            <li> I love the smxell of this always wanted to try creed but didn&#x27;t know the smell of it because no one carrys this product where I live. will end up buying a big bottle of this it is expensive but I think it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I like this! To me it is very strong from the get-go, then mellows out in a hour os so. A little goes a long way for sure. has a pretty masculine smell, pls dont ask me to describe it as I do not have the vocabulary to put it down in words! One remark if I may, to me it smells like this should be worn on a night out on the town or along those lines. This is one I would not wear as an everyday, anytime cologne. I have the Creed Oud parfum and to me that is the one I wear almost everyday, anytime.  Just have to say the more I try Creed the more I am intrigued by their uniqueness.</li>
            <li> So, I originally sampled SMW at Nordstrom&#x27;s and was enthralled by it. It smelled great. I ordered my sample vial here and although it appears to be authentic, I&#x27;m not entirely impressed by the smell. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Creed scents are top notch and their quality is always outstanding - but it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;d stop and say &amp;#34;Wow that&#x27;s good!&amp;#34;. I wore it quite a few times and didn&#x27;t get any compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different and this cologne could easily work well on you. It&#x27;s cheap enough to order a sample vial and test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Irish Tweed would be an excellent alternative, or Aventus as well.</li>
            <li> This cologne is fine. However, the man I bought it for is not older, so he did not care for it. Personally I do not like this. We both love Green Irish Tweed.  This cologne  is NOTHING like that.&lt;br /&gt;This is fine if the man is over 60, I think.</li>
            <li> First let me say that Silver Mountain Water smells absolutely incredible. I&#x27;ve been using Bulgari Soir for a few years now and it&#x27;s been incredible but i wanted to add a little something to my collection that had that could take it to the next level.  I am new to Creed but after doing quite a bit of research i ordered two sample vials to test and see if i could find the \\&quot;one\\&quot;. I ordered the Creed Silver Mountain Water Millesime sample vial and the Creed Santal EDP sample vial to begin with.  Make no mistake about it, SMW smells absolutely incredible BUT, what i received couldn&#x27;t possibly be the Millesime sample. When putting it on, the crispness jumps out at you and almost leaves you in awe.  However, after an hour or so it fades rather quickly. It&#x27;s as if it shifts from it&#x27;s top notes straight to the bottom notes within an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Creed, Millesime is the most potent scent they produce as it has the highest concentrations of compounds (up to 40%). If this is the highest concentration that they produce of Silver Mountain Water then i feel for anyone who may have bought the Eau de Parfume aka EDP (up to 30%) or the Eau de toilette aka EDT(up to 15%).  By comparison, cologne or (EDC) is up to 8%, while aftershave is up to 3%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could it be that the Silver Mountain Water is just that subtle? Possibly, however in comparison with my experience with the Santal EDP that i received, i&#x27;d say that the Silver Mountain Water i received clearly wasn&#x27;t Millesime or even EDP for that matter. First let me say the Santal is NOT for me, it came off way to floral for my tastes and was very potent (an obvious sign of an EDP or Millesime). The Santal EDP was MUCH MUCH stronger of the two samples.  The difference was so pronounced that i&#x27;d go so far to say that the Spring Mountain Water sample was more along the lines of an EDT or even a EDC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another difference in the two was the packaging. This comes with the standard stock card while the other EDPs and Millesime samples come in a different type of packaging. EDP WILL come in the fold over card with the sample in the middle, like the majority of samples you find out there. I&#x27;ve gone through and ordered different samples and the funny thing is the ones that i&#x27;ve ordered that are EDP come in the fold over card while one, possibly a true Millesime comes on a different type of flat card than the EDT. The card has richer golden embossed circles around the pictures of James Henry Creed on the left (original founder) and Oliver Henry Creed on the right (current head of Creed). Furthermore, the photo of James Henry Creed has him turned slightly to the left, exposing the right side of his face. On the EDT sample card, such as this one, James Henry Creed is turned slightly towards the right, towards Oliver Henry, exposing the left side of his face. While these are minor differences, they are appear to be different for a reason, such as to suggest the different types concentration levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some very positive reviews for Spring Mountain Water and some negative ones. My guess is those that are negative were expecting a Millesime sample and likely are receiving the EDT sample. IF you are going to order, please make sure you do your research and know exactly what strength you&#x27;re getting. The description can say Millesime all day long and you&#x27;ll never know the difference unless you do your homework.ther EDPs and Millesime samples come in a different type of packaging.

            <li> Realy fresh cool scent, not overpowering at all. Something I could wear daily or for a night on the town, an all occasions scent.  EXCELLENT!!!</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but everyone has different taste so there is a pattern. Durable enough for perfume.. good good</li>
            <li> I bought several Creed samples along with several other brands. Looking for something new to use regularly. This is one of my two top favorites and my absolute favorite Creed. Great smelling stuff.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Aventus, that&#x27;s the best smell so far</li>
            <li> As advertised. Wanted to see I liked this fragrance. May buy a full bottle if I enjoy this sample size.</li>
            <li> Seriously its hard to go back to my 50 to 100 dollar bottles of cologne. Creed colognes are hands down the best smelling thing on this planet. They are very strong and last a long time. Well worth getting a sample to test. However they may be a little strong for everyday use.</li>
