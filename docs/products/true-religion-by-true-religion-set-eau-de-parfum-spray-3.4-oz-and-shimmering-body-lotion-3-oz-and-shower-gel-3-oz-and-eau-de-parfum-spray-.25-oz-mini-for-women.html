            <li>Though the price tag in daunting, for the men, your woman will love you for this if you buy it.</li>

            <li>No complaints from my husband either :)  </li>
            <li>My favorite seller is Fragrance.com</li>
            <li>so I would purchase again:)</li>
            <li>Arrived early,couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love the shimmering lotion too.  </li>
            <li>I receive many compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>The perfume doesn&#x27;t have the greatest staying power, but you can probably make it last longer by putting on the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can still buy this from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is very unique with a combination of florals, fruit and hint of musk.</li>
            <li>AND SHE LOVED IT VERY  MUCH.</li>
            <li>After all these years it still doesn&#x27;t leak and it&#x27;s as good as the first day</li>
            <li>The bottle is beautiful, and smell is amazing, and they give you a lot for your money including a smaller version of the perfume which a female can carry with her in her bag, and some very nice</li>
            <li>Just a light scent that&#x27;s not too flowery.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume for the first time about 5 years ago and have been in love with it since.  </li>
            <li>I love the bottle design, it&#x27;s pretty and ornate but not too girly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a sweet scent with a hint of musk.</li>
            <li>Was even more pleased to find the gift set which included the body lotion and a smaller spray that fits in my purse.</li>
            <li>This scent is crisp and clean with notes of water and citrus.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for this fragrance and was glad to finally find it.</li>
            <li>I have to say that the spray is really well made.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fresh-ness of the smell</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very calming.  </li>
            <li>And the box is something you can keep too, they really thought about everything.</li>
            <li>The little bottle is also adorable, it has a little True Religion buddha on the top.  </li>
            <li>This is one sexy perfume, and you will be thanked endlessly.  </li>
            <li>Came super fast and was so much cheaper than buying the perfume at a department store such as Macy&#x27;s or bloomy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>which is pretty embarrassing when coming from a complete stranger who sees me wrangling my four kids.  </li>
            <li>The color is more yellow than the original parfum spray, the scent is watered down and lasts about 4 minutes on your body!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a night out, but as a young professional, attempting to be taken seriously, I can&#x27;t walk around with body glitter</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The recipient wasn&#x27;t sure that this was the same set that she had previously bought in the store.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift, the person who received it loves it completely.</li>
            <li>It cheapens the whole box overall.  </li>
            <li>Paid less than what i normally pay for just the perfume for the whole set!</li>
            <li>Item was reasonably priced and shipped quicker than expected.</li>
            <li>My sister bought me this for Christmas a few years ago, so the price is about right here</li>

            <li> Not much to say...my wife wanted it...she has worn it every day since it arrived.  I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I ordered and recieved it almost instantly.  It&#x27;s beautiful packaging.  Smells better than I remember.  Will make a wonderful gift.  The price was the best I&#x27;ve seen.  The best service and delivery time ever.  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Came super fast and was so much cheaper than buying the perfume at a department store such as Macy&#x27;s or bloomy&#x27;s. Looove this perfume!</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume for the first time about 5 years ago and have been in love with it since.  It is very unique with a combination of florals, fruit and hint of musk. Disappointing it&#x27;s hard to find in stores now but that&#x27;s what Amazon is for! Item was reasonably priced and shipped quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> It was a gift. The recipient wasn&#x27;t sure that this was the same set that she had previously bought in the store. She was still happy with it so that is why it received 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Amazed no one has reviewed. Though the price tag in daunting, for the men, your woman will love you for this if you buy it. This is one sexy perfume, and you will be thanked endlessly.  This is a great birthday or Christmas gift.  The bottle is beautiful, and smell is amazing, and they give you a lot for your money including a smaller version of the perfume which a female can carry with her in her bag, and some very nice lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Separately, a lot of this stuff would be more expensive.  I give this my highest Recommendation!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good. It&#x27;s like a sweet scent with a hint of musk. Any female would appreciate this stuff. MEN: BUY THIS FOR YOUR WOMAN.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, the person who received it loves it completely. the lotion and body wash are also very nice. and it comes with a purse size!</li>
            <li> This is a reoccurring buy for me.  I buy it once a year for myself.  This is my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent and all I wear.  I have always gotten many complements and told that I smell &amp;#34;sexy&amp;#34; which is pretty embarrassing when coming from a complete stranger who sees me wrangling my four kids.  No complaints from my husband either :)  But there are also alot of fakes out there so buy from a seller who can do returns just in case.  My favorite seller is Fragrance.com and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I do not use this since its for women but happy wife &#x3D; happy life so I would purchase again:)</li>
            <li> Great item wonderful price fast shipping product as described HIGHLY recommend</li>
            <li> This is a great set. I love this scent, and the mini bottle is great for your purse. Packed well. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> wonderful my grand daughter got me started with it as a gift. I am very pleased</li>
            <li> Unbelievable price !!!! Paid less than what i normally pay for just the perfume for the whole set! Arrived early,couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> This scent is crisp and clean with notes of water and citrus.  Love the shimmering lotion too.  I receive many compliments when I wear this.</li>

            <li> It was the same set that I purchased at the TR store a year ago, just half the price. I was pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! it&#x27;s addicting!!! What a great deal! I will order it again from ThePerfumespot.com as long as the price&#x27;s stay this affordable and the quality stays the same.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume.  A great Christmas gift. I went to Macy&#x27;s last Fall and was sorry to see that they no longer carry this item.  I was thrilled to find it online for purchase at a great price.</li>
            <li> My sister bought me this for Christmas a few years ago, so the price is about right here (being that it is a few years old).

After all these years it still doesn&#x27;t leak and it&#x27;s as good as the first day I opened it.  Some perfume sprays get stuck and it&#x27;s annoying, this isn&#x27;t one of them!  The little bottle is also adorable, it has a little True Religion buddha on the top.  I ended up giving the little one to a friend because there is just a lot of perfume here!  She loved the scent.  The body wash my mother stole because she loved the scent too!!  So you really can&#x27;t go wrong here.  I really like the fresh-ness of the smell, it&#x27;s very calming.  The perfume doesn&#x27;t have the greatest staying power, but you can probably make it last longer by putting on the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe here is with the lotion.  It&#x27;s sparkly..WHY?  It cheapens the whole box overall.  It&#x27;s great for a night out, but as a young professional, attempting to be taken seriously, I can&#x27;t walk around with body glitter on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  It&#x27;s a scent you can wear on the daily, to work, out on a day-date etc.  And the box is something you can keep too, they really thought about everything.</li>
            <li> This parfum has been dilluted with something!  The color is more yellow than the original parfum spray, the scent is watered down and lasts about 4 minutes on your body! Even the lotion does not hold its scent.  I would NOT reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> They stopped making this and I am unable to purchase this at a retail store. I love the fact that I can still buy this from Amazon. It is an awesome fragrance and such a great price for this set!</li>
