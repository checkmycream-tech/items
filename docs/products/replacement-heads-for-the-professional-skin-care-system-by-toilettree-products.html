            <li> My only gripe with this product is that it tends to fling soap suds if you wet the brush before you put your cleanser on it.</li>
            <li> I was having a minor breakout because it was time to change the brush, and these coupled with my African black soap have cleared up my skin in two days!</li>
            <li> They are a little bit larger but doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> The heads are a little bigger than the stock ones but work just as expected.</li>
            <li> Prefer them to other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried doing it that way once, though, so I could be wrong</li>

            <li> Love this product.Is soft &amp; work well. Go with the ToiletTree Water-Resistant Professional Skin Care Face and Body Brush System.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit my spa sonic as if they were just made for  it.  Larger then the ones that came with my sonic cleaner, like the feel of these better, so am ordering more.  Do not want to be without these brushes.</li>
            <li> Not a perfect fit for my SpaSonic, but they do the job.</li>
            <li> I love this product very much but there were times it made my skin red. Maybe I over did it?</li>
            <li> I got these to replace my old ones. I love how these do the same job as the $200+ clarisonic spin brushes! I had wanted to try the clairisonic but refused to pay the price, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. While you can use the brushes to take off your make-up, I prefer not to because I feel like it just swishes your make-up around. I&#x27;ve only tried doing it that way once, though, so I could be wrong I just don&#x27;t like the feel. The soft brushes are my favorite...I can use the medium ones, but with the soft ones you can go over your eye area without feeling like it&#x27;s pulling your skin. My only gripe with this product is that it tends to fling soap suds if you wet the brush before you put your cleanser on it. It&#x27;s not a big enough problem for me to stop using it, you just have to clean your mirror more often. :)</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my Spa Sonic that I bought at Costco.</li>
            <li> awesome brushes.  Prefer them to other brands.</li>

            <li> Fit perfectly on my Sonic Spa device. The heads are a little bigger than the stock ones but work just as expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as replacement brushes for my Spin brush. I have sensitive skin and these are better than the original brush. The replacement heads are slightly larger and the bristles are softer, similar to that of a baby brush. I received them Monday and have been enjoying them since. I was having a minor breakout because it was time to change the brush, and these coupled with my African black soap have cleared up my skin in two days!</li>
            <li> I just received replacement heads for my professional skin care system by ToiletTree.  The head arrived promptly and as promised.  What can I say except that I am completely converted to this skin care system!  I use it daily and have had really positive result with my skin.  I am so pleased with the value that this system offers.  If you are on the fence about ordering - just do it!  The company has excellent customer service so you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love your brush so much better then the Spa Sonic brushes they are bigger really love them ordered first set and loved them so much I reordered another set I will buying your brushes from now on and I have prime so I don&#x27;t pay shipping don&#x27;t remember if I used prime or if you offered free shipping thank you for a great product at a great price too ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Excellent product. These refills are quality and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love the Professional Skin Care System so much that I had to buy replacement heads once the original ones started to wear.</li>
            <li> These work with my spa sonic. They are a little bit larger but doesn&#x27;t matter. Will buy again.</li>
