            <li>I feel better too with more energy.</li>
            <li>I do love it as a face mask, though.  </li>
            <li>great mixed with bottled water as a detox,and great in the bath, really had a good nights sleep .and</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>it settles my stomach nicely and my BMs are smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>This clay is finely ground, so it is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and very fine.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling super clean!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>I researched the net and found great reviews for this pure form of clay.</li>
            <li>In this powdered form it can easily be absorbed into tooth enamel.  </li>
            <li>but I love using this as a facial mask.</li>
            <li>Perhaps most notable, given my hyper-allergic skin, is that I don&#x27;t react negatively to this product.</li>
            <li>Still don&#x27;t know how much they helped but certainly reduced the acidity in the body</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer just from using the mask once or twice each week.</li>

            <li>The other type Sodium Bentonite Clay also works to bind Heavy Metals and Radioactive Ions through Adsorbsion, but it swells so much it cannot pass through the Colon membrane and clean the blood stream easily.</li>
            <li>It works just as well as the vet&#x27;s product, so next time I will order a large jar.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so clear and soft.  </li>
            <li>I literary works for almost everything.</li>
            <li>I sprinkle in a very small amount in a glass of water and make sure I drink a lot of water while using this clay.</li>
            <li>I use a half teaspoon in warm water almost every day, I recommend taking a break from it every few days though.</li>
            <li>I have used it topically and internally, with no negative side effects.  </li>
            <li>It was effective, but expensive.</li>
            <li>I have tried my fair share of very expensive face products.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores, very oily skin, and mild to moderate acne until going through menopause, and for all of my life exposed my skin to too much sun (stupid, plus allergic to sunscreen).  </li>
            <li>If you feel your skin becoming itchy or tight, that means its working!!!!</li>

            <li> Mix this with activated charcoal to make one heck of an amazing face mask! Helps get rid of black heads and clear up skin :)</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it for a face mask and it leaves my skin feeling awesome and looking great!</li>
            <li> I have tried my fair share of very expensive face products.  Getting back to basics and frustrated with my congested skin I tried this.  I make masks out of it and it is truly amazing.  I used once a week and my skin is so clear and soft.  Great bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This is the best bentonite clay available and I love that Amazon offers it! I&#x27;ve been buying this clay for years and it is excellent for many purposes!</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully. It&#x27;s light, feels purer than other clay.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> Gives me a headache, seems contaminated as many are in the u.s.</li>
            <li> I sprinkle in a very small amount in a glass of water and make sure I drink a lot of water while using this clay. it settles my stomach nicely and my BMs are smooth and easy. I feel better too with more energy. my skin looks amazing, no more flakyness</li>
            <li> I am using this stuff for homemade toothpaste, body powder, and facial masks. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I have large pores, very oily skin, and mild to moderate acne until going through menopause, and for all of my life exposed my skin to too much sun (stupid, plus allergic to sunscreen).  I purchased this powder based on it&#x27;s claim to remove impurities from my facial skin, now wrinkling rapidly.  In 5-6 weekly facial applications of a mask of this powder mixed with apple cider vinegar, I find it leaves my skin smoother and pores smaller for about a day.  No other benefits have been observed, but that&#x27;s not surprising. Perhaps most notable, given my hyper-allergic skin, is that I don&#x27;t react negatively to this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff removed my depression!!! I love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Still don&#x27;t know how much they helped but certainly reduced the acidity in the body</li>
            <li> I only rate this product 4 stars as it&#x27;s a little over priced, 22.00 for only 8oz c&#x27;mon. It&#x27;s unfortunately the only certified Calcium Bentonite Clay Amazon has for sale. The other type Sodium Bentonite Clay also works to bind Heavy Metals and Radioactive Ions through Adsorbsion, but it swells so much it cannot pass through the Colon membrane and clean the blood stream easily. Calcium Bentonite is best. I use a half teaspoon in warm water almost every day, I recommend taking a break from it every few days though.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing clay from my vet for my dog&#x27;s tendency for loose stools (yes, I have addressed diet, supplements, physical issues, etc., but this seems to be her norm). It was effective, but expensive. I researched the net and found great reviews for this pure form of clay. To test it first, I ordered a small jar. It works just as well as the vet&#x27;s product, so next time I will order a large jar.</li>
            <li> I mix this with activate Charcoal by Nature&#x27;s Way and use this to make an amazing face mask.  My skin is much clearer just from using the mask once or twice each week.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling super clean! If you feel your skin becoming itchy or tight, that means its working!!!!</li>
            <li> A little messy to mix but I love using this as a facial mask.</li>
            <li> For what I&#x27;m using it for it fits the bill. I&#x27;m using this to brush my teeth with since my teeth have started to become transparent due to the loss of calcium. In this powdered form it can easily be absorbed into tooth enamel.  This clay is finely ground, so it is nice and smooth. Not gritty at all.</li>
            <li> Nice sized jar for the price.  I have used it topically and internally, with no negative side effects.  It&#x27;s hard to tell how well it&#x27;s working as a supplement, because I started taking several other health supplements at the same time.  I do love it as a face mask, though.  It&#x27;s a little hard to mix with water, but I like the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> great mixed with bottled water as a detox,and great in the bath, really had a good nights sleep .and fab as a face mask tightened up my pores.</li>
            <li> I used this clay to cleanse my insides. It&#x27;s smooth and very fine. I know that you can use it as a facial cleaner as well as other things, but I have only used it for internal use. No side effects that I can report. Does it work, I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s worth a try! Just do your research.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to make detoxifying paste, it worked great.</li>
            <li> I literary works for almost everything.</li>
