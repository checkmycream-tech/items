            <li>Great hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>it is a great product to have for styling.</li>
            <li>IT is amazing!</li>
            <li>and then a good 20+ minutes to straighten it after that.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely awesome, and it is definetly worth the money.</li>
            <li>Just love it, and so happy that I own it.  </li>

            <li>Add one more fan of CHI to the list!</li>
            <li>From the great buying experience to the quick delivery, this product couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the T3 blowdryer before and this CHI dryer is better.  </li>
            <li>I love Farouk products.</li>
            <li>This dryer is excellent especially on virgin, African-American hair.</li>
            <li>It calms the frizzies and just gives your hair an all around healthy shine look.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe what a huge difference it&#x27;s made in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I absolutly love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I bought it if you have a lot of hair</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>My best friend borrowed this dryer and immediately wanted to buy one for herslef, because she felt it too was less damaging on her hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried MANY different professional dryers and this one is the best I have found.  </li>
            <li>It will make a difference in time and its light weight.</li>
            <li>Makes hair look shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I liked my old dryer, but wanted to see if there was anything out there that would save me time and be better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for a while now and it still works wonderfully and it&#x27;s quieter than hair dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I had been trying to find a replacement for my old Chi Rocket hair dryer for a while and finally found a great deal on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I take really good care of it and only use salon products, use heat protectant etc.  </li>
            <li>Great dryer but not worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Really happy with this chi hair dryer - my old chi stopped working (no hot air), and this one (as replacement) is even better.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love and appreciate this tool!</li>
            <li>YES, it is worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used it, I got two compliments from complete strangers about how my hair looked beautifully healthy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is one of my important features to keep as nice as possible, and this product dries my hair quickly, quietly, and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Does not frizz hair and dries hair really fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazingly soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I will never go back to a cheap blowdryer again!</li>
            <li>I also use Hot Tools brand hair dryer that is comparable in specs and would recommend it over this Chi product.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t even need to do anything else to it after blowdrying, but I use a big curling iron and it looks fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t found a blow dryer that cuts my dry time down, but this one is the best that I have used thus far.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, and looks to be very well made.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My old blowdryer was a Bedhead one and it made my hair so hot</li>
            <li>I searched and found it for less money than she was able to get it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, enough, 2 years prior.  </li>
            <li>It seems like it isn&#x27;t very powerful, because it isn&#x27;t loud, but it blow dries my hair quickly and seems less damaging on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this dryer for it&#x27;s quietness and qucker drying time.</li>
            <li>My Chi died this week and I was looking for a new dryer.  </li>
            <li>It runs too hot, there is no middle temp.</li>
            <li>IT TAKES LESS TIME TO STYLE WITH A CHI ROCKET, AND YOUR HAIR STAYS IN BETTER (NOT DRY) SHAPE.</li>
            <li>and I barely have to do any straightening!!!!  </li>
            <li>This hair dryer dries my hair in half the time without frizzing/knotting and is also light weight.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thick, fine, undefined curly, blond from a box hair which I prefer to wear straight.  </li>
            <li>I dry and straight my hair ever 3 days.</li>
            <li>Quiet enough that I can sleep through it in the \\&quot;low\\&quot; mode if she&#x27;s in the next room, and be barely aware of it in the \\&quot;high\\&quot; mode from the next room over.  </li>
            <li>So, my heating element went out in my prior professional hair dryer</li>
            <li>so I jumped online and spent some time looking for a reasonably priced dryer that would work well.  </li>
            <li>When I saw online that many people complained about the short life span, I looked back in my order history to see when I bought this CHI.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too heavy, the control buttons are right where you hold the unit.</li>

            <li> I read one similar review and assumed it was just one bad one out of the batch since the other reviews were good, I won&#x27;t be purchasing chi products anymore.</li>
            <li> I get my hair trimmed regularly, but my ends just felt really dry</li>
            <li> I like how quiet the dryer is and the speed of the dry time.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very hot afterwards, and my arm is exhausted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either hot or cold, low blower or high.</li>
            <li> I have long, mid-back length, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> my hairdresser told me it would, this dryer gets my hair dry faster.</li>
            <li> It takes about 45 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> It now takes me about 15-20 minutes to dry my hair</li>
            <li> to dry it with this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It dry&#x27;s your hair without making it frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair (usually takes at least 10-12 min to dry), so this really helps!</li>
            <li> My hair is shinier after using this dryer than after any other I have used.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that is thick and slightly coarse.  </li>
            <li> Cuts down substantially on blow drying time.</li>
            <li> I just have to touch up the one area that is stubbornly frizzy, which is the front hair-line area from about my temples down to my ears.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair quicker and not damaging like the other I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for someone who has wanted one for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I am shocked that a dryer which costs $170.00 has such a short life span.  </li>
            <li> It takes me no more than 15 minutes with this hair-dryer.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and usually it takes me 45-60mins.</li>
            <li> My hair is bouncy and thick, but sleek and shiny.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick or course hair, the attachement will fall off every time...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a bad item to purchase, but definitely research what else you can get for your dollar elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have had my dryer for approximately 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any mechanical problems with the dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been frustrating with the attachment falling off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this are dryer.</li>

            <li> THE ROCKET ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN PERFECT CONDITION.  THIS WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY MY HAIR STYLIST.  I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE IN MY HAIR.  JUST USE THIS FOR A WHILE AND THEN GO BACK TO A \\&quot;REGULAR\\&quot; DRYER AND YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE.  IT TAKES LESS TIME TO STYLE WITH A CHI ROCKET, AND YOUR HAIR STAYS IN BETTER (NOT DRY) SHAPE.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the T3 blowdryer before and this CHI dryer is better.  It seems like it isn&#x27;t very powerful, because it isn&#x27;t loud, but it blow dries my hair quickly and seems less damaging on my hair.  My best friend borrowed this dryer and immediately wanted to buy one for herslef, because she felt it too was less damaging on her hair.  I still haven&#x27;t found a blow dryer that cuts my dry time down, but this one is the best that I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> I love Farouk products. This dryer is excellent especially on virgin, African-American hair. Cuts down substantially on blow drying time. I definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser always uses the CHI Rocket hair dryer. I asked her about it one day and she said I should get one. In fact, she said she would order one and pick it up for me at her cost. I told her I wanted to see if I could get it on Amazon. I searched and found it for less money than she was able to get it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As my hairdresser told me it would, this dryer gets my hair dry faster. I love it!</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for my girlfriend.  It seems to make her hair softer compared to a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; blow drier, and is very quiet.  Quiet enough that I can sleep through it in the \\&quot;low\\&quot; mode if she&#x27;s in the next room, and be barely aware of it in the \\&quot;high\\&quot; mode from the next room over.  Lightweight, and looks to be very well made.</li>
            <li> I had been trying to find a replacement for my old Chi Rocket hair dryer for a while and finally found a great deal on Amazon!

Great transaction from Amazon - thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this are dryer. It&#x27;s too heavy, the control buttons are right where you hold the unit. So you hit the on/off&lt;br /&gt;switch constantly. It runs too hot, there is no middle temp. It&#x27;s either hot or cold, low blower or high. Yes it took 15 min. off of my&lt;br /&gt;hair drying time. But I&#x27;m very hot afterwards, and my arm is exhausted. I do not recommend this are dryer to anyone!</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this blow dryer. It is absolutely awesome, and it is definetly worth the money. This is my second Rocket Hair Dryer that I have purchased. I use it everyday. It calms the frizzies and just gives your hair an all around healthy shine look. Would not go anywhere without it.... This hair dryer is a must have for me.</li>
            <li> YES, it is worth the investment.  My hair is one of my important features to keep as nice as possible, and this product dries my hair quickly, quietly, and smoothly.  My hair is shinier after using this dryer than after any other I have used.</li>
            <li> So, my heating element went out in my prior professional hair dryer so I jumped online and spent some time looking for a reasonably priced dryer that would work well.  I have curly hair that is thick and slightly coarse.  It takes about 45 minutes to dry my hair and then a good 20+ minutes to straighten it after that.  I liked my old dryer, but wanted to see if there was anything out there that would save me time and be better for my hair.  Well, I FOUND IT!  This CHI is GREAT!  It now takes me about 15-20 minutes to dry my hair and I barely have to do any straightening!!!!  I just have to touch up the one area that is stubbornly frizzy, which is the front hair-line area from about my temples down to my ears.  I just can&#x27;t say enough about how much I love and appreciate this tool! My hair is bouncy and thick, but sleek and shiny.

            <li> I bought this hair dryer last year. I dry and straight my hair ever 3 days. It takes me no more than 15 minutes with this hair-dryer. IT is amazing! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really happy with this chi hair dryer - my old chi stopped working (no hot air), and this one (as replacement) is even better. I have a lot of hair (usually takes at least 10-12 min to dry), so this really helps!</li>
            <li> Add one more fan of CHI to the list! Just love it, and so happy that I own it.  I will recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Works amazing!! Does not frizz hair and dries hair really fast! I have a lot of hair and it dries my hair in no time.</li>
            <li> I have long, mid-back length, color treated hair.  I take really good care of it and only use salon products, use heat protectant etc.  I get my hair trimmed regularly, but my ends just felt really dry and my hair was so unmanageable.  My old blowdryer was a Bedhead one and it made my hair so hot I couldn&#x27;t even touch it.  I decided to invest in the Chi Rocket after reading the great reviews. I honestly can&#x27;t believe what a huge difference it&#x27;s made in my hair.  It&#x27;s amazingly soft and smooth.  I really don&#x27;t even need to do anything else to it after blowdrying, but I use a big curling iron and it looks fantastic!  I wish I would have bought this years ago!  I will never go back to a cheap blowdryer again!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  It dries my hair quicker and not damaging like the other I&#x27;ve used in the past.  I wish the  power cord was longer still.  I would highly recommend this dryer for it&#x27;s quietness and qucker drying time.</li>
            <li> From the great buying experience to the quick delivery, this product couldn&#x27;t be better. Quiet, efficient, quality feel. GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> My Chi died this week and I was looking for a new dryer.  When I saw online that many people complained about the short life span, I looked back in my order history to see when I bought this CHI.  Sure, enough, 2 years prior.  I am shocked that a dryer which costs $170.00 has such a short life span.  Great dryer but not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this product. It drys my hair in minutes. I have a lot of hair and usually it takes me 45-60mins. to dry it with this blow dryer. It takes me 15-20mins. It has a lot of power. I am so glad that I bought it if you have a lot of hair this suits you. It will make a difference in time and its light weight.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for someone who has wanted one for a few years.  The heat stopped working the second time she used it.  I read one similar review and assumed it was just one bad one out of the batch since the other reviews were good, I won&#x27;t be purchasing chi products anymore.</li>
            <li> I have had my dryer for approximately 4 years.  I do not use it daily.  I have not experienced any mechanical problems with the dryer.  The quality of the dryer casing however feels cheap and the back cover for the &amp;#34;fan&amp;#34; area has broken off.  I like how quiet the dryer is and the speed of the dry time.  I also use Hot Tools brand hair dryer that is comparable in specs and would recommend it over this Chi product.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this is a bad item to purchase, but definitely research what else you can get for your dollar elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It dry&#x27;s your hair without making it frizzy.  Makes hair look shiny and smooth. Easy to use. it is a great product to have for styling.</li>
            <li> If you have thick or course hair, the attachement will fall off every time...esp blowdrying damp hair. After 2.5 yrs, the dryer stopped working as well. I wish I had returned it while I had the chance. It&#x27;s been frustrating with the attachment falling off and now it provides no heat.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a while now and it still works wonderfully and it&#x27;s quieter than hair dryers I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
