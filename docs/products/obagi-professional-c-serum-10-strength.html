            <li> I am very pleased with this product purchase!  Thank you for a great transaction along with a GREAT affordable price!!!  Don&#x27;t know what I would have done without finding this :)  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am still in the early stages, but so far I like it very much. It says to put 4-6 drops but I definitely have enough with 4. I let it dry before applying moisturizer and it feels very nice on my face. It is too early to tell if it will have positive effects but will definitely keep using. The package arrived earlier than expected.  The product came in original box, sealed from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Product came in great condition and quick . I love this product. I don&#x27;t think I could use a higher % than the 10.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the seller and the product .</li>

            <li> Love this stuff!  Does not dry out my skin.  I use 5 drops every day.  This bottle has lasted quite a while.  Will purchase again</li>

            <li> Vitamin C is an awesome skin brightner and I am a big fan of Obagi products so it&#x27;s a win win.</li>
            <li> Not the orginal product I purchased from my Dermatologist. When I rec&#x27;d the bottle the product was already yellow, which means it was no good.&lt;br /&gt;These websites sell alot of &#x27;FAKE&#x27; products, so buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> results after 3-4 weeks are visible for me-love it</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this specific item because of its benefits. I have recommended it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> The only one my mother will use.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin types.  Use with the obagi Hydrate product on top.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so the Obagi C Serum keeps my face feeling smooth and less dry. I also use Retin - A so this product keeps the redness from the Retin A at bay.  Love the Product.</li>
            <li> Before to undergo surgery to remove wrinkles from my face, my doctor prescribed me the 5% Obagi serum  two months prior my surgery. Over time, my skin has become so much more beautiful and smooth, I kept using the serum but I dropped the operation. I saved 1000 $ !!! Since, I continue applying Obagi daily, morning and evening. This time I upgraded the serum to 10% because I have 52 years. In 5 years, I will try the 20% serum.  I am extremely satisfied with this little mirale. My friends tell me regularly that my skin is beautiful and I do not look my age. Not need more to express my satisfaction!  ________________________________________________________  Avant une opération chirurgicale que je devais subir pour atténuer les rides de mon visage, mon médecin m&#x27;avait prescrit le sérum Obagi à utiliser deux mois avant mon opération. Ma peau est devenue tellement plus belle et lisse, que j&#x27;ai continué le sérum mais j&#x27;ai laissé tomber l&#x27;opération. J&#x27;ai sauvé 1000$ quoi! Depuis, je poursuis l&#x27;application d&#x27;Obagi tous les jours, matin et soir. Cette fois j&#x27;ai upgradé le sérum à 10% car j&#x27;ai 52 ans. Dans 5 ans, j&#x27;essaierai le 20%.  Je suis extrêmement satisfaite de ce produit miracle. Mes amies me disent régulièrement que ma peau est belle et que je ne fais pas mon âge. Pas besoin de plus pour exprimer ma satisfaction!</li>
