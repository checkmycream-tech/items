            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>amazing!</li>
            <li>amazing!.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin suspetible to burning so invest in a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>the product is so good i&#x27;m using it</li>
            <li>Helps greatly with dryness, gives a nice finish to the skin.</li>
            <li>But hands down, this is the best priced, best formula out there.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using the products from Acne.org for a while and then branching out on your own.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use a face good moisturizer in the meantime.  </li>
            <li>was able to control most of my breakouts after I started using noble forumla&#x27;s soap, but I still had a lot of hyperpigmentation and blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Excellent for body acne scars , facial scars , and acne .</li>
            <li>And make sure you wear sun screen .</li>
            <li>My blackheads have cleared up and my hyperpigmentation is mostly gone.</li>
            <li>but now I am confident it is transforming my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect on my skin to use once per day prior to moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Make sure you understand how AHA works before you use it....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>it does exactly what it says, no kidding!!!.</li>
            <li>But hands down this is the best AHA product I&#x27;ve used for my body and face.  </li>
            <li>but over all it is perfect i&#x27;ll diffidently purchase it again.</li>
            <li>However, since it&#x27;s made for the body primarily, that&#x27;s the important part.</li>
            <li>i chose this rating because this product coupled with the benzoyl peroxide (treatment) have effectively replaced the high priced retin a and obagi c serum prescribed by med spa dermatologist.</li>
            <li>think that it helps, but my scars don&#x27;t fade more since 2 month after becoming clear.</li>
            <li>I use Cotz.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product more than 3 or 4 days a week because it is very potent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But maybe if Dan happens to read this...could you make a formulation that absorbs into the skin better/more quickly.</li>
            <li>It does sting some, and you do get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>Really good, however I received the older version with old look of this.</li>
            <li>would suggest against this overpriced goo.&lt;br /&gt;Please use more natural remedies or see a Dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first it did cause a stinging sensation but that goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job of smoothing out your skin and helps cut down on the number of breakouts.</li>
            <li>This was a wee bit too strong for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This next week she should be able to.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump up in obviously flaky patches like most acne meds, and really works!  </li>
            <li>and I still look pretty much the same(I&#x27;m 35 now).  </li>
            <li>only problem for me : it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>it works on really large cysts.</li>
            <li>I have found some cheaper replacements for the soap and benzoyl peroxide but not by much.  </li>
            <li>Daniel Kern&#x27;s AHA really does work.</li>
            <li>I use this for back acne, but sometimes use it on my face, which is acne free.</li>
            <li>But evetually your skin will get used to it and really help your skin texture.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night, every night, mixed with a light moisturizer and/or BP</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>Because too much of AHA will have adverse effects.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how to feel about that.</li>
            <li>Acne scarring significantly reduced and overall texture improved.</li>
            <li>I have use other AHA product that have worked better then this one.</li>
            <li>gentle chemical exfoliation (aha+) and daily disinfection (treatment) have left me acne free and on the road to a clear complexion free of discoloration.</li>
            <li>The system will not dry out your skin or make it super oily.</li>
            <li>you can use this daily on legs or arms and you will see a difference quickly in the skin texture.</li>
            <li>Really helped clear acne, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I even had my roommate start using it since she has cystic acne on her cheeks and jaw line...which she&#x27;s had since high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for face and body.</li>
            <li>The important thing is be careful with sun exposure</li>
            <li>It does bleach most fabrics, so get used to a wardrobe of black, white, grey and bright red tops, white towels, sheets, and pillow cases.</li>
            <li>COULDN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly greasy when you first put it on, but it dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>and i have to stay very very far away from around the eye</li>
            <li>I bought the first container about two to three months ago and am just running low now.</li>
            <li>It works wonders for the areas that I get body acne and comes in a large enough container that I don&#x27;t have to restock too often.</li>
            <li>For me, I used little bits only at night on top of the regimen treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using BP for 4 years now but needed something to help clear my acne scarring.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s had clear skin ever since.</li>
            <li>works to stay clear and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really lightened up my back acne scars and panoxyl cleared my body acne .</li>
            <li>The scarring is beginning to fade and overall my skin feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>and naturally I won&#x27;t tell them...</li>
            <li>It spreads really well over my entire face just using a pea-sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it was completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>You have to use it certain days, and when you first use it, it might burn a little.</li>
            <li>So far I have been using AHA for 1 month now every second night after using the BP and in the mornings my skin is soft, dewy and clear.</li>
            <li>a quick disclaimer: it does sting a little bit.</li>
            <li>Compared to the beta hydroxy acid products (salicylic acid), this take a long while before it&#x27;s dry and absorbed.</li>
            <li>Acne is no fun, but this stuff pretty much wipes it out for me, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li>Acne sucks in every sense of the word, this system will free you from the suckiness.</li>
            <li>Not only did it clear up existing acne, but I haven&#x27;t had a break out since I started using it.</li>
            <li>It definitely help clear my skin in conjunction with the AHA.</li>
            <li>THE ONLY THING THAT CALMS MY SENSITIVE SKIN DOWN.PLUS</li>
            <li>always purchase this and other products made by this company very well reseached and does work on acne</li>
            <li>But only the first few times you use it, or if you have a pimple coming in that</li>

            <li> This has been a miracle product for me - I have aging (early 40s), combination skin that was constantly breaking out; due to &#x27;congested pores&#x27;, says the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> gooey stuff was not even friendly to my acne, i believe it made it worse.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and back in January</li>
            <li> I would love to help acne sufferers because acne is so depressing.</li>
            <li> but the shipping took so long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit rough on the face, which I only tried once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the same price per ounce as other AHA treatments.</li>
            <li> Since starting the Acne.org AHA+, my skin has cleared up by 95%, the texture has softened, it&#x27;s even less oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with very dry rough skin on my arms for years.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this product and over the past couple of weeks have noticed a major change in the appearance and  feeling of my skin.</li>
            <li> When I say I have done everything and spent a gazillion dollars on products, I have.  </li>
            <li> It stings if you shave or if you get rough patches like me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Arrived timely as expected.</li>
            <li> This lotion is to make the skin look nicer, less rough looking and even out the tone.  </li>
            <li> I only use this on my face and neck once a week or at least wait 5 days or so</li>
            <li> I usually get those really deep under the skin, can&#x27;t-do-anything-about-them, SUPER painful pimples on my chin every month.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality AHA+ lotion that would cost triple or quadruple the price if purchased anywhere other than acne.org (check Paula&#x27;s choice if you are skeptical).</li>
            <li> I cut down to once a day after about 2 years of &amp;#34;the regimen&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> All in all, the only complaint is that it&#x27;s not available in stores or through Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> This product will sting your skin for a little bit.  </li>
            <li> IT HELPS GET THE DEAD SKIN</li>
            <li> totally hated the pricing and the contents, smells funny, looks and feels funny.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Only use after using BP for at least 2 months or it will sting like crazy!</li>
            <li> my face was completely broken out and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It made my cystic acne worse</li>
            <li> and my skin broke out like crazy.</li>
            <li> So do not pop ur zits and put this lotion on it will burn like crazy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent for body acne scars , facial scars , and acne . It really lightened up my back acne scars and panoxyl cleared my body acne . And make sure you wear sun screen . Panoxyl and dans aha will eradicate your acne just be patient took 3 weeks to start seeing results .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with very dry rough skin on my arms for years. I&#x27;ve been doing my research and found out that chemical exfoliation might help. So I purchased this product and over the past couple of weeks have noticed a major change in the appearance and  feeling of my skin. The scarring is beginning to fade and overall my skin feels so much softer. I would definitely recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> THE ONLY THING THAT CALMS MY SENSITIVE SKIN DOWN.PLUS IT HELPS GET THE DEAD SKIN OFF.LOVE IT. COULDN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for almost a decade. Acne is no fun, but this stuff pretty much wipes it out for me, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. One big bottle usually last 5 months, I use one pump squirt every morning and night. It does bleach most fabrics, so get used to a wardrobe of black, white, grey and bright red tops, white towels, sheets, and pillow cases. I hope it works for you too.</li>
            <li> always purchase this and other products made by this company very well reseached and does work on acne no scars</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months, and the difference in my skin is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the Acne Regimen. I have really dry skin and back in January my face was completely broken out and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to control most of my breakouts after I started using noble forumla&#x27;s soap, but I still had a lot of hyperpigmentation and blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this glycolic acid three days a week. I put it on after washing my fact and before my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;At first it did cause a stinging sensation but that goes away quickly. It does make your skin suspetible to burning so invest in a good sunscreen. I use Cotz.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product more than 3 or 4 days a week because it is very potent.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks incredible now. My blackheads have cleared up and my hyperpigmentation is mostly gone. When I get zits now, I use glycolic acid as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried to find a cheaper way of getting this and there is not.  I would go to Acne.org and find out about the system that is used.  Nothing has cleared my face like this system.  I have found some cheaper replacements for the soap and benzoyl peroxide but not by much.  I would recommend using the products from Acne.org for a while and then branching out on your own.  But hands down, this is the best priced, best formula out there.  When I say I have done everything and spent a gazillion dollars on products, I have.  Save money, time and headache.  The system will not dry out your skin or make it super oily. I have used: retinol, tetracycline, benzoyl peroxide washes and creams, Proactive, dermatologists, an AHA system that was over 300.00 a month (worked but I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep it up)...on and on and on.  Save money, get this.  Also, I&#x27;d recommend going to an Aesthetician for extractions or mini facials, it will just speed the process along.  Once your face is cleared, if you keep up with the system, you won&#x27;t have to go back.  It will happen with just the Acne.org system, just takes a bit longer.  Acne sucks in every sense of the word, this system will free you from the suckiness.</li>
            <li> Daniel Kern&#x27;s AHA really does work. I&#x27;ve been using BP for 4 years now but needed something to help clear my acne scarring. So far I have been using AHA for 1 month now every second night after using the BP and in the mornings my skin is soft, dewy and clear. I was hesitant at the start because I couldn&#x27;t see any changes but now I am confident it is transforming my skin. Acne scarring significantly reduced and overall texture improved. Only use after using BP for at least 2 months or it will sting like crazy! I will definitely be repurchasing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before.  It&#x27;s perfect on my skin to use once per day prior to moisturizing!&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I have used some type of AHA product since I was 23 and I still look pretty much the same(I&#x27;m 35 now).  But hands down this is the best AHA product I&#x27;ve used for my body and face.  Make sure you understand how AHA works before you use it....I only use this on my face and neck once a week or at least wait 5 days or so before you use it again on your face. Make sure you use a face good moisturizer in the meantime.  But, the skin on your body is very different...you can use this daily on legs or arms and you will see a difference quickly in the skin texture. All my friends want to know what I do....and naturally I won&#x27;t tell them...I just say &amp;#34;oh just diet and exercise&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> We bought this to reduce red scars from acne. We have to wait a month before using totally on my daughter as that is what it says to do. I like it on my skin just for a serum / moisturizer. We will check back when my daughter starts using it. This next week she should be able to.</li>
            <li> This was a wee bit too strong for my sensitive skin.  Sometimes I could put it on without an issue, but a lot of times it burned or caused my discomfort.</li>
            <li> This is my miracle cream. I put this on after washing my face in the morning and before bed. Not only did it clear up existing acne, but I haven&#x27;t had a break out since I started using it. NOT ONCE. I usually get those really deep under the skin, can&#x27;t-do-anything-about-them, SUPER painful pimples on my chin every month. I haven&#x27;t had ANY (NONE. ZIP. NADA.) since starting to use this stuff. You only have to use the tiniest amount each time too. It spreads really well over my entire face just using a pea-sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s that amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even had my roommate start using it since she has cystic acne on her cheeks and jaw line...which she&#x27;s had since high school. It took about a month but it was completely cleared up. She&#x27;s had clear skin ever since. M.I.R.A.C.L.E. Amazing. Buying this stuff for LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Just a quick disclaimer: it does sting a little bit. But only the first few times you use it, or if you have a pimple coming in that you didn&#x27;t even know existed...</li>
            <li> Works well at the beginning but after 1 month acne&#x27;s scars can&#x27;t fade.&lt;br /&gt;But works to stay clear and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem for me : it&#x27;s strong. If i put this product every night it&#x27;s itching me and i have to stay very very far away from around the eye, otherwise i wake up with swell eyes !&lt;br /&gt;I think that it helps, but my scars don&#x27;t fade more since 2 month after becoming clear.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s slightly greasy when you first put it on, but it dries pretty fast. It really does a great job of smoothing out your skin and helps cut down on the number of breakouts. I use this for back acne, but sometimes use it on my face, which is acne free.</li>
            <li> the product is so good i&#x27;m using it and my skin is glowing like never before but the shipping took so long. but over all it is perfect i&#x27;ll diffidently purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit rough on the face, which I only tried once. Maybe you&#x27;d get used to it over time. However, since it&#x27;s made for the body primarily, that&#x27;s the important part. It works wonders for the areas that I get body acne and comes in a large enough container that I don&#x27;t have to restock too often. I bought the first container about two to three months ago and am just running low now. It&#x27;s about the same price per ounce as other AHA treatments. All in all, the only complaint is that it&#x27;s not available in stores or through Amazon Prime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2/7/13 Still works great. But maybe if Dan happens to read this...could you make a formulation that absorbs into the skin better/more quickly. Compared to the beta hydroxy acid products (salicylic acid), this take a long while before it&#x27;s dry and absorbed. I have been using a hair dryer to speed it up.</li>
            <li> Really helped clear acne, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, see results ! Thank you !</li>
            <li> This is a high quality AHA+ lotion that would cost triple or quadruple the price if purchased anywhere other than acne.org (check Paula&#x27;s choice if you are skeptical). I highly recommend it for face and body.</li>
            <li> Use it in the way they recommend it. You have to use it certain days, and when you first use it, it might burn a little. But evetually your skin will get used to it and really help your skin texture. The important thing is be careful with sun exposure</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have been using it for over a year.  It continues to work on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Use it every day- I cut down to once a day after about 2 years of &amp;#34;the regimen&amp;#34;.  I love it.  Still works.</li>
            <li> This product will sting your skin for a little bit.  It makes the skin smoother and help fade acne scars.  I use the 2.5% BP lotion and that was the product that got rid of my acne on my body.  This lotion is to make the skin look nicer, less rough looking and even out the tone.  If you want to save money and just want to get rid of acne, just buy the BP lotion only and skip this.</li>
            <li> This has been a miracle product for me - I have aging (early 40s), combination skin that was constantly breaking out; due to &#x27;congested pores&#x27;, says the dermatologist.  I have used Retin A, BP, and salicylic, even glycolic acid masks for over a decade, and nothing cleared my skin up.  Since starting the Acne.org AHA+, my skin has cleared up by 95%, the texture has softened, it&#x27;s even less oily. I use it at night, every night, mixed with a light moisturizer and/or BP (if I see spots forming).  It does sting some, and you do get used to it quickly.  If you battle with blackheads and gunked up pores, try this stuff!</li>
            <li> i chose this rating because this product coupled with the benzoyl peroxide (treatment) have effectively replaced the high priced retin a and obagi c serum prescribed by med spa dermatologist. my skin doesn&#x27;t tolerate mechanical exfoliation and my issues aren&#x27;t severe enuf for lasers.  the acne.org products and advice are on point for me.  gentle chemical exfoliation (aha+) and daily disinfection (treatment) have left me acne free and on the road to a clear complexion free of discoloration. the value blows away the derma&#x27;s Rx and med spa suggestions.</li>
            <li> It stings if you shave or if you get rough patches like me.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest against this overpriced goo.&lt;br /&gt;Please use more natural remedies or see a Dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;I totally hated the pricing and the contents, smells funny, looks and feels funny.&lt;br /&gt;This gooey stuff was not even friendly to my acne, i believe it made it worse.</li>
            <li> Helps greatly with dryness, gives a nice finish to the skin. I think it helps with marks too. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says, no kidding!!!. For me, I used little bits only at night on top of the regimen treatment. It will sting initially but your skin will get used to it.  Amazing! amazing! amazing!.</li>
            <li> This did not help my acne.  I really wanted this to work but, no go for me. It made my cystic acne worse and I used it for two weeks.  I think there is something in it that does not agree with my skin.  I have use other AHA product that have worked better then this one. I thought because this was for acne it would help me.  I guess I need to keep looking somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely as expected.</li>
            <li> it works on really large cysts. It also helps with redness. Don&#x27;t abuse this though. Try using it only 3 times a week. Because too much of AHA will have adverse effects.</li>
            <li> Really good, however I received the older version with old look of this. I really don&#x27;t know how to feel about that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year and it definitely helps prevent acne. I stopped using this for about a month to try the coconut remedy and my skin broke out like crazy. So I decided to go back to the AHA and my skin is getting clearer every day. I also recommend female balance supplements by Now and Eminence skin vitamins if you have hormonal acne. It definitely help clear my skin in conjunction with the AHA. The AHA does sting when you put it on so do not put it on any open lesions like acne or it will make u jump. So do not pop ur zits and put this lotion on it will burn like crazy. Any way don&#x27;t pop ur zits it causes scars and nobody likes scars you can&#x27;t get rid of on ur face. I would love to help acne sufferers because acne is so depressing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump up in obviously flaky patches like most acne meds, and really works!  Try the AHA+ for bumpy arms, too.</li>
