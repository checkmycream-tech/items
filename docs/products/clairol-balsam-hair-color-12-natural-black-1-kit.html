    <ol>
            <li>This product is awesome and results in silky, shiny, wonderful smelling hair.  </li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>It smells really great while dyeing, and afterwards, too.</li>
            <li>Great color for the price</li>
            <li>Great price for the lot</li>
            <li>The price is great too compared to the retail store cost.</li>
            <li>Great price and my favorite color!  </li>
            <li>I just put aside some of our raggedy linens for the dyeing process so nothing good gets ruined.</li>
            <li>; looks fab w fair skin</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on how good the color looks with my coloring.</li>
            <li>This product gives me as good a result</li>
            <li>I am kind of a beauty product snob, and CAN tell the difference between department store and drug store beauty products, and I had a pleasant experience with this product.  </li>
            <li>very fast delivery and very pleased with the product awesome deal</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>And the smell was really strong, not in a good way.</li>
            <li>Very natural and my hair looks GREAT!</li>
            <li>Works like a charm and is very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the color however it washed out in a weeks time.</li>
            <li>I ended up trying it anyway, I LOVE the color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best red I&#x27;ve been able to find</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve had to buy a much better conditioner in order to continue to use the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really affordable and a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>I am able to dye my hair alone with this, versus needing somebody else&#x27;s help.</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair and I love this color because it doesn&#x27;t look like a drastic, noticeable color change.  </li>
            <li>My husband picked this out for me and he is quite pleased, also.  </li>
            <li>This has happened to me too many times, so I don&#x27;t order \\&quot;retired\\&quot; colors anymore.</li>
            <li>The darker colors are much more flattering than the lighter ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Always satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the brands</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and the color looks fabulous!</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I have NEVER even tried another hair dye since then.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect color, 10 minutes in hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out in clumps after I dye it like with other coloring products.</li>
            <li>I use one and a half of the kits to get the best coverage.</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed over the years, the colors aren&#x27;t really accurate anymore.</li>
            <li>On my light auburn hair it came out a perfect red, far better than what I was expecting...</li>
            <li>As I stepped out of the shower I saw drops of light tan falling.  </li>
            <li>I was excited because it looked like a \\&quot;Dr.</li>
            <li>Clairol Natural Instincts 22 Cinnaberry Medium Auburn Brown is an AWESOME red!</li>
            <li>Still worked but a pain to clean everything.</li>
            <li>I should have to just to my tried and true Feria</li>
            <li>My color came out very well and everyone seems to love it too.</li>
            <li>I really could not have rinsed it more than I did.  </li>
            <li>The box is true to the color.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a bold change, so I do like it, but it looks anything but \\&quot;natural\\&quot; on me.  </li>
            <li>They fade really quickly though.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the older reviews I think I have a more updated color kit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true red red, a perfect balance of orange red and purple red, which I have NOT been able to successfully find in a semi-permanent until now.</li>
            <li>The very first time I dyed my hair was 7 or 8 years ago</li>
            <li>It totally changes the color and makes it even more orange!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll prolly have to dye it again in 2 -3 weeks if I want to keep it looking like this, since it is a semi-permanent, but to me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I read reviews and do what ever I can to find out if somethings worth buying .  </li>
            <li>It looks like the old color is supposed to and is shiny and ammonia free!</li>
            <li>However with the right hair care you can still use this product.</li>
            <li>At first it was a bright reddish, pink color.  </li>
            <li>I wish Clairol natural instincts was more consistent with their products .</li>
            <li>I actually saw a review in some magazine that said that Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts 22 was one of the best otc red hair colors out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as bright of a red as I can get and still keep it looking somewhat natural.</li>
            <li>process is really easy and the directions are clear and understandable.</li>
            <li>This is a reorder for me most definitely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the exact color result I had been looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this hair color for 4 years (formerly 22) and I get so many compliments on the color of my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the real deal, too!</li>
            <li>Consistent quality.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and last long enough for me to be happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It catches flashes of red, gold, and browns - really making it an interesting color.</li>
            <li>depends on the color you are dying over, it&#x27;ll be more subtle on darker hair for sure.  </li>
            <li>I live off the grid, and still have fun playing with hair color.</li>
            <li>if I don&#x27;t my hair becomes too dry and has more breakage.  </li>
            <li>It is easily applied and the results last for weeks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just that my hair has turned real muddy brown since I hit 30</li>
            <li>and I did not want to grab too much of that.</li>
            <li>I wrote them and they gave me a free coupon, but why would I use there product again for it to wash out another week later.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves your hair REALLY shiny and silky.</li>
            <li>Natural Instincts fades out of your hair pretty much all over consistently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to my blonde and light brown shades from now on.</li>
            <li>My hair got so wooley and stuck together that I couldn&#x27;t move it much.  </li>
            <li>It was the 28 shampoo&#x27;s,  but it absolutely would NOT fade.</li>
            <li>It did run clear for me after about 5 mins of rinsing, but I do have a hand-held shower nozzle so this probably rinses better than if you are just sticking your head under a tub faucet.  </li>
            <li>Cinnaberry offers just the right shade of auburn to match my summer locks.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B001E5EC72 Clairol Natural Instincts Hair Color 28, Nutmeg, Dark Brown 1 Kit (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product!</li>
            <li>Normally I stick to the blonde or light brown colors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a natural redhead, so it&#x27;s easy for me to pick up a decent looking red, since I naturally have the right undertones for it -</li>
            <li>One thing I love about Natural Instincts is that it does wash out and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have medium dark hair that gets lovely auburn highlights in the summer.</li>
            <li>I did my research and found a color that is exactly like the old Cinnaberry.</li>
            <li>However, I live in rainy Oregon, where sunshine is at a premium after September!</li>
            <li>I use dry shampoo (Suave makes a cheap brand, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long; Got2Be&#x27;s is better) between washes, and my hair has never been healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After years of using this I&#x27;ve realized that \\&quot;semi-permanent\\&quot; and \\&quot;no ammonia\\&quot; (or is it \\&quot;no peroxide\\&quot;??) does not mean \\&quot;no damage\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>but it is very shiny &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li>my hair was lighter than normal but I wanted to change it up, so I tried Cinnaberry, a auburn shade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*This isn&#x27;t scientific, but I&#x27;ve found if I blow dry my hair after rinsing out the color, it seems to stand out more and last longer.</li>
            <li>I ordered Cinnaberry and for a second I was set on returning it because as soon as I opened the box, I saw it wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li>, I tried something new and it didn&#x27;t work out so well for me.  </li>
            <li>The first day or two, it&#x27;s a little brassy (color on the weekend to ready by Monday), but it smooths out after that, leaving a deep, rich shade that looks just right with my medium complexion (I&#x27;m native American; my skin tone is what you might call a perpetual tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the conditioner that came with it and had no problems, I&#x27;m not sure why others had so many issues</li>
            <li>I have purchased this in the past and love the color.  </li>
            <li>The color lasts a full 6-9 weeks, (although be careful, it does run for the first several hair washes!)</li>
            <li>Up until about a year ago I was high-end salon BLONDE for years, however balyage 4x/yr at $250 a pop started getting old, so I eased up until I had my natural color which turned out to be a mousy blondish brown with natural golden highlights,</li>
            <li>&quot; This may result in some light colored towels or pillowcases to have some slight staining.</li>
            <li>Since I have some gray I left it on for 15 minutes, instead of 10, and it was pretty easy compared to past colorings.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, though, if you want a pretty Black, or Dark Brown - I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li>first couple of times you wash your hair (wait at least 24 hours for your first wash), be sure to use dark or old linens, as the dye will stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After doing research it occurred to me that all i was really after was having a red ontop of my natural shade.  </li>
            <li>When the water looked clear I applied the conditioner and then rinsed.  </li>
            <li>Online the picture is clearly auburn .</li>
            <li>I read a lot of mixed reviews on Cinnaberry and was VERY nervous when the dye on my head started turning an eggplanty PURPLE, but went the 10 mins and rinsed &amp; conditioned as directed.  </li>
            <li>So even though it doesn&#x27;t say it on the package the company recommends this for natural hair, call them and see for yourself.  </li>
            <li>The next morning I washed my hair and the shampoo turned orange, the whole thing washed away (YAY).  </li>
            <li>I use Natural Instincts to get rid of my gray every 2 months or so.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s to be expected with any wash out haircolor - right?</li>
            <li>I like to dye frequently to keep it a vibrant red.</li>
            <li>The most recent application left my hair clown red and horribly dry.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every day, and I have a feeling this shade will hit its \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; in about a week, but it&#x27;s flashy and fun for now!</li>
            <li>I have some grey and while it blends in nicely I can tell because it&#x27;s not as dark as the other hair.</li>
            <li>The hair that was never dyed with permant color (6 months of roots and bangs) is soft and not dry at all.  </li>
            <li>but I am a loyal customer now that I&#x27;ve tried this a few times.</li>
            <li>they regularly  discontinue or rename colors , which creates problems for old customers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big user of Natural Instincts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, red doesn&#x27;t hold well in my hair and after 3 washes and swimming in the pool, it is now a normal looking red color, though still splotchy.  </li>
            <li>It was supposed to make a pretty toned down &#x27;Auburn&#x27; type color, but</li>
            <li>It all depends on your current color, your natural color, and how long you leave it on.</li>

            <li> On my light auburn hair it came out a perfect red, far better than what I was expecting...</li>
            <li> As I stepped out of the shower I saw drops of light tan falling.  </li>
            <li> I was excited because it looked like a \\&quot;Dr.</li>
            <li> Clairol Natural Instincts 22 Cinnaberry Medium Auburn Brown is an AWESOME red!</li>
            <li> Still worked but a pain to clean everything.</li>
            <li> I should have to just to my tried and true Feria</li>
            <li> My color came out very well and everyone seems to love it too.</li>
            <li> I really could not have rinsed it more than I did.  </li>
            <li> The box is true to the color.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a bold change, so I do like it, but it looks anything but \\&quot;natural\\&quot; on me.  </li>
            <li> They fade really quickly though.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the older reviews I think I have a more updated color kit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true red red, a perfect balance of orange red and purple red, which I have NOT been able to successfully find in a semi-permanent until now.</li>
            <li> The very first time I dyed my hair was 7 or 8 years ago</li>
            <li> It totally changes the color and makes it even more orange!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll prolly have to dye it again in 2 -3 weeks if I want to keep it looking like this, since it is a semi-permanent, but to me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and do what ever I can to find out if somethings worth buying .  </li>
            <li> It looks like the old color is supposed to and is shiny and ammonia free!</li>
            <li> However with the right hair care you can still use this product.</li>
            <li> At first it was a bright reddish, pink color.  </li>
            <li> I wish Clairol natural instincts was more consistent with their products .</li>
            <li> I actually saw a review in some magazine that said that Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts 22 was one of the best otc red hair colors out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as bright of a red as I can get and still keep it looking somewhat natural.</li>
            <li> process is really easy and the directions are clear and understandable.</li>
            <li> This is a reorder for me most definitely.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the exact color result I had been looking for.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this hair color for 4 years (formerly 22) and I get so many compliments on the color of my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the real deal, too!</li>
            <li> Consistent quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and last long enough for me to be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It catches flashes of red, gold, and browns - really making it an interesting color.</li>
            <li> depends on the color you are dying over, it&#x27;ll be more subtle on darker hair for sure.  </li>
            <li> I live off the grid, and still have fun playing with hair color.</li>
            <li> if I don&#x27;t my hair becomes too dry and has more breakage.  </li>
            <li> It is easily applied and the results last for weeks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just that my hair has turned real muddy brown since I hit 30</li>
            <li> and I did not want to grab too much of that.</li>
            <li> I wrote them and they gave me a free coupon, but why would I use there product again for it to wash out another week later.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves your hair REALLY shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> Natural Instincts fades out of your hair pretty much all over consistently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my blonde and light brown shades from now on.</li>
            <li> My hair got so wooley and stuck together that I couldn&#x27;t move it much.  </li>
            <li> It was the 28 shampoo&#x27;s,  but it absolutely would NOT fade.</li>
            <li> It did run clear for me after about 5 mins of rinsing, but I do have a hand-held shower nozzle so this probably rinses better than if you are just sticking your head under a tub faucet.  </li>
            <li> Cinnaberry offers just the right shade of auburn to match my summer locks.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001E5EC72 Clairol Natural Instincts Hair Color 28, Nutmeg, Dark Brown 1 Kit (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product!</li>
            <li> Normally I stick to the blonde or light brown colors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a natural redhead, so it&#x27;s easy for me to pick up a decent looking red, since I naturally have the right undertones for it -</li>
            <li> One thing I love about Natural Instincts is that it does wash out and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have medium dark hair that gets lovely auburn highlights in the summer.</li>
            <li> I did my research and found a color that is exactly like the old Cinnaberry.</li>
            <li> However, I live in rainy Oregon, where sunshine is at a premium after September!</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo (Suave makes a cheap brand, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long; Got2Be&#x27;s is better) between washes, and my hair has never been healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After years of using this I&#x27;ve realized that \\&quot;semi-permanent\\&quot; and \\&quot;no ammonia\\&quot; (or is it \\&quot;no peroxide\\&quot;??) does not mean \\&quot;no damage\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> but it is very shiny &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li> my hair was lighter than normal but I wanted to change it up, so I tried Cinnaberry, a auburn shade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*This isn&#x27;t scientific, but I&#x27;ve found if I blow dry my hair after rinsing out the color, it seems to stand out more and last longer.</li>
            <li> I ordered Cinnaberry and for a second I was set on returning it because as soon as I opened the box, I saw it wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li> , I tried something new and it didn&#x27;t work out so well for me.  </li>
            <li> The first day or two, it&#x27;s a little brassy (color on the weekend to ready by Monday), but it smooths out after that, leaving a deep, rich shade that looks just right with my medium complexion (I&#x27;m native American; my skin tone is what you might call a perpetual tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the conditioner that came with it and had no problems, I&#x27;m not sure why others had so many issues</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past and love the color.  </li>
            <li> The color lasts a full 6-9 weeks, (although be careful, it does run for the first several hair washes!)</li>
            <li> Up until about a year ago I was high-end salon BLONDE for years, however balyage 4x/yr at $250 a pop started getting old, so I eased up until I had my natural color which turned out to be a mousy blondish brown with natural golden highlights,</li>
            <li> &quot; This may result in some light colored towels or pillowcases to have some slight staining.</li>
            <li> Since I have some gray I left it on for 15 minutes, instead of 10, and it was pretty easy compared to past colorings.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, though, if you want a pretty Black, or Dark Brown - I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> first couple of times you wash your hair (wait at least 24 hours for your first wash), be sure to use dark or old linens, as the dye will stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After doing research it occurred to me that all i was really after was having a red ontop of my natural shade.  </li>
            <li> When the water looked clear I applied the conditioner and then rinsed.  </li>
            <li> Online the picture is clearly auburn .</li>
            <li> I read a lot of mixed reviews on Cinnaberry and was VERY nervous when the dye on my head started turning an eggplanty PURPLE, but went the 10 mins and rinsed &amp; conditioned as directed.  </li>
            <li> So even though it doesn&#x27;t say it on the package the company recommends this for natural hair, call them and see for yourself.  </li>
            <li> The next morning I washed my hair and the shampoo turned orange, the whole thing washed away (YAY).  </li>
            <li> I use Natural Instincts to get rid of my gray every 2 months or so.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s to be expected with any wash out haircolor - right?</li>
            <li> I like to dye frequently to keep it a vibrant red.</li>
            <li> The most recent application left my hair clown red and horribly dry.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day, and I have a feeling this shade will hit its \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; in about a week, but it&#x27;s flashy and fun for now!</li>
            <li> I have some grey and while it blends in nicely I can tell because it&#x27;s not as dark as the other hair.</li>
            <li> The hair that was never dyed with permant color (6 months of roots and bangs) is soft and not dry at all.  </li>
            <li> but I am a loyal customer now that I&#x27;ve tried this a few times.</li>
            <li> they regularly  discontinue or rename colors , which creates problems for old customers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big user of Natural Instincts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, red doesn&#x27;t hold well in my hair and after 3 washes and swimming in the pool, it is now a normal looking red color, though still splotchy.  </li>
            <li> It was supposed to make a pretty toned down &#x27;Auburn&#x27; type color, but</li>
            <li> It all depends on your current color, your natural color, and how long you leave it on.</li>
            <li> box says 28 washes, but I usually get at least six weeks out of it, as I only wash my hair every 2-3 days, on the advice of my fabulous hairdresser friend in New York.</li>
            <li> I once used a &#x27;Medium cool Brown&#x27;, and it turned my hair a VERY Dark Brown, which everyone said it looked Black.</li>
            <li> I used it when I had the dark Brown, and my roots were completely Reddish.</li>
            <li> Your variable is how long you leave it on, so I would experiment with different times using test strands.</li>
            <li> I have really long (almost to the bottom of my back)</li>
            <li> I like this product and though it is labeled semi-permanent, it is quite long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I have read reviews from several other people who have had the same problem.</li>
            <li> and I need a healthier, long term solution that doesn&#x27;t involve henna.     </li>
            <li> If you have grey I would recommend keeping it on for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> My hair is almost all grey</li>
            <li> Got tired of going store to store looking for the right color and started ordering on line.</li>
            <li> hair is medium to dark brown and this makes it slightly darker in areas, but really well lit in other areas.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about losing my natural \\&quot;tones &amp; highlights,\\&quot; but there are definitely still contrasts, and I also worried it would be dull</li>
            <li> Because my hair is very long</li>
            <li> However, I finally had to admit that it was not at all attractive and was disgusting!!</li>
            <li> With Cinaberry my hair didn&#x27;t turn out like the box depicts, but it&#x27;s probably because I only left it on for roughly 6 minutes, from beginning to finish, and my hair is pre-lightened from previous permanent treatments.</li>
            <li> It had no 15 day refresher (which really sounded terrible from the reviewers), but it did have the nice conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally dark blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> So, I am pleased with the color, though shocked because I have never been a redhead.  </li>
            <li> It used to last me a few weeks before fading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of using permanents since they are more damaging.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dark brown, but was a lighter brown due to highlights and previous color.</li>
            <li> In the past I have purchased hard to find shades in packages that were too old.  </li>
            <li> (My ends get too dark from porosity).</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair...</li>
            <li> I wanted to add some reddish dark brown spice to my hair for some flair.</li>
            <li> I have longish, thick hair (mid shoulder blades)</li>
            <li> I also tried the Black once, which got permanently stuck in my hair, for some reason.</li>
            <li> A little too dark, but works for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little pass shoulder length and is a medium thickness, so one bottle should be plenty.  </li>
            <li> It said cinnaberry but the color looked dark brown!</li>
            <li> few tips:&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice, but kinda boring.  </li>
            <li> So for a few months the box sat unused.  </li>
            <li> No scalp irritation or uneven color.</li>
            <li> However, when I rinsed and dried my hair, I almost fell over when I looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> And it was worse the next day when I was driving and the sunlight hit my hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and very red; the shower usually looks like a scene out of Psycho when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> The plastic bottle becomes brittle and cracks in your hands as you squeeze it, what a mess!</li>
            <li> And that they can&#x27;t guarentee it won&#x27;t cause hair breakage if used over past permanent hair dyes.  </li>
            <li> The color part is okay, the 2 week enhancer part is TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s usually</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Getting it is hard, so I was tickled to find I could order it (3 box package) from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I do have delicate hair and maybe someone with thicker hair strands would not have this issue, but I can no longer use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this color Cinnaberry for at least 15 years.</li>
            <li> curly, thick hair and one bottle is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took me two weeks to fade it, which as of right now it&#x27;s a very ugly Orange/Brassy color.</li>
            <li> but subtle--- it came out Angela-from-My-So-Called-Life-Red.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t look sickly, and now my blue eyes just POP.  </li>
            <li> I agree with those who say the new formula is horrible.</li>
            <li> I had to end up getting it bleached out, which damaged my hair like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also sick of how permanents lighten hair, and how difficult it is to manage root growth and to keep an even color.</li>
            <li> is that it is impossible to \\&quot;rinse until water runs clear.\\</li>
            <li> when ever I switch brands now because of bad experiences) and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed by how the products have changed.</li>
            <li> Worst color I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as damaging as permanent hair color, but my longer hair is giving up the ghost, it&#x27;s like an overstretched rubber band, awful split ends and won&#x27;t hold color.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>

            <li> I love it. I just found the color I want to use forever. I&#x27;m sick of using permanents since they are more damaging. I like to dye frequently to keep it a vibrant red. I&#x27;m also sick of how permanents lighten hair, and how difficult it is to manage root growth and to keep an even color. (My ends get too dark from porosity). My hair is getting fried and I need a healthier, long term solution that doesn&#x27;t involve henna.     With Cinaberry my hair didn&#x27;t turn out like the box depicts, but it&#x27;s probably because I only left it on for roughly 6 minutes, from beginning to finish, and my hair is pre-lightened from previous permanent treatments. I&#x27;m also a natural redhead, so it&#x27;s easy for me to pick up a decent looking red, since I naturally have the right undertones for it - it&#x27;s just that my hair has turned real muddy brown since I hit 30 and I need help to give it back to that knockout red.    I didn&#x27;t want to leave it on any longer than 6 min total because, judging from the box, this carries purples tones and I did not want to grab too much of that. On my light auburn hair it came out a perfect red, far better than what I was expecting...kinda like Christina Hendricks&#x27; red, but maybe not as blondish...just a hint of purple tone as to not make it look so orangey. It&#x27;s a true red red, a perfect balance of orange red and purple red, which I have NOT been able to successfully find in a semi-permanent until now. It&#x27;s as bright of a red as I can get and still keep it looking somewhat natural. (I&#x27;m not looking to get a manic panic red going on).    It all depends on your current color, your natural color, and how long you leave it on. Your variable is how long you leave it on, so I would experiment with different times using test strands. The box says to leave it on from 10 minutes, but depending on what you are looking for you may want to change that around a bit.    I&#x27;ll prolly have to dye it again in 2 -3 weeks if I want to keep it looking like this, since it is a semi-permanent, but to me, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the color however it washed out in a weeks time. I was so upset. I wrote them and they gave me a free coupon, but why would I use there product again for it to wash out another week later. I should have to just to my tried and true Feria</li>
            <li> I have medium dark hair that gets lovely auburn highlights in the summer. However, I live in rainy Oregon, where sunshine is at a premium after September! #22 Cinnaberry offers just the right shade of auburn to match my summer locks. The first day or two, it&#x27;s a little brassy (color on the weekend to ready by Monday), but it smooths out after that, leaving a deep, rich shade that looks just right with my medium complexion (I&#x27;m native American; my skin tone is what you might call a perpetual tan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*\\&quot;Rinse until clear\\&quot; takes the majority of your time. This stuff is thick and very red; the shower usually looks like a scene out of Psycho when I&#x27;m done! I have longish, thick hair (mid shoulder blades) and I think that makes for a longer rinse time, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The first couple of times you wash your hair (wait at least 24 hours for your first wash), be sure to use dark or old linens, as the dye will stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I recommend using an end sealer before coloring. It helps strengthen &amp; seal the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The box says 28 washes, but I usually get at least six weeks out of it, as I only wash my hair every 2-3 days, on the advice of my fabulous hairdresser friend in New York. I use dry shampoo (Suave makes a cheap brand, but it doesn&#x27;t last as long; Got2Be&#x27;s is better) between washes, and my hair has never been healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This isn&#x27;t scientific, but I&#x27;ve found if I blow dry my hair after rinsing out the color, it seems to stand out more and last longer.</li>
            <li> I am kind of a beauty product snob, and CAN tell the difference between department store and drug store beauty products, and I had a pleasant experience with this product.  I think just HOW red this comes out on you depends on the color you are dying over, it&#x27;ll be more subtle on darker hair for sure.  Mine is anything but subtle--- it came out Angela-from-My-So-Called-Life-Red.  I was looking for a bold change, so I do like it, but it looks anything but \\&quot;natural\\&quot; on me.  Up until about a year ago I was high-end salon BLONDE for years, however balyage 4x/yr at $250 a pop started getting old, so I eased up until I had my natural color which turned out to be a mousy blondish brown with natural golden highlights, nice, but kinda boring.  I read a lot of mixed reviews on Cinnaberry and was VERY nervous when the dye on my head started turning an eggplanty PURPLE, but went the 10 mins and rinsed &amp; conditioned as directed.  It did run clear for me after about 5 mins of rinsing, but I do have a hand-held shower nozzle so this probably rinses better than if you are just sticking your head under a tub faucet.  I had no issues with rubbing off on my clothes or pillowcase, even though I put grubby ones on just in case.  No skin staining or anything either, which I had problems with way back when I used to do at-home permanent dyes.  I did plan ahead and self-tanned my face, decollette, and arms so I wouldn&#x27;t look sickly, and now my blue eyes just POP.  I was concerned about losing my natural \\&quot;tones &amp; highlights,\\&quot; but there are definitely still contrasts, and I also worried it would be dull but it is very shiny &amp; soft.  I wash my hair every day, and I have a feeling this shade will hit its \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; in about a week, but it&#x27;s flashy and fun for now!</li>
            <li> My color came out very well and everyone seems to love it too. I used the conditioner that came with it and had no problems, I&#x27;m not sure why others had so many issues but thankfully it wasn&#x27;t so in my case. This is a reorder for me most definitely. If you have grey I would recommend keeping it on for a longer period of time. I have some grey and while it blends in nicely I can tell because it&#x27;s not as dark as the other hair.</li>
            <li> I found this product about 7 months ago.  it&#x27;s the exact color result I had been looking for.  I&#x27;ve been using permanent dye for years and wasn&#x27;t getting a consitant color for whatever reasons.  After doing research it occurred to me that all i was really after was having a red ontop of my natural shade.  After buying a box of this brand I called the company to double check something (something I do when ever I switch brands now because of bad experiences) and I was actually told that this product is NOT recommended for use over permante hair dye.  (not just henna and metalics like it says on the leaflet).  that they recommend you wait until your hair grows out before use.  And that they can&#x27;t guarentee it won&#x27;t cause hair breakage if used over past permanent hair dyes.  So for a few months the box sat unused.  I ended up trying it anyway, I LOVE the color.  It&#x27;s the best red I&#x27;ve been able to find and it&#x27;s consistant.      HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve had to buy a much better conditioner in order to continue to use the product.  if I don&#x27;t my hair becomes too dry and has more breakage.  i can&#x27;t stop dying my hair but don&#x27;t want to continue to wreck my roots if I don&#x27;t have to, So I am continueing with this product vs a level 3.  The hair that was never dyed with permant color (6 months of roots and bangs) is soft and not dry at all.  So even though it doesn&#x27;t say it on the package the company recommends this for natural hair, call them and see for yourself.  However with the right hair care you can still use this product.</li>
            <li> Why do products have to change and \\&quot;improve\\&quot;?  Here&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like:  The color part is okay, the 2 week enhancer part is TERRIBLE.  You wash it in, wait 5 minutes, rinse.  It turned my hair and scalp orange (I used Nutmeg #28), it didn&#x27;t cover the gray roots or where my hair had bleached out from the sun AT ALL.  It was like I poured an orange popsicle on my head.  And the smell was really strong, not in a good way. The next morning I washed my hair and the shampoo turned orange, the whole thing washed away (YAY).  I will be throwing away the 2 week touch-up pack.</li>
            <li> The name is misleading. \\&quot;Auburn brown\\&quot; means reddish brown. This is almost tomato red. Nothing brown about it. Went to the trash. Worst color I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> The very first time I dyed my hair was 7 or 8 years ago and I used Cinnaberry. I loved it so much I have NEVER even tried another hair dye since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really affordable and a great value for the price. I have really long (almost to the bottom of my back) curly, thick hair and one bottle is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is really easy and the directions are clear and understandable. I am able to dye my hair alone with this, versus needing somebody else&#x27;s help. It smells really great while dyeing, and afterwards, too. While walking around with the dye setting, my boyfriend commented I smelled \\&quot;like blueberries.\\&quot; - It&#x27;s not chemical smelling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium to dark brown and this makes it slightly darker in areas, but really well lit in other areas. It catches flashes of red, gold, and browns - really making it an interesting color. I always get compliments on it. I also like that it is a 28 day wash out b/c it just fades away over time, instead of making root touch ups and maintenance necessary. It has always lasted in my hair about 6 weeks, though. Perhaps b/c I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, but I&#x27;ve found it really holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your hair REALLY shiny and silky. I have curly, coarse hair and it&#x27;s usually it&#x27;s healthiest after I&#x27;ve dyed it with this and used the enclosed conditioner. They give you enough for multiple shampoos, also, which is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can think of is that it is impossible to \\&quot;rinse until water runs clear.\\&quot; This may result in some light colored towels or pillowcases to have some slight staining. But that&#x27;s to be expected with any wash out haircolor - right? I just put aside some of our raggedy linens for the dyeing process so nothing good gets ruined.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair color for 4 years (formerly 22) and I get so many compliments on the color of my hair.  Easy to apply and the color looks fabulous!</li>
            <li> Great color for the price; looks fab w fair skin</li>
            <li> A little too dark, but works for me. I wish Clairol natural instincts was more consistent with their products . they regularly  discontinue or rename colors , which creates problems for old customers.</li>
            <li> I live off the grid, and still have fun playing with hair color. Getting it is hard, so I was tickled to find I could order it (3 box package) from Amazon. I received it timely and intact. Great price for the lot and it&#x27;s the real deal, too!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past and love the color.  I&#x27;ll buy it again when I need to retouch.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and results in silky, shiny, wonderful smelling hair.  No scalp irritation or uneven color. Works like a charm and is very easy to apply. I love it!</li>
            <li> very fast delivery and very pleased with the product awesome deal</li>
            <li> Very good product. I have been using it for over 15 years. I love the color. I get a lot of compliments on how good the color looks with my coloring. I&#x27;m just upset that i can&#x27;t get it in the store i work for. Walgreens no longer carries this color.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair and I love this color because it doesn&#x27;t look like a drastic, noticeable color change.  I don&#x27;t like using permanent color as it leaves the roots looking too obvious if you don&#x27;t touch up the color in a timely manner.  Natural Instincts fades out of your hair pretty much all over consistently. The price is great too compared to the retail store cost.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for years.  I have naturally dark blonde hair.  I use Natural Instincts to get rid of my gray every 2 months or so.  Normally I stick to the blonde or light brown colors.  They fade really quickly though.  From sun and the pool my hair was lighter than normal but I wanted to change it up, so I tried Cinnaberry, a auburn shade.  I probably should not have tried it on the blondish hair.  At first it was a bright reddish, pink color.  And...there wasn&#x27;t really enough in the bottle to cover all my hair.  My hair is a little pass shoulder length and is a medium thickness, so one bottle should be plenty.  It was patchy in areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, red doesn&#x27;t hold well in my hair and after 3 washes and swimming in the pool, it is now a normal looking red color, though still splotchy.  I&#x27;d recommend this for brunettes and if you have longer than shoulder length hair, get two boxes.  One thing I love about Natural Instincts is that it does wash out and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried something new and it didn&#x27;t work out so well for me.  I&#x27;ll stick to my blonde and light brown shades from now on.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001E5EC72 Clairol Natural Instincts Hair Color 28, Nutmeg, Dark Brown 1 Kit (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product! It is easily applied and the results last for weeks. My hair is almost all grey and I was spending a ton on salon (Aveda) coloring. This product gives me as good a result and I don&#x27;t have to schedule an appointment!</li>
            <li> After years of using this I&#x27;ve realized that \\&quot;semi-permanent\\&quot; and \\&quot;no ammonia\\&quot; (or is it \\&quot;no peroxide\\&quot;??) does not mean \\&quot;no damage\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s not as damaging as permanent hair color, but my longer hair is giving up the ghost, it&#x27;s like an overstretched rubber band, awful split ends and won&#x27;t hold color.  I do have delicate hair and maybe someone with thicker hair strands would not have this issue, but I can no longer use this product.</li>
            <li> After reading all the older reviews I think I have a more updated color kit.  It had no 15 day refresher (which really sounded terrible from the reviewers), but it did have the nice conditioner.  Since I have some gray I left it on for 15 minutes, instead of 10, and it was pretty easy compared to past colorings.  I had a dickens of a time rinsing it out, though.  My hair got so wooley and stuck together that I couldn&#x27;t move it much.  When the water looked clear I applied the conditioner and then rinsed.  As I stepped out of the shower I saw drops of light tan falling.  I really could not have rinsed it more than I did.  So, I am pleased with the color, though shocked because I have never been a redhead.  My husband picked this out for me and he is quite pleased, also.  Photo posted.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and do what ever I can to find out if somethings worth buying .  I even looked at youtube video reviewers and google images to figure out whether or not to buy this product .  I ordered Cinnaberry and for a second I was set on returning it because as soon as I opened the box, I saw it wasn&#x27;t the right color. It said cinnaberry but the color looked dark brown! Online the picture is clearly auburn . I&#x27;m very disappointed. In my youtube research though I found that the color is similar to what I was hoping for on others, the problem is that they all had blonde hair when they dyed it . I have dark brown hair... I hope it turns out SOMEWHAT similar !</li>
            <li> I like this product and though it is labeled semi-permanent, it is quite long lasting.  I wish they would print expiration dates on it.  In the past I have purchased hard to find shades in packages that were too old.  The plastic bottle becomes brittle and cracks in your hands as you squeeze it, what a mess! This has happened to me too many times, so I don&#x27;t order \\&quot;retired\\&quot; colors anymore.</li>
            <li> I wanted to add some reddish dark brown spice to my hair for some flair. My hair is naturally dark brown, but was a lighter brown due to highlights and previous color. I followed the instructions, and while it was on my hair I was excited because it looked like a \\&quot;Dr. Pepper\\&quot; color. However, when I rinsed and dried my hair, I almost fell over when I looked in the mirror. And it was worse the next day when I was driving and the sunlight hit my hair. I looked like BOZO the clown!!! I kept trying to convince myself that it was just \\&quot;different\\&quot; for me and maybe that was the problem. However, I finally had to admit that it was not at all attractive and was disgusting!! I have read reviews from several other people who have had the same problem. Do NOT use this product if you are expecting the color on the box, because you will not get that result. If you want bozo the clown colored hair, then I recommend this product.! Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Perfect color, 10 minutes in hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out in clumps after I dye it like with other coloring products. Not too red and not too orange. Very natural and my hair looks GREAT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big user of Natural Instincts. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 5 years. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed over the years, the colors aren&#x27;t really accurate anymore. I once used a &#x27;Medium cool Brown&#x27;, and it turned my hair a VERY Dark Brown, which everyone said it looked Black. It took me a couple of weeks to fade it. I also tried the Black once, which got permanently stuck in my hair, for some reason. It was the 28 shampoo&#x27;s,  but it absolutely would NOT fade. I had to end up getting it bleached out, which damaged my hair like crazy. Recently, I gave it another shot and used the Raspberry Creme 23R, and OMG - my hair was fireball RED. It was supposed to make a pretty toned down &#x27;Auburn&#x27; type color, but NOPE. My hair was RED. It stained everything. My hands, face, neck, pillow cases/etc. It took me two weeks to fade it, which as of right now it&#x27;s a very ugly Orange/Brassy color. I&#x27;m going to be going to a stylist to get it covered with a Medium Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed by how the products have changed. I&#x27;ve also noticed the colors do not make my hair shiny/smooth like they once did. :/ For the most part, though, if you want a pretty Black, or Dark Brown - I do recommend this product. The darker colors are much more flattering than the lighter ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO - I would NOT use the 2 weeks re-freshener they add. As everyone else stated, it DOES turn your hair a Red/Orange tint. I used it when I had the dark Brown, and my roots were completely Reddish. It did not match my hair at all, so I had to go buy another box of dye, and touch my roots up..Which still made them a Red tint. It was horrible.</li>
            <li> Have been buying this color and brand for years. Got tired of going store to store looking for the right color and started ordering on line. Always satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I ordered a package of 3. When I rec&#x27;d the order, one box of the product was so damaged that the &amp;#34;developer&amp;#34; lotion had spilled inside the box. I had to throw it out. As a result, I paid for 3 boxes of this product but rec&#x27;d only 2 I could use.</li>
            <li> I agree with those who say the new formula is horrible. I have been using this color Cinnaberry for at least 15 years. It was my go to color if I was feeling like a change. The most recent application left my hair clown red and horribly dry. Dont even touch the refresher packet becasue that is a joke. It totally changes the color and makes it even more orange! It used to last me a few weeks before fading. It lasted a week and started to fade. I dont know why they have to change formulas. If it isnt broke Clairol, dont fix it. I did my research and found a color that is exactly like the old Cinnaberry. Garnier Herba shine 565 Med Auburn Brown. It looks like the old color is supposed to and is shiny and ammonia free!</li>
            <li> Clairol Natural Instincts 22 Cinnaberry Medium Auburn Brown is an AWESOME red! I actually saw a review in some magazine that said that Clairol&#x27;s Natural Instincts 22 was one of the best otc red hair colors out there. I concur. I&#x27;ve tried most of the brands but I am a loyal customer now that I&#x27;ve tried this a few times. The color lasts a full 6-9 weeks, (although be careful, it does run for the first several hair washes!) I have bought the 3 pack twice now and intend to keep buying it. Because my hair is very long I use one and a half of the kits to get the best coverage.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years. Consistent quality.</li>
            <li> My store stopped carrying this color so I went online to purchase.  Great price and my favorite color!  Two of the three boxes were stained on the outside and when opened, the color had leaked out a bit and stained all of the bottles inside as well as the outside of the box.  Still worked but a pain to clean everything.</li>
            <li> The box is true to the color.  Easy to apply and last long enough for me to be happy with the results.</li>
