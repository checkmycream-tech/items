            <li>I really love this product!!!</li>
            <li>Great item would order from them again.</li>
            <li>This is a great item to have and I always have one plus another one.</li>
            <li>I will though, and I am sure it will be great!</li>
            <li>Save your money and get a good one.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any good information on how often to treat my skin.  </li>
            <li>This would be a good product for maintaining a facelift.</li>
            <li>works great, cheap.  </li>
            <li>Now why i really think this micro needler is awesome b/c</li>
            <li>I beg the manufacture of this item to go try it on your own skin-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it for my stretch marks on my stomach and have used it twice which is more than the recommended amount (once every 3 weeks)</li>
            <li>it breaks up the scar tissue and penetrates the skin and allows so much more absortion.</li>
            <li>I do it more than just 6 directions.</li>
            <li>but truthfully I have not seen any noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>and i labeled them my self since I won&#x27;t be able to tell which is which.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>After trial-and-error, I determined that ten days is the best time between treatments for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the time between usage would depend on a person&#x27;s age.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my scalp, and it does hurt a bit, but it does work as intended and helps liquid lotions /supplements to permeate the skin better.</li>
            <li>I also am using Sweet Bee Magic Cream and Bio Oil in addition to using the roller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean and has a container to keep it clean and safe.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t do was clean it before I used it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product for keeping the skin tight and youthful looking.  </li>
            <li>I clean my face and hands with a mild soap and water.  </li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s not painful unless too much pressure is applied but</li>
            <li>I put Bee Magic on my skin prior to use, I roll the roller in the direction shown in the directions.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I first checked on YouTube to get some information on its use.  </li>
            <li>I use both rollers, using the 2.0 mm roller first.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know of anything short of a facelift that could do more.  </li>
            <li>540 needles is too many because it actually prevents any of them from being able to enter the skin properly- at a vertical angle.</li>
            <li>the next needle hits too soon- touching the skin at an angle- causing it to rip a slit in the skin rather than poke a hole.</li>
            <li>After each rolling I douse the area with pure collagen, retinol, coconut oil, and/or vitamin e oil.</li>
            <li>When I use the product, I take a hot shower to open up my pores, I clean the roller in rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>but it is great any area where you skin is really thin like your scalp or forehead.</li>
            <li>Ok not great chemical peals work better</li>
            <li>I have dark scars mostly on my legs from a flea infestation, in which my roommates were not treating their pets.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The older one is, the longer one should wait between treatments.  </li>
            <li>Works about 6 months, then time to replace it with new needles.</li>
            <li>I am not sure this made my lotions work any better.</li>
            <li>These needles are far too close together and blunt to do anything to you except scar you permanently.</li>
            <li>After it seems not so sensitive</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes me 45 minutes to complete the process.  </li>
            <li>After completely treating my face and neck, I apply a skin serum and repeat the complete process again while the serum is still on my face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash off the serum when I complete the procedure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good concept that fails to work as intended.</li>
            <li>Now I have rows of fine white lines running up and down my arm!</li>
            <li>I do this before bedtime, but there have been a couple times when I&#x27;ve had an unexpected social event afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I realized afterwards that how the rollers are used depends almost completely on the individual.  </li>
            <li>The needles are so close that the slit ripping action causes the slits to merge into a single slice- with one slice per row of needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I thoroughly treat my face and neck by rolling over the same area at least twice in different directions.  </li>
            <li> It helps with minor wrinkles as well as scars and dark skin spots.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after about a month of using it</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works great, cheap.  i just ordered my second one.  Works about 6 months, then time to replace it with new needles.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this you will be disappointed. Bitterly disappointed. These needles are far too close together and blunt to do anything to you except scar you permanently. Save your money and get a good one. That wouldn&#x27;t be this one.</li>
            <li> Another gift item the user is not impressed with.  He says it&#x27;s not painful unless too much pressure is applied but also he sees no benefit from using it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!!! I was skeptical at first but after about a month of using it I can see the difference already. I&#x27;m using it for my stretch marks on my stomach and have used it twice which is more than the recommended amount (once every 3 weeks) but I have really bad ones and felt like they healed enough in between uses. Now why i really think this micro needler is awesome b/c it breaks up the scar tissue and penetrates the skin and allows so much more absortion. After each rolling I douse the area with pure collagen, retinol, coconut oil, and/or vitamin e oil. The following several days I do the same. After it seems not so sensitive I use bio oil daily. I know this is a slow process people but alls we have is time!</li>
            <li> Just as described. I have not actually used it yet as I have not mustered the nerve. I will though, and I am sure it will be great!</li>
            <li> I have dark scars mostly on my legs from a flea infestation, in which my roommates were not treating their pets.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the twice already, and my scars and stretch marks are diminishing. I do not think that they would go away after two uses (I had read several reviews in which that was the case for some users), but I assume my scars are darker. I also am using Sweet Bee Magic Cream and Bio Oil in addition to using the roller. I am taking biotin supplements to help with my hair, skin, and nails. I do know that Vitamin C helps in the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;This product DOES NOT HURT ME, NOR DOES IT DRAW BLOOD. It is uncomfortable on bony areas, and on the tops of my feet, and on my elbows. When I use the product, I take a hot shower to open up my pores, I clean the roller in rubbing alcohol. I put Bee Magic on my skin prior to use, I roll the roller in the direction shown in the directions. I do it more than just 6 directions. I vary over and over in my rolling in one spot. I put triple antibiotic ointment on each area after rolling and let the creams soak into my skin before dressing. I give myself a few days in between use to let my body a chance to heal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic but truthfully I have not seen any noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I think this micro needle product serves it&#x27;s purpose. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean and has a container to keep it clean and safe. However, I have bought these in 3 different sizes and i labeled them my self since I won&#x27;t be able to tell which is which. No size indication on the needle or container.</li>
            <li> I got used to the tingling!</li>
            <li> I bought this for acne scares on my cheeks which it is not good for but it is great any area where you skin is really thin like your scalp or forehead.</li>
            <li> Great item would order from them again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure this made my lotions work any better.</li>
            <li> Ok not great chemical peals work better</li>
            <li> I love it.  It really works!</li>
            <li> Lots of tiny needles. Roller is a bit squeaky. I&#x27;m not religious on using it daily because it can be painful.</li>
            <li> This is a great item to have and I always have one plus another one. It helps with minor wrinkles as well as scars and dark skin spots. I have found that if I use bag balm immediately after using it lessens the discomfort as well as gives a quicker healing process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for six months now.  I first checked on YouTube to get some information on its use.  I didn&#x27;t get any good information on how often to treat my skin.  I realized afterwards that how the rollers are used depends almost completely on the individual.  After trial-and-error, I determined that ten days is the best time between treatments for me.  This shouldn&#x27;t be used daily simply because time is needed to heal the skin and develop collagen.  I&#x27;m sure the time between usage would depend on a person&#x27;s age.  The older one is, the longer one should wait between treatments.  I&#x27;m past sixty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes me 45 minutes to complete the process.  Before I start, I run isopropyl alcohol over the roller to sterilize it.  I clean my face and hands with a mild soap and water.  I then numb my skin with a cream and wait about ten minutes before using the rollers.  I don&#x27;t wash off the numbing cream.  I do six back and forth motions before moving to the next area of my face.  I thoroughly treat my face and neck by rolling over the same area at least twice in different directions.  I take care around the eyes to roll in very short strokes.  After completely treating my face and neck, I apply a skin serum and repeat the complete process again while the serum is still on my face.  I don&#x27;t wash off the serum when I complete the procedure.  I have two rollers that have 1.5 mm and 2.0 mm needles.  I use both rollers, using the 2.0 mm roller first.  I run alcohol over the rollers when finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never drawn blood and only turn mildly pink when everything is done.  The pinkness goes away in a couple hours.  I do this before bedtime, but there have been a couple times when I&#x27;ve had an unexpected social event afterwards.  No one noticed that my skin was pinker than usual shortly following my treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have serious wrinkles before using the rollers.  Since using the rollers, my face and my neck look like I&#x27;m no more than in my forties.  I was starting to develop flabbiness in my neck and that&#x27;s now gone.  It&#x27;s a very good product for keeping the skin tight and youthful looking.  I don&#x27;t know of anything short of a facelift that could do more.  This would be a good product for maintaining a facelift.</li>
            <li> I did it wrong (or I think I did). Ended up with a serious rash that lasted quite a while. What I didn&#x27;t do was clean it before I used it.  Thought it would have been sterile just coming out of the box.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY !!! IT WILL SLICE YOUR SKIN AND SCAR YOU!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING- This doesn&#x27;t work at all-  540 needles is too many because it actually prevents any of them from being able to enter the skin properly- at a vertical angle. And triangle shaped needles causes it to make slices - not fine holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needles close together doesn&#x27;t work because as you roll it- the next needle hits too soon- touching the skin at an angle- causing it to rip a slit in the skin rather than poke a hole. The needles are so close that the slit ripping action causes the slits to merge into a single slice- with one slice per row of needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is a row of slices. I tested it on my inner arm- rolling it about 7 inches from inside by my elbow towards my wrist. I tried with no pressure- and it rolled over the surface of the skin doing nothing at all. I applied just a little pressure- rolling back and forth 3 times like they show in videos and it instantly left the rows of parallel slices- looking like a cat had scratched me (with both paws at once)Perfect lines of bleeding skin that took a week to heal. Did it leave a scar? YES! Now I have rows of fine white lines running up and down my arm! What if I tried it on my face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good concept that fails to work as intended. I beg the manufacture of this item to go try it on your own skin- then you&#x27;ll know why it MUST BE REMOVED FROM THE MARKET ASAP!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the derma roller.  I use it on my scalp, and it does hurt a bit, but it does work as intended and helps liquid lotions /supplements to permeate the skin better.</li>
