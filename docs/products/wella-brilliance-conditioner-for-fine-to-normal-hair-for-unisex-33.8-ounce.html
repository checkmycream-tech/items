            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> When it feels empty, you can take a razor and cut it open and you&#x27;ll find a ton of product left hanging in the openings and corners of the bottle.</li>

            <li> My hair is so thick that it weighs itself down on the top, so conditioner just makes it worse.  </li>

            <li> I actually have rather thick hair.  </li>

            <li> Love Wella my Aunt is a high profile hairdresser in Nashville and I grew up using Wella Conditioner, well worth the money</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It&#x27;s very light and allows my hair to detangle without feeling greasy and weighed down.</li>

            <li> Love how this stuff works and smells! I&#x27;ve read a couple reviews that when they&#x27;ve received theirs it looked maybe old or chunky. Well this last  time when I got my order it looked like cottage cheese and was grossed out. My thinking is that at some point in shipping it got hot. So I dumped it in a large  bowl and took a mixer on high speed and good as new! Had to work at getting it back in the bottle some with a funnel but for me... This stuff is worth it! There&#x27;s not much that can be done to prevent that from ever occurring and was the only time I&#x27;ve had it like that so I still gave it 5 stars. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years and won&#x27;t buy anything else.  It makes my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Have been very pleased with this product.  Have been using the shampoo for a year.  It makes hair soft and holds color so decided to also purchase the conditioner.  My salon uses ithese products and is the only place that sells it as it isn&#x27;t available in retail except from Amazon.  Great price and value.</li>
            <li> I keep buying this stuff! it makes my hair soft and shiny at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Great product. Better than described! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I loved this shampoo and conditioner. I color my hair and needed a product to add moisture and shine, which Wella did. An added bonus is that it smells good.</li>
            <li> If I could give 0 stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if there is a misunderstanding from the item description, but it clearly says &amp;#34; Wella Brilliance Conditioner for Fine To Normal Hair for Unisex, 33.8 Ounce &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a LEAKING 8.4 Ounce TUBE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed and hope that this will be sorted out. Otherwise, I am going to return the product.</li>
            <li> nothing to write home about, was hoping for more.  Its as good as suave, no more - no less.  Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Wife loves it/ When she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy. Good product !!</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my hair feel great but it smells wonderful!!  This conditioner is awesome, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have fine hair.  I actually have rather thick hair.  My stylist recommended it because of my dye.  The beauty of this conditioner is that it makes one&#x27;s hair sooooo smooth, but it does not weigh it down at all.  My hair is so thick that it weighs itself down on the top, so conditioner just makes it worse.  However, conditioner is necessary if I want to get a comb through my hair at all.  I used Paul Mitchell for years, and Wella just tops it!  I&#x27;m converted!</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner and well worth the price to get it in bulk like this. The bottle it comes in is pretty heavy and slippery and just not comfortable for every day use, so I recommend transferring the product into a smaller bottle. When it feels empty, you can take a razor and cut it open and you&#x27;ll find a ton of product left hanging in the openings and corners of the bottle. I wish this kind of product comes in a toothpaste like tube, instead of a bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this with the matching shampoo for my long, color treated hair. It leaves my hair smooth and not weighed down. I wish the big bottles came with a pump, but at least I can get it here--I&#x27;ve never found this product in stores--thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wella shampoo and conditioner for a few months now, and I will never go back to anything else!  These products are top notch for color-treated hair, and my hair has been so much healthier as a result of these products.</li>
            <li> Been using for awhile vey happy with the product.</li>
