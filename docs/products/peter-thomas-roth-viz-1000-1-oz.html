    <ol>
            <li>This product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>PTR has great products.  </li>
            <li>I have been on a hunt for a good hydrating serum for months now.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I like that serum</li>
            <li>I continued my search for good serum that hopefully could change my condition.</li>
            <li>I love almost all of Peter Thomas Roth products!</li>
            <li>How amazing is that?!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>That is quite a reliable sacle of my own to test whether the stuff worked or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just an okay product.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am only 25 and worried that this product was mostly for anti-aging but it is the best moisturizer I have ever tried!  </li>
            <li>I really love about this stuff</li>
            <li>Overall, an AWESOME product.</li>
            <li>I love, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and it really smells so good</li>
            <li>It made my skin look younger, and it brought a beautiful glow and texture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worthy the money!</li>
            <li>Clinique has their new hydro-gel, which has a similar function and is more affordable; but this is the best.</li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles were much smoother and my skin felt more supple.  </li>
            <li>It is the exact same thing and it arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>much as I love this stuff, I have found that generic Hyaluronic Acid, such as can be found here on Amazon, is just as effective for a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It dries super fast</li>
            <li>I love Viz-1000 because I just turned 40 and am starting to notice deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It goes on every morning first thing before any makeup to keep my face hydrated but not oily.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it has the hyaluronic acid in it makes it so much better than a regular moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Light enough for a moisturizer in deep summer, but really more of a support system.  </li>
            <li>I feel that this really \\&quot;plumps\\&quot; up my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see ANY difference after using this product.</li>
            <li>This product helps absorb the moisturizer and really works.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working, can&#x27;t really tell any difference</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also have very problematic acne-prone</li>
            <li>My face is looking much clearer</li>
            <li>I am a new follower of Roth&#x27;s skincare.</li>
            <li>Finally, I think I found it--this Peter Thomas Roth serum really works!</li>
            <li>Well, the first night was noticablely different and by 3 days, my face was entirely clear and hydrated feeling.  </li>
            <li>but I got a sample and after just a few days I have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very pricy and compared to others-even coconut oil, this doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well or as long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and have seen a major difference.</li>
            <li>I barely drink water, but this skin quencher was suggested to me and I&#x27;ll keep on reordering it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 39 year old female who actually became like a teenager again with breakout prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I researched long and far for a hydrating step between cleaning and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Almost all the peely, dry patches are completely gone.  </li>

            <li> I sometimes use a light moiturizer in the mornings over it also if I am feeling a little drier that usual.  </li>
            <li> I use only the smallest amount - it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> After one single application ( with Everyhing else being the same), I did not feel the need to put on a mist, adding some refreshment, or skincare items.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this to anyone who strugles with dry skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not SUPER moisturizing as other people say (I live in Denver @</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I still got this tight feeling on my face about 2 hours later of my skin routine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive, but if you can splurge, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of this stuff goes a really long way too.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few other serums that cost less, but I keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li> So on the one hand I&#x27;m trying to combat pimples and on the other worried about anti aging.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wasn&#x27;t expecting change in fine lines/wrinkles or anything, I just hoped it did what it claimes--hydrating, so at least I would like to see some dehydrated skin condition go away.</li>
            <li> I use moturizers every morning and night and sometimes heavier ones at night but my nose and a few other areas are almost always dry and peeling.  </li>
            <li> so I expect this bottle to last me at least a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that based on the the product description, following the directions and using the product consistently for a week, I saw NO benefit whatsover.</li>
            <li> A little bit of it under moisturizer cuts out all the winter chapping</li>
            <li> Waste of money....</li>
            <li> Press it into slightly moist skin, et voila!</li>
            <li> I have the weird problem that when my skin is dry, it breaks out.  </li>
            <li> But after 3 bottles of use, sadly I have not seen any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> If you needa boost of hydration in addition to your usual moisturizer, then this is it!!!!  </li>

            <li> This product sells in stores for about $60.  It is the exact same thing and it arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.  PTR has great products.  I love Viz-1000 because I just turned 40 and am starting to notice deeper wrinkles.  I feel that this really \\&quot;plumps\\&quot; up my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of the serum to cover my face so I expect this bottle to last me at least a couple of months.  Definitely recommend this product and this seller.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It made my skin look younger, and it brought a beautiful glow and texture. It&#x27;s worthy the money!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything at all.... saw it online and thought I HAD to have it. Waste of money....</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive, but if you can splurge, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.  A little bit of it under moisturizer cuts out all the winter chapping I&#x27;d have otherwise.  Light enough for a moisturizer in deep summer, but really more of a support system.  Clinique has their new hydro-gel, which has a similar function and is more affordable; but this is the best.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see ANY difference after using this product. I was disappointed that based on the the product description, following the directions and using the product consistently for a week, I saw NO benefit whatsover. I wish I had my money back!</li>
            <li> I love almost all of Peter Thomas Roth products! This product helps absorb the moisturizer and really works. You can see a difference almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working, can&#x27;t really tell any difference but it&#x27;s only been a month or so.</li>
            <li> Just an okay product. Very pricy and compared to others-even coconut oil, this doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well or as long.</li>
            <li> I tried a few other serums that cost less, but I keep coming back to this one.  This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this stuff. It goes on every morning first thing before any makeup to keep my face hydrated but not oily.  That being said, the price is still WAY too high.&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love this stuff, I have found that generic Hyaluronic Acid, such as can be found here on Amazon, is just as effective for a much more reasonable price. Will be purchasing that instead in the future</li>
            <li> I am only 25 and worried that this product was mostly for anti-aging but it is the best moisturizer I have ever tried!  I have extremely dry skin.  I use moturizers every morning and night and sometimes heavier ones at night but my nose and a few other areas are almost always dry and peeling.  I also have very problematic acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to try this because of the cost but I got a sample and after just a few days I have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin.  Almost all the peely, dry patches are completely gone.  My face is looking much clearer also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really love about this stuff is it isn&#x27;t like a regular moisturizer.  It dries super fast and I doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or shiny throughout the day.  I sometimes use a light moiturizer in the mornings over it also if I am feeling a little drier that usual.  (I like [[ASIN:B000GX4BSS Murad Skin Perfecting Lotion, 3: Hydrate/Protect, 1.7 fl oz (50 ml)]])  A little bit of this stuff goes a really long way too.  I got a tiny sample from Sephora and used it 2x a day and it lasted over a week.  Definitely recommend this to anyone who strugles with dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have been on a hunt for a good hydrating serum for months now. Before I found this, I was on my 3rd bottle of Caudalie&#x27;s SOS thirst quenching serum. To be fair, I like that serum and it really smells so good that everytime I apply it I feel as if I am in a spa. But after 3 bottles of use, sadly I have not seen any change in my skin. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I wasn&#x27;t expecting change in fine lines/wrinkles or anything, I just hoped it did what it claimes--hydrating, so at least I would like to see some dehydrated skin condition go away. But no. I still got this tight feeling on my face about 2 hours later of my skin routine. That is quite a reliable sacle of my own to test whether the stuff worked or not.&lt;br /&gt;So I continued my search for good serum that hopefully could change my condition. Finally, I think I found it--this Peter Thomas Roth serum really works! After one single application ( with Everyhing else being the same), I did not feel the need to put on a mist, adding some refreshment, or skincare items. How amazing is that?!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another one today just in case this sale ends sometime soon.</li>
            <li> If you needa boost of hydration in addition to your usual moisturizer, then this is it!!!!  I have the weird problem that when my skin is dry, it breaks out.  Well, the first night was noticablely different and by 3 days, my face was entirely clear and hydrated feeling.  Fine lines and wrinkles were much smoother and my skin felt more supple.  Overall, an AWESOME product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s not SUPER moisturizing as other people say (I live in Denver @ 5800 ft) but it is moisturizing enough without causing acne.  The fact that it has the hyaluronic acid in it makes it so much better than a regular moisturizer.  Worth the money, and it&#x27;s so much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I researched long and far for a hydrating step between cleaning and moisturizing.  The Viz-1000 proved to be the element I needed for dewey hydrated skin.  I use only the smallest amount - it goes a long way.  Press it into slightly moist skin, et voila!</li>
            <li> I love, love this stuff.  I&#x27;m a 39 year old female who actually became like a teenager again with breakout prone skin.  So on the one hand I&#x27;m trying to combat pimples and on the other worried about anti aging.  This stuff has an acid in it that helps to combat my breakouts but at the same time puts a lot of moisture into my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now and have seen a major difference.</li>
            <li> I am a new follower of Roth&#x27;s skincare. I barely drink water, but this skin quencher was suggested to me and I&#x27;ll keep on reordering it.</li>
            <li> Products was all that it was described and delivered promptly.</li>
