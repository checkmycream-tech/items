            <li>Great blades, good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice product!</li>
            <li>I love this razor, the blades are the best.</li>
            <li>I love 5 blades, it works perfect to me.</li>
            <li>The razor heads are a great deal on Amazon, the price was great for that many and the quality was still there.</li>
            <li>I also loved that my legs were still moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck with the Kiss</li>
            <li>The razor blades themselves are good.</li>
            <li>I was thinking that 4 is good</li>
            <li>Provides a good close shave.</li>
            <li>it is just as good as I remembered.....</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Good  close shave without irritation</li>
            <li>This is really good.</li>
            <li>They do a good job which lasts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of disposables, this razor is a nice sleek finish, infused shaving gel is a great time saver..</li>
            <li>My wife never had a good razor and always used those Bic disposable ones.</li>
            <li>so this is a really good buy.</li>
            <li>The design on the handle provides good grip and comfort.</li>
            <li>but they do work and the price is good</li>
            <li>I bought this and the razor system for my daughter telling her how much I loved them.</li>

            <li>and you will be very glad you did.</li>
            <li>I have this on the delivery system and am very glad.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my item.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely Love it GREAT</li>
            <li>Delivery was great and the razor refills arrived safely and intact.</li>
            <li>I got my wonderful campaign box in the mail and started using it right away as we are supposed to with the campaigns.</li>
            <li>Nice price, great quality, my wife love it</li>
            <li>Love the razor !  </li>
            <li>I remember the bit on MADtv about adding like 20 blades to a razor to make it more effective (the Spishak Mach20!)</li>
            <li>These are my favorite razors!</li>
            <li>Also, Schick is a way better value!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>These razors are the absolute best.</li>
            <li>excellent product works as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Best razor on the market and lasts much longer than others.</li>
            <li>Still looking for an ideal and economical way to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I liked this razor a lot</li>
            <li>I got this from BazzAgent, and I really liked it</li>
            <li>The 5 blades are nice, but I have found without the conditioning stuff, I have to use shaving gel</li>
            <li>I got to try this through the website buzzagent in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely felt like it&#x27;s the best razor</li>
            <li>These are reasonable, give a close shave, and leave me with the smoothest legs - perfect for summer!</li>
            <li>I normally wouldn&#x27;t write an amazon review for something like that, but I am just so impressed by this blade.</li>
            <li>the blades did a good job, didn&#x27;t rust easy, and I had no irritation while using them.</li>
            <li>Best little product ever... easy to use and the best results yet.</li>
            <li>Good deal and quick to my door shipping!</li>
            <li>I received these for free and I really loved these.</li>
            <li>this is by far the very best.</li>
            <li>but these razors have been the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li>I really love these razor refills and they&#x27;re so nice to use.</li>
            <li>But the Hydro Silk has this water activated moisturizer (kind of like the conditioning strips on the Mach 3 blades but better).</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and love the handy shower suction cup for hanging it up when not in use.</li>
            <li>By far the best razor out there.</li>
            <li>These razors, both the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; are the best I have experienced for wherever you want to shave from the face, to the underarms and all the way down.  </li>
            <li>Daughter loves these refills as they provide her a very good shave and last a good time.</li>
            <li>So far, the Schick Hydro has been my favorite, even beating out the excellent Quattro.</li>
            <li>Great razor for a smooth shave, easy to use, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>I was glad I could shave my knees without getting cut.</li>
            <li>this is one of the best razor I have ever used to date, it makes my skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>and I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>and I just love it..</li>
            <li>Overall, awesome addition to the kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my favorite razors/refill blades.</li>
            <li>and I love these blades.</li>
            <li>Always love getting my purchases here.</li>
            <li>so 5 is better and that is not the case.  </li>
            <li>I actually ordered them for my GF but have found that they do the best job for keeping my head shaved.</li>
            <li>can you get me more for Christmas.</li>
            <li>that will top my experience with these.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love the Hydro Silk razor blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of razors and go back and forth on them, as nothing stood out as wonderful.</li>

            <li>My legs feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>not so I am glad I bought the razor and also refills,</li>
            <li>These are my favorite razors, I cannot shave with anything</li>
            <li>Omg I love the shick hydro silk I received it by being a bzzagent</li>
            <li>i love these razors</li>
            <li>even though they get really goopy and slimy they still provide a great shave</li>
            <li>especially if she uses Aveeno shaving cream with this razor... perfect</li>
            <li>better than gillette.</li>
            <li>I love the razor these blades are for, and I&#x27;m really glad to have found them for cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li>SO THAT THE BLADE PART IS ON THE BOTTOM, AND THE HANDLE IS ON THE TOP.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these razors.</li>
            <li>I love these blades, and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy them here than at Walmart.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite type of of razor.  </li>
            <li>I love these razor blades.</li>
            <li>Blades glide smoothly over the skin and it is the closest shave I have ever had!</li>
            <li>oh i do love these razors.</li>
            <li>Nice product, great for sensitive skin too.</li>

            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>The price is cheaper than most stores, so I&#x27;d get it off of amazon.</li>
            <li>These are better than Venus</li>
            <li>and I love these blades.</li>
            <li>Theyr&#x27;re better then</li>
            <li>I would love for Schick to come up with a newer/better razor with that in mind.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smoother and more moisturized after using the Schick Hydro Silk than after using the Venus blades.</li>
            <li>These are ok.</li>
            <li>I love these razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried what seems like a million razors and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the cheapest place I have been able to find them.</li>
            <li>Love Schick...</li>
            <li>My favorite razor.</li>
            <li>wife says blade better than the competition will start using them all the time have them on subscribe and save</li>
            <li>I think the the Schick Hydro Silk cartridges are okay.</li>
            <li>I also noticed using this razor seemed to be better withOUT shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now grown much more funder of it and</li>
            <li>like it more now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each blade can be used fairly many times, so this is what I also like about them.</li>
            <li>Love this razor-</li>
            <li>I like the refillable version better than the disposable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>Honestly, my legs have never been this silky smooth -</li>
            <li>On a whim I decided to try these, and am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love using these razor&#x27;s to shave my head</li>
            <li>Love the pivoting head.  </li>
            <li>I got a trial pack of these from the Vine program, I fell in love with them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from that, it&#x27;s a great razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My legs are super sensitive and prone to razor burn, this razor was perfect.</li>
            <li>So she was excited to get a slew of them from me!</li>
            <li>I thoroughly love getting a nice, smooth, clean shave with these razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Love them super close shave!</li>
            <li>My favorite razor, always smooth and non-irritating</li>
            <li>Good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I really like the Hydro Silk shaver and the razor refills are really good too.</li>
            <li>Fortunately in an night of curious desperation, they got the best of me, and I tried it out.</li>
            <li>Just Pogoplug with my wife came back to me and said OMG these raiders are so good they are so amazing</li>
            <li>The built in shaving serum makes it so easy to shave and not have to worry about getting cut.</li>
            <li>Thirty plus years of shaving pits and legs have never been so easy.</li>
            <li>The handle of the razor is easy to hold in the shower.</li>
            <li>(This was the main reason I didn&#x27;t like it as good at frist)</li>
            <li>Best razors I&#x27;ve ever used hands down</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs super moisturized!</li>
            <li>Updated Review - the Schick Hydro Silk Razor is the best system I have ever owned, and the refills are generally a few dollars cheaper than the Venus systems.</li>
            <li>My legs are SO smooth with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free to test &amp; review from INFLUENSTER</li>
            <li>Shaves close and smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this razor as a free sample when I placed an order from Walmart.</li>
            <li>, however amazing it is, gobs up in the blades too much.</li>
            <li>They last well, provide a close shave, and are great quality.</li>
            <li>these are great because the blades are so close together that it definitely reduces the chance of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They leave my legs silky and smooth</li>
            <li>and I found a way to get a couple of these free.</li>
            <li>Over the holiday season my wife was given a free sample of department store and I told her</li>
            <li>These refill blades are comfortable, give a close shave, and have a conditioning strip on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It all started with a free sample.</li>
            <li>No nicks, and a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The campaign I participated in gave me a free razor, and 3 refill blades.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>smooth-</li>
            <li>The Hydro Silk has a nice lubricating strip which lasts much longer than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I got a free one as a promo</li>
            <li>my skin is so smooth. ..</li>
            <li>Cheaper than Target and free shipping --</li>
            <li>The shave is smooth and my legs do not feel scraped.</li>
            <li>I know what a great razor can actually do.</li>
            <li>I received this razor free from bzzagent.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a babies</li>
            <li>overall a great product</li>
            <li>I used to just buy the razors that were most reasonably priced-- not the cheapest, but whatever 3 blade (or more)</li>
            <li>When combined with a good quality gel shave cream, they work better than anything else I have used and last up to a month, even with my steel wool-like face and body hair.</li>
            <li>They provide a decent shave but are definitely not the best shaving product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>She said, I already use them, they are my new favorite razor!</li>
            <li>These leave my legs super smooth and razor burn/knick free, all in one or two strokes</li>
            <li>These leave my legs super smooth and razor burn/knick free, all in one or two strokes</li>
            <li>great price, lasts long</li>
            <li>originally obtained this product via the Bzzagent word of mouth company for one of their campaigns.</li>
            <li>Great razors---last a long time.</li>
            <li>Rarely causes irritation, shaves close, never a nick!</li>
            <li>I tried it and wasn&#x27;t quite sure at first.</li>
            <li>So excited I was.</li>
            <li>(I am very prone to ingrowns no matter where it is I shave), no razor burn problems, really smooth, smoother longer than with the razors I had been using, and very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how you think you have something that works, only to discover something so much better.</li>
            <li>Great blades for a great razor - can&#x27;t go wrong with these.  </li>
            <li>Gives a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li>Solid razors-the 5 blades do good work.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite razor.</li>
            <li>but if in a hurry this razor will shave without either fairly well especially if it&#x27;s newer.</li>
            <li>They were received very quickly and exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used on my legs.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried every freaking razor on the market (including everything from Venus) and these are the best!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still try to get the best price, but I&#x27;ll buy this brand for sure, even if I could get &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; razors for several dollars less.</li>
            <li>Great Product and much cheaper than in local stores</li>
            <li>They actually leave a close shave leaving my skin nice a smooth.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer wears off rather quickly</li>
            <li>It leaves such a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>We can even get a couple more shaves from each blade than I normally would attempt.</li>
            <li>I like this razor a lot and happy to find the razors on Amazon for less.</li>
            <li>Occasionally, Amazon even has a coupon for them, so even better!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>but I still use longer since they are pretty pricey!  </li>
            <li>I use it most every day and have never had such a close, easy shave.</li>
            <li>It left my legs super soft and my skin happy.</li>
            <li>Trust me on that, it will help keep the water from collecting inside the blade locking mechanism, which will keep it nice and clean for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to replace the handle!</li>
            <li>I get a razor burn with each use but only from the ones I purchased on Amazon.com but the ones I purchased in the store are amazing.</li>
            <li>It was perfect for my sensitive skin and my legs stayed hydrated for a few hours...</li>
            <li>The razor glides smooth and the blade cuts very close.</li>
            <li>I really liked these cartridges and used to actually look forward to how gentle and smooth they WERE.</li>
            <li>Then, when I was able to pick up some Venus refill blades, I could tell a HUGE difference between shaving with the two different brands.</li>
            <li>it makes me smile every time I think about shaving my legs</li>
            <li>FInally a razor that I love and keeps my legs smooth</li>
            <li>then they&#x27;re well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s def worth the money I still use it and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of razors out there, this is by far my favorite one.</li>
            <li>I have used many kinds of razors over the years but none made me say WOW until this one.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this on my own</li>
            <li>These are by far my favorite razor blades.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I feel as though it needs to be marked more clearer on the razor itself and not just on the box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It dries out pretty quickly, even without use.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take this mom much to get excited about.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a shame because when you use it the first time, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this was just an off package but haven&#x27;t experienced this when purchasing in a store vs Amazon.</li>
            <li>I switched to Venus, and found the smaller lotion bar to be a bit better, but it still wasn&#x27;t as close a shave when they were brand new, and not as easy a shave when the lotion bar was almost gone.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, easy-glide, the lubrication in them lasts as long as the razor blade (most run out fast).</li>
            <li>I found the Intuition lost the soap surrounding very quickly, and when they were brand new they didn&#x27;t shave as well because of the large border.  </li>
            <li>I tried a disposable one that came as a gift with a different item I bought, and discovered that this is a waaay better razor than my Gillete that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li>After I tried Hyro Silk for the first time, I was sold.</li>
            <li>For years now I&#x27;ve been using the chick Hydro male version and I will love the results.</li>
            <li>and yes they last a while also where many others d</li>
            <li>I sure hope my husband doesn&#x27;t mind a second hand razor for himself!</li>
            <li>Prior to it, I was using the Schick Quatro, but I can safely say I won&#x27;t go back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blades last a long time and give a great shave.  </li>
            <li>This Schick has four separate blades, which is one more than my former favorite razor, which was also a Schick but only had three blades.</li>
            <li>This is the only razor that has ever made my legs feel this smooth!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They are definitely silky tho :)</li>
            <li>I get a consistent shave every time.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought 5 blades was overkill but trust me</li>
            <li>There is a little bar of lotion at the top of the blade cartridge that makes the blades slide smoothly over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was super excited as I usually only buy the cheaper razors</li>
            <li>the packaging was awesome, it wasn&#x27;t all that hard to open.</li>
            <li>I never really had a reason to buy a better razor since she got a new one for free....</li>
            <li>Still no comparison to their discontinued Personal Touch but good enough.</li>
            <li>I guess more blades do mean better performance because I prefer her razor to mine.</li>
            <li>First, the mosturising part lasts much much longer than on Gillette, and the head moves smoother, eliminating cuts and bumps.  </li>
            <li>I barely got any razor bumps and it was comfortable when going over my brazilian.</li>
            <li>This razor provides such a close shave, but is also nice and comfortable for my sensitive skin (red head).  </li>
            <li>The 5 blades provide a nice, close shave and help cut down on the stubbies, especially vital in the summer</li>
            <li>Amazon prices are generally better than local stores unless you have an amazing coupon, so I usually just order them here and save $5 per pack.</li>
            <li>I have used lots of other razors and other brands and these are by far the best.</li>
            <li>Worked as expected very smooth shave</li>
            <li>If you are shaving courser hair, it will dull the blades faster, so it is good to have a dedicated razor in rotation for each area.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Schick.</li>
            <li>Your life will change, your boss will start noticing you in the office, your coffee will make itself, the scars will heal on your legs from using that cheap-o razor that made it look like you went skydiving into a field of cacti one sunny afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;Since using these blades, I haven&#x27;t had as much razorburn either.</li>
            <li>My Face brand shaving creams, but the Alba Very Emollient gel</li>
            <li>This razer came for free attached to something else I bought at Walmart recently.</li>
            <li>I got a free razor in the mail last month</li>
            <li>The blades are very moisturizing and the 5 blades give a close shave.</li>
            <li>- it hydrates my skin and leaves it much softer after use for longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really smooth shave that only takes one swipe up to get rid of everything.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I much prefer them, though I don&#x27;t dislike the Venus.</li>
            <li>as described and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I got a free razor in the mail last month</li>
            <li>I told her to stop, but she never listened... until she got this Schick Hydro Silk razor as a free gift from one of our wedding orders last year from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li>The 5 blades really make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I used men&#x27;s razors for awhile and they worked very well.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps provide a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I really like the moisturizing strip</li>
            <li>These cut very well.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very close and glides over bumps to prevent cuts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different razors, and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Strangely enough, these work a thousand times better than the &#x27;Sensitive Skin&#x27; version of the Schick Hydro Silk...</li>
            <li>My hubby dislikes the viscosity of the &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; and it can form strands, but for leg shaving in a shower, it is pretty good because you don&#x27;t need to worry about the soap or foam running down your legs and being left shaving with just water.  </li>
            <li>With refills being cheaper online and one blade refill lasting about a month I find them to be very economical.  </li>
            <li>They are better then any other blades that I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite razor due to the lubrication strip and the close shave.</li>
            <li>These blades leave neither and are much better than any other I have tried</li>
            <li>however when you keep them clean, they last for a while.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a nice clean shave and it leaves your skin feeling soft, but the moisturizing serum (the white dots above and below the blades) can only be used for a handful of times.</li>
            <li>noticed the tiny holes on the razor release more moisturizing gel the more it becomes wet, so when you&#x27;re finished, don&#x27;t leave it in the shower/sink; store it somewhere clean and dry so it will last much longer.</li>
            <li>It also gives a very close shave each time, from when it&#x27;s brand new to when the moisturizer dots are almost gone.</li>
            <li>I am always fighting dry skin (especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant) and this razor leaves my skin silky smooth without having to lather up with moisturizing lotion all day.  </li>
            <li>I love these blades so much--smooth shave and slightly moisturising.</li>
            <li>I came to Amazon to find something similar since I&#x27;m usually a quick shaver and don&#x27;t like to bother with shaving cream, and I found the Schick Hydro.</li>
            <li>whatever soft stuff they put outside the blades make for a really smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Tried many different brands such as venus etc</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this razor for any part of the body (face, body, the goods)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I can get quite a few shaves from one refill, and the handle of the razor feels very comfortable when shaving.  </li>
            <li>The girl friend love this and it makes shaving easier for her wish they were a little cheaper</li>
            <li>They always get a close shave and actually moisturize my legs, which is good because the Chicago water is so harsh on my skin!</li>
            <li>Plus I signed up for the subscription, so I don&#x27;t have to deal with running out and to pick more up in a few months - they&#x27;ll be auto shipped to me.</li>
            <li>wish it was cheaper, but worth the extra $</li>
            <li>leave your skin feeling soft and not dried out like most other razors.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>and it came just right on time before I left.</li>
            <li>and then i saw they had a new one with a 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li>However, to release the cartridge for replacement with a new one is not as fast/easy as the Venus brand razors and</li>
            <li>I had one of the new Schick Hydro Silk for Women razors laying around the house that I had received as a sample in the mail one day.</li>
            <li>Sure, the blades are expensive, but if you are going to treat yourself, it might as well be with something that makes you smooth as a baby seal.</li>
            <li>my old Venus Embrace blades, which I loved for years, but the Venus blades always butchered my poor legs, these however do not.</li>
            <li>What irritated me the most was when the serum melted off cartridge completely (just from my shower steam) and made a complete mess in my shower.</li>
            <li>cartridge is easy to install and remove and each one seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li>I love the shaver and the blades last longer than any other disposable razor I have bought.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many in the past 30 years.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than going back over missed hairs or pushing the blades down causing irritation.</li>
            <li>I clean it off reguarly to cut down on any dirt that can accumulate, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave is close and soft.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>(  I was very upset that I had to keep putting it back on throughout my shave.  </li>
            <li>These are the only blades I&#x27;ve ever been able to use that don&#x27;t end up nicking and burning and completely destroying my legs.</li>
            <li>So if you want to get the most usage out of these, store the razor just a few inches outside the shower itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited when I actually get a more expensive one.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver because it cuts in real close, and it lasts a few days longer than other shavers I have tried.</li>
            <li>but they really dull out fast if you don&#x27;t clean them throughly.</li>
            <li>and I can definitely save money by buying these refills as opposed to new complete razors all the time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m imressed enough to stick with my new upgraded razer!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend you try this if you&#x27;re on the hunt for a new razor!</li>
            <li>This might sound weird but other razors seem to take off the top layer of my skin, which means I have to use hydrocortisone lotion to keep razor burn, scratches, and all that away.</li>
            <li>The aloe strips will get gooey and start dissolving much faster if it doesn&#x27;t stay fairly dry between uses.</li>
            <li>These are the best razors for my skin, I get razor bumps constantly and my skin seems to hate shaving</li>
            <li>does not nick or cut my sensitive skin as much as other brands I tried like it as much as venus by gillette</li>
            <li>It seems the refill blades are a little spendy, but its so worth it.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t even stay on the handle :o</li>
            <li>and I went back to my old razor.</li>
            <li>Ladies, if you have sensitive skin and want the closest/ effortless shave, this is definitely the razor for you.</li>
            <li>I order them on the subscribe and save and that makes them nearly \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; and definitely inexpensive!</li>
            <li>I will continue using these for as long as they are made as I can&#x27;t imagine anything coming out new</li>
            <li>These felt like seconds or like maybe they were stored too long and were old.</li>
            <li>They are super smooth and the blade guards make it almost impossible to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>The razor refills last a long time if you use some razor sharpening hacks (i.e. running the razor over denim before using to sharpen the blades and prolong the life of them - do an internet search, you will be pleasantly surprised).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they get so moisture, but those little dots really work.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s really nice product!</li>
            <li> I love this razor, the blades are the best.</li>
            <li> I love 5 blades, it works perfect to me.</li>
            <li> The razor heads are a great deal on Amazon, the price was great for that many and the quality was still there.</li>
            <li> I also loved that my legs were still moisturized afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with the Kiss</li>
            <li> The razor blades themselves are good.</li>
            <li> I was thinking that 4 is good</li>
            <li> Provides a good close shave.</li>
            <li> it is just as good as I remembered.....</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Good  close shave without irritation</li>
            <li> This is really good.</li>
            <li> They do a good job which lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of disposables, this razor is a nice sleek finish, infused shaving gel is a great time saver..</li>
            <li> My wife never had a good razor and always used those Bic disposable ones.</li>
            <li> so this is a really good buy.</li>
            <li> The design on the handle provides good grip and comfort.</li>
            <li> but they do work and the price is good</li>
            <li> I bought this and the razor system for my daughter telling her how much I loved them.</li>

            <li> I got my wonderful campaign box in the mail and started using it right away as we are supposed to with the campaigns.</li>
            <li> Nice price, great quality, my wife love it</li>
            <li> Love the razor !  </li>
            <li> I remember the bit on MADtv about adding like 20 blades to a razor to make it more effective (the Spishak Mach20!)</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors!</li>
            <li> Also, Schick is a way better value!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> These razors are the absolute best.</li>
            <li> excellent product works as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Best razor on the market and lasts much longer than others.</li>
            <li> Still looking for an ideal and economical way to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I liked this razor a lot</li>
            <li> I got this from BazzAgent, and I really liked it</li>
            <li> The 5 blades are nice, but I have found without the conditioning stuff, I have to use shaving gel</li>
            <li> I got to try this through the website buzzagent in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely felt like it&#x27;s the best razor</li>
            <li> These are reasonable, give a close shave, and leave me with the smoothest legs - perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> I normally wouldn&#x27;t write an amazon review for something like that, but I am just so impressed by this blade.</li>
            <li> the blades did a good job, didn&#x27;t rust easy, and I had no irritation while using them.</li>
            <li> Best little product ever... easy to use and the best results yet.</li>
            <li> Good deal and quick to my door shipping!</li>
            <li> I received these for free and I really loved these.</li>
            <li> this is by far the very best.</li>
            <li> but these razors have been the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I really love these razor refills and they&#x27;re so nice to use.</li>
            <li> But the Hydro Silk has this water activated moisturizer (kind of like the conditioning strips on the Mach 3 blades but better).</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and love the handy shower suction cup for hanging it up when not in use.</li>
            <li> By far the best razor out there.</li>
            <li> These razors, both the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; are the best I have experienced for wherever you want to shave from the face, to the underarms and all the way down.  </li>
            <li> Daughter loves these refills as they provide her a very good shave and last a good time.</li>
            <li> So far, the Schick Hydro has been my favorite, even beating out the excellent Quattro.</li>
            <li> Great razor for a smooth shave, easy to use, easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> I was glad I could shave my knees without getting cut.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best razor I have ever used to date, it makes my skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> and I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> and I just love it..</li>
            <li> Overall, awesome addition to the kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my favorite razors/refill blades.</li>
            <li> and I love these blades.</li>
            <li> Always love getting my purchases here.</li>
            <li> so 5 is better and that is not the case.  </li>
            <li> I actually ordered them for my GF but have found that they do the best job for keeping my head shaved.</li>
            <li> can you get me more for Christmas.</li>
            <li> that will top my experience with these.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love the Hydro Silk razor blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of razors and go back and forth on them, as nothing stood out as wonderful.</li>
            <li> Each year shaving products fro women get better and better.</li>
            <li> My legs feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> not so I am glad I bought the razor and also refills,</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors, I cannot shave with anything</li>
            <li> Omg I love the shick hydro silk I received it by being a bzzagent</li>
            <li> i love these razors</li>
            <li> even though they get really goopy and slimy they still provide a great shave</li>
            <li> especially if she uses Aveeno shaving cream with this razor... perfect</li>
            <li> better than gillette.</li>
            <li> I love the razor these blades are for, and I&#x27;m really glad to have found them for cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> SO THAT THE BLADE PART IS ON THE BOTTOM, AND THE HANDLE IS ON THE TOP.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these razors.</li>
            <li> I love these blades, and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy them here than at Walmart.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite type of of razor.  </li>
            <li> I love these razor blades.</li>
            <li> Blades glide smoothly over the skin and it is the closest shave I have ever had!</li>
            <li> oh i do love these razors.</li>
            <li> Nice product, great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> The price is cheaper than most stores, so I&#x27;d get it off of amazon.</li>
            <li> These are better than Venus</li>
            <li> and I love these blades.</li>
            <li> Theyr&#x27;re better then</li>
            <li> I would love for Schick to come up with a newer/better razor with that in mind.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smoother and more moisturized after using the Schick Hydro Silk than after using the Venus blades.</li>
            <li> These are ok.</li>
            <li> I love these razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried what seems like a million razors and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the cheapest place I have been able to find them.</li>
            <li> Love Schick...</li>
            <li> My favorite razor.</li>
            <li> wife says blade better than the competition will start using them all the time have them on subscribe and save</li>
            <li> I think the the Schick Hydro Silk cartridges are okay.</li>
            <li> I also noticed using this razor seemed to be better withOUT shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now grown much more funder of it and</li>
            <li> like it more now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each blade can be used fairly many times, so this is what I also like about them.</li>
            <li> Love this razor-</li>
            <li> I like the refillable version better than the disposable.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> Honestly, my legs have never been this silky smooth -</li>
            <li> On a whim I decided to try these, and am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love using these razor&#x27;s to shave my head</li>
            <li> Love the pivoting head.  </li>
            <li> I got a trial pack of these from the Vine program, I fell in love with them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from that, it&#x27;s a great razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My legs are super sensitive and prone to razor burn, this razor was perfect.</li>
            <li> So she was excited to get a slew of them from me!</li>
            <li> I thoroughly love getting a nice, smooth, clean shave with these razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Love them super close shave!</li>
            <li> My favorite razor, always smooth and non-irritating</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really like the Hydro Silk shaver and the razor refills are really good too.</li>
            <li> Fortunately in an night of curious desperation, they got the best of me, and I tried it out.</li>
            <li> Just Pogoplug with my wife came back to me and said OMG these raiders are so good they are so amazing</li>
            <li> The built in shaving serum makes it so easy to shave and not have to worry about getting cut.</li>
            <li> Thirty plus years of shaving pits and legs have never been so easy.</li>
            <li> The handle of the razor is easy to hold in the shower.</li>
            <li> (This was the main reason I didn&#x27;t like it as good at frist)</li>
            <li> Best razors I&#x27;ve ever used hands down</li>
            <li> It leaves my legs super moisturized!</li>
            <li> Updated Review - the Schick Hydro Silk Razor is the best system I have ever owned, and the refills are generally a few dollars cheaper than the Venus systems.</li>
            <li> My legs are SO smooth with no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to test &amp; review from INFLUENSTER</li>
            <li> Shaves close and smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this razor as a free sample when I placed an order from Walmart.</li>
            <li> , however amazing it is, gobs up in the blades too much.</li>
            <li> They last well, provide a close shave, and are great quality.</li>
            <li> these are great because the blades are so close together that it definitely reduces the chance of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They leave my legs silky and smooth</li>
            <li> and I found a way to get a couple of these free.</li>
            <li> Over the holiday season my wife was given a free sample of department store and I told her</li>
            <li> These refill blades are comfortable, give a close shave, and have a conditioning strip on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It all started with a free sample.</li>
            <li> No nicks, and a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The campaign I participated in gave me a free razor, and 3 refill blades.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> smooth-</li>
            <li> The Hydro Silk has a nice lubricating strip which lasts much longer than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I got a free one as a promo</li>
            <li> my skin is so smooth. ..</li>
            <li> Cheaper than Target and free shipping --</li>
            <li> The shave is smooth and my legs do not feel scraped.</li>
            <li> I know what a great razor can actually do.</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a babies</li>
            <li> overall a great product</li>
            <li> I used to just buy the razors that were most reasonably priced-- not the cheapest, but whatever 3 blade (or more)</li>
            <li> When combined with a good quality gel shave cream, they work better than anything else I have used and last up to a month, even with my steel wool-like face and body hair.</li>
            <li> They provide a decent shave but are definitely not the best shaving product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> She said, I already use them, they are my new favorite razor!</li>
            <li> These leave my legs super smooth and razor burn/knick free, all in one or two strokes</li>
            <li> These leave my legs super smooth and razor burn/knick free, all in one or two strokes</li>
            <li> great price, lasts long</li>
            <li> originally obtained this product via the Bzzagent word of mouth company for one of their campaigns.</li>
            <li> Great razors---last a long time.</li>
            <li> Rarely causes irritation, shaves close, never a nick!</li>
            <li> I tried it and wasn&#x27;t quite sure at first.</li>
            <li> So excited I was.</li>
            <li> (I am very prone to ingrowns no matter where it is I shave), no razor burn problems, really smooth, smoother longer than with the razors I had been using, and very comfortable in my hand.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how you think you have something that works, only to discover something so much better.</li>
            <li> Great blades for a great razor - can&#x27;t go wrong with these.  </li>
            <li> Gives a clean, close shave.  </li>
            <li> Solid razors-the 5 blades do good work.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite razor.</li>
            <li> but if in a hurry this razor will shave without either fairly well especially if it&#x27;s newer.</li>
            <li> They were received very quickly and exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used on my legs.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried every freaking razor on the market (including everything from Venus) and these are the best!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still try to get the best price, but I&#x27;ll buy this brand for sure, even if I could get &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; razors for several dollars less.</li>
            <li> Great Product and much cheaper than in local stores</li>
            <li> They actually leave a close shave leaving my skin nice a smooth.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer wears off rather quickly</li>
            <li> It leaves such a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> We can even get a couple more shaves from each blade than I normally would attempt.</li>
            <li> I like this razor a lot and happy to find the razors on Amazon for less.</li>
            <li> Occasionally, Amazon even has a coupon for them, so even better!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> but I still use longer since they are pretty pricey!  </li>
            <li> I use it most every day and have never had such a close, easy shave.</li>
            <li> It left my legs super soft and my skin happy.</li>
            <li> Trust me on that, it will help keep the water from collecting inside the blade locking mechanism, which will keep it nice and clean for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to replace the handle!</li>
            <li> I get a razor burn with each use but only from the ones I purchased on Amazon.com but the ones I purchased in the store are amazing.</li>
            <li> It was perfect for my sensitive skin and my legs stayed hydrated for a few hours...</li>
            <li> The razor glides smooth and the blade cuts very close.</li>
            <li> I really liked these cartridges and used to actually look forward to how gentle and smooth they WERE.</li>
            <li> Then, when I was able to pick up some Venus refill blades, I could tell a HUGE difference between shaving with the two different brands.</li>
            <li> it makes me smile every time I think about shaving my legs</li>
            <li> FInally a razor that I love and keeps my legs smooth</li>
            <li> then they&#x27;re well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s def worth the money I still use it and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of razors out there, this is by far my favorite one.</li>
            <li> I have used many kinds of razors over the years but none made me say WOW until this one.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this on my own</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite razor blades.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I feel as though it needs to be marked more clearer on the razor itself and not just on the box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It dries out pretty quickly, even without use.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take this mom much to get excited about.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a shame because when you use it the first time, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was just an off package but haven&#x27;t experienced this when purchasing in a store vs Amazon.</li>
            <li> I switched to Venus, and found the smaller lotion bar to be a bit better, but it still wasn&#x27;t as close a shave when they were brand new, and not as easy a shave when the lotion bar was almost gone.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, easy-glide, the lubrication in them lasts as long as the razor blade (most run out fast).</li>
            <li> I found the Intuition lost the soap surrounding very quickly, and when they were brand new they didn&#x27;t shave as well because of the large border.  </li>
            <li> I tried a disposable one that came as a gift with a different item I bought, and discovered that this is a waaay better razor than my Gillete that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li> After I tried Hyro Silk for the first time, I was sold.</li>
            <li> For years now I&#x27;ve been using the chick Hydro male version and I will love the results.</li>
            <li> and yes they last a while also where many others d</li>
            <li> I sure hope my husband doesn&#x27;t mind a second hand razor for himself!</li>
            <li> Prior to it, I was using the Schick Quatro, but I can safely say I won&#x27;t go back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades last a long time and give a great shave.  </li>
            <li> This Schick has four separate blades, which is one more than my former favorite razor, which was also a Schick but only had three blades.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that has ever made my legs feel this smooth!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> They are definitely silky tho :)</li>
            <li> I get a consistent shave every time.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought 5 blades was overkill but trust me</li>
            <li> There is a little bar of lotion at the top of the blade cartridge that makes the blades slide smoothly over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was super excited as I usually only buy the cheaper razors</li>
            <li> the packaging was awesome, it wasn&#x27;t all that hard to open.</li>
            <li> I never really had a reason to buy a better razor since she got a new one for free....</li>
            <li> Still no comparison to their discontinued Personal Touch but good enough.</li>
            <li> I guess more blades do mean better performance because I prefer her razor to mine.</li>
            <li> First, the mosturising part lasts much much longer than on Gillette, and the head moves smoother, eliminating cuts and bumps.  </li>
            <li> I barely got any razor bumps and it was comfortable when going over my brazilian.</li>
            <li> This razor provides such a close shave, but is also nice and comfortable for my sensitive skin (red head).  </li>
            <li> The 5 blades provide a nice, close shave and help cut down on the stubbies, especially vital in the summer</li>
            <li> Amazon prices are generally better than local stores unless you have an amazing coupon, so I usually just order them here and save $5 per pack.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of other razors and other brands and these are by far the best.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected very smooth shave</li>
            <li> If you are shaving courser hair, it will dull the blades faster, so it is good to have a dedicated razor in rotation for each area.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Schick.</li>
            <li> Your life will change, your boss will start noticing you in the office, your coffee will make itself, the scars will heal on your legs from using that cheap-o razor that made it look like you went skydiving into a field of cacti one sunny afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;Since using these blades, I haven&#x27;t had as much razorburn either.</li>
            <li> My Face brand shaving creams, but the Alba Very Emollient gel</li>
            <li> This razer came for free attached to something else I bought at Walmart recently.</li>
            <li> I got a free razor in the mail last month</li>
            <li> The blades are very moisturizing and the 5 blades give a close shave.</li>
            <li> - it hydrates my skin and leaves it much softer after use for longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really smooth shave that only takes one swipe up to get rid of everything.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I much prefer them, though I don&#x27;t dislike the Venus.</li>
            <li> as described and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I got a free razor in the mail last month</li>
            <li> I told her to stop, but she never listened... until she got this Schick Hydro Silk razor as a free gift from one of our wedding orders last year from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades really make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I used men&#x27;s razors for awhile and they worked very well.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps provide a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizing strip</li>
            <li> These cut very well.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very close and glides over bumps to prevent cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different razors, and these are by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Strangely enough, these work a thousand times better than the &#x27;Sensitive Skin&#x27; version of the Schick Hydro Silk...</li>
            <li> My hubby dislikes the viscosity of the &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; and it can form strands, but for leg shaving in a shower, it is pretty good because you don&#x27;t need to worry about the soap or foam running down your legs and being left shaving with just water.  </li>
            <li> With refills being cheaper online and one blade refill lasting about a month I find them to be very economical.  </li>
            <li> They are better then any other blades that I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor due to the lubrication strip and the close shave.</li>
            <li> These blades leave neither and are much better than any other I have tried</li>
            <li> however when you keep them clean, they last for a while.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a nice clean shave and it leaves your skin feeling soft, but the moisturizing serum (the white dots above and below the blades) can only be used for a handful of times.</li>
            <li> noticed the tiny holes on the razor release more moisturizing gel the more it becomes wet, so when you&#x27;re finished, don&#x27;t leave it in the shower/sink; store it somewhere clean and dry so it will last much longer.</li>
            <li> It also gives a very close shave each time, from when it&#x27;s brand new to when the moisturizer dots are almost gone.</li>
            <li> I am always fighting dry skin (especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant) and this razor leaves my skin silky smooth without having to lather up with moisturizing lotion all day.  </li>
            <li> I love these blades so much--smooth shave and slightly moisturising.</li>
            <li> I came to Amazon to find something similar since I&#x27;m usually a quick shaver and don&#x27;t like to bother with shaving cream, and I found the Schick Hydro.</li>
            <li> whatever soft stuff they put outside the blades make for a really smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Tried many different brands such as venus etc</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this razor for any part of the body (face, body, the goods)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can get quite a few shaves from one refill, and the handle of the razor feels very comfortable when shaving.  </li>
            <li> The girl friend love this and it makes shaving easier for her wish they were a little cheaper</li>
            <li> They always get a close shave and actually moisturize my legs, which is good because the Chicago water is so harsh on my skin!</li>
            <li> Plus I signed up for the subscription, so I don&#x27;t have to deal with running out and to pick more up in a few months - they&#x27;ll be auto shipped to me.</li>
            <li> wish it was cheaper, but worth the extra $</li>
            <li> leave your skin feeling soft and not dried out like most other razors.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> and it came just right on time before I left.</li>
            <li> and then i saw they had a new one with a 5 blade razor.</li>
            <li> However, to release the cartridge for replacement with a new one is not as fast/easy as the Venus brand razors and</li>
            <li> I had one of the new Schick Hydro Silk for Women razors laying around the house that I had received as a sample in the mail one day.</li>
            <li> Sure, the blades are expensive, but if you are going to treat yourself, it might as well be with something that makes you smooth as a baby seal.</li>
            <li> my old Venus Embrace blades, which I loved for years, but the Venus blades always butchered my poor legs, these however do not.</li>
            <li> What irritated me the most was when the serum melted off cartridge completely (just from my shower steam) and made a complete mess in my shower.</li>
            <li> cartridge is easy to install and remove and each one seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver and the blades last longer than any other disposable razor I have bought.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many in the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than going back over missed hairs or pushing the blades down causing irritation.</li>
            <li> I clean it off reguarly to cut down on any dirt that can accumulate, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave is close and soft.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> (  I was very upset that I had to keep putting it back on throughout my shave.  </li>
            <li> These are the only blades I&#x27;ve ever been able to use that don&#x27;t end up nicking and burning and completely destroying my legs.</li>
            <li> So if you want to get the most usage out of these, store the razor just a few inches outside the shower itself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited when I actually get a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver because it cuts in real close, and it lasts a few days longer than other shavers I have tried.</li>
            <li> but they really dull out fast if you don&#x27;t clean them throughly.</li>
            <li> and I can definitely save money by buying these refills as opposed to new complete razors all the time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m imressed enough to stick with my new upgraded razer!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend you try this if you&#x27;re on the hunt for a new razor!</li>
            <li> This might sound weird but other razors seem to take off the top layer of my skin, which means I have to use hydrocortisone lotion to keep razor burn, scratches, and all that away.</li>
            <li> The aloe strips will get gooey and start dissolving much faster if it doesn&#x27;t stay fairly dry between uses.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors for my skin, I get razor bumps constantly and my skin seems to hate shaving</li>
            <li> does not nick or cut my sensitive skin as much as other brands I tried like it as much as venus by gillette</li>
            <li> It seems the refill blades are a little spendy, but its so worth it.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t even stay on the handle :o</li>
            <li> and I went back to my old razor.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you have sensitive skin and want the closest/ effortless shave, this is definitely the razor for you.</li>
            <li> I order them on the subscribe and save and that makes them nearly \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; and definitely inexpensive!</li>
            <li> I will continue using these for as long as they are made as I can&#x27;t imagine anything coming out new</li>
            <li> These felt like seconds or like maybe they were stored too long and were old.</li>
            <li> They are super smooth and the blade guards make it almost impossible to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> The razor refills last a long time if you use some razor sharpening hacks (i.e. running the razor over denim before using to sharpen the blades and prolong the life of them - do an internet search, you will be pleasantly surprised).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they get so moisture, but those little dots really work.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, dark stubborn hair and it glides over my skin so smooth and leaves them soft.</li>
            <li> Plus, there are moisturizers in the razor blade which have totally natural ingredients (other moisturizing razor blades have parabens in them which I don&#x27;t like).  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because I have been an avid user of men&#x27;s razors for a long time as women&#x27;s razors never seemed to work for me.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Hydro Silk girl, but this last purchase left me really annoyed.</li>
            <li> Already happy with my older, less expensive razor, I was not in the mood to play their game.</li>
            <li> Blades shave close and shave last a long time...</li>
            <li> took long enough!!!</li>
            <li> Each blade can last long time.</li>
            <li> Buying five will last a long time.</li>
            <li> and it does seem to shave well and last for a really long time</li>
            <li> they are long lasting.</li>
            <li> but if you keep the razor in a location that is exposed to direct water contact every day, those little moisture beads will melt way and the razor will be unusable after a very short amount of time.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;The blades last a very long time too.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;The blades last a very long time too.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and hate shaving, but this razor is amazing and never gives me razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have facial hair under my chin which is thick and these blades really do the trick of giving a \\&quot;close\\&quot; and \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li> Switched to these because Venus are so ridiculously priced, but they are still pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> It works, but not for long. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I paid for double the replacement blades...&amp; got only half the product...</li>
            <li> The softness is unbelievable and sometimes I wonder if they are really doing the job because I have felt no nicks or cuts with them like other blades out there.</li>
            <li> One blade will last me well over 3 weeks of shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> Plus, compared to other razors, these are relatively inexpensive if you buy them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> At the low price offered by Amazon , I keep my Subscription active on this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a fluke, but every single one smells like that.</li>
            <li> and I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I love these razors, but they are very expensive.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the longest lasting razor head I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I only wish they weren&#x27;t in a pink box!!</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to any other razor!</li>
            <li> This is a vast improvement over my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> then I expected since u must hold the button down the entire time instead of just a on and off switch.</li>
            <li> this is the ONLY one that doesn&#x27;t mess up her legs....</li>
            <li> My only &#x27;complaint&#x27; is that the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Hang it up on the little white hanger that comes with it, and HANG IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same on for almost a year and it shows little sign of wear and tear.</li>
            <li> I like these blades but they seem to dull quicker than my old Schick Quatro.</li>
            <li> However, they are a little expensive, but personally, I think they&#x27;re worth buying.</li>
            <li> One tip: Don&#x27;t store these with the blade against anything after it is wet, the moisture band will stick and pull out of the blade.</li>
            <li> Just be careful and don&#x27;t leave the blade in on the ledge of your tub with standing water.  </li>
            <li> After figuring out how to place the battery, I then realized using a trimmer was much harder</li>
            <li> I wish it could be a little less bulky, but it is smaller than the Venus with the built in moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I would be able to live with a plastic-y smell, but these give off a horrible fish smell.</li>
            <li> My wife, on the other hand; prefers the newborn silky skin feeling that these blades provide for her legs.</li>
            <li> I never liked shaving my legs in the shower because I was afraid a cutting myself, but then I found these and was impressed.</li>
            <li> my daughter breaks out from ALL other razors...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moist and sharp the way you need it to be.</li>
            <li> i dont feel they glide as well as other schick ones.</li>
            <li> average I would shave once ever other day.</li>
            <li> My Venus blades lasted for maybe one week, tops.&lt;br /&gt;Not the closest shave in the bikini/under arm department, still have to use an electric shaver or wax in those areas, but hey if they save my poor sensitive legs from cuts AND save me the embarrassment of ugly, red razor bumps on my legs then they&#x27;re well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> The only thing is if you don&#x27;t dry your razor off well between uses, the serum will run out before your blades dull!</li>
            <li> Much too expensive online,</li>
            <li> I needed something reliable because my leg hair unfortunately grows fast.</li>
            <li> I finally got to use this sucker.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else, just wish they would go down in price.....</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, so shaving was a very painful thing to do all the time.</li>
            <li> The razor felt a little heavy which Is to be expected if it&#x27;s both a trimmer and a razor and holds a battery</li>
            <li> and I also get a lot less ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> All my recent shaves have been uncomfortable and left me with cuts.  </li>
            <li> also less delicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lubricating gooey stuff on the blades are a bit of a mess</li>
            <li> Luckily it goes away and it doesn&#x27;t transfer the awful smell to your skin, but if I were using that thing anywhere near my face</li>
            <li> The moisturizing gel around the blades lasts for about 3-4 shaves for me; However, I have very thin /sparse body hair and sensitive</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would rather use the Venus razor with a bar that slowly wears down.</li>
            <li> it seems a little hard to control and the head comes out if you drop it.  </li>
            <li> They save my poor sensitive legs from cuts AND save me the embarrassment of ugly, red razor bumps on my legs</li>
            <li> nothing else no more cuts nicks or razor burn</li>
            <li> I also believe five blades is excessive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased that these blades are pricey</li>
            <li> The other blades always butchered my poor legs, these however do not.</li>
            <li> I hate disposable razors and I shave only when necessary.</li>
            <li> but I got sick of purchasing the expensive refills only to have half of the moisturizing bar fall off regularly.</li>
            <li> It works so well at reaching those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Once the gel is gone, I toss it because the blade seems dull at that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get cut hardly ever.</li>
            <li> It has five blades with moisture strips…I hardly ever cut myself.</li>
            <li> It would be hard to nick yourself with these blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have a hard time sticking with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to be a die hard Gillette Venus lady.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Venus and Intuition razors with the thick bars around them.  </li>
            <li> For a woman, there is no better razor!</li>
            <li> and I mean any of the Venus blades.</li>
            <li> No more dealing with Venus, thank god!</li>
            <li> one issue with the Hydro is that the refill blades smell awful straight out of the package!</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.</li>
            <li> Bootleg.</li>
            <li> These were definitely bootleg.</li>
            <li> I secretly use hers all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to buy these on Amazon, because I can get them for a little less than the military base, plus I don&#x27;t have to worry about the base being out of stock on these, which happens a lot.</li>
            <li> I was really shocked that I found I had a lot less issues with ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I hated how it cut the hairs on my legs and it left hairs behind which</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of schick razors and this is the worst by far.  </li>
            <li> Women&#x27;s shaving choices used to be limited and with awful products like the Daisy until the late 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I must have been allergic to this, they gave me a rash like poison ivy.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong trying this product</li>
            <li> Unsure as to why refills are so expensive</li>
            <li> and you can go wrong with the savings you get.</li>
            <li> I have tried waxing with terrible results due to rash and bumps.</li>
            <li> Also if you&#x27;re prone to accidentally cutting yourself (like me)</li>
            <li> Will never be afraid to shave my legs in the shower again now</li>
            <li> They help with  ingrown hair and cutting problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I can understand when she started stealing my razor for her shaves... but replaceable heads are expensive!</li>
            <li> I hate these razors.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received these for free and I really loved these. I was glad I could shave my knees without getting cut. I also loved that my legs were still moisturized afterwards. Thanks, Schick.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. It works so well at reaching those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Updated Review - the Schick Hydro Silk Razor is the best system I have ever owned, and the refills are generally a few dollars cheaper than the Venus systems. The refill blades used to be much more expensive on Amazon, but now they are cheaper than the drug store.  Subscription is awesome if you&#x27;re a hermit and can&#x27;t handle going to the drug stores. This razor provides such a close shave, but is also nice and comfortable for my sensitive skin (red head).  My legs are SO smooth with no nicks or cuts. This might sound weird but other razors seem to take off the top layer of my skin, which means I have to use hydrocortisone lotion to keep razor burn, scratches, and all that away. With this razor I can use regular lotion after shaving.  The razor refills last a long time if you use some razor sharpening hacks (i.e. running the razor over denim before using to sharpen the blades and prolong the life of them - do an internet search, you will be pleasantly surprised).</li>
            <li> this is one of the best razor I have ever used to date, it makes my skin so soft and smooth and I am in love with it. it makes me smile every time I think about shaving my legs and I just love it..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I must have been allergic to this, they gave me a rash like poison ivy. I received this product for free to test &amp; review from INFLUENSTER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different razors, and these are by far my favorite. They always get a close shave and actually moisturize my legs, which is good because the Chicago water is so harsh on my skin!</li>
            <li> Best razors I&#x27;ve used. Just wish they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Bootleg. I get a razor burn with each use but only from the ones I purchased on Amazon.com but the ones I purchased in the store are amazing. The ones from the store give great moisture and are perfect for showering. These were definitely bootleg.</li>
            <li> great price, lasts long</li>
            <li> Personally, I like MY hairy legs. My wife, on the other hand; prefers the newborn silky skin feeling that these blades provide for her legs.</li>
            <li> Best razor blades ever! For a woman, there is no better razor!</li>
            <li> Much too expensive online, but I love the razor anyways - best one I&#x27;ve ever used. (I do realize these are just the refill cartridges).</li>
            <li> I was using a Venus razor until about 3 years ago.  I tried this one and never went back.  With refills being cheaper online and one blade refill lasting about a month I find them to be very economical.  They also provide a great shave.</li>
            <li> I tried a disposable one that came as a gift with a different item I bought, and discovered that this is a waaay better razor than my Gillete that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  First, the mosturising part lasts much much longer than on Gillette, and the head moves smoother, eliminating cuts and bumps.  I am switching to Schick!</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever had. Shaves close and smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this razor as a free sample when I placed an order from Walmart. Already happy with my older, less expensive razor, I was not in the mood to play their game. Fortunately in an night of curious desperation, they got the best of me, and I tried it out. It is amazing how you think you have something that works, only to discover something so much better. Sure, the blades are expensive, but if you are going to treat yourself, it might as well be with something that makes you smooth as a baby seal. Your life will change, your boss will start noticing you in the office, your coffee will make itself, the scars will heal on your legs from using that cheap-o razor that made it look like you went skydiving into a field of cacti one sunny afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;Since using these blades, I haven&#x27;t had as much razorburn either. I think you have to wax to truly prevent it, but this helps a lot. I go through a blade every 3 weeks. If you are shaving courser hair, it will dull the blades faster, so it is good to have a dedicated razor in rotation for each area. I&#x27;ve had good luck with the Kiss My Face brand shaving creams, but the Alba Very Emollient gel, however amazing it is, gobs up in the blades too much. Overall, awesome addition to the kit.</li>
            <li> Solid razors-the 5 blades do good work.</li>
            <li> My favorite razors and a great price. I&#x27;ll never buy them at the drug store again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the gelette Mach 3 for years and just never felt like I needed to try something else. This razer came for free attached to something else I bought at Walmart recently. It seems the refill blades are a little spendy, but its so worth it. The shave is close and soft. I&#x27;m imressed enough to stick with my new upgraded razer!</li>
            <li> Great razor for a smooth shave, easy to use, easy to hold.  FInally a razor that I love and keeps my legs smooth</li>
            <li> My Favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my favorite razors/refill blades. They last well, provide a close shave, and are great quality. Also if you&#x27;re prone to accidentally cutting yourself (like me) these are great because the blades are so close together that it definitely reduces the chance of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest giving these a try!</li>
            <li> Great product. The moisturizing gel around the blades lasts for about 3-4 shaves for me; However, I have very thin /sparse body hair and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the tiny holes on the razor release more moisturizing gel the more it becomes wet, so when you&#x27;re finished, don&#x27;t leave it in the shower/sink; store it somewhere clean and dry so it will last much longer. This will also keep it from rusting. Once the gel is gone, I toss it because the blade seems dull at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this razor for any part of the body (face, body, the goods)</li>
            <li> I have these on auto subscription and they arrive on time every month. They leave my legs silky and smooth</li>
            <li> I got a free razor in the mail last month and I love these blades. They are better then any other blades that I have tried. The other blades always butchered my poor legs, these however do not. These leave my legs super smooth and razor burn/knick free, all in one or two strokes too.&lt;br /&gt;The blades last a very long time too. These last for several weeks if not stored in the shower. They save my poor sensitive legs from cuts AND save me the embarrassment of ugly, red razor bumps on my legs then they&#x27;re well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Great blades for a great razor - can&#x27;t go wrong with these.  I would recommend these to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love the razor !  Blades shave close and shave last a long time...that said, blades are pricey.</li>
            <li> Best razors I&#x27;ve ever used hands down</li>
            <li> Always love getting my purchases here. The razors are great and very easy to use without having to use soap.</li>
            <li> I used to just buy the razors that were most reasonably priced-- not the cheapest, but whatever 3 blade (or more) that I had a coupon for. I didn&#x27;t consider myself too picky... I started using Hydro Silk because I&#x27;m a couponer and I found a way to get a couple of these free. Well, I guess this was a win-win for me and for Schick, because now I&#x27;ve found one that I actually PREFER.  I&#x27;ll still try to get the best price, but I&#x27;ll buy this brand for sure, even if I could get &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; razors for several dollars less.</li>
            <li> The razor blades themselves are good. Still no comparison to their discontinued Personal Touch but good enough. The moisture strip though is gross. I prefer to use soap on my legs, not shaving cream, and the strip turns to goop when using soap.</li>
            <li> I was thinking that 4 is good so 5 is better and that is not the case.  Do not waste your money I&#x27;m sticking to my quattro 4 blade.</li>
            <li> Great. Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> They are perfect! Close shave and my legs stay smooth for days!!!</li>
            <li> Good price, fast shipping</li>
            <li> These felt like seconds or like maybe they were stored too long and were old.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase and delivery.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the girlfriend and I was traveling and it came just right on time before I left. As described.</li>
            <li> I used to be a devoted Venus customer... After I tried Hyro Silk for the first time, I was sold. Seemed to leave my legs a lot smoother than Venus.</li>
            <li> These are great....I actually ordered them for my GF but have found that they do the best job for keeping my head shaved. I have used lots of other razors and other brands and these are by far the best. I only wish they weren&#x27;t in a pink box!! lol</li>
            <li> For years now I&#x27;ve been using the chick Hydro male version and I will love the results. Over the holiday season my wife was given a free sample of department store and I told her yes you should Tripkos I used it the male version and I&#x27;ve been telling her she should try it for years now. She currently uses the lady shaver that you buy it like a package of five for a buck 99. Just Pogoplug with my wife came back to me and said OMG these raiders are so good they are so amazing can you get me more for Christmas.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades ever</li>
            <li> Provides a good close shave. I don&#x27;t ever feel like I have to worry about cuts. I will continue using these for as long as they are made as I can&#x27;t imagine anything coming out new that will top my experience with these.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love the Hydro Silk razor blades. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of razors and go back and forth on them, as nothing stood out as wonderful. These are great, though. Smooth, easy-glide, the lubrication in them lasts as long as the razor blade (most run out fast). We can even get a couple more shaves from each blade than I normally would attempt. I hope they keep making them for a while, as I finally found one I can stick with.</li>
            <li> Women&#x27;s shaving choices used to be limited and with awful products like the Daisy until the late 80&#x27;s. Each year shaving products fro women get better and better. So far, the Schick Hydro has been my favorite, even beating out the excellent Quattro. These refill blades are comfortable, give a close shave, and have a conditioning strip on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because sometimes there seems to be one blade in the pack that is scratchy feeling and nicks me. This is unacceptable especially considering the cost of these 4 packs. I&#x27;ve decided to buy these on Amazon, because I can get them for a little less than the military base, plus I don&#x27;t have to worry about the base being out of stock on these, which happens a lot.</li>
            <li> I started using these razors a couple years ago. It all started with a free sample. Since then I haven&#x27;t used another brand. These razors are the absolute best. I don&#x27;t get cut hardly ever. My legs feel nice and smooth. The blades last me about 3 weeks each. So this box will last me 2 months. At the low price offered by Amazon , I keep my Subscription active on this product. Well worth the money. I&#x27;ve tried countless products over my 34 years this is by far the very best. You can&#x27;t go wrong trying this product and you will be very glad you did. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> she was always using my mens hydro. So I bought her these. she loves them. says they are the best razors she has ever used.</li>
            <li> I got the Schick hydro as a gift with a pair of shoes I bought on amazon...it is just as good as I remembered..... Gives a clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> excellent product works as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have this on the delivery system and am very glad.  Unsure as to why refills are so expensive but this purchase does save some money and is very handy</li>
            <li> Yes they are a bi pricy to me but they do the job, leave no marks and gseem to glide over your skin and yes they last a while also where many others d not so I am glad I bought the razor and also refills,</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used on my legs. I never get cuts anymore and I also get a lot less ingrown hairs. When I use this razor I don&#x27;t even need shaving cream. It leaves my legs super moisturized! I love it!!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors, I cannot shave with anything but these, even the most expensive disposables. You practically don&#x27;t need shaving cream because of the moisture band. One tip: Don&#x27;t store these with the blade against anything after it is wet, the moisture band will stick and pull out of the blade. I wish it could be a little less bulky, but it is smaller than the Venus with the built in moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like these blades as I don&#x27;t need an additional shaving foam/soap when using these.  The only thing is if you don&#x27;t dry your razor off well between uses, the serum will run out before your blades dull!</li>
            <li> These are the only reason I stopped stealing my husband&#x27;s razor. The blades are very moisturizing and the 5 blades give a close shave.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver because it cuts in real close, and it lasts a few days longer than other shavers I have tried.</li>
            <li> Omg I love the shick hydro silk I received it by being a bzzagent and I loved it. It was perfect for my sensitive skin and my legs stayed hydrated for a few hours... it&#x27;s def worth the money I still use it and nothing else no more cuts nicks or razor burn</li>
            <li> I hate these razors.  I have used all kinds of schick razors and this is the worst by far.  It wouldn&#x27;t even stay on the handle :o(  I was very upset that I had to keep putting it back on throughout my shave.  I hated how it cut the hairs on my legs and it left hairs behind which is a no no.  I would NOT recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors I buy. I never liked shaving my legs in the shower because I was afraid a cutting myself, but then I found these and was impressed. The built in shaving serum makes it so easy to shave and not have to worry about getting cut. The razor glides smooth and the blade cuts very close. Will never be afraid to shave my legs in the shower again now that I found these razors.</li>
            <li> Good  close shave without irritation</li>
            <li> Great Product and much cheaper than in local stores</li>
            <li> i owned the last Trimstyle thing from Schick and then i saw they had a new one with a 5 blade razor. FINALLY A 5 BLADE FOR WOMEN. took long enough!!! so i bought that one and these razors go w it. definitely cheaper on Amazon than in stores. i love these razors</li>
            <li> even though they get really goopy and slimy they still provide a great shave</li>
            <li> my daughter breaks out from ALL other razors... this is the ONLY one that doesn&#x27;t mess up her legs.... especially if she uses Aveeno shaving cream with this razor... perfect</li>
            <li> better than gillette. After using this, I will never go back</li>
            <li> The girl friend love this and it makes shaving easier for her wish they were a little cheaper but what can i do about that nothing</li>
            <li> Best razor on the market and lasts much longer than others.</li>
            <li> Switched to these because Venus are so ridiculously priced, but they are still pretty pricey. The lubricating gooey stuff on the blades are a bit of a mess so I use a cheaper razor for travel.</li>
            <li> I like this razor a lot and happy to find the razors on Amazon for less. Just tacked it on to another purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the razor these blades are for, and I&#x27;m really glad to have found them for cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I&#x27;ve ever been able to use that don&#x27;t end up nicking and burning and completely destroying my legs. Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried every freaking razor on the market (including everything from Venus) and these are the best!! Strangely enough, these work a thousand times better than the &#x27;Sensitive Skin&#x27; version of the Schick Hydro Silk...so stick with the regular ones if you don&#x27;t want razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big tip: the thing that makes these work so well is the awesome moisture beads under the blades...but if you keep the razor in a location that is exposed to direct water contact every day, those little moisture beads will melt way and the razor will be unusable after a very short amount of time. So if you want to get the most usage out of these, store the razor just a few inches outside the shower itself. Hang it up on the little white hanger that comes with it, and HANG IT SO THAT THE BLADE PART IS ON THE BOTTOM, AND THE HANDLE IS ON THE TOP. Trust me on that, it will help keep the water from collecting inside the blade locking mechanism, which will keep it nice and clean for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to replace the handle!</li>
            <li> This is really good. No nicks, and a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> ***This review below is the one I wrote for the actual razor, however, I obtained a pack of refills with my razor so it counts for both. The campaign I participated in gave me a free razor, and 3 refill blades.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally obtained this product via the Bzzagent word of mouth company for one of their campaigns. I was a bit skeptical at first because I have been an avid user of men&#x27;s razors for a long time as women&#x27;s razors never seemed to work for me. I started using a men&#x27;s razor in my teens and never looked back, until now. I got my wonderful campaign box in the mail and started using it right away as we are supposed to with the campaigns. I was really shocked that I found I had a lot less issues with ingrown hairs (I am very prone to ingrowns no matter where it is I shave), no razor burn problems, really smooth, smoother longer than with the razors I had been using, and very comfortable in my hand. I officially have changed to a Schick Hydro Silk for women razor and I am never looking back! I sure hope my husband doesn&#x27;t mind a second hand razor for himself!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these razors. Prior to it, I was using the Schick Quatro, but I can safely say I won&#x27;t go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro is just that - it hydrates my skin and leaves it much softer after use for longer. The 5 blades provide a nice, close shave and help cut down on the stubbies, especially vital in the summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor itself is sturdy - I&#x27;ve used the same on for almost a year and it shows little sign of wear and tear. I clean it off reguarly to cut down on any dirt that can accumulate, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, these are a bit pricey for 4 cartridges, but it&#x27;s way cheaper than in the store. Plus I signed up for the subscription, so I don&#x27;t have to deal with running out and to pick more up in a few months - they&#x27;ll be auto shipped to me.</li>
            <li> Best little product ever... easy to use and the best results yet.I recommend this product. Can&#x27;t wait to buy more!!!</li>
            <li> I love these blades, and it&#x27;s cheaper to buy them here than at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of razors out there, this is by far my favorite one. It&#x27;s a really smooth shave that only takes one swipe up to get rid of everything. It has five blades with moisture strips…I hardly ever cut myself. I definitely recommend you try this if you&#x27;re on the hunt for a new razor!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite type of of razor.  Very satisfied with my item.  You get the closest shave without the irritation.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I think these are the best on the market.  We store them in alcohol between uses and each blade lasts about a onth.</li>
            <li> does not nick or cut my sensitive skin as much as other brands I tried like it as much as venus by gillette</li>
            <li> Not very impressed. Still looking for an ideal and economical way to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I love these razor blades. They actually leave a close shave leaving my skin nice a smooth. This is my go to razor now.</li>
            <li> It would be hard to nick yourself with these blades. They do a good job which lasts. Like &#x27;em a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of disposables, this razor is a nice sleek finish, infused shaving gel is a great time saver..</li>
            <li> These blades take some getting used to since they have a strip that gets activated by water and turns into a sort of &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; lubricant.  When the &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; runs out it is time to replace the blade.  My hubby dislikes the viscosity of the &amp;#34;goo&amp;#34; and it can form strands, but for leg shaving in a shower, it is pretty good because you don&#x27;t need to worry about the soap or foam running down your legs and being left shaving with just water.  I like these blades but I suppose they are not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used many kinds of razors over the years but none made me say WOW until this one. Blades glide smoothly over the skin and it is the closest shave I have ever had! I also found I could go isn&#x27;t between shaving longer! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else, just wish they would go down in price..... oh well.</li>
            <li> Great razors---last a long time.</li>
            <li> I liked this razor a lot so I replaced the blade. Definitely an upgrade from cheapie razors. No cuts. Very nice feeling to it.</li>
            <li> These razors, both the &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; are the best I have experienced for wherever you want to shave from the face, to the underarms and all the way down.  When combined with a good quality gel shave cream, they work better than anything else I have used and last up to a month, even with my steel wool-like face and body hair.</li>
            <li> Greatest razors ever, Um have to hide them from my husband lol</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love it GREAT</li>
            <li> oh i do love these razors. they catch everything, leave everything feeling smooth- but they really dull out fast if you don&#x27;t clean them throughly. however when you keep them clean, they last for a while.</li>
            <li> I use these blades for my armpits and legs. They are super smooth and the blade guards make it almost impossible to cut yourself. I would recommend them for anyone shaving anything.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Hydro Silk girl, but this last purchase left me really annoyed. There are faulty pieces/sections of blade and/or the quality has been reduced greatly.  All my recent shaves have been uncomfortable and left me with cuts.  Bummer...bc I really liked these cartridges and used to actually look forward to how gentle and smooth they WERE.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors for my skin, I get razor bumps constantly and my skin seems to hate shaving but these razors have been the best I have found so far. Been using them for awhile now.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I found for these razor blades for my daughter.  They were received very quickly and exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li> Nice product, great for sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> I really love these razor refills and they&#x27;re so nice to use. I was a longtime user of the Schick Intuition but I got sick of purchasing the expensive refills only to have half of the moisturizing bar fall off regularly. I came to Amazon to find something similar since I&#x27;m usually a quick shaver and don&#x27;t like to bother with shaving cream, and I found the Schick Hydro. I love it and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch to another razor. The Hydro is great because it&#x27;s moisturizing and you don&#x27;t need shaving cream, but it&#x27;s not bulky and impractical like the Intuition is. It&#x27;s easier to travel with and also less delicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one issue with the Hydro is that the refill blades smell awful straight out of the package! I would be able to live with a plastic-y smell, but these give off a horrible fish smell. I thought it was a fluke, but every single one smells like that. Luckily it goes away and it doesn&#x27;t transfer the awful smell to your skin, but if I were using that thing anywhere near my face I&#x27;d have a hard time sticking with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, it&#x27;s a great razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this from BazzAgent, and I really liked it the blades did a good job, didn&#x27;t rust easy, and I had no irritation while using them. I would definitely purchase this on my own</li>
            <li> I had used Gillette Venus razors for years and then ended up with one of these as a sample. I much prefer them, though I don&#x27;t dislike the Venus. The Hydro Silk has a nice lubricating strip which lasts much longer than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great blades, good price.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razors ever.  I got a free one as a promo and now I&#x27;ve ordered the 4 pack of replacement blades.  I am always fighting dry skin (especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant) and this razor leaves my skin silky smooth without having to lather up with moisturizing lotion all day.  Just be careful and don&#x27;t leave the blade in on the ledge of your tub with standing water.  The aloe strips will get gooey and start dissolving much faster if it doesn&#x27;t stay fairly dry between uses. I wish they had a holder for it to keep it off the side of my tub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer in this razor, and believe me i&#x27;ve tried them all,and finally settled on this one.it gives the best clean shave ever,no razor bumps,</li>
            <li> OMG this is the best razor i ever have.....i used to use venus but i changed it...and i love it my skin is so smooth. ..</li>
            <li> I remember the bit on MADtv about adding like 20 blades to a razor to make it more effective (the Spishak Mach20!) which is why I never went beyond 3-blade technology until now. MADtv be damned, these razors give the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I had only used disposable razors and those tore my legs up. I decided to research sethig else and so I tried this and its the best shave I have ever had. I needed something reliable because my leg hair unfortunately grows fast. Great pick!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.  Cheaper than Target and free shipping -- love it.</li>
            <li> as described and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love these blades so much--smooth shave and slightly moisturising. However, they are a little expensive, but personally, I think they&#x27;re worth buying. The price is cheaper than most stores, so I&#x27;d get it off of amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice product!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors!</li>
            <li> I am a man, and I prefer these blades to shave my head than anything I have ever bought.&lt;br /&gt;The best!</li>
            <li> These are better than Venus and I mean any of the Venus blades. One blade will last me well over 3 weeks of shaving every other day. The shave is smooth and my legs do not feel scraped.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor due to the lubrication strip and the close shave. Amazon prices are generally better than local stores unless you have an amazing coupon, so I usually just order them here and save $5 per pack. Occasionally, Amazon even has a coupon for them, so even better!</li>
            <li> Great buy.  Would do business with again.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I got a free razor in the mail last month and I love these blades. Theyr&#x27;re better then my old Venus Embrace blades, which I loved for years, but the Venus blades always butchered my poor legs, these however do not. These leave my legs super smooth and razor burn/knick free, all in one or two strokes too.&lt;br /&gt;The blades last a very long time too. These last for several weeks if not stored in the shower. My Venus blades lasted for maybe one week, tops.&lt;br /&gt;Not the closest shave in the bikini/under arm department, still have to use an electric shaver or wax in those areas, but hey if they save my poor sensitive legs from cuts AND save me the embarrassment of ugly, red razor bumps on my legs then they&#x27;re well worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve grown facial hair, I&#x27;ve always used my trusty Gillette Mach 3. I had that razor for over 15 years. That razor was awesome until my wife (then girlfriend) started stealing it and using it to shave her legs and armpits. My wife never had a good razor and always used those Bic disposable ones. So I can understand when she started stealing my razor for her shaves... but replaceable heads are expensive! This lasted for five years. I told her to stop, but she never listened... until she got this Schick Hydro Silk razor as a free gift from one of our wedding orders last year from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. She claims this is the best razor she&#x27;s ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t noticed, the Mach 3 has 3 razors vs the Hydro Silk&#x27;s 5. But the Hydro Silk has this water activated moisturizer (kind of like the conditioning strips on the Mach 3 blades but better). I never really had a reason to buy a better razor since she got a new one for free.... so I tried it one day. I guess more blades do mean better performance because I prefer her razor to mine. Although they do sell a Schick Hydro for men, this razor is essentially the same despite the pastel colors. But who cares! I secretly use hers all the time and she doesn&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for these refills... they are cheaper than my local Walmart so this is a really good buy. Be on the lookout for Amazon coupons for this too. The last 2 times I bought the refills, I got $2 off Amazon&#x27;s price from the coupon.</li>
            <li> quick shipping, great item!!!</li>
            <li> Refills came on time.Worked as expected very smooth shave</li>
            <li> It works, but not for long. &#x3D;\ You&#x27;ll get a nice clean shave and it leaves your skin feeling soft, but the moisturizing serum (the white dots above and below the blades) can only be used for a handful of times. What irritated me the most was when the serum melted off cartridge completely (just from my shower steam) and made a complete mess in my shower. It no longer has that &#x27;silk&#x27; softness and now feels like a dollar store brand razor. It&#x27;s such a shame because when you use it the first time, it&#x27;s amazing. I barely got any razor bumps and it was comfortable when going over my brazilian. The design on the handle provides good grip and comfort. However, to release the cartridge for replacement with a new one is not as fast/easy as the Venus brand razors and I also believe five blades is excessive. I would love for Schick to come up with a newer/better razor with that in mind.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite razor. Rarely causes irritation, shaves close, never a nick!</li>
            <li> After trying several different razors this is the one I keep coming back to.  Gives a clean, close shave.  I use it in the shower and love the handy shower suction cup for hanging it up when not in use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Received! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> These are great! and I can definitely save money by buying these refills as opposed to new complete razors all the time! They make your legs so silky too!</li>
            <li> I like these blades but they seem to dull quicker than my old Schick Quatro. I will probably go back.</li>
            <li> These blades are refills for the Hydro Silk shaver. I love the shaver and the blades last longer than any other disposable razor I have bought. The softness is unbelievable and sometimes I wonder if they are really doing the job because I have felt no nicks or cuts with them like other blades out there. I have facial hair under my chin which is thick and these blades really do the trick of giving a \\&quot;close\\&quot; and \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; shave. I have tried waxing with terrible results due to rash and bumps. These blades leave neither and are much better than any other I have tried and I have tried many in the past 30 years. Finally a blade for the woman who has to shave every day.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor: very smooth, gets a close shave, and leaves legs feeling moisturized. I have eczema, and these blades don&#x27;t aggravate it like some others do. I always order my replacement blades here. The only place where they&#x27;re cheaper is SAMs Club (and maybe Costco, but I haven&#x27;t checked).</li>
            <li> I used to be a die hard Gillette Venus lady. Then I ran out of refill blades and was low on cash. I had one of the new Schick Hydro Silk for Women razors laying around the house that I had received as a sample in the mail one day. I tried it and wasn&#x27;t quite sure at first. Then, when I was able to pick up some Venus refill blades, I could tell a HUGE difference between shaving with the two different brands. My skin felt smoother and more moisturized after using the Schick Hydro Silk than after using the Venus blades. Also, Schick is a way better value! I switched and never looked back!!</li>
            <li> I tried to switch to this razor from the Venus &amp; Olay 5 blade because this is cheaper.  I was not a fan and I went back to my old razor.</li>
            <li> These work great.  The moisturizer wears off rather quickly but I still use longer since they are pretty pricey!  I don&#x27;t change blades very often and these continue to work well for a few months.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. Add to that the subscribe and save options with Prime shipping and you can go wrong with the savings you get. This item is used a lot in my household so buying bulk via subscribe and save was a no brainer.</li>
            <li> Only razor I like to use. It&#x27;s moist and sharp the way you need it to be.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, the blades are the best.</li>
            <li> I love 5 blades, it works perfect to me. Each blade can last long time. I never need to worry about the shaving problem anymore after I found this.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly love getting a nice, smooth, clean shave with these razor blades.  I never get nicked with these razors.</li>
            <li> These are ok. i dont feel they glide as well as other schick ones. but they do work and the price is good</li>
            <li> I love these razors. I&#x27;ve tried what seems like a million razors and this one is my favorite. The five blades and whatever soft stuff they put outside the blades make for a really smooth shave. Plus, compared to other razors, these are relatively inexpensive if you buy them here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite razor blades.  The 5 blades really make a difference.  The blades last a long time and give a great shave.  Amazon is the cheapest place I have been able to find them.</li>
            <li> Love Schick...its the only razors I can use!</li>
            <li> My favorite razor. Great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Amazon gives me the opportunity to get these razors at a great price.  Plus ordering on-line I know the supply will be there  for me.  Sometimes when I go to the retail store the items I need are not in stock.</li>
            <li> The Hydro Silk is a truly great product. I use it most every day and have never had such a close, easy shave. This Schick has four separate blades, which is one more than my former favorite razor, which was also a Schick but only had three blades. And the blades are called \\&quot;silk\\&quot; for a reason. There is a little bar of lotion at the top of the blade cartridge that makes the blades slide smoothly over your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge is easy to install and remove and each one seems to last a long time. I only have to change blades a couple of times a month. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> wife says blade better than the competition will start using them all the time have them on subscribe and save</li>
            <li> I hate disposable razors and I shave only when necessary. I prefer to use the electric hair-ripper-out-ers but I don&#x27;t have the pain tolerance to use it on my pits. I am also prone to razor burn. I used men&#x27;s razors for awhile and they worked very well. I received this in a sample and I was actually very impressed. I&#x27;m not pleased that these blades are pricey but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I think the the Schick Hydro Silk cartridges are okay. They provide a decent shave but are definitely not the best shaving product out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a &amp;#34;water-activated&amp;#34; conditioning stuff is great. It definitely helps provide a smooth shave. However, because it is water activated, if the shower is too humid, or if the water splashes onto the razor, the conditioning stuff will ooze out of the razor head and it will be out of it by 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the conditioning stuff, I think the razor is only sub-par. The 5 blades are nice, but I have found without the conditioning stuff, I have to use shaving gel or else I cut up my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rather use the Venus razor with a bar that slowly wears down.</li>
            <li> best razor i have used ever. no razor burn, just dont store it in your shower, or the strip of moisture gel might get ruined.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves these refills as they provide her a very good shave and last a good time.</li>
            <li> Best out there. Good deal and quick to my door shipping!</li>
            <li> Two of the razor blades from this pack feel like they have a ragged edge. Not sure if this was just an off package but haven&#x27;t experienced this when purchasing in a store vs Amazon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this at a store or online. I got to try this through the website buzzagent in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had this around 2 weeks and have used this twice. My frist experience using the razor I would have gave the rating slightly different maybe a 3. But after my 2nd time using its differently a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;When I frist received this package I was super excited as I usually only buy the cheaper razors I&#x27;m excited when I actually get a more expensive one. AND this one had a trimmer which I personally hadn&#x27;t had the opportunity to try before. So excited I was. Notice it doesn&#x27;t take this mom much to get excited about. Lol&lt;br /&gt;So the packaging was awesome, it wasn&#x27;t all that hard to open. The razor felt a little heavy which Is to be expected if it&#x27;s both a trimmer and a razor and holds a battery I guess.&lt;br /&gt;So I finally got to use this sucker. I got in she shower, I made the mistake of not reading the directors on how to place the battery inside the razor before getting into the shower. So I literally had to get out, read my box just to figure out how to get the battery in. I feel as though it needs to be marked more clearer on the razor itself and not just on the box. (This was the main reason I didn&#x27;t like it as good at frist) I also noticed using this razor seemed to be better withOUT shaving cream. It leaves such a nice smooth shave. I absolutely felt like it&#x27;s the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the trimmer part. After figuring out how to place the battery, I then realized using a trimmer was much harder then I expected since u must hold the button down the entire time instead of just a on and off switch. However by the 2nd use of this. I&#x27;ve now grown much more funder of it and like it more now.&lt;br /&gt;On average I would shave once ever other day. Thank goodness I know what a great razor can actually do. I shave 1 time about ever 5 days using this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend. It&#x27;s Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, so shaving was a very painful thing to do all the time. I found this razor blades and that changed forever. Now I use them every time I shave and I get that silky feeling without any irritation. Each blade can be used fairly many times, so this is what I also like about them.</li>
            <li> They work great and are cheaper on amazon. Buying five will last a long time.</li>
            <li> They work well and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> These blades are the best razors out there. They help with  ingrown hair and cutting problems.&lt;br /&gt;They leave your skin feeling soft and not dried out like most other razors.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to any of my girl friends.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that has ever made my legs feel this smooth! I have very thick, dark stubborn hair and it glides over my skin so smooth and leaves them soft. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like the Hydro Silk shaver and the razor refills are really good too. Delivery was great and the razor refills arrived safely and intact. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best. Razor. Ever. Love this razor- I like the refillable version better than the disposable. Have told others about this razor and they have all agreed with me.....it&#x27;s fantastic! Close shave, no nicks or cuts. My only &#x27;complaint&#x27; is that the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. I use either soap or a shave gel anyway, so it&#x27;s not a big deal. Love it!!</li>
            <li> The razor heads are a great deal on Amazon, the price was great for that many and the quality was still there.</li>
            <li> Item is as described and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> They are cheaper buying them this way. Great razors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these razors for years now. They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> This is my regular every day razor. I really like the moisturizing strip and it does seem to shave well and last for a really long time and I use it every single day. I use dove soap and not shaving cream but if in a hurry this razor will shave without either fairly well especially if it&#x27;s newer.</li>
            <li> these are supposed to be a 4pack of blades...well I opened both packages and there were only 2 per pack....I paid for double the replacement blades...&amp; got only half the product...this is a rip off!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this razor free from bzzagent. I normally wouldn&#x27;t write an amazon review for something like that, but I am just so impressed by this blade. My legs are super sensitive and prone to razor burn, this razor was perfect. It left my legs super soft and my skin happy. These do not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Great product and cheaper then the stores.</li>
            <li> I love these razors, but they are very expensive. I guess all razors are though. Also... I wish the comfort strip would last longer. It dries out pretty quickly, even without use.</li>
            <li> Have always use the brand like the price</li>
            <li> Smooth as a babies ass</li>
            <li> Works well with my razor.</li>
            <li> I feel like I get a closer shave with a man&#x27;s razor... They are definitely silky tho :)</li>
            <li> Love these! couldn&#x27;t imagine going back to any other razor!</li>
            <li> I have used Venus for years, but after discovering Schick Hydro Silk, I have switched over.  Honestly, my legs have never been this silky smooth - I get a consistent shave every time.  Plus, there are moisturizers in the razor blade which have totally natural ingredients (other moisturizing razor blades have parabens in them which I don&#x27;t like).  These are reasonable, give a close shave, and leave me with the smoothest legs - perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> I used to use the Venus and Intuition razors with the thick bars around them.  I found the Intuition lost the soap surrounding very quickly, and when they were brand new they didn&#x27;t shave as well because of the large border.  I switched to Venus, and found the smaller lotion bar to be a bit better, but it still wasn&#x27;t as close a shave when they were brand new, and not as easy a shave when the lotion bar was almost gone.  On a whim I decided to try these, and am I glad I did.  I don&#x27;t know how they get so moisture, but those little dots really work.  I don&#x27;t like using shaving cream, so I just rely on the razor moisturizer.  This one keeps going and going and going; even my husband has started using it.  I can get quite a few shaves from one refill, and the handle of the razor feels very comfortable when shaving.  It also gives a very close shave each time, from when it&#x27;s brand new to when the moisturizer dots are almost gone.</li>
            <li> I love using these razor&#x27;s to shave my head and my wife loves using them to shave her legs and underarms.</li>
            <li> it seems a little hard to control and the head comes out if you drop it.  overall a great product and I do like the cartridges that are made for this.</li>
            <li> Nice price, great quality, my wife love it</li>
            <li> This is hands down the longest lasting razor head I&#x27;ve found. No more dealing with Venus, thank god!</li>
            <li> I like the conditioning stuff that helps soften skin and makes shaving smoother</li>
            <li> I always repurchase these blades when they run out. Tried many different brands such as venus etc and they are NOTHING compared to this. Ladies, if you have sensitive skin and want the closest/ effortless shave, this is definitely the razor for you. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor, always smooth and non-irritating</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and hate shaving, but this razor is amazing and never gives me razor burn. By far the best razor out there. At first I thought 5 blades was overkill but trust me it&#x27;s better than going back over missed hairs or pushing the blades down causing irritation. I used this with eos shave cream...I was impressed with the results</li>
            <li> Every woman should use these.  Thirty plus years of shaving pits and legs have never been so easy.</li>
            <li> These cut very well.  Cheaper than in the stores.  Love the pivoting head.  The handle of the razor is easy to hold in the shower.</li>
            <li> my step daughter loves these blades. I buy them for her. She is very happy with them. they are long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is a vast improvement over my previous shaver. It shaves very close and glides over bumps to prevent cuts.</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;-5 blades + hydration gel makes legs the smoothest ever&lt;br /&gt;-longevity of blades, lasts for weeks (depending on usage)&lt;br /&gt;-easy to snap on and off, don&#x27;t come apart if dropped in shower/tub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-price. wish it was cheaper, but worth the extra $</li>
            <li> best razor out there!</li>
            <li> I got a trial pack of these from the Vine program, I fell in love with them. I bought this and the razor system for my daughter telling her how much I loved them. She said, I already use them, they are my new favorite razor! So she was excited to get a slew of them from me! They really do a great job and my daughter said she gets zero razor burn from these and she&#x27;s always had an issue with it. So, on OUR recommendation, give it a try. I order them on the subscribe and save and that makes them nearly \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; and definitely inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Best razors I&#x27;ve ever used! Love them super close shave!</li>
