            <li>It is widely regarded as the best polish on the market.</li>
            <li>I love OPI nail polish, and this is the perfect dark purple color.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much, but found out my salon was no longer selling it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this color and its perfect for all year round.  </li>

            <li>The color is so luscious and rich</li>
            <li>I was so excited about the Casino Royale color.</li>
            <li>true to color in bottle.  </li>
            <li>Casino Royale is a gorgeous color, and the quality is OPI standard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had friends ask to borrow it from me because they love it so much too.</li>
            <li>The color is absolutely lovely, and very versatile.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty red-violet color.</li>
            <li>color was not as pretty as the pictures online.</li>
            <li>I picked out this color at the salon for my first pedicure of the season.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Works best with opi top and base coats.</li>
            <li>: I attempted to contact seller and got an incredibly snarky reply that colors look differently on the screen and they would only allow it to be returned if I shipped it back</li>
            <li>The photo is very misleading, and I plan to return it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely more of a purple than a red (which is what I was expecting due to the product pictures), but the color is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this color.</li>
            <li>I thought that it would be a little more purple than it was</li>
            <li>This color is not as dark as &amp;#34; in the car pool.&amp;#34; Seems to look great whether my nails are running short or long.</li>
            <li>going to wear it on New Years&#x27;s Eve</li>
            <li>Arrived fast double wrapped.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dark purple at all.</li>
            <li>The photo depicts a very deep purple and is absolutely nothing like the actual product I received today.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package this morning was I ever surprised to find a bottle of purple polish, not like the cranberry red as shown.  </li>
            <li>It was here in a few days, the product was exactly what she likes.</li>

            <li> When it arrived in the mail, I was very disappointed to see that it is more of a berry;</li>
            <li> I could even get away with one coat when lazy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.  </li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately I opened it and painted one nail to verify that it indeed was not the color</li>

            <li> It made a very good stocking stuffer</li>
            <li> fav nail brand, great color</li>
            <li> When I opened the package this morning was I ever surprised to find a bottle of purple polish, not like the cranberry red as shown.  Still working with Nailmart on returning it.</li>
            <li> color was not as pretty as the pictures online. already gave this away to someone :( won&#x27;t buy polish anymore online that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> This is the only color I use on my toenails. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely more of a purple than a red (which is what I was expecting due to the product pictures), but the color is fabulous. I have an olive skin tone, and this color pairs wonderfully with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence, I&#x27;d say try it out! It&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this color and its perfect for all year round.  It goes on easy and dries relatively quick. very pleased</li>
            <li> This color looks NOTHING like the picture. It&#x27;s not dark purple at all. It looks more like a medium violet/red.</li>
            <li> Great color last long beautiful&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to all my friends&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to wear it on New Years&#x27;s Eve</li>
            <li> Great color, lasts several weeks. Would reccommend to a friend. Works best with opi top and base coats. Love this collection!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI.  Love the color!  Use Seche Vita as base and top and the color lasts for over a week!</li>
            <li> Stocking stuffer for girlfriend.  she says,  strong finish, does not chip.  true to color in bottle.  goes on smooth.  dries evenly and glossy.  says is among the best she has ever used.</li>
            <li> Every time I have worn this polish, I have had people ask me where I got my nails done. They&#x27;re shocked to learn I did them myself! Casino Royale is a gorgeous color, and the quality is OPI standard.</li>
            <li> A very lovely color. I don&#x27;t understand though how people can call this a purple/berry shade. It&#x27;s a very pretty red-violet color. Coverage was very good in 2 coats. OPI quality shows again.</li>
            <li> This color is not as dark as &amp;#34; in the car pool.&amp;#34; Seems to look great whether my nails are running short or long. Not too blue, not too orange....it goes with everything. My fav in the Skyfall collection, I think. Arrived fast double wrapped.</li>
            <li> love the color, it applies very smoothly and it&#x27;s great quality, would definitely purchase again, need two coats to be opaque</li>
            <li> Bought as a Christmas gift for my wife. It was here in a few days, the product was exactly what she likes. Excellent product, excellent service.</li>
            <li> OPI has always had great quality in nail polish and innovators in colors and shades. This color is no exception. It looks elegant and sophisticated on any skin color</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this purchase. The photo depicts a very deep purple and is absolutely nothing like the actual product I received today. I got a bottle of berry colored polish. I am returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I attempted to contact seller and got an incredibly snarky reply that colors look differently on the screen and they would only allow it to be returned if I shipped it back and they verified it was unused. Well, unfortunately I opened it and painted one nail to verify that it indeed was not the color I thought I was buying, so forget it. I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely color that is very becoming. The price was good and it arrived quickly. OPI polishes are of the highest quality. I would shop here again.</li>

            <li> Great color, doesn&#x27;t chip easily. The polish goes on nicely, and I got a great color from just two coats. I could even get away with one coat when lazy.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Casino Royale shade, and I was under the impression that it was a dark royal purple.  When it arrived in the mail, I was very disappointed to see that it is more of a berry; almost plum.  The photo is very misleading, and I plan to return it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this polish. The color is so luscious and rich I feel so decadent wearing it.</li>
            <li> I picked out this color at the salon for my first pedicure of the season. Loved it so much, but found out my salon was no longer selling it. I found it online and ordered 2.</li>

            <li> I was so excited about the Casino Royale color. It looked like a beautiful purple but when it arrived it was a rosy  plum color. According to other reviews the seller was not helpful with regards to returning the product. So I&#x27;ll just save myself the hassle and eat the cost. But I won&#x27;t buy from them again. And I&#x27;m not likely to buy nail polish online again either.</li>
            <li> I love OPI nail polish, and this is the perfect dark purple color.  A great color collection from OPI!  I highly recommend this color.</li>
