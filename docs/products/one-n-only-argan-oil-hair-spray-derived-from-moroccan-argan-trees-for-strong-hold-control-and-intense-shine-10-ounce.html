            <li>its a nice spary since it includes oil in it and</li>
            <li>beautiful shiny and soft hold!!!!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, love how it smells.  </li>
            <li>This would probably work great for people who don&#x27;t have issues getting their hair to curl in the first place.</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>One&#x27;n&#x27;only leaves my perfect.</li>
            <li>Love argan oil hair spray.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, just pricey.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This hairspray left my hair shiny, lightweight and held the style perfectly without making it crunchy or sticky.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it.</li>
            <li>However my barber used this on my hair today for the first time and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great smelling hair-spray and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, but yet the hold is great.</li>
            <li>But the most important thing this product does is it adds shine and moisture.  </li>
            <li>Repeat buyer, love the product and shipper is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair still fell very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, just over my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important me as I have allergy issues.  </li>
            <li>I think that it is good for my hair, but as far as hold</li>
            <li>Great for my fine and sometimes dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have used cleansing conditioners instead of shampoo and conditioners for over a year and have been amazed at how fast my hair has grown and how healthy it has become.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and clean without being overbearing.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray, but mainly for the smell and the benefits of using it.  </li>
            <li>Even better than high end pricey products.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair cut in a pixie.</li>
            <li>I had used the actual oil before and really liked the scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Who ever thought hairspray could put a smile on your face??</li>
            <li>It is brushable and keeps my hair looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely light, almost to the point of not really even being a hairspray, but more of a hair fragrance spray.</li>
            <li>I have long hair below my shoulders and it is naturally light  brown with some light grey underneath and kind of looks like hi-lights.  </li>
            <li>Really excellent...thanks!</li>
            <li>This product provides a nice hold without the stiffness of other products.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and have already reordered.</li>
            <li>The online price is much lower than going to Ulta.</li>
            <li>brushes right out leaving hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It also smells a lot better than other hair sprays.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair too stiff.</li>
            <li>Tried many hairsprays but never satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I use hot rollers on my hair every couple of days and have been using regular hair spray</li>
            <li>but it does softly hold by loose hot roller curls really well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nutty oily spicy smell that has a subtly exotic scent that&#x27;s hard to explain.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin and scalp had no complaints.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>and I feel guilty every time I do and feel like I am undoing the good from the cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I only use products like pomade that give a decent hold while still looking natural.  </li>
            <li>This one left my hair very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look thick and healthy instead of dry and crunchy.</li>
            <li>It might be too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; if you have thin fine hair.</li>

            <li> I have thick full black hair that has a ton of life and body.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, expensive, and everything in between.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s when I searched further to see if they had other hair care products as well,</li>
            <li> Also, I have dry hair and with the cleansing conditioner I go from 6 - 8 days without washing my hair</li>
            <li> Most hair products for short, pieced-out styles or \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; will dry the ever-lovin&#x27; crap out of your hair, and don&#x27;t always deliver on claims.</li>
            <li> do not work make hair rough</li>
            <li> that helps hair from drying up.but the only issue i noticed is , its makes hair not free flowing..</li>
            <li> It gives you enough hold so that your hair stays in place, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard.</li>
            <li> I hate putting a lot of product in my hair for the most part because it either doesn&#x27;t hold well enough for my thick hair</li>
            <li> Bonus: my hair appears healthier even after washing it out and less oily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a very gentle hold, but enough to help tame my thick hair, and it didn&#x27;t give a crazy gel</li>
            <li> I still can feel it in my hair, and it&#x27;s not too stiff.</li>
            <li> Hold hair in place with a shine...does not make the hair stiff or plastic looking and</li>
            <li> So, I usually use mousse.</li>
            <li> I was watching a youtube video and they suggested this one saying that it won&#x27;t make your hair hard.</li>
            <li> My hair is relaxed and very thick.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I really hate using hair spray because of how my hair feels after I have used one, like a helmet.</li>

            <li> Favorite hairspray ever!  Great price, will be purchasing from here from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of hairspray in my life. Cheap, expensive, and everything in between. I am obsessed with this stuff. It makes my hair look thick and healthy instead of dry and crunchy.</li>
            <li> Love argan oil hair spray.  wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Love the product, just pricey.</li>
            <li> do not work make hair rough</li>
            <li> My hair looks, smells and feels wonderful and healthy.  I can use it almost 1 wk before washing by just brushing it out at night.  No stiffness.  I have long hair below my shoulders and it is naturally light  brown with some light grey underneath and kind of looks like hi-lights.  Here&#x27;s the kicker , I am 70 years of age and you wouldn&#x27;t believe it.  Honest!  I am sometimes called &#x27;sunshine&#x27; cause everything seems to be exceptionally shiny :0)&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling hair-spray and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff, but yet the hold is great. Love it.</li>
            <li> I like the hair spray, although I had been trying to find the kind in the silver container that us Argan hair spray.</li>
            <li> I have used cleansing conditioners instead of shampoo and conditioners for over a year and have been amazed at how fast my hair has grown and how healthy it has become.  I use hot rollers on my hair every couple of days and have been using regular hair spray and I feel guilty every time I do and feel like I am undoing the good from the cleansing conditioner.  Also, I have dry hair and with the cleansing conditioner I go from 6 - 8 days without washing my hair so hair spray is going to build up in my hair before I wash it out.  I stumbled upon this at Sally&#x27;s Beauty on sale and decided to give it a try and it worked great.  The hold is not going to be as great as with extra-hold hair spray but it does softly hold by loose hot roller curls really well.  But the most important thing this product does is it adds shine and moisture.  I use this with the moisturizing spray and together they help keep my hair as shiny and bouncy on day 7 as my cleansing conditioner does on day one.</li>
            <li> Not only does it hold well, it has a pleasant smell.  That&#x27;s important me as I have allergy issues.  I had used the actual oil before and really liked the scent.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I searched further to see if they had other hair care products as well, and voila . . found it here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. After I cut my hair into a pixie cut, my texture changed once I started to grow back out. My hair is relaxed and very thick. And now it does not hold a curl. I can curl or bump my hair an d it will be gone in 10 minutes. This didn&#x27;t solve my problem. My hair still fell very quickly. I still can feel it in my hair, and it&#x27;s not too stiff. This would probably work great for people who don&#x27;t have issues getting their hair to curl in the first place.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! beautiful shiny and soft hold!!!!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair cut in a pixie. I&#x27;ve had this style for 8 years, and used to be a hair model for salons, so I&#x27;ve tried just about every styling product known to man, including naturals and DIY recipes. Trust me when I tell you that this is the BEST hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used! Most hair products for short, pieced-out styles or \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; will dry the ever-lovin&#x27; crap out of your hair, and don&#x27;t always deliver on claims. This hairspray left my hair shiny, lightweight and held the style perfectly without making it crunchy or sticky. No cotton-candy head! No flakes! It provided volume, and it washed out great after a 12 hour shift. My sensitive skin and scalp had no complaints. The scent is fresh and clean without being overbearing. Bonus: my hair appears healthier even after washing it out and less oily.  I bought this at Ulta, but will buy from Amazon with my Prime membership from now on. Who ever thought hairspray could put a smile on your face?? 5 shiny stars for this product!!</li>
            <li> This is a good hair spray with a nice fragrance.  I really like it and have already reordered.</li>
            <li> It provides a light hold, and great shine. I love the smell and like that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair too stiff.</li>
            <li> Holds my curls perfectly!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray.  I love the way it smells.  It is not sticky.  It is brushable and keeps my hair looking fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Repeat buyer, love the product and shipper is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t order this product. I ordered the oil and they sent this. Turned out to be a good mistake. I love this hairspray. A lot of hairspray are sticky. This one left my hair very soft and shiny. I have very thick, curly hair. I use this when I flat iron it. It might be too &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; if you have thin fine hair. For me though, great product!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I really hate using hair spray because of how my hair feels after I have used one, like a helmet. So, I usually use mousse. However, this one is different. I was watching a youtube video and they suggested this one saying that it won&#x27;t make your hair hard. So, I decided to give it a try because although I like the results of using a mousse, I don&#x27;t like that you have to get it all over your hands. I was pleasantly surprised. It gives you enough hold so that your hair stays in place, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard. It also smells a lot better than other hair sprays. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This hair spray provides a meduim hold and it smells really good. I&#x27;ve been using it a long time</li>
            <li> Hold hair in place with a shine...does not make the hair stiff or plastic looking and brushes right out leaving hair soft and manageable.  Even better than high end pricey products.  So glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man of Italian heritage.  I have thick full black hair that has a ton of life and body.  I hate putting a lot of product in my hair for the most part because it either doesn&#x27;t hold well enough for my thick hair or I get that Italian jersey shore look of helmet hair.  I only use products like pomade that give a decent hold while still looking natural.  However my barber used this on my hair today for the first time and I loved it.  It&#x27;s got a very gentle hold, but enough to help tame my thick hair, and it didn&#x27;t give a crazy gel helmet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the best part.  The smell is out of this world.  It&#x27;s a nutty oily spicy smell that has a subtly exotic scent that&#x27;s hard to explain.  My wife loves it and now I&#x27;m going to have to order some for myself.</li>
            <li> I feel it on my hair after I spray, but after a bit I comb out my hair and the style keeps its bounce.  I think it smells good, but the smell does wear off after a bit.  I have fine hair, just over my shoulders.  If I use a lot, it holds like Aquanet to me, so I think it&#x27;s a great choice to keep hair healthy.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, love how it smells.  Just spray on and comb thru.  The online price is much lower than going to Ulta.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!  Great for my fine and sometimes dry hair.</li>
            <li> very good product to have</li>
            <li> its a nice spary since it includes oil in it and that helps hair from drying up.but the only issue i noticed is , its makes hair not free flowing..may be i have to try it again and see its usage, . instead i am using argan oil (like 2 pumps) and thats helping me comtrol frizz.</li>
            <li> This product provides a nice hold without the stiffness of other products.  The best part is that it not drying.</li>
