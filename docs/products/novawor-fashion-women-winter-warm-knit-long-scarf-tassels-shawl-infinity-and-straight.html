            <li>This is a really cute and stylish scarf.</li>
            <li>but it is warm and comfortable around the neck.</li>
            <li>We love scarves in my family..</li>
            <li>probably my favorite purchase of the year</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super warm and cute.</li>
            <li>Item was as described and is beautiful but was a gift and seemed to take a great deal of time to arrive (well past birthday).  </li>
            <li>So I washed them and they smell better and are much softer and am more pleased with them now.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant to the touch, soft and very high quality.</li>
            <li>Very nice, very long &#x27;tunnel&#x27; that one folds in on itself...looks nice, keeps in warmth in wind, but light weight to wear all day.&lt;br /&gt;Is great width so can be pulled up in back over head for a hanging scarf look if snowing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>SUPER CUTE &amp; OH</li>
            <li>and it was super cheap!</li>
            <li>Super cute.</li>
            <li>looks more very pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s warm and thick, and is very good quality.  </li>
            <li>It is nice that it can be used both ways, as an infinity or as a straight scarf.</li>
            <li>I love this just the right size for your neck.</li>
            <li>I love it plus fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>The pictures truly depict how the scarf fits...just make sure to read the instructions it comes with because there is a certain way to wear them.</li>
            <li>I think I will be able to work it out to be very close.  </li>
            <li>That was a nice added touch and unexpected.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty scarf.  </li>
            <li>Not as full ad I was hoping but still a pretty scarf.</li>
            <li>Worth t</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>The styles you can create with them are fun</li>
            <li>However, it was WELL WORTH</li>
            <li>So versatile and user friendly that my 20 year old daughter tried to steal it!</li>
            <li>So, it DOES look exactly like what is pictured.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package I thought this is not what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Well after reading another review, I finally figured out how to wear the scarf and love it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s SUPER soft.</li>
            <li>It can be used as straight scarf or an infinity scarf.  </li>
            <li>Very comfy.</li>
            <li>(thanks everyone).</li>
            <li>All there is to it is to stick your head through the whole thing and tug and pull on it around your neck until you get the look you desire.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, pretty</li>
            <li>I will go back and by more different colors.</li>
            <li>I love this scarf, very different from what you see being worn daily.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and big.</li>
            <li>Wow, now my daughter wants it and is trying to take it from me.</li>
            <li>It also originally said it wouldn&#x27;t be here for a little over a month ended up coming in a few days, which is also nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s stretches and goes right back into shape.</li>
            <li>Well you put it on the exact opposite that you would normally wear a scarf.</li>
            <li>Its a knit blend and very soft.  </li>
            <li>it looks like a regular scarf with you first see it.</li>
            <li>buy this it is so so so soft.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of hard to understand, but getting online and reading other reviews I understood it.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re kind of hard to understand, but getting online and reading other reviews I understood it.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with how it looks in real life.</li>
            <li> Essentially the scarf is a long tube</li>
            <li> It can be worn 2 ways: as a normal long scarf or as a fluffy infinity scarf.</li>
            <li> The material is very soft and cozy.</li>
            <li> the gray gauzy side and the dark khaki open fish net...</li>
            <li> It is actually wide enough to wear in a off one shoulder style.</li>
            <li> It came as a long narrow scarf with the front of the scarf in the picture on one side and a solid pattern on the back but each end is open and you can take one end and feed it through the scarf and you end up with a tube.  </li>
            <li> And I ordered khaki and the color I got looks like grey.</li>
            <li> It is a bit smaller than expected, but arrived on time.</li>
            <li> but then realized it opened all the way down the middle.</li>
            <li> but the scarf opens in the center.  </li>
            <li> Slip your head THRU the center hole - it stretches out &amp; loops around your neck just like an infinite scarf</li>
            <li> Does not really look like the picture.</li>
            <li> BUT THEN I read the instructions about slipping my head through the hole</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all....</li>
            <li> I intend to order in other colors.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I thought they sent the wrong thing, or that the picture had been misleading.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s stretchy) by reading the other reviews</li>
            <li> Came with no directions but after reading other reviews, I figured it out.</li>
            <li> goes well with other items with a khaki or &amp;#34;greyish&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like that they are not bulky; during the cold weather layering while necessary can be a challenge when it comes to looks and comfort if the scarves provide too much fabric</li>
            <li> /&gt;Colors depicted correctly here for the Khaki &amp; dark gray version.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered</li>
            <li> VERY well-made, looks expensive,</li>
            <li> Although mine is still looking a little tighter than the picture</li>
            <li> Already received quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very delicate, so you must be careful to put jewelry on after you already have it on.  </li>
            <li> il&#x27;s also to small  </li>
            <li> was a little bit confused when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Not pleased, picture is deceiving!</li>
            <li> the scarf is very small and thin.</li>
            <li> but when i got it i was so confused why it wasn&#x27;t an infintity scarf</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to expensive to return it.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong.</li>
            <li> random</li>
            <li> I thought I received the wrong scarf - it looks nothing like the picture UNTIL I figured out how to wear it!</li>
            <li> The scarves smelled awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this scarf.  I intend to order in other colors.  Its a knit blend and very soft.  It can be used as straight scarf or an infinity scarf.  I&#x27;ve noticed some reviewer don&#x27;t realize but the scarf opens in the center.  You have to work your hands though it and open.  Once done it drapes just like in the picture.  It is actually wide enough to wear in a off one shoulder style.</li>
            <li> Very happy with item &amp; seller would by again.</li>
            <li> Not as full ad I was hoping but still a pretty scarf.</li>
            <li> buy this it is so so so soft. looks more very pretty.</li>
            <li> Love these...I bought two. I get complements all the time. I&#x27;m gonna buy one for my sister. Don&#x27;t hesitate, buy it!</li>
            <li> Not what was pictured. Tried returning but they wouldn&#x27;t allow a return? Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful,  the material is so soft and amazing I love it! I will go back and by more different colors. The seller did a great job with the description thank you</li>
            <li> il&#x27;s also to small  not what I thought</li>
            <li> Looks good on and is fun to try on.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!!!! took me asking my friend how it worked but once I learned love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> So versatile and user friendly that my 20 year old daughter tried to steal it!</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I thought they sent the wrong thing, or that the picture had been misleading. But I found the instructions and it made sense. They&#x27;re kind of hard to understand, but getting online and reading other reviews I understood it. It looks great, colors are like the picture, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting this but it&#x27;s SUPER soft. Which is a nice bonus. It also originally said it wouldn&#x27;t be here for a little over a month ended up coming in a few days, which is also nice.</li>
            <li> I thought I received the wrong scarf - it looks nothing like the picture UNTIL I figured out how to wear it! Slip your head THRU the center hole - it stretches out &amp; loops around your neck just like an infinite scarf should:) So, it DOES look exactly like what is pictured. Love this scarf!!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this scarf is prettier than I imagined!!!  It&#x27;s warm and thick, and is very good quality.  My God, I want to wear this every day!</li>
            <li> I love this just the right size for your neck.</li>
            <li> Does not really look like the picture. I was not pleased with how it looks in real life. It looks kind of cheap</li>
            <li> SO many compliments when wearing this scarf! Love the different ways you can wear it and for a great price!</li>
            <li> Very nice, very long &#x27;tunnel&#x27; that one folds in on itself...looks nice, keeps in warmth in wind, but light weight to wear all day.&lt;br /&gt;Is great width so can be pulled up in back over head for a hanging scarf look if snowing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Two versions melded together...the gray gauzy side and the dark khaki open fish net...both sections have fringe/tassels.&lt;br /&gt;Colors depicted correctly here for the Khaki &amp; dark gray version.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered when was a 2 day Prime and thought a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for infinity scarf.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I thought this is not what I ordered.  Then I read the reviews and thought it definitely isn&#x27;t as everyone else is commenting.  BUT THEN I read the instructions about slipping my head through the hole and I played with the scarf.  It came as a long narrow scarf with the front of the scarf in the picture on one side and a solid pattern on the back but each end is open and you can take one end and feed it through the scarf and you end up with a tube.  Then you can stretch it.  Although mine is still looking a little tighter than the picture I think I will be able to work it out to be very close.  It is nice that it can be used both ways, as an infinity or as a straight scarf.</li>
            <li> Nice scarf!! Worth t&lt;br /&gt;He wait!</li>
            <li> This scarf is amazing it&#x27;s stretches and goes right back into shape. Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Very comfy. Fits nice. Already received quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! SUPER CUTE &amp; OH SO CHIC. I WANT IN MORE COLORS</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty scarf.  It&#x27;s very delicate, so you must be careful to put jewelry on after you already have it on.  Otherwise, great buy.  I get many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Did not realize that this was shipping from China and nothing in ad pointed to that.  Item was as described and is beautiful but was a gift and seemed to take a great deal of time to arrive (well past birthday).  It did in fact arrive within window as promised.  I would buy again from this seller but give extra time for shipping</li>
            <li> the scarf is very small and thin. My package arrived opened and no manual on the bag. It&#x27;s to expensive to return it. And I ordered khaki and the color I got looks like grey.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, easy transaction, wonderful product. Nothing wrong. Everything is good.</li>
            <li> Colors are the same completely different scarf I got in the mail.</li>
            <li> I love it plus fast shipping! Def satisfied</li>
            <li> When you open the package it throws you...but it&#x27;s super warm and cute. I only figured out I had to slip my head through the hole (it&#x27;s stretchy) by reading the other reviews (thanks everyone). I probably got it within a week and It will stretch over time. I&#x27;m probably going to order the different colors. :D</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, the khaki and beige color, and received them yesterday. It is international shipping so allow a couple weeks for delivery. I bought for $1.59 each+ shipping. I am really happy with this purchase! The material is very soft and cozy. The pictures truly depict how the scarf fits...just make sure to read the instructions it comes with because there is a certain way to wear them. I would say that the beige one I recieved is more like an off-white, but I am still happy with the color. Both of my scarves came with a purple silk bag to store them in. 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments on this scarf! I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s soft, pretty and it was super cheap! GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> Bought these as  gifts. Item arrived on time. Exactly as described. Very pretty and big. The scarves smelled awful. So I washed them and they smell better and are much softer and am more pleased with them now. Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> The most beautiful!! When I got this I was like what the hell, how do you make it look like this on the model?! Well you put it on the exact opposite that you would normally wear a scarf. You feed your arms through the scarf like it&#x27;s a tunnel, when you get your arm to the opening of the end of the scarf stretch it out a bit, play with it and feel your head through. You will have to do this according the the color in the photo. I love it so much! I will buy many more colors! Very warm, snug and adorable. Great buy.</li>
            <li> was a little bit confused when it arrived. The directions did nothing for me. All there is to it is to stick your head through the whole thing and tug and pull on it around your neck until you get the look you desire. I love this scarf, very different from what you see being worn daily. A lil on the bulky side, but I don&#x27;t mind it. Will buy in more colors</li>
            <li> Does not hang the same on me, as it does in the picture.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all.... Not pleased, picture is deceiving!</li>
            <li> beautiful scarf however please send me the video again to show how to make it an infinity scarf.  thank you.</li>
            <li> Super cute. Came with no directions but after reading other reviews, I figured it out. It can be worn 2 ways: as a normal long scarf or as a fluffy infinity scarf. Essentially the scarf is a long tube and you just open the tube and stick your neck through. Really warm and attractive.</li>
            <li> I like this scarf a lot. Very cute and warm. I like to wear it the second way, when you open it and put it over your head.</li>
            <li> Personally I like these scarves and ordered them in several different colors.  I like that they are not bulky; during the cold weather layering while necessary can be a challenge when it comes to looks and comfort if the scarves provide too much fabric it can be overwhelming. They are warm  yet lightweight.  The styles you can create with them are fun You can wear them as the picture indicates or don&#x27;t open it and wear it with all the versatility of a rectangular scarf.</li>
            <li> This is a really cute and stylish scarf. It&#x27;s not too heavy but it is warm and comfortable around the neck.</li>
            <li> love it a lot of nice compliments when I wore it</li>
            <li> Well after reading another review, I finally figured out how to wear the scarf and love it. Wow, now my daughter wants it and is trying to take it from me. We love scarves in my family..</li>
            <li> Warm &amp; fashionable. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> coolest thing ever! please read instructions. random i know but when i got it i was so confused why it wasn&#x27;t an infintity scarf but then realized it opened all the way down the middle. it looks like a regular scarf with you first see it. probably my favorite purchase of the year</li>
            <li> NOT LIKE PIX.  RETURNING IT.</li>
            <li> This scarf took quite some time to come...as it came from China.  However, it was WELL WORTH THE WAIT.  VERY well-made, looks expensive, goes well with other items with a khaki or &amp;#34;greyish&amp;#34; hue.  You can use it as it looks or make it smaller for around the neck....choose your own style!</li>
            <li> It is a bit smaller than expected, but arrived on time. Each scarf came with an additional purple mesh bag to gift the item. That was a nice added touch and unexpected.</li>
            <li> I like it! Very pleasant to the touch, soft and very high quality. Looks good and very stylish.</li>
