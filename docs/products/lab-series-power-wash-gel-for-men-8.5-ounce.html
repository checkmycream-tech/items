            <li>I love this stuff and recommend it to friends who ask or are in need.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much the best face wash on the planet.</li>
            <li>I also use a small scrub to make sure my skin is thoroughly scrubbed for best effect.</li>
            <li>Great product for male skin care.</li>
            <li>My skin remains smooth after washing with this product.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely too, so you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot to get clean.</li>
            <li>All of the Lab products makes my skin feel clean, flexible, moist without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I use just a touch of this lotion in the shower, a few drops suffice for hair and body, and it leaves me feeling clean and fresh, a very pleasant after-shower feeling.</li>
            <li>good for daily use.</li>
            <li>This is the first Lab Series product that I ever bought and so far I am more than satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I can use the eye-treat cream around my eyes without it irritating them which is good, and I feel like it softens up age lines nicely.    </li>
            <li>The whole day my face felt really relaxed and smooth with no razor burns or anything like that.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and smooth without being oily at all.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s better than regular soap</li>
            <li>As a 43 year old guy, I&#x27;m starting to get to that point where I want to take care of my face before it starts to look any more beat up than it already is!  </li>
            <li>nice clear blue face wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a pretty big fan of the Light Moisture Lotion.  </li>
            <li>, both are very high quality.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff for my face and ended up using it on my whole body.</li>
            <li>On a hot, sunscreen-caked day, it takes a little more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the company and this product.</li>
            <li>Dosing it out is very easy: start small and work your way up to what your particular face needs.</li>
            <li>Love this, use this everyday</li>
            <li>If there was only one product a guy was willing to purchase for his face, I&#x27;d say this would be it.  </li>
            <li>Now...before you think I&#x27;m a shill for this company, I&#x27;ve also used the Lab Series Overnight Renewal lotion which good enough, but ridiculously overpriced.  </li>
            <li>i use frequently.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, about the size of a dime (maybe a quarter if you&#x27;ve got a big face!)  </li>
            <li>(Not one of those old mother dogs with the saggy teets...</li>
            <li>This power wash works very well, does not leave your face feeling dry at all, big plus.</li>

            <li> I use this in conjunction with their face scrub that I do once a week, and use the eye-treat cream around my eyes everyday.  </li>
            <li> peppermint is totally unnecessary and is actually an irritant.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether this is supposed to help people who have oily skin, but it did help me.</li>

            <li> This is the first Lab Series product that I ever bought and so far I am more than satisfied with it. I did not have much of a dry skin, but I did have oily skin. I am not sure whether this is supposed to help people who have oily skin, but it did help me. I use it every time I go take a shower and my skin looks great. No oil, just shine, and a good kind of shine that makes your skin glow. I also use a small scrub to make sure my skin is thoroughly scrubbed for best effect. I find this to be my personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used this to shave once and it worked better than my shaving cream. The whole day my face felt really relaxed and smooth with no razor burns or anything like that. Make sure to take a shower or wash your face with warm water for best shaving experience. I plan on being Lab Series costumer for a long time. Their products might be a bit expensive but they provide quality products. The packaging was great with \\&quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Luxury Grooming Supplies\\&quot; banner across the box (nice touch, huh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great service, great product, and very fast delivery. I highly recommend the company and this product.</li>
            <li> This powerwash is AMAZING. My husband used to have black heads everywhere on his face. He&#x27;s been using it for over 2 months now...I have yet to find a black head.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much the best face wash on the planet. I have been using it for almost a decade now, experimenting here and there with other face washes, and always come back to this. It may seem expensive as compared to a store bought brand, but it lasts SO much longer and it ends up being cheaper to use overall. It takes very little of this stuff to lather up your face on a normal day. On a hot, sunscreen-caked day, it takes a little more. Dosing it out is very easy: start small and work your way up to what your particular face needs.</li>
            <li> I was using ivory liquid body wash in the shower. It dried my skin a bit. I bought this stuff for my face and ended up using it on my whole body. No more dryness, anywhere. It lathers up nicely too, so you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot to get clean. Excellent.</li>
            <li> i have very oily skin and have had a hard time finding something that I can wash my face with and not have the oil back in a couple of hours.  I can wash my face with this stuff and I&#x27;m good all day.</li>
            <li> This power wash works very well, does not leave your face feeling dry at all, big plus. Better value here than at department stores.</li>
            <li> great packaging. good for daily use. long lasting. i use frequently. i would recommend. nice clear blue face wash. no smell.</li>
            <li> This product is so great that I&#x27;d rather go without washing my face when I run out; now I keep a back-stock of this power wash. This product keeps my skin feeling fresh and it breaks through all the grease without any irritating fragrances. I LOVE the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 82 and have face skin like a 45 Y/O. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least over five years now, and obviously like it a lot.    It is probably not cheap, but do not notice this because of it&#x27;s benefits.  First of all, you only need a few small drops (the applicator cap dispenses tiny portions) for your whole face to be washed thoroughly, so a bottle lasts me months, almost a year.  Second, there is no big foam, just a slippery wash of cleanser but afterwards your face feels clean and good.  Third, I use Lab overall because all the products I use are odorless including this one - that&#x27;s good so I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m adding more chemicals and perfumes.  I use this in conjunction with their face scrub that I do once a week, and use the eye-treat cream around my eyes everyday.  All of the Lab products makes my skin feel clean, flexible, moist without being greasy.  I can use the eye-treat cream around my eyes without it irritating them which is good, and I feel like it softens up age lines nicely.    Good stuff and will continue to use Lab products.</li>
            <li> As a 43 year old guy, I&#x27;m starting to get to that point where I want to take care of my face before it starts to look any more beat up than it already is!  This stuff is amazing.  Skin feels soft and smooth without being oily at all.  Great mild scent.  If there was only one product a guy was willing to purchase for his face, I&#x27;d say this would be it.  You don&#x27;t need much, about the size of a dime (maybe a quarter if you&#x27;ve got a big face!)  Used every day it should last you around 3 months.  I&#x27;m also a pretty big fan of the Light Moisture Lotion.  Use these 2 together and your face will be as soft and smooth as a dog&#x27;s belly.  (Not one of those old mother dogs with the saggy teets...those things can be a little rough)  Now...before you think I&#x27;m a shill for this company, I&#x27;ve also used the Lab Series Overnight Renewal lotion which good enough, but ridiculously overpriced.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing that again.  I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Power Wash for a long time though.</li>
            <li> Lab Series products are good. I like this one and the SPF lotion, both are very high quality. I use just a touch of this lotion in the shower, a few drops suffice for hair and body, and it leaves me feeling clean and fresh, a very pleasant after-shower feeling.</li>
            <li> Leave skin feeling slick after rinsing.</li>
            <li> Good scent free gel wash. I like it but it has peppermint in it...peppermint is totally unnecessary and is actually an irritant. The funny thing is that the product is not even cooling so I don&#x27;t understand why peppermint is in the product. I would give it five stars if they took out the peppermint, it has not caused any irritation so I will continue to use it but won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this in store for about 8 years.  I have slightly oily skin and use an electric shaver every day.  This Lab Series stuff strips the oil but then it moisturizes too.  The best part is it leaves your skin with this incredibly smooth feeling like a very very light shaving gel.  So, when you shave with an electric shaver, there is ZERO razor burn.  I haven&#x27;t had razor burn in almost a decade after I started using this power wash and I&#x27;ve switched shavers several times.  I love this stuff and recommend it to friends who ask or are in need.</li>
            <li> Great product for male skin care.</li>
            <li> Tried this when my other face wash ran out. It&#x27;s better than regular soap but I ended up switching back to Clinique Skin Supplies for Men Face Soap after this ran out. Your face isn&#x27;t my face so results may vary.</li>
            <li> My skin remains smooth after washing with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably 10 years. Still had lingering acne issues into my 30&#x27;s but this cleanser has helped eliminate that problem.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for 15 years, its great!  The lab series line is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My go-to face wash for years. Good service too</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for over a year and it&#x27;s the best thing I can find on the market for guys.</li>
            <li> Good price and great product.</li>
            <li> great for me. I am Chinese.</li>
            <li> Love this, use this everyday</li>
