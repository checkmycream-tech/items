            <li>Best moisturizer on the market!</li>
            <li>One of the best Keri lotion products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>This is a GREAT product.</li>
            <li>They were a great price by this merchant as others were selling at almost $20</li>
            <li>good size bottle, and works as a great soothing lotion for my skin</li>
            <li>All their others are not as good.</li>
            <li>Though it takes a while to rub it in, its effective in protecting the hands from drying out.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion of all times.</li>
            <li>Keri is simply the best,  loves it</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite hand lotion for years, mostly because it feels like I have some cream on my hands after applying.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using it more than 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I have used Original Keri lotion for years and am thrilled it is still available without all the additives that are popular these days.  </li>
            <li>OVERALL GREAT EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a light scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>i go through a regular size bottle in 3-4 weeks, so thelarger bottle comes in handy.</li>
            <li>So many lotions have a smooth, almost dry feeling once applied, and I prefer to have my hands not feel that way.</li>
            <li>LOTION IS GREAT my wife has been using it for over 30 years and her skin is firm and soft</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>it probably lasts me 2 months, more or less.</li>
            <li>Love Keri lotion because it&#x27;s not filled with a lot of water.</li>
            <li>I have been using Keri for over 30yrs, since I moved to the desert southwest, as it is the only lotion that keeps my sensative skin soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown up using keri on my dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion my husband will use on his dry, sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> My favorite lotion of all times. Please keep in stock</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for almost 40 years as a facial cream. Yesterday I went to Walmart &amp; Target to purchase a bottle and they didn&#x27;t have it. I was very disappointed in them. Thank god for Amazon &amp; Walgreens. I hope they never quit making this lotion...I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d replace it with. There is nothing on the market like it.</li>
            <li> I have used Original Keri lotion for years and am thrilled it is still available without all the additives that are popular these days.  Hard to find in stores.  Thanks Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The only lotion I use. Can&#x27;t found in stores</li>
            <li> kERI LOTION IS GREAT my wife has been using it for over 30 years and her skin is firm and soft</li>
            <li> OVERALL GREAT EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> good size bottle, and works as a great soothing lotion for my skin</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected.  The lotion has a light scent that is not overpowering. Moisture with feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, but sad to say in the last 6 months I&#x27;ve order 2 of this and when arrived the lotion spilled all over the box.&lt;br /&gt;Not sealed correctly.</li>
            <li> It really protects in a harsh environment.  Though it takes a while to rub it in, its effective in protecting the hands from drying out. It also helps to heal cracks that develop when its cold or the hands are really dry.</li>
            <li> Keri is the Best Lotion Ever!

I used to purchase the 900 ml at Costco, but they discontinued it, as well as other local stores.  Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> Keri is simply the best,  loves it</li>
            <li> Love Keri lotion because it&#x27;s not filled with a lot of water. Soothes the skin. Feels like you&#x27;ve put something on rather than have it dissipate into thin air.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer on the market!</li>

            <li> This is the only lotion my husband will use on his dry, sensitive skin.  He&#x27;s been using it more than 20 years.  He&#x27;s tried others, both expensive and cheaper ones, now this is the only one he&#x27;ll use.  It has to be the \\&quot;original\\&quot;.  All their others are not as good.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product. It really helps after my skin gets dried out from swimming.</li>
            <li> I have been using Keri lotion for years, 10+. i go through a regular size bottle in 3-4 weeks, so thelarger bottle comes in handy. it probably lasts me 2 months, more or less. i ordered 3-4 of them to ensure that i have enough in case it discountinues, which i hope it never does. i wish they made an even bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> One of the best Keri lotion products I&#x27;ve used.  I have been using this product for years.  Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Unable to find the large bottles in my local stores. They were a great price by this merchant as others were selling at almost $20</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown up using keri on my dry, sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it! There is truly nothing else like it. I&#x27;ve tried every other lotion out there to see if I could have a few options (in case they ever stop making this) and there&#x27;s really nothing else! I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years!!</li>
