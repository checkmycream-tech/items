            <li>Very effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Always nice to have extras.</li>
            <li>Thank you kindly.</li>
            <li>but the results are spectacular.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to have found this system; the Emjoi with separate rollers.  </li>
            <li>I found it to be some what effective, considering the test my feet was putting it to.</li>
            <li>I have the battery operated one, which is SO handy on vacation.</li>
            <li>These work great but seem to wear out somewhat quickly so that is the reason for the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>and it would be very easy to over</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very easy to insert and remove from the unit.  </li>
            <li>These are the best for removing calluses and keeping your feet soft.</li>
            <li>I am 50 yrs old with sexy, baby feet!!!!</li>
            <li>Love love love them!  </li>
            <li>and they work ok, but these super course ones are amazing!</li>
            <li>These were amazing at how quickly the rollers powered thru all the dryness to start to reveal nice heels again.</li>
            <li>Love my Emjoi.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier and plan to order more soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my feet for most of the hours I spend at my job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if these work better than the non-brand that&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>getting a pedi would cost me more, much more?  </li>
            <li>I will buy more when I need them:)</li>
            <li>So glad I found the Emjoi micro-pedi system.</li>
            <li>I love my emjoi mico pedi foot sander.</li>
            <li>I have given it as a gift to many people in my life.</li>
            <li>Sure it works if you have the time to repeatedly keep going over your feet</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love Emjoi.</li>
            <li>anything more</li>
            <li>This method seems to work much better.</li>
            <li>I love this for my heels</li>
            <li>Excellent product if you need some extra attention for your feet.</li>
            <li>I am now able to take better care of my feet, I can remove the Claus and ruff areas from feet.</li>
            <li>I am really glad they came out with this roller.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>and i really love it</li>
            <li>I thought that they would be more course though.</li>
            <li>Love love the emjoli.</li>
            <li>I could use something a bit MORE coarse but these will do perfectly until I need to reorder.</li>
            <li>I really like the Emjoi and these work great.  </li>
            <li>I tried the knock offs, you get twice as many</li>
            <li>think they have more power.</li>
            <li>Now if I could just find a cream/lotion/ointment that really works I will be a happy camper.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I have found this product.</li>
            <li>Many years a physician recommended to me to use a Pumice Stone to keep my calluses under control.  </li>
            <li>are significantly more fastidious about the appearance of their feet than I am.  </li>
            <li>From what I could tell on the Emjoi website, this is their most coarse roller, and the best for stubborn calluses.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this.  </li>
            <li>They made mine nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Is a 2&amp;#34; square of sandpaper more.  </li>
            <li>I love these rollers.</li>
            <li>Will buy these again for sure.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like these rollers.</li>
            <li>I love emjoi.  </li>
            <li>I believe after continued use I will get even better results.</li>
            <li>I was able to get them cheaper from the source - micropedi(dot)com.</li>
            <li>The rollers that came with my Emjoi were okay</li>
            <li>but these work a lot better and faster.</li>
            <li>Just so everyone knows, these are the roughest refills Emjoi makes, check their web site to be sure</li>
            <li>and I was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>My husband even noticed and thought I had sexy feet.  </li>
            <li>I needed this and am so glad I got it ...</li>
            <li>It allows the cream to penetrate the heel much better.  </li>
            <li>Better than a pumice stone</li>
            <li>I use it every day and it has been safely removing two calluses that caused me a lot of discomfort.</li>
            <li>these are perfect, my husband uses them like clock work, it&#x27;s a daily routine while watching his shows.</li>
            <li>I love my Micro-Pedi</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy the plug in one for more power and to save on batteries.</li>
            <li>misread how many were in pack.  </li>
            <li>I love the machine.</li>
            <li>Love them and they work.</li>
            <li>these cost more, but work the best, get several uses from 1 roller.  </li>
            <li>This is the roughest rollers they offer and I love it.</li>
            <li>They were ok.</li>
            <li>Pain free treatment and super effective!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy one of these wonderful contraptions.</li>
            <li>Beautiful soft feet in the AM.  </li>
            <li>I like the original device but for my calloused feet (could practically use a grinder on them!)  </li>
            <li>I bought these new stronger rollers which work great.</li>
            <li>Works great; better than paying for pedicures to get soft feet.</li>
            <li>perfect for extremely dry feet like mine.</li>
            <li>For dry skin it is the best.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>The rollers work good but the price is very high for just two of them.</li>
            <li>These work great in my Emjoi and keeps my heels baby soft.</li>
            <li>The best thing I ever did was to buy the machine that uses these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful for taking the rough skin off your feet.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly works very well.</li>
            <li>Love it, I recommend this strongly if you have ruff feet and want them to be smooth.</li>
            <li>wife said it is comfortable, quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;She tried it and liked it and will continue using them.</li>
            <li>They are much better than the original rollers that came with the tool.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I absolutely love the Emjoi Micro-pedi!  </li>
            <li>These are sooo much better than the original rollers.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are easy to put into unit too</li>
            <li>I thought the blue rollers that came with the MicroPedi were great, but these are fabulous!  </li>
            <li>but it was still not an easy task</li>
            <li>This does the job easily.</li>
            <li>No pain, so easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with how soft and smooth my feet feel.</li>
            <li>and I may just get her , her own Emjoi because I&#x27;m getting very attached to this thing!.</li>
            <li>Which means I do it more often because it&#x27;s quick and easy...</li>
            <li>Well, the rollers truly are wonderful but my cute little feet could use a coarser grade!  </li>
            <li>Less time in the bathroom working on my feet means more time in flip flops and sandals while enjoying the beautiful weather with very pretty feet!</li>
            <li>I know this company makes fine rollers as well which I imagine could be used for that purpose</li>
            <li>The&lt;br /&gt;cartridges are well made and fit easily in all the Emjoi sanding/buffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The others worked fine</li>
            <li>so I have no reason to think these won&#x27;t be fine also.</li>
            <li>My wife  loves the easy change over with this kind of roller thanks.</li>
            <li>These are very good for rough feet.</li>
            <li>wish they have this available in a value pack, these can get pricey.</li>
            <li>Does the job gently but effectively.</li>
            <li>The x coarse do a great job however.</li>
            <li>It works great but maintaining is key, so I will be buying cheaper replacements!</li>
            <li>This product actually works so happy that I went ahead and brought the item.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to start with these</li>
            <li>I used them two weeks ago and my feet are still callus and crack free.</li>
            <li>I bought my Emjoi to smooth out my callus buildup.  </li>
            <li>The XTREME COARSE rollers are a great product.</li>
            <li>If you have calluses, these rollers are what you need to smooth your feet.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many different grits of roller for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi and these seem to be the best as far as performance.</li>
            <li>Makes the heels smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>Join the club - it&#x27;s a free subscription program</li>
            <li>I just joined to take advantage of the free shipping and discount.</li>
            <li>Have tried different ones and these work great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy who has nice feet and wants to keep them that way.</li>
            <li>clean easily with a dust brush...........or can be rinsed in water.</li>
            <li>my feet are now smooth as a babys a--</li>
            <li>fit the micro-pedi pro buffer</li>
            <li>An occasional soak before using the contour file and a good heel cream and lotion have helped more since my mishap.</li>
            <li>They do as good a job as having a professional pedicure &amp; you can do it at home &amp; save time &amp; money.</li>
            <li>the new abrasion-type of rollers are excellent for rough heels and even better than the previously available coarseness of roller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a new &amp; MUCH better alternative!</li>
            <li>The blue rollers while good are more gentle and take longer, like over a period of 3-4 days to safely remove all callused heals.  </li>
            <li>First time out, I needed to spend 40.minutes with the most course roller .</li>
            <li>These are ok, as is the machine, but if you have thickened feet, you are better off sticking to the old razer.</li>
            <li>Use the brush that was part of your Emjoi package to clean the rollers.</li>
            <li>Very good product, but the rollers dull easily.  </li>
            <li>If you really want to have smooth feet and get rid of dead skin, this is the best roller to order.</li>
            <li>This is great for people that have more calluses than usual.</li>
            <li>Love it and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>if they don&#x27;t have full power.</li>
            <li>love them my order came fast i would order again</li>
            <li>These rollers are the best for really thick cracked feet.</li>
            <li>I have found that I can take these rollers that I already have and scrape the old used sandpaper off and roll and glue my own at about 1cent each.  </li>
            <li>One roller is only good for one time.</li>
            <li>It is easy, can be done in your own private home, no need to go for a pedicare, which saves tons of money.  </li>
            <li>Not for any other reason than that it&#x27;s an amazing product and that everyone needs to smooth their feet once and a while.&lt;br /&gt;These roller refills are even better than the ones that come with the product.</li>
            <li>Great for very rough feet.  </li>
            <li>This item works great for very rough feet.</li>
            <li>I love the emoji system, leaves my feet smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>They are not too coarse and leave a nice smooth finish after using.</li>
            <li>imagine most of the people who buy this groomer tool and rollers are females and not physically challenged males, and most women that I know</li>
            <li>She definitely like the coarse roller the best.</li>
            <li>Maybe after I get mine under control I won&#x27;t go through these as quickly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that this roller would be effective enough for the certain rought spots on my feet,but after experimenting with how to use the Emjoi micro pedi</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy a cheap brand like I did first</li>
            <li>Outstanding primary roller to be followed by the blue one to smooth.</li>
            <li>My feet for the first time a smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>These are my new favorite sanding rollers.  </li>
            <li>I live in sandals makes them look 100% better</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li>Works great, really helps my dry feet</li>
            <li>These very coarse rollers are wonderful for stubborn dry skin.  </li>
            <li>They really work and make keeping feet callus free and well groomed a snap.</li>
            <li>works great to grind off that dead skin on your  feet or hands just don&#x27;t hit the puss if its juicy</li>
            <li>These rollers smooth them out very well</li>
            <li>Great!&lt;br /&gt;works great and better than shaving that dead skin off your heels any old day&lt;</li>
            <li>BUT WELL WORTH IT</li>
            <li>As for price, I think that they are well worth it since</li>
            <li>The blue roller was good however this works much better and quicker on a callus than the blue roller did.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my feet are after using this.</li>
            <li>Nice and coarse.  </li>
            <li>My feet have never been completely callus free and so smooth until now</li>
            <li>This helps to keep them soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>The Green is good and has worked for me - I think I would have had a better response to one more coarse.  </li>
            <li>This roller is so effective I only have to use it once a week!!</li>
            <li>not as powerful as advertise.</li>
            <li>Better than the professional pedicure.</li>
            <li>If you go to fast, the roller is only skimming the calluses and instead of speeding things up, you have to do more passes and it will take more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>If you own the Emjoi, or are thinking about it, forget the blue roller it comes with!  </li>
            <li>The emjoi micro pedi is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I used these new xtreme roller was able to smooth out my heels in about 5 minutes per foot, but did not completely get rid of the calluses - that will take lots and lots of time, I am sure.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to clean the rollers to make them last longer</li>
            <li>I do like the device and the rollers - it does work, just ensure you&#x27;re getting the right &#x27;graininess&#x27; on the roller -</li>
            <li>Smoothes them right out.  </li>
            <li>- you can cancel right away.</li>
            <li>This whole system works best if the skin is dry, so no need to pre-soak like you do with a regular pedicure.  </li>
            <li>Easy to install,  Works great on tough areas.</li>
            <li>I love this super coarse grit!</li>
            <li>Nice to have an option more coarse than the blue ones.</li>
            <li>My feet have looked so soft and beautiful all summer long thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>These do a so much better job than the light blue that normally come with the remover!</li>
            <li>Have brutally rough and calloused heels and tried this for the first time last night--and the results are remarkable!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did with the standard Blue Rollers which I thought were OK the task took significantly longer and the Grooming Tool would sometimes get hot..</li>
            <li>They work great on tough skin and make your feet feel smooth, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I think of it as if sanding wood with sandpaper, using the coarse paper first to get off the paint and finishing with the fine paper to make it smooth.</li>
            <li>This will be a real time saver for me, as I&#x27;m prone to quick callous build-up and refuse to pay the price for the prestige pedi salons in my city.  </li>
            <li>Works great, have bought several Rollers as gifts and always a big hit.</li>
            <li>They work really well, and fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The extra coarse rollers work great.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without them!!!</li>
            <li>Even coarser would better, but probably would be to strong for the average user.</li>
            <li>It worked very fast , I think that you hit it on the head</li>
            <li>Also arrived on time, exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Work better than regular ones, but would have them to be even courser!</li>
            <li>I have to use them almost daily, but my feet look much better.</li>
            <li>I ordered different rollers and love them...</li>
            <li>these rollers work better than the blue ones that my Emjoi Callus Remover came with.</li>
            <li>but I get better results from a $3.00 hand-foot sander I get at my local Drug Store.</li>
            <li>but I thought they would be significantly more course than the blue ones.  </li>
            <li>They are much better than the blue one.</li>
            <li>4 refill rollers cost more than the entire set.  </li>
            <li>She has used this product several times per week since purchasing the Mini-Pedi machine and is extremely pleased with it&#x27;s results.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m ready for the summer!</li>
            <li>and I have tried many products including regular pedicures.</li>
            <li>Still works better than the regular grade you get with the systems.</li>
            <li>They work exactly as advertised and are the reason the machine gets 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>Definitely more abrasive than the regular rollers.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something better and found it with Xtreme Coarse Rollers.  </li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t able to remove the calluses properly.</li>
            <li>These really work!  </li>
            <li>Much better than Blue Rollers that are just regular.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are much better than the blue ones I had been ordering.  </li>
            <li>My legs and feet look better then actually going for a pedicure.  </li>
            <li>And that is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>First rate-</li>
            <li>I use this between pedicures and I like this one much more than the blue roller.</li>
            <li>These do exactly what they say....</li>
            <li>No problems with my order and fast delivery !</li>
            <li>I used them the first time I bought my Pedi</li>
            <li>In fact, i think the blue ones work better.</li>
            <li>They work better than expected and made the callus removal quick.</li>
            <li>It came fast and is easy to use, makes my feet feel soft.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it does what it says it will do ,no more calluses on the heels just nice smooth feet .yes</li>
            <li>These new coarse rollers are great but don&#x27;t hesitate, unless you have diabetes, because they are not THAT coarse.</li>
            <li>The Emjoi Micro-Pedi Xtreme Coarse Rollers are great for smoothing out rough skin.  </li>
            <li>These are actually more coarse and work really well.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the regular blue rollers.</li>
            <li>Ive ordered a few other sets, but took longer to remove callouses, these ones are the best, they get rid of calloused skin fast!</li>
            <li>but I really needed the extra coarse rollers to get the smooth results I want quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that Emjoi offers a roller with this level of coarseness, it gets the job done on calluses and rough skin and leaves your feet baby soft</li>
            <li>It still did not remove all the dry skin on my heels, so not to pleased</li>
            <li>Excellent for those hard, dry areas.</li>
            <li>Up here in the northeast, the dry winters make my heels so thick theses work the best.</li>
            <li>I used the coarse roller first and followed up with the original roller.  </li>
            <li>(I spent about half an hour on each foot), but they got them nice and smooth!</li>
            <li>These rollers works great for my tough calluses.</li>
            <li>What I love about the Emjoi is no mess with soaking and no long time required.</li>
            <li>If you have a good deal of hard skin on your heels and feet then this is the roller you want to use.</li>
            <li>I have one very stubborn callus and these are helping to smooth it out; the blue ones did not.</li>
            <li>My order arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li>Really works well on toughest callouses.</li>
            <li>These really are the roughest and toughest of the Micro-Pedi Rollers.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d grind too much away.  </li>
            <li>Does not work very well</li>
            <li>These seem faster and don&#x27;t give the impression that they will take too much off.</li>
            <li>I really am a fan of the Emjoi products.</li>
            <li>then you can use the blue ones to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li>The whole package of the emjoi pedi call us remover</li>
            <li>The blue are extremely light.  </li>
            <li>It does not take too much time.</li>
            <li>I end up taking off a bit too much skin.  </li>
            <li>This one really doesn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li>By the time I finished his feet were much smoother</li>
            <li>Really works on skin removal....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>They seem to stay smooth for several days.  </li>
            <li>but it does allow be to go much longer between pedicures, so it has paid for itself.</li>
            <li>The whole family loves these sanders.  </li>
            <li>Much needed tool.</li>
            <li>I am a runner and need to really take care of my feet.  </li>
            <li>It really works...</li>
            <li>It did a better job than I expected.</li>
            <li>These work really well</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>they work very well</li>
            <li>These work better than the blue ones and are not too agressive for frequent use.</li>
            <li>However, it worn out quite quickly after first use compare to the price you pay for, hope it&#x27;s could last a bit longer</li>
            <li>I would recommend what should use reasonable caution, with this is a reasonable powerful grooming tool in combination with the extra course rollers which work very fast</li>
            <li>If you have any problem with your feet I would ask your doctor whether these are okay to use, because if you are a person who does things to the extreme you could remove too much skin.</li>
            <li>When originally purchased this tool originally came with two of the standard course blue rollers which worked reasonably well</li>
            <li>Go through them rather rapidlly but still better then using my dremel of any other product on the market.</li>
            <li>I followed up with the blue Extra Coarse Roller and the skin was smooth and callus free in no time!</li>
            <li>My wife wanted a new roller and when I saw that there was a coarse roller available</li>
            <li>I received this product quickly, but haven&#x27;t really noticed the difference between the these Xtreme Course Rollers and the standard rollers.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it on him he thought it was a joke because it felt so soft.</li>
            <li>did accidentally used this on the sensitive skin around my ankles and aside from a sensation of being scraped there were no ill effects</li>
            <li>Like I said before, pummice stone does the job better, and these actually are very close in performance to the blue ones.</li>
            <li>They really took care of the tougher callouses that needed a little more attention.  </li>
            <li>This roller definitely removes the dead skin from my feet much better than the roller that originally came with the Micro Pedi.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really needed to order a new pair of micro pedi.</li>
            <li>These work way better than the standard coarse rollers.</li>
            <li>Powerful for those stubborn areas, yet gentle enough to get the job done!</li>
            <li>I wonder do they have any super, ultra coarse ones?</li>
            <li>My tool is older, 2 years and still working, but I will consider buying a newer one,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We are glad to have found the extra coarse rollers.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t work any better so will save the money and buy the blue ones next time</li>
            <li>If you think those are good and that the Emjoi is great, this makes the combination insane!!!.</li>
            <li>This coarse one was more like the blue one.</li>
            <li>I thought the coarse rollers would be better than the Blue ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as coarse as I thought it would be - wish it were more coarse.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased these extra coarse rollers along with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>highly recommend this...</li>
            <li>Highly recomend.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend Emjoi products.</li>
            <li>High price $20 for two.</li>
            <li>I highly reacommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>They work just fine, as expected.</li>
            <li>With several passes these extremely coarse rollers do an excellent job of removing that extremely thick build up!</li>
            <li>A hint from another reviewer does definitely work - grab an old toothbrush to clean the buildup of skin out of the texture of these.  </li>
            <li>I opted for the extreme coarse rollers and am very pleased with how quickly it dissolves rough skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they really leave your skin soft and smooth&lt;</li>
            <li>These are really course and remove the callous fast and has been lasting much longer.  </li>
            <li>I have some really calloused areas on my heels and thought that these may completely eliminate the problem.  </li>
            <li>The entire device isn&#x27;t worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I love the machine on the feet, bit the refills don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>The green one is much better</li>
            <li>My feet are brand new and baby soft!!</li>
            <li>I have only used it twice so far but seems to do an adequate job.</li>
            <li>While I do not have the most calloused feet they are definitely dry and have some deep creases.  </li>
            <li>I love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi but didn&#x27;t feel that these were really that coarse compared to their other rollers.  </li>
            <li>The blue rollers that come with the Micro Pedi are pretty good, but with these rollers and a brand new battery you can burn right through the extremely thick dry skin that some people can develop.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 4 major back surgeries so taking basic care of my feet can be challenging.  </li>
            <li>I suggest using the MICRO-PEDI outside due to the very fine dust they all make if you have any type of allergy.  </li>
            <li>Live in the desert and wear sandals twelve months out of the year.  </li>
            <li>That being said, can&#x27;t live without them unless I go to a spa for pedicures.</li>
            <li>Plan to pamper you feet multiple times within a few days to get amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I uses a slow back and forth motion keeping an eye on the progress so that I don&#x27;t sand to close to good skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this as I always have calluses on my heels and have tried other devices and they weren&#x27;t very powerful.</li>
            <li>Nice to have for daily touch-ups, especially during our dry northern winters and in sandal weather!</li>
            <li>When I first purchased the Emjoi Micro-Pedi, I also bought these Xtreme Coarse Rollers.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used these xx coarse rollers but am willing to give them a try.  </li>
            <li>And WOW!  </li>
            <li>Great roller for if you have thick rough calluses!</li>
            <li>feet are baby soft!  </li>
            <li>I will not be able to use them on a regular basis bkz they are very rough, but if you have let your calluses go for a while, this is the roller to do the trick..</li>
            <li>However the batteries will not last as long, but they are cheap.</li>
            <li>Takes much less time and makes your feet so smooth.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product if you have rough feet and are a lady that wants a man to touch her feet without having a panic attack!</li>
            <li>My rough feet wear out the roller quick .</li>
            <li>I would suggest that once you get past the tough stuff, you consider those who are inclined to get a more finished look switch to some kind of finishing tool.</li>
            <li>They blast through all of the dry skin on your heels and leave them extra smooth</li>
            <li>We had the standard micro-pedi rollers that came with the product and decided to try the super coarse ones.  </li>
            <li>so I think any of these roller are fine for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed extra and these certainly do the job.</li>
            <li>absolutely great for tough callouses ad rough skin patches.</li>
            <li>I bought theese to complete the Emjoi little device which came with only the blue rolls (good for later).</li>
            <li>These magically rollers won&#x27;t be able to tackle hard, thick calluses in one seating.</li>
            <li>I previously used the default blue rollers that came with the machine, which did a good job smoothing my feet, but could not even come close to tackling my heels that are very rough since I basically walk around barefoot all but 1-2 hours every day.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I found something as gentle as a coarse emery board and it&#x27;s a lot easier to hold onto.</li>
            <li>No signs of wear so far.</li>
            <li>I have to use it quite often especially after the masseuse that worked on my feet said, &amp;#34;that tool you&#x27;re using is really working&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>but I prefer the old fashioned grater method.</li>
            <li>With these Extra Course Rollers the task is very rapid and the Tool doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li>do it which I imagine could leave ones feet overly sensitive.</li>
            <li>It would take much longer to work on with the last grinders that I used.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work as well as getting a professional pedicure</li>
            <li>Like these better than the blue ones for my rough Southern California flip flop feet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They really remove a callous in short order.  </li>
            <li>In between pedicures it keeps my feet soft and looking like</li>
            <li>Much better then the standard blue extra coarse rollers.</li>
            <li>This takes all the dead skin off and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Green leaves more of a rougher finish than the blue which leaves my feet smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought these, as my feet were horribly thick and cracked.</li>
            <li>Seemed to wear down quickly though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t want to read elaborations about funky feet, so I&#x27;ll spare the graphic descriptions and just say that these REALLY work on tough callouses and leave feet baby-smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that these would be extra , extra course, but they don&#x27;t seem to really be any more coarse then the next level down.  </li>
            <li>I probably spent 30 minutes a foot the first time</li>
            <li>My feet are pretty rough</li>
            <li>A little bit dissapointed; I expected to see better results</li>
            <li>However, I have callouses for a reason, and I realized that, as nice as it is to have smooth, flat feet, it&#x27;s painful to walk around with them.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the green rollers and a blue one came with my Emjoi, I can tell a huge difference in the two.  </li>
            <li>I am always having dry heels and this has really helped.</li>
            <li>However, I have very calloused, dry cracked heels and that may be why.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i use these to first remove the tough skin then the blue ones to smooth it out</li>
            <li>I got the coarse roller and within 5 minutes all of the calluses were gone and my heels were as soft as a babies butt!  </li>
            <li>have the recharge unit and use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with the Blue Rollers, but be sure to order extra Green Course !</li>
            <li>As far as coarseness...they don&#x27;t seem to be a whole lot coarser than the blue ones, however, they seem to last longer than those blue ones.</li>
            <li>I love going barefoot and, as a result, have very thick callused feet.</li>
            <li>This item works very well for my husband&#x27;s rough feet.  </li>
            <li>(I actually use a SOFT bristle tooth brush on mine)</li>
            <li>but I realized it would take several weeks before his callouses would be completely gone.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using this roller on soft parts of the feet - I switched out to the blue roller for the pads of my feet.</li>
            <li>Wow, if this is XTREME coarse I will eat my underwear.  </li>
            <li>My feet really aren&#x27;t that rough</li>
            <li>They really take off all the rough stuff from your feet.  </li>
            <li>it is totally painless and leaves my heels soft.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well, as expected.</li>
            <li>The course rolls work extremely well for very callous areas.  </li>
            <li>these rollers work better than the blue ones if you really tough feet&lt;</li>
            <li>Disappointed, seemed less effective than the standard rollers, and more pricey.  </li>
            <li>My new Emjoi is the answer to my dry cracked feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This course roller really gets off the dead skin and makes your feet soft.  </li>
            <li>most rollers are not coarse enough for my tough feet.  </li>
            <li>In a few minutes I was ready for my sandals!</li>
            <li>The others are pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li>If you press down too hard, the roller isn&#x27;t able to spin like it should</li>
            <li>Not so..Slightly disappointed, but I love the product itself!!</li>
            <li>I decided to try it which worked out well because the tool gives me extra reach and its much faster and takes less effort than using a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>works good removes heavy callous a little slow but does the job...</li>
            <li>You will love this if your feet are heavily calloused, but it might be too tough on sensitive feet.</li>

            <li> I just love these &amp;#34;pads&amp;#34; fory Emjoi, I use it every night &amp; it works wonders on my feet!</li>

            <li> My feet have never looked and felt better!  </li>

            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and this gets them off great and easily.</li>
            <li> Great price, super product!</li>
            <li> Very effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Always nice to have extras.</li>
            <li> Thank you kindly.</li>
            <li> but the results are spectacular.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to have found this system; the Emjoi with separate rollers.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be some what effective, considering the test my feet was putting it to.</li>
            <li> I have the battery operated one, which is SO handy on vacation.</li>
            <li> These work great but seem to wear out somewhat quickly so that is the reason for the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> and it would be very easy to over</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very easy to insert and remove from the unit.  </li>
            <li> These are the best for removing calluses and keeping your feet soft.</li>
            <li> I am 50 yrs old with sexy, baby feet!!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love them!  </li>
            <li> and they work ok, but these super course ones are amazing!</li>
            <li> These were amazing at how quickly the rollers powered thru all the dryness to start to reveal nice heels again.</li>
            <li> Love my Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier and plan to order more soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my feet for most of the hours I spend at my job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these work better than the non-brand that&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> getting a pedi would cost me more, much more?  </li>
            <li> I will buy more when I need them:)</li>
            <li> So glad I found the Emjoi micro-pedi system.</li>
            <li> I love my emjoi mico pedi foot sander.</li>
            <li> I have given it as a gift to many people in my life.</li>
            <li> Sure it works if you have the time to repeatedly keep going over your feet</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love Emjoi.</li>
            <li> anything more</li>
            <li> This method seems to work much better.</li>
            <li> I love this for my heels</li>
            <li> Excellent product if you need some extra attention for your feet.</li>
            <li> I am now able to take better care of my feet, I can remove the Claus and ruff areas from feet.</li>
            <li> I am really glad they came out with this roller.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> and i really love it</li>
            <li> I thought that they would be more course though.</li>
            <li> Love love the emjoli.</li>
            <li> I could use something a bit MORE coarse but these will do perfectly until I need to reorder.</li>
            <li> I really like the Emjoi and these work great.  </li>
            <li> I tried the knock offs, you get twice as many</li>
            <li> think they have more power.</li>
            <li> Now if I could just find a cream/lotion/ointment that really works I will be a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I have found this product.</li>
            <li> Many years a physician recommended to me to use a Pumice Stone to keep my calluses under control.  </li>
            <li> are significantly more fastidious about the appearance of their feet than I am.  </li>
            <li> From what I could tell on the Emjoi website, this is their most coarse roller, and the best for stubborn calluses.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this.  </li>
            <li> They made mine nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Is a 2&amp;#34; square of sandpaper more.  </li>
            <li> I love these rollers.</li>
            <li> Will buy these again for sure.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like these rollers.</li>
            <li> I love emjoi.  </li>
            <li> I believe after continued use I will get even better results.</li>
            <li> I was able to get them cheaper from the source - micropedi(dot)com.</li>
            <li> The rollers that came with my Emjoi were okay</li>
            <li> but these work a lot better and faster.</li>
            <li> Just so everyone knows, these are the roughest refills Emjoi makes, check their web site to be sure</li>
            <li> and I was quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> My husband even noticed and thought I had sexy feet.  </li>
            <li> I needed this and am so glad I got it ...</li>
            <li> It allows the cream to penetrate the heel much better.  </li>
            <li> Better than a pumice stone</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it has been safely removing two calluses that caused me a lot of discomfort.</li>
            <li> these are perfect, my husband uses them like clock work, it&#x27;s a daily routine while watching his shows.</li>
            <li> I love my Micro-Pedi</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy the plug in one for more power and to save on batteries.</li>
            <li> misread how many were in pack.  </li>
            <li> I love the machine.</li>
            <li> Love them and they work.</li>
            <li> these cost more, but work the best, get several uses from 1 roller.  </li>
            <li> This is the roughest rollers they offer and I love it.</li>
            <li> They were ok.</li>
            <li> Pain free treatment and super effective!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy one of these wonderful contraptions.</li>
            <li> Beautiful soft feet in the AM.  </li>
            <li> I like the original device but for my calloused feet (could practically use a grinder on them!)  </li>
            <li> I bought these new stronger rollers which work great.</li>
            <li> Works great; better than paying for pedicures to get soft feet.</li>
            <li> perfect for extremely dry feet like mine.</li>
            <li> For dry skin it is the best.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> The rollers work good but the price is very high for just two of them.</li>
            <li> These work great in my Emjoi and keeps my heels baby soft.</li>
            <li> The best thing I ever did was to buy the machine that uses these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful for taking the rough skin off your feet.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly works very well.</li>
            <li> Love it, I recommend this strongly if you have ruff feet and want them to be smooth.</li>
            <li> wife said it is comfortable, quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;She tried it and liked it and will continue using them.</li>
            <li> They are much better than the original rollers that came with the tool.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I absolutely love the Emjoi Micro-pedi!  </li>
            <li> These are sooo much better than the original rollers.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are easy to put into unit too</li>
            <li> I thought the blue rollers that came with the MicroPedi were great, but these are fabulous!  </li>
            <li> but it was still not an easy task</li>
            <li> This does the job easily.</li>
            <li> No pain, so easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with how soft and smooth my feet feel.</li>
            <li> and I may just get her , her own Emjoi because I&#x27;m getting very attached to this thing!.</li>
            <li> Which means I do it more often because it&#x27;s quick and easy...</li>
            <li> Well, the rollers truly are wonderful but my cute little feet could use a coarser grade!  </li>
            <li> Less time in the bathroom working on my feet means more time in flip flops and sandals while enjoying the beautiful weather with very pretty feet!</li>
            <li> I know this company makes fine rollers as well which I imagine could be used for that purpose</li>
            <li> The&lt;br /&gt;cartridges are well made and fit easily in all the Emjoi sanding/buffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The others worked fine</li>
            <li> so I have no reason to think these won&#x27;t be fine also.</li>
            <li> My wife  loves the easy change over with this kind of roller thanks.</li>
            <li> These are very good for rough feet.</li>
            <li> wish they have this available in a value pack, these can get pricey.</li>
            <li> Does the job gently but effectively.</li>
            <li> The x coarse do a great job however.</li>
            <li> It works great but maintaining is key, so I will be buying cheaper replacements!</li>
            <li> This product actually works so happy that I went ahead and brought the item.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to start with these</li>
            <li> I used them two weeks ago and my feet are still callus and crack free.</li>
            <li> I bought my Emjoi to smooth out my callus buildup.  </li>
            <li> The XTREME COARSE rollers are a great product.</li>
            <li> If you have calluses, these rollers are what you need to smooth your feet.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many different grits of roller for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi and these seem to be the best as far as performance.</li>
            <li> Makes the heels smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Join the club - it&#x27;s a free subscription program</li>
            <li> I just joined to take advantage of the free shipping and discount.</li>
            <li> Have tried different ones and these work great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who has nice feet and wants to keep them that way.</li>
            <li> clean easily with a dust brush...........or can be rinsed in water.</li>
            <li> my feet are now smooth as a babys a--</li>
            <li> fit the micro-pedi pro buffer</li>
            <li> An occasional soak before using the contour file and a good heel cream and lotion have helped more since my mishap.</li>
            <li> They do as good a job as having a professional pedicure &amp; you can do it at home &amp; save time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> the new abrasion-type of rollers are excellent for rough heels and even better than the previously available coarseness of roller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a new &amp; MUCH better alternative!</li>
            <li> The blue rollers while good are more gentle and take longer, like over a period of 3-4 days to safely remove all callused heals.  </li>
            <li> First time out, I needed to spend 40.minutes with the most course roller .</li>
            <li> These are ok, as is the machine, but if you have thickened feet, you are better off sticking to the old razer.</li>
            <li> Use the brush that was part of your Emjoi package to clean the rollers.</li>
            <li> Very good product, but the rollers dull easily.  </li>
            <li> If you really want to have smooth feet and get rid of dead skin, this is the best roller to order.</li>
            <li> This is great for people that have more calluses than usual.</li>
            <li> Love it and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> if they don&#x27;t have full power.</li>
            <li> love them my order came fast i would order again</li>
            <li> These rollers are the best for really thick cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I have found that I can take these rollers that I already have and scrape the old used sandpaper off and roll and glue my own at about 1cent each.  </li>
            <li> One roller is only good for one time.</li>
            <li> It is easy, can be done in your own private home, no need to go for a pedicare, which saves tons of money.  </li>
            <li> Not for any other reason than that it&#x27;s an amazing product and that everyone needs to smooth their feet once and a while.&lt;br /&gt;These roller refills are even better than the ones that come with the product.</li>
            <li> Great for very rough feet.  </li>
            <li> This item works great for very rough feet.</li>
            <li> I love the emoji system, leaves my feet smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> They are not too coarse and leave a nice smooth finish after using.</li>
            <li> imagine most of the people who buy this groomer tool and rollers are females and not physically challenged males, and most women that I know</li>
            <li> She definitely like the coarse roller the best.</li>
            <li> Maybe after I get mine under control I won&#x27;t go through these as quickly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that this roller would be effective enough for the certain rought spots on my feet,but after experimenting with how to use the Emjoi micro pedi</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy a cheap brand like I did first</li>
            <li> Outstanding primary roller to be followed by the blue one to smooth.</li>
            <li> My feet for the first time a smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite sanding rollers.  </li>
            <li> I live in sandals makes them look 100% better</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works very well.</li>
            <li> Works great, really helps my dry feet</li>
            <li> These very coarse rollers are wonderful for stubborn dry skin.  </li>
            <li> They really work and make keeping feet callus free and well groomed a snap.</li>
            <li> works great to grind off that dead skin on your  feet or hands just don&#x27;t hit the puss if its juicy</li>
            <li> These rollers smooth them out very well</li>
            <li> Great!&lt;br /&gt;works great and better than shaving that dead skin off your heels any old day&lt;</li>
            <li> BUT WELL WORTH IT</li>
            <li> As for price, I think that they are well worth it since</li>
            <li> The blue roller was good however this works much better and quicker on a callus than the blue roller did.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my feet are after using this.</li>
            <li> Nice and coarse.  </li>
            <li> My feet have never been completely callus free and so smooth until now</li>
            <li> This helps to keep them soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> The Green is good and has worked for me - I think I would have had a better response to one more coarse.  </li>
            <li> This roller is so effective I only have to use it once a week!!</li>
            <li> not as powerful as advertise.</li>
            <li> Better than the professional pedicure.</li>
            <li> If you go to fast, the roller is only skimming the calluses and instead of speeding things up, you have to do more passes and it will take more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> If you own the Emjoi, or are thinking about it, forget the blue roller it comes with!  </li>
            <li> The emjoi micro pedi is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used these new xtreme roller was able to smooth out my heels in about 5 minutes per foot, but did not completely get rid of the calluses - that will take lots and lots of time, I am sure.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to clean the rollers to make them last longer</li>
            <li> I do like the device and the rollers - it does work, just ensure you&#x27;re getting the right &#x27;graininess&#x27; on the roller -</li>
            <li> Smoothes them right out.  </li>
            <li> - you can cancel right away.</li>
            <li> This whole system works best if the skin is dry, so no need to pre-soak like you do with a regular pedicure.  </li>
            <li> Easy to install,  Works great on tough areas.</li>
            <li> I love this super coarse grit!</li>
            <li> Nice to have an option more coarse than the blue ones.</li>
            <li> My feet have looked so soft and beautiful all summer long thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> These do a so much better job than the light blue that normally come with the remover!</li>
            <li> Have brutally rough and calloused heels and tried this for the first time last night--and the results are remarkable!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did with the standard Blue Rollers which I thought were OK the task took significantly longer and the Grooming Tool would sometimes get hot..</li>
            <li> They work great on tough skin and make your feet feel smooth, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think of it as if sanding wood with sandpaper, using the coarse paper first to get off the paint and finishing with the fine paper to make it smooth.</li>
            <li> This will be a real time saver for me, as I&#x27;m prone to quick callous build-up and refuse to pay the price for the prestige pedi salons in my city.  </li>
            <li> Works great, have bought several Rollers as gifts and always a big hit.</li>
            <li> They work really well, and fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The extra coarse rollers work great.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without them!!!</li>
            <li> Even coarser would better, but probably would be to strong for the average user.</li>
            <li> It worked very fast , I think that you hit it on the head</li>
            <li> Also arrived on time, exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Work better than regular ones, but would have them to be even courser!</li>
            <li> I have to use them almost daily, but my feet look much better.</li>
            <li> I ordered different rollers and love them...</li>
            <li> these rollers work better than the blue ones that my Emjoi Callus Remover came with.</li>
            <li> but I get better results from a $3.00 hand-foot sander I get at my local Drug Store.</li>
            <li> but I thought they would be significantly more course than the blue ones.  </li>
            <li> They are much better than the blue one.</li>
            <li> 4 refill rollers cost more than the entire set.  </li>
            <li> She has used this product several times per week since purchasing the Mini-Pedi machine and is extremely pleased with it&#x27;s results.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m ready for the summer!</li>
            <li> and I have tried many products including regular pedicures.</li>
            <li> Still works better than the regular grade you get with the systems.</li>
            <li> They work exactly as advertised and are the reason the machine gets 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> Definitely more abrasive than the regular rollers.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something better and found it with Xtreme Coarse Rollers.  </li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t able to remove the calluses properly.</li>
            <li> These really work!  </li>
            <li> Much better than Blue Rollers that are just regular.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are much better than the blue ones I had been ordering.  </li>
            <li> My legs and feet look better then actually going for a pedicure.  </li>
            <li> And that is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> First rate-</li>
            <li> I use this between pedicures and I like this one much more than the blue roller.</li>
            <li> These do exactly what they say....</li>
            <li> No problems with my order and fast delivery !</li>
            <li> I used them the first time I bought my Pedi</li>
            <li> In fact, i think the blue ones work better.</li>
            <li> They work better than expected and made the callus removal quick.</li>
            <li> It came fast and is easy to use, makes my feet feel soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it does what it says it will do ,no more calluses on the heels just nice smooth feet .yes</li>
            <li> These new coarse rollers are great but don&#x27;t hesitate, unless you have diabetes, because they are not THAT coarse.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Micro-Pedi Xtreme Coarse Rollers are great for smoothing out rough skin.  </li>
            <li> These are actually more coarse and work really well.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the regular blue rollers.</li>
            <li> Ive ordered a few other sets, but took longer to remove callouses, these ones are the best, they get rid of calloused skin fast!</li>
            <li> but I really needed the extra coarse rollers to get the smooth results I want quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that Emjoi offers a roller with this level of coarseness, it gets the job done on calluses and rough skin and leaves your feet baby soft</li>
            <li> It still did not remove all the dry skin on my heels, so not to pleased</li>
            <li> Excellent for those hard, dry areas.</li>
            <li> Up here in the northeast, the dry winters make my heels so thick theses work the best.</li>
            <li> I used the coarse roller first and followed up with the original roller.  </li>
            <li> (I spent about half an hour on each foot), but they got them nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> These rollers works great for my tough calluses.</li>
            <li> What I love about the Emjoi is no mess with soaking and no long time required.</li>
            <li> If you have a good deal of hard skin on your heels and feet then this is the roller you want to use.</li>
            <li> I have one very stubborn callus and these are helping to smooth it out; the blue ones did not.</li>
            <li> My order arrived very promptly.</li>
            <li> Really works well on toughest callouses.</li>
            <li> These really are the roughest and toughest of the Micro-Pedi Rollers.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d grind too much away.  </li>
            <li> Does not work very well</li>
            <li> These seem faster and don&#x27;t give the impression that they will take too much off.</li>
            <li> I really am a fan of the Emjoi products.</li>
            <li> then you can use the blue ones to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> The whole package of the emjoi pedi call us remover</li>
            <li> The blue are extremely light.  </li>
            <li> It does not take too much time.</li>
            <li> I end up taking off a bit too much skin.  </li>
            <li> This one really doesn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> By the time I finished his feet were much smoother</li>
            <li> Really works on skin removal....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> They seem to stay smooth for several days.  </li>
            <li> but it does allow be to go much longer between pedicures, so it has paid for itself.</li>
            <li> The whole family loves these sanders.  </li>
            <li> Much needed tool.</li>
            <li> I am a runner and need to really take care of my feet.  </li>
            <li> It really works...</li>
            <li> It did a better job than I expected.</li>
            <li> These work really well</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> they work very well</li>
            <li> These work better than the blue ones and are not too agressive for frequent use.</li>
            <li> However, it worn out quite quickly after first use compare to the price you pay for, hope it&#x27;s could last a bit longer</li>
            <li> I would recommend what should use reasonable caution, with this is a reasonable powerful grooming tool in combination with the extra course rollers which work very fast</li>
            <li> If you have any problem with your feet I would ask your doctor whether these are okay to use, because if you are a person who does things to the extreme you could remove too much skin.</li>
            <li> When originally purchased this tool originally came with two of the standard course blue rollers which worked reasonably well</li>
            <li> Go through them rather rapidlly but still better then using my dremel of any other product on the market.</li>
            <li> I followed up with the blue Extra Coarse Roller and the skin was smooth and callus free in no time!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a new roller and when I saw that there was a coarse roller available</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly, but haven&#x27;t really noticed the difference between the these Xtreme Course Rollers and the standard rollers.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it on him he thought it was a joke because it felt so soft.</li>
            <li> did accidentally used this on the sensitive skin around my ankles and aside from a sensation of being scraped there were no ill effects</li>
            <li> Like I said before, pummice stone does the job better, and these actually are very close in performance to the blue ones.</li>
            <li> They really took care of the tougher callouses that needed a little more attention.  </li>
            <li> This roller definitely removes the dead skin from my feet much better than the roller that originally came with the Micro Pedi.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really needed to order a new pair of micro pedi.</li>
            <li> These work way better than the standard coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> Powerful for those stubborn areas, yet gentle enough to get the job done!</li>
            <li> I wonder do they have any super, ultra coarse ones?</li>
            <li> My tool is older, 2 years and still working, but I will consider buying a newer one,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We are glad to have found the extra coarse rollers.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work any better so will save the money and buy the blue ones next time</li>
            <li> If you think those are good and that the Emjoi is great, this makes the combination insane!!!.</li>
            <li> This coarse one was more like the blue one.</li>
            <li> I thought the coarse rollers would be better than the Blue ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as coarse as I thought it would be - wish it were more coarse.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased these extra coarse rollers along with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> highly recommend this...</li>
            <li> Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend Emjoi products.</li>
            <li> High price $20 for two.</li>
            <li> I highly reacommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> They work just fine, as expected.</li>
            <li> With several passes these extremely coarse rollers do an excellent job of removing that extremely thick build up!</li>
            <li> A hint from another reviewer does definitely work - grab an old toothbrush to clean the buildup of skin out of the texture of these.  </li>
            <li> I opted for the extreme coarse rollers and am very pleased with how quickly it dissolves rough skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they really leave your skin soft and smooth&lt;</li>
            <li> These are really course and remove the callous fast and has been lasting much longer.  </li>
            <li> I have some really calloused areas on my heels and thought that these may completely eliminate the problem.  </li>
            <li> The entire device isn&#x27;t worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I love the machine on the feet, bit the refills don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> The green one is much better</li>
            <li> My feet are brand new and baby soft!!</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice so far but seems to do an adequate job.</li>
            <li> While I do not have the most calloused feet they are definitely dry and have some deep creases.  </li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi but didn&#x27;t feel that these were really that coarse compared to their other rollers.  </li>
            <li> The blue rollers that come with the Micro Pedi are pretty good, but with these rollers and a brand new battery you can burn right through the extremely thick dry skin that some people can develop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 major back surgeries so taking basic care of my feet can be challenging.  </li>
            <li> I suggest using the MICRO-PEDI outside due to the very fine dust they all make if you have any type of allergy.  </li>
            <li> Live in the desert and wear sandals twelve months out of the year.  </li>
            <li> That being said, can&#x27;t live without them unless I go to a spa for pedicures.</li>
            <li> Plan to pamper you feet multiple times within a few days to get amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I uses a slow back and forth motion keeping an eye on the progress so that I don&#x27;t sand to close to good skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I always have calluses on my heels and have tried other devices and they weren&#x27;t very powerful.</li>
            <li> Nice to have for daily touch-ups, especially during our dry northern winters and in sandal weather!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased the Emjoi Micro-Pedi, I also bought these Xtreme Coarse Rollers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these xx coarse rollers but am willing to give them a try.  </li>
            <li> And WOW!  </li>
            <li> Great roller for if you have thick rough calluses!</li>
            <li> feet are baby soft!  </li>
            <li> I will not be able to use them on a regular basis bkz they are very rough, but if you have let your calluses go for a while, this is the roller to do the trick..</li>
            <li> However the batteries will not last as long, but they are cheap.</li>
            <li> Takes much less time and makes your feet so smooth.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product if you have rough feet and are a lady that wants a man to touch her feet without having a panic attack!</li>
            <li> My rough feet wear out the roller quick .</li>
            <li> I would suggest that once you get past the tough stuff, you consider those who are inclined to get a more finished look switch to some kind of finishing tool.</li>
            <li> They blast through all of the dry skin on your heels and leave them extra smooth</li>
            <li> We had the standard micro-pedi rollers that came with the product and decided to try the super coarse ones.  </li>
            <li> so I think any of these roller are fine for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed extra and these certainly do the job.</li>
            <li> absolutely great for tough callouses ad rough skin patches.</li>
            <li> I bought theese to complete the Emjoi little device which came with only the blue rolls (good for later).</li>
            <li> These magically rollers won&#x27;t be able to tackle hard, thick calluses in one seating.</li>
            <li> I previously used the default blue rollers that came with the machine, which did a good job smoothing my feet, but could not even come close to tackling my heels that are very rough since I basically walk around barefoot all but 1-2 hours every day.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I found something as gentle as a coarse emery board and it&#x27;s a lot easier to hold onto.</li>
            <li> No signs of wear so far.</li>
            <li> I have to use it quite often especially after the masseuse that worked on my feet said, &amp;#34;that tool you&#x27;re using is really working&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but I prefer the old fashioned grater method.</li>
            <li> With these Extra Course Rollers the task is very rapid and the Tool doesn&#x27;t heat up.</li>
            <li> do it which I imagine could leave ones feet overly sensitive.</li>
            <li> It would take much longer to work on with the last grinders that I used.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as getting a professional pedicure</li>
            <li> Like these better than the blue ones for my rough Southern California flip flop feet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They really remove a callous in short order.  </li>
            <li> In between pedicures it keeps my feet soft and looking like</li>
            <li> Much better then the standard blue extra coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> This takes all the dead skin off and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Green leaves more of a rougher finish than the blue which leaves my feet smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought these, as my feet were horribly thick and cracked.</li>
            <li> Seemed to wear down quickly though.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t want to read elaborations about funky feet, so I&#x27;ll spare the graphic descriptions and just say that these REALLY work on tough callouses and leave feet baby-smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that these would be extra , extra course, but they don&#x27;t seem to really be any more coarse then the next level down.  </li>
            <li> I probably spent 30 minutes a foot the first time</li>
            <li> My feet are pretty rough</li>
            <li> A little bit dissapointed; I expected to see better results</li>
            <li> However, I have callouses for a reason, and I realized that, as nice as it is to have smooth, flat feet, it&#x27;s painful to walk around with them.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the green rollers and a blue one came with my Emjoi, I can tell a huge difference in the two.  </li>
            <li> I am always having dry heels and this has really helped.</li>
            <li> However, I have very calloused, dry cracked heels and that may be why.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use these to first remove the tough skin then the blue ones to smooth it out</li>
            <li> I got the coarse roller and within 5 minutes all of the calluses were gone and my heels were as soft as a babies butt!  </li>
            <li> have the recharge unit and use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with the Blue Rollers, but be sure to order extra Green Course !</li>
            <li> As far as coarseness...they don&#x27;t seem to be a whole lot coarser than the blue ones, however, they seem to last longer than those blue ones.</li>
            <li> I love going barefoot and, as a result, have very thick callused feet.</li>
            <li> This item works very well for my husband&#x27;s rough feet.  </li>
            <li> (I actually use a SOFT bristle tooth brush on mine)</li>
            <li> but I realized it would take several weeks before his callouses would be completely gone.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this roller on soft parts of the feet - I switched out to the blue roller for the pads of my feet.</li>
            <li> Wow, if this is XTREME coarse I will eat my underwear.  </li>
            <li> My feet really aren&#x27;t that rough</li>
            <li> They really take off all the rough stuff from your feet.  </li>
            <li> it is totally painless and leaves my heels soft.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well, as expected.</li>
            <li> The course rolls work extremely well for very callous areas.  </li>
            <li> these rollers work better than the blue ones if you really tough feet&lt;</li>
            <li> Disappointed, seemed less effective than the standard rollers, and more pricey.  </li>
            <li> My new Emjoi is the answer to my dry cracked feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This course roller really gets off the dead skin and makes your feet soft.  </li>
            <li> most rollers are not coarse enough for my tough feet.  </li>
            <li> In a few minutes I was ready for my sandals!</li>
            <li> The others are pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> If you press down too hard, the roller isn&#x27;t able to spin like it should</li>
            <li> Not so..Slightly disappointed, but I love the product itself!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try it which worked out well because the tool gives me extra reach and its much faster and takes less effort than using a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> works good removes heavy callous a little slow but does the job...</li>
            <li> You will love this if your feet are heavily calloused, but it might be too tough on sensitive feet.</li>
            <li> I usually clean mine at least when changing from one foot to the other and when finished.</li>
            <li> you put a dark towel down and use it, you&#x27;ll see the (yucky) proof that this does remove A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much nicer to be able to treat my feet at home instead of an expensive pedi at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At last there is a tool that can handle my gross, dry, cracked summer feet.</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> Unit came with coarse, which seemed to take a long time.</li>
            <li> They also last a long time before they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> they dont last very long.</li>
            <li> They are doing their job but do not last very long at all, therefore way overpriced.</li>
            <li> I bought the green - and my feet aren&#x27;t terribly bad, but I&#x27;d even go one more higher - which I think would be the gray/silver.  </li>
            <li> The things that come with aging - for crying out loud!</li>
            <li> the right way(not applying pressure and letting the roller sort of file the rough spot delicately)</li>
            <li> JUST WISH THE ROLLERS WOULD LAST LONGER, HOWEVER IT&#x27;S LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A  PEDICURE AND BETTER RESULTS.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These extreme rollers will really eradicate dead skin.</li>
            <li> but they get dull really fast.</li>
            <li> but if you have tough feet I would recommend you use these rollers first then use the blue rollers.</li>
            <li> and longer I&#x27;m stretching in this awkward position the more pain</li>
            <li> the green are course and if you got tuff feet they are grades from tuff to soft in colors n variety of grit</li>
            <li> These help when you have waited too long to do a pedi.  </li>
            <li> They work just as expected, except that they seem to last longer for me than I thought they would.</li>
            <li> If you want to go all out, follow up with a heavy layer of cream and then don some cotton socks, go to bed and wake up to soft feet.</li>
            <li> It will take quite a bit of time with the blue and pink rollers that come with the Micro-Pedi, save those for finishing.</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin they may be too harsh for you.</li>
            <li> It works but takes a long time.</li>
            <li> These rollers take too long to remove calluses.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with my heals cracking for years and have finally found (a partial solution).</li>
            <li> so you need to take care when using them that you don&#x27;t keep it on one spot too long.</li>
            <li> My feet are harsh, and these rollers make my feet baby soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long.  </li>
            <li> they definately work very well on the thick calluses</li>
            <li> Be care though and keep it to heel and very flat tight areas of skin because it can and will do damage if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> This thing has saved me money in the long run!</li>
            <li> I also bought an Emjoi and the Xtreme Coarse Rollers for all of my boys and have recommended it to all of my family since we are all cursed with extreme callus buildup.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife who has had very rough, coarse, crack heels.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product to rid myself of cracked dry heels and it works.  </li>
            <li> So at least in my case for the short amount of time I&#x27;m using this tool it doesn&#x27;t heat up the tool like it did with the standard course blue rollers.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the coarseness wore down after using it 5-6 times (about 5 min sessions each).  </li>
            <li> However, I would still recommend over the blue rollers as they get down to the softer skin faster.  </li>
            <li> took way less time than using the regular roller (which I will use on a weekly basis during the summer)....</li>
            <li> Women may prefer a less coarse roller.</li>
            <li> The Xtreme Coarse Rollers were exactly what I needed for my very tough calluses.  </li>
            <li> You need to have a gentle touch, no need to press down (as a matter of fact it will slow or stop the roller).</li>
            <li> Not sure that less extreme rollers would have helped as much.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use the less coarse rollers because my feet were that rough.  </li>
            <li> The only piece of advice I will give you is to just press hard enough to slightly slow down the cylinder, too much pressure and it will stop.to prevent risking skin damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are just not a significant improvement over the regular rollers.</li>
            <li> These really work on the tough skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> They work really well and get rid of tough calluses.</li>
            <li> a side note I am a male and as such my callouses are rather hard.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled across the Emjoi Micro-Pedi and considering how rough my heels are decided to get the Xtreme course rollers as my replacement rollers.</li>
            <li> Seems like a big waste of plastic...</li>
            <li> the stock rollers worse out to fast and burned through batteries.  </li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s too rough for that.  </li>
            <li> Removes all the rough calluses with no pain.</li>
            <li> This took them off with minimal errort,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the red, the blues and worked my way up to the green as they came out.  </li>
            <li> It took a few times, but this did the trick and now maintenance is simple.</li>
            <li> I purchase these rollers because my man has some really rough feet.</li>
            <li> They remove all the rough spots without damaging the skin.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful using these.</li>
            <li> or when they start looking rough.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be coarser then they were..</li>
            <li> Wear out far to quickly :(</li>
            <li> It still takes forever to sand down dry skin.</li>
            <li> As for what I had to deal with, I would consider my issues fairly average (only a few callouses, rough spots, etc).</li>
            <li> If you have rough feet, skip the other rollers and go for these</li>
            <li> I will buy the electric larger powered unit and hope it will not be bogged down like</li>
            <li> Frankly, I found very little difference between results with these and the regular ones.  </li>
            <li> If you have extremely course callus feet, purchase this the electric emoji micro pedi.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would order them in the future</li>
            <li> When you try to give yourself a pedicure, you usually have to contort into various yoga-envious shapes in order to get to the areas of your feet that need attention.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen other grooming tools which Amazon customers have recommended for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> He has not said one way or the other, so guess it works.</li>
            <li> It is not too rough and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other as I have bad&lt;br /&gt;calluses</li>
            <li> IF HAVE VERY ROUGH FEET,</li>
            <li> I would only recommend these if you have very heavy callouses.</li>
            <li> These rollers are very rough</li>
            <li> I have very rough skin on my heals.  </li>
            <li> coarse roller, however, are not so rough as to be hard on your skin.  </li>
            <li> the cost of the rollers is minimal and they last at least 8</li>
            <li> If you have tough callouses do not waste your money on the other rollers.  </li>
            <li> it does the job on my hard callus.purchased a cheaper model of different brand and could not get the rollers .</li>
            <li> These seem like they work the same as the extra course maybe even a little worse.  </li>
            <li> And meet the needs of average feet.</li>
            <li> The only negative response is the replacement cost.</li>
            <li> I seem to develop thick callouses constantly and this takes care of them.</li>
            <li> Was worried that it might be too harsh but was somewhat less than expected.  </li>
            <li> I have used them both &amp; these seem to take the callouses down faster however;  </li>
            <li> If you put any pressure on it, it slows down.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this green roller unless you have extremely course callus feet.</li>
            <li> Less time also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m opting for the less disruptive rasp and lotion from now on.</li>
            <li> Received quickly, no problems.</li>
            <li> This roller&#x27;s grade of abrasive is what is necessary to restore seriously callused feet.  </li>
            <li> and my feet are getting smoother and less cracked by the day.</li>
            <li> Plus there&#x27;s no true commitment</li>
            <li> thick callused heels from being a nurse and being on my feet for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> these things are very harsh, you have to be very careful</li>
            <li> It shaved off the hard rough calluses like they were butter.  </li>
            <li> I have used these heavy duty rollers with my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> At a roller a month, which is stretching it, that&#x27;s getting into a lot of money over a few years.</li>
            <li> But you have to use it all the time in order to keep your feet looking nice.&lt;br /&gt;These roller take of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> After using these, I use a heavy duty moisturizer or foot creme, put on some cotton socks &amp; let it soak in.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it might be to harsh on my feet</li>
            <li> A few things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> you need to do a few treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of dead skin that was coming off.  </li>
            <li> I got the battery powered one and it is basically a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Need to use over a trash can though because you can literally see a pile of dead skin fall off.</li>
            <li> It takes all of the dead skin away.  </li>
            <li> I get extremely thick build up of hard dry skin on the soles of my feet.  </li>
            <li> and so I get pretty ugly calluses on my heels.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a section of raw skin from trying to get into a crack.</li>
            <li> As the Emjoi instructions say, you need to move slowly and not press down hard.</li>
            <li> I have really hard, tough, dry feet.</li>
            <li> I used the ped egg in the past and you can&#x27;t find the blades anymore.</li>
            <li> I found an electric one on Amazon &amp; bought these course rollers  as I was not sure the ones that came with it would do the job.</li>
            <li> I usually go and get a pedicure to help soften these.</li>
            <li> At this point most of my spine is fused taking using a Pumice stone is a slow difficult and painful task.  </li>
            <li> Wish they would last longer because they are expensive.</li>
            <li> A waste of my money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reason why these are built so small.</li>
            <li> If you have cracked or thick calluses these green rollers will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I used one of these Xtreme coarse rollers when I bought the Emjoi micro pedi unit because my feet were bad with so much dry skin.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m hard on my feet.</li>
            <li> I then applied a thick foot cream and put socks on to go to bed.  </li>
            <li> Well no more!</li>
            <li> NO MORE TOUGH CALLUSES.</li>
            <li> I previously had literally chunks of skin on my heels that were so bad they would drag on my sheets.</li>
            <li> I like these as they are less expensive that the.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some time, use the Xtreme coarse if your feet are in bad shape.</li>
            <li> Takes care of those dry ugly heels.</li>
            <li> My husband works with his hands and this helps to remove tough calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a tough callous on my foot.  </li>
            <li> It works fantastically at removing that hardened, tough skin.</li>
            <li> you will need for very thick calluses</li>
            <li> Last for about two times then worthless.</li>
            <li> Finally my wife can take care of her bad callus!</li>
            <li> have very ugly coarse heels</li>
            <li> But replacement rollers are so expensive.</li>
            <li> Failed to noitice</li>
            <li> Worked as expected on my horrible heals.</li>
            <li> ( i mean so bad the people who do my manicure cringe!)  </li>
            <li> They would get so bad</li>
            <li> This is just the ticket for managing my ugly heels.</li>
            <li> I was shocked because nothing I found was working</li>
            <li> I used to have cracked skin on my heels that was painful to walk on and it bled sometimes.  </li>
            <li> It works and you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This Xtreme Coarse roller definitely did the trick!  I thought it might be too harsh...but using it cut time off of my regular routine.</li>
            <li> works the best out of all strengths. Less time also</li>
            <li> The green rollers really got the job done on my calloused heels.</li>
            <li> the green are course and if you got tuff feet they are grades from tuff to soft in colors n variety of grit</li>
            <li> I love the emoji system, leaves my feet smooth and soft. I seem to develop thick callouses constantly and this takes care of them. Also arrived on time, exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> These work great in my Emjoi and keeps my heels baby soft.They last a long time.</li>
            <li> Always nice to have extras.</li>
            <li> Work better than regular ones, but would have them to be even courser!</li>
            <li> great customer service, item as described</li>
            <li> My wife  loves the easy change over with this kind of roller thanks.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; rollers work the best. Even coarser would better, but probably would be to strong for the average user. Up here in the northeast, the dry winters make my heels so thick theses work the best.</li>
            <li> as explained. great product.</li>
            <li> These work briefly.  However, I have callouses for a reason, and I realized that, as nice as it is to have smooth, flat feet, it&#x27;s painful to walk around with them.  I&#x27;m opting for the less disruptive rasp and lotion from now on.</li>
            <li> These are the best but always get on sale, I got 4 for $14 but they do work and get the machine that plugs in rather than the battery operated.</li>
            <li> You need the coarse as well as the regular.  These help when you have waited too long to do a pedi.  Helps take off the calluses easier than the blue one(regular).  It&#x27;s best to have both.</li>
            <li> It still did not remove all the dry skin on my heels, so not to pleased</li>
            <li> These rollers works great for my tough calluses. I used it with my battery operated Emjoi. And I waiting for my Emjoi Micro-Pedi POWER corded version that I also ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they have this available in a value pack, these can get pricey.</li>
            <li> These really work on the tough skin on my feet. I have to use them almost daily, but my feet look much better.</li>
            <li> The Xtreme Coarse Rollers were exactly what I needed for my very tough calluses.  It shaved off the hard rough calluses like they were butter.  I followed up with the blue Extra Coarse Roller and the skin was smooth and callus free in no time!</li>
            <li> Love my Emjoi. I ordered different rollers and love them...My daughter is ordering her one.....</li>
            <li> My feet have never been smoother. I stumbled across the Emjoi Micro-Pedi and considering how rough my heels are decided to get the Xtreme course rollers as my replacement rollers. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and plan to order more soon.</li>
            <li> My order arrived very promptly. I just love these &amp;#34;pads&amp;#34; fory Emjoi, I use it every night &amp; it works wonders on my feet! I&#x27;ll definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Great product and will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Yup! First time out, I needed to spend 40.minutes with the most course roller . I&#x27;m on my feet for most of the hours I spend at my job. Come sorting, my neglected advised feet are grim, and nasty. After the initial 45 minute session, I only need it for about 10 minutes once a week. Great product.</li>
            <li> these things are very harsh, you have to be very careful</li>
            <li> Love it and much cheaper. Fits perfectly. Does the job gently but effectively.</li>
            <li> These rollers make short work of getting rid of calluses.  The Emjoi Micro-Pedi Nano comes with the finer blue roller, which also works well, but these are just a wee bit quicker to do the job.</li>
            <li> These are ok, as is the machine, but if you have thickened feet, you are better off sticking to the old razer.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is a wonderful device, my heals have never looked this good. It is easy, can be done in your own private home, no need to go for a pedicare, which saves tons of money.  The rollers are different courseness to adapt to what you may need. I would definitely recommend this and buy it again when mine wears out!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly.  Do what they are supposed to.m</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT REFILL ROLLERS - DO HAVE TO REPLACE OFTEN IF HAVE VERY ROUGH FEET, BUT WELL WORTH IT FOR YOUR FEET TO LOOK AWESOME</li>
            <li> These are the best for removing calluses and keeping your feet soft. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product, and this two-pack is a good value.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased the Emjoi Micro-Pedi, I also bought these Xtreme Coarse Rollers. They work just as expected, except that they seem to last longer for me than I thought they would. I don&#x27;t know if these work better than the non-brand that&#x27;s out there. Maybe when I re-order, I&#x27;ll make that comparison and update this review. As for price, I think that they are well worth it since getting a pedi would cost me more, much more?  As for what I had to deal with, I would consider my issues fairly average (only a few callouses, rough spots, etc). Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy one of these wonderful contraptions.</li>
            <li> The blue roller was good however this works much better and quicker on a callus than the blue roller did.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these xx coarse rollers but am willing to give them a try.  After months wearing boots with no socks and an infrequent pedicure, these are necessary.  The x coarse do a great job however. And meet the needs of average feet.</li>
            <li> These are great. I will buy more when I need them:)</li>
            <li> Received quickly, no problems.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> fits perfectly in my Emjoi Rechargeable Micro-Pedi Foot Buffer. I opted for the extreme coarse rollers and am very pleased with how quickly it dissolves rough skin.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to I just wish it lasted longer.  Seems like a big waste of plastic...</li>
            <li> I love this super coarse grit! It does the job faster! I will purchase this grit from now on. I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Really works well on toughest callouses.</li>
            <li> These work great to smooth out skin AFTER a good file is used to remove callouses</li>
            <li> So glad I found the Emjoi micro-pedi system. I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; feet which pedicures and files just couldn&#x27;t keep up with the problem.  I bought these new stronger rollers which work great. I also use the regular rollers to keep up the smoothness. I think of it as if sanding wood with sandpaper, using the coarse paper first to get off the paint and finishing with the fine paper to make it smooth. What I love about the Emjoi is no mess with soaking and no long time required. Which means I do it more often because it&#x27;s quick and easy...</li>
            <li> these rollers work better than the blue ones that my Emjoi Callus Remover came with. They are a bit pricey but if you have tough feet I would recommend you use these rollers first then use the blue rollers. They work great on tough skin and make your feet feel smooth, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love my emjoi mico pedi foot sander. I have given it as a gift to many people in my life. Not for any other reason than that it&#x27;s an amazing product and that everyone needs to smooth their feet once and a while.&lt;br /&gt;These roller refills are even better than the ones that come with the product. Excellent for those hard, dry areas. I love how soft my feet are after using this.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite sanding rollers.  They blast through all of the dry skin on your heels and leave them extra smooth</li>
            <li> These really are the roughest and toughest of the Micro-Pedi Rollers.  I needed extra and these certainly do the job.</li>
            <li> I purchased additional rolls when I bought the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  The entire device isn&#x27;t worth the price.  Sure it works if you have the time to repeatedly keep going over your feet but I get better results from a $3.00 hand-foot sander I get at my local Drug Store.</li>
            <li> I like the original device but for my calloused feet (could practically use a grinder on them!)  the stock rollers worse out to fast and burned through batteries.  This is just the ticket for managing my ugly heels.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a friend at work. It came fast and is easy to use, makes my feet feel soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> perfect for extremely dry feet like mine.</li>
            <li> I have used these heavy duty rollers with my [[ASIN:B005BG5CK6 Emjoi Micro-Pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover]] They work really well and get rid of tough calluses. My husband works with his hands and this helps to remove tough calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do remember to replace the batteries in your emjoi often, the rollers don&#x27;t work as well as the can if they don&#x27;t have full power.</li>
            <li> Received my replacement rollers timely and they work great. I will reorder again and again.  They fit my emjoi perfectly, I recommend to others</li>
            <li> They really work and make keeping feet callus free and well groomed a snap. I would recommend them to anyone looking for good pedicure tools.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that there were different grit options!!!  These do a so much better job than the light blue that normally come with the remover!</li>
            <li> These work way better than the standard coarse rollers. It still takes a lot of time (I spent about half an hour on each foot), but they got them nice and smooth!</li>
            <li> These are great to start the de-callus process with my Emjoi Mini-Pedi; After using this roller I switch it out with the Extra-Coarse roller to finish out my mini-pedi.</li>
            <li> These are the refills for my emjoi callus remover. Love Emjoi.</li>
            <li> They work great but I thought they would be significantly more course than the blue ones.  They feel course but I think do about the same as the blue ones.</li>
            <li> I used one of these rollers to get things started because my feet were so calloused. I ended up with a section of raw skin from trying to get into a crack. It got infected. My doctor put me on antibiotics and I had to apply a non-stick pad with antibiotic ointment on it and change it twice a day. I had to wrap gauze around it to keep the pad in place because tape wouldn&#x27;t stick to the bottom of my foot. I asked my doctor what to use in the future and he said, \\&quot;an emery board.\\&quot; I found something as gentle as a coarse emery board and it&#x27;s a lot easier to hold onto. It&#x27;s called a \\&quot;contour toe file.\\&quot; They sell them on Amazon as an Add-on-item but I bought mine at Meijer. I have also seen them at CVS. Look at Amazon&#x27;s picture of it so you know what to look for, and try not to fix years of wear and tear in one sitting. An occasional soak before using the contour file and a good heel cream and lotion have helped more since my mishap.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect level coarsness for me, I think... anything more and I&#x27;d grind too much away.  A hint from another reviewer does definitely work - grab an old toothbrush to clean the buildup of skin out of the texture of these.  it will help extend the life of the roller.</li>
            <li> This roller definitely removes the dead skin from my feet much better than the roller that originally came with the Micro Pedi.&lt;br /&gt;I would not use this on the pads of your fingertips or your palm, though; it&#x27;s too rough for that.  But for calloused feet it&#x27;s great.  Still doesn&#x27;t remove all of my callouses but it gets them looking good for about three or four days.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well</li>
            <li> these rollers work better than the blue ones if you really tough feet&lt;br /&gt;i use these to first remove the tough skin then the blue ones to smooth it out&lt;br /&gt;they really leave your skin soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this</li>
            <li> So glad I ordered these! They are much better than the blue one. My feet are brand new and baby soft!!</li>
            <li> Just as promised, these rollers are the coarser version, use these then follow with the blue ones and end with some cream.  If you want to go all out, follow up with a heavy layer of cream and then don some cotton socks, go to bed and wake up to soft feet.</li>
            <li> I used one of these Xtreme coarse rollers when I bought the Emjoi micro pedi unit because my feet were bad with so much dry skin. These were amazing at how quickly the rollers powered thru all the dryness to start to reveal nice heels again. The rollers are easy to put into unit too</li>
            <li> Unit came with coarse, which seemed to take a long time. These seem faster and don&#x27;t give the impression that they will take too much off.</li>
            <li> Great product. Wish it had been invented years ago. Takes care of those dry ugly heels. I live in sandals makes them look 100% better</li>
            <li> This roller&#x27;s grade of abrasive is what is necessary to restore seriously callused feet.  They also seem to last longer than the Extra Coarse variety.</li>
            <li> It worked very fast , I think that you hit it on the head it is a great product  works great keep making it  thank  you  R.H</li>
            <li> They WORK, and that being said is a lot. I used the ped egg in the past and you can&#x27;t find the blades anymore. This method seems to work much better.</li>
            <li> I bought theese to complete the Emjoi little device which came with only the blue rolls (good for later). They work just fine, as expected. No signs of wear so far. Read the instructions: do not wash then, it is not needed.</li>
            <li> These seem like they work the same as the extra course maybe even a little worse.  From now on I&#x27;ll just get the extra course.</li>
            <li> The blue rollers while good are more gentle and take longer, like over a period of 3-4 days to safely remove all callused heals.  This courser roller I used tonight.  And WOW!  What a difference a coarse roller can make.  This will be a real time saver for me, as I&#x27;m prone to quick callous build-up and refuse to pay the price for the prestige pedi salons in my city.  The cheaper ones I don&#x27;t trust for sanitary reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your pedi is a longer work in progress, maybe it&#x27;s time to move up to a courser roller.  These seem to do the trick for me! Less time in the bathroom working on my feet means more time in flip flops and sandals while enjoying the beautiful weather with very pretty feet!</li>
            <li> I really am a fan of the Emjoi products. I use one roller each month. I will keep purchasing these as it saves me from a pricey pedicure.</li>
            <li> I love this for my heels but I feel gouged by the prices.  4 refill rollers cost more than the entire set.  At a roller a month, which is stretching it, that&#x27;s getting into a lot of money over a few years.</li>
            <li> Works great, really helps my dry feet</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife who has had very rough, coarse, crack heels.  She has used this product several times per week since purchasing the Mini-Pedi machine and is extremely pleased with it&#x27;s results.</li>
            <li> Again just needed some refills. Trying to maintain my feet. They are to only ones I have. That is all.</li>
            <li> This micro-pedi foot care product is an excellent choice and the rollers are easily replaced and cleaned.  The Coarse rollers helped with stubborn areas.</li>
            <li> Excellent product if you need some extra attention for your feet. I will purchase this again.  Gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Nice and coarse.  Seemed to wear down quickly though.  Nice to have an option more coarse than the blue ones.</li>
            <li> It works great but maintaining is key, so I will be buying cheaper replacements! I would absolutely recommend this product if you have rough feet and are a lady that wants a man to touch her feet without having a panic attack!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife&#x27;s emjoi micro pedi and man it was like night and day in terms of difference between the coarse and extra coarse.  Get this item if you have issues buffing away the callouses on your feet, these will make them go away in no time.</li>
            <li> I thought the blue rollers that came with the MicroPedi were great, but these are fabulous!  They really took care of the tougher callouses that needed a little more attention.  The only drawback is the coarseness wore down after using it 5-6 times (about 5 min sessions each).  However, I would still recommend over the blue rollers as they get down to the softer skin faster.  I am going to order another set so I&#x27;m ready for the summer!</li>
            <li> excellent piece of skin removal equipment. As I walk around barefooted, this keeps all my foot problems at bay Thank you kindly. Anthony Luck</li>
            <li> Works great, have bought several Rollers as gifts and always a big hit. Saves time and does the job excellent!</li>
            <li> I have seen Emjoi Micro-Pedi for removing foot callouses; but did not want a battery operated one. I found an electric one on Amazon &amp; bought these course rollers  as I was not sure the ones that came with it would do the job. I have used them both &amp; these seem to take the callouses down faster however;  I would only recommend these if you have very heavy callouses. They do as good a job as having a professional pedicure &amp; you can do it at home &amp; save time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> My feet have never been completely callus free and so smooth until now and I have tried many products including regular pedicures. I used these rollers with a cord powered Emjoi.  I probably spent 30 minutes a foot the first time but the results are spectacular.</li>
            <li> This product actually works so happy that I went ahead and brought the item.  Very pleased with my purchase.  I have and will continue to recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these.  It&#x27;s important to start with these then you can use the blue ones to keep them smooth.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some time, use the Xtreme coarse if your feet are in bad shape. It will take quite a bit of time with the blue and pink rollers that come with the Micro-Pedi, save those for finishing.</li>
            <li> Love it, I recommend this strongly if you have ruff feet and want them to be smooth. I was shocked because nothing I found was working and I said I might as well give it a try and I was sold.  It works and you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product to have, I now can do a pedicure myself. I am now able to take better care of my feet, I can remove the Claus and ruff areas from feet. This helps to keep them soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I have several different types of rollers for my emjoi, but these last longer !!  I am really glad they came out with this roller. The whole package of the emjoi pedi call us remover is the BEST!!! Thank you. Lynnie</li>
            <li> If you have extremely course callus feet, purchase this the electric emoji micro pedi.  Remember!! Don&#x27;t use this green roller unless you have extremely course callus feet.</li>
            <li> Powerful for those stubborn areas, yet gentle enough to get the job done! In a few minutes I was ready for my sandals!</li>
            <li> great addition to the base product</li>
            <li> I love the machine on the feet, bit the refills don&#x27;t last long.  The coarse ones last longer than the regular ones.</li>
            <li> Was worried that it might be too harsh but was somewhat less than expected.  Probably would order again as it does the job.</li>
            <li> I will never get another pedicure! The emoji Nano does it all, if you don&#x27;t mind experimenting with different roller strengths. A truly painless rough-heel smoother.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The best thing I ever did was to buy the machine that uses these rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful for taking the rough skin off your feet. But you have to use it all the time in order to keep your feet looking nice.&lt;br /&gt;These roller take of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> If you have rough feet, skip the other rollers and go for these but if you have sensitive skin they may be too harsh for you.</li>
            <li> this roller, in the emjoi is a God send.  for years i&#x27;ve tried to manage my unruly hard-used feet to no avail.  now my feet are amazing!  i have even used these around my fingernails for cuticle removal.  love it. love it. love it.</li>
            <li> it does the job on my hard callus.purchased a cheaper model of different brand and could not get the rollers . tha is why i ordered this one and i really love it</li>
            <li> I like these as they are less expensive that the. &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34;. I thought that they would be more course though. Still works better than the regular grade you get with the systems.</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet but  im going to try this week to used this it looks like it works hope it dose thank you</li>
            <li> Finally my wife can take care of her bad callus! We are happy about it. It is way tougher than the stock blue.</li>
            <li> The rollers work good but the price is very high for just two of them. I am not sure if I would order them in the future</li>
            <li> I moved to Florida, land of constant sandals, and my once-beautiful feet started getting scratchy, no matter how regularly I used my blue micro-pedi. I got these, and man...They are awesome.</li>
            <li> works good removes heavy callous a little slow but does the job...</li>
            <li> Works great!! Removes all the rough calluses with no pain.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, seemed less effective than the standard rollers, and more pricey.  Lesson learned.  Next time I will stick with the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; blue rollers</li>
            <li> works great to grind off that dead skin on your  feet or hands just don&#x27;t hit the puss if its juicy</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. A big step up in results from the blue Micro-Pedi rollers!</li>
            <li> Love love the emjoli. My feet have never looked and felt better!  I don&#x27;t need a pedicure now only polish changes!</li>
            <li> I do like the device and the rollers - it does work, just ensure you&#x27;re getting the right &#x27;graininess&#x27; on the roller - and with the device, never apply pressure.  The blue are extremely light.  I bought the green - and my feet aren&#x27;t terribly bad, but I&#x27;d even go one more higher - which I think would be the gray/silver.  The Green is good and has worked for me - I think I would have had a better response to one more coarse.  The things that come with aging - for crying out loud!</li>
            <li> Works great on my tougher areas.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference between these and the blue ones. They both do a great job though.</li>
            <li> At last there is a tool that can handle my gross, dry, cracked summer feet. I use it about once a week and my feet are getting smoother and less cracked by the day.</li>
            <li> Very effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I gave the actual machine 4 stars only in an earlier review as the manufacturers do not include cleaning brushes and since it cannot be properly cleaned - i.e. no water, damp cloth or even rubbing alcohol to sterilise the equipment so basically it would not be hygienic to share your rollers.  However, the rollers have nothing to do with that statement.  They work exactly as advertised and are the reason the machine gets 4 stars.  For that matter, I have only been invited to write this review as I waited to see whether the machine would work before I proceeded to order additional rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that Emjoi offers a roller with this level of coarseness, it gets the job done on calluses and rough skin and leaves your feet baby soft I follow up with Bath n&#x27; body works Heal of Approval Cracked Heel Treatment and the results are wonderful!! This roller is so effective I only have to use it once a week!! I am very pleased with this product and will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you don&#x27;t want to read elaborations about funky feet, so I&#x27;ll spare the graphic descriptions and just say that these REALLY work on tough callouses and leave feet baby-smooth.  This whole system works best if the skin is dry, so no need to pre-soak like you do with a regular pedicure.  After using these, I use a heavy duty moisturizer or foot creme, put on some cotton socks &amp; let it soak in.</li>
            <li> This worked great removing the calloused skin from my heels. I have only used it twice so far but seems to do an adequate job.</li>
            <li> This item works very well for my husband&#x27;s rough feet.  The delivery was on time and I appreciate that I did not have wait a week.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that these would be extra , extra course, but they don&#x27;t seem to really be any more coarse then the next level down.  I need really, really  coarse ones for my heels. I wonder do they have any super, ultra coarse ones?</li>
            <li> JUST WISH THE ROLLERS WOULD LAST LONGER, HOWEVER IT&#x27;S LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A  PEDICURE AND BETTER RESULTS.  NO MORE TOUGH CALLUSES.</li>
            <li> We had the standard micro-pedi rollers that came with the product and decided to try the super coarse ones.  I was concerned that it might be to harsh on my feet but it worked great.  My feet have looked so soft and beautiful all summer long thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Great roller for if you have thick rough calluses! Does a better job than going to a salon!</li>
            <li> I chose this product to rid myself of cracked dry heels and it works.  I have to use it quite often especially after the masseuse that worked on my feet said, &amp;#34;that tool you&#x27;re using is really working&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m sold, and my feet can prove it</li>
            <li> they dont last very long.</li>
            <li> Wear out far to quickly :(</li>
            <li> Works great I love it!</li>
            <li> Definitely more abrasive than the regular rollers. I used them two weeks ago and my feet are still callus and crack free. It does not take too much time. I put cream on my feet after using the coarse rollers. If you have any problem with your feet I would ask your doctor whether these are okay to use, because if you are a person who does things to the extreme you could remove too much skin.</li>
            <li> Will buy again! Great price, super product!</li>
            <li> I have the worst calluses ever.  These rollers smooth them out very well but I sometimes get over zealous and I end up taking off a bit too much skin.  That&#x27;s MY problem; not the rollers fault.  I could use something a bit MORE coarse but these will do perfectly until I need to reorder.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I always have calluses on my heels and have tried other devices and they weren&#x27;t very powerful. This one really doesn&#x27;t either. If you put any pressure on it, it slows down. It works but takes a long time.</li>
            <li> not as powerful as advertise.</li>
            <li> I love going barefoot and, as a result, have very thick callused feet. This took them off with minimal errort,</li>
            <li> not as coarse as it should be.</li>
            <li> I use these every night and they work great!</li>
            <li> I have horrible ( i mean so bad the people who do my manicure cringe!)  thick callused heels from being a nurse and being on my feet for long periods of time. I usually go and get a pedicure to help soften these. Well no more! This thing has saved me money in the long run! I got the coarse roller and within 5 minutes all of the calluses were gone and my heels were as soft as a babies butt!  Best micro pedi EVER! I will never buy another item!</li>
            <li> They work really well, and fairly quickly. i am happy with the results I get. Better than the professional pedicure.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with chronic callus buildup.  I bought my Emjoi to smooth out my callus buildup.  It came with coarse rollers but I wanted something better and found it with Xtreme Coarse Rollers.  I also bought an Emjoi and the Xtreme Coarse Rollers for all of my boys and have recommended it to all of my family since we are all cursed with extreme callus buildup.  This machine saved my feet.</li>
            <li> Great for very rough feet.  Smoothes them right out.  I couldn&#x27;t use the less coarse rollers because my feet were that rough.  These did the trick.</li>
            <li> I really like the Emjoi and these work great.  They are not too coarse and leave a nice smooth finish after using.</li>
            <li> When you try to give yourself a pedicure, you usually have to contort into various yoga-envious shapes in order to get to the areas of your feet that need attention.  These rollers are wonderful because they make the job quicker and easier.</li>
            <li> Very good product, but the rollers dull easily.  Be sure to clean the rollers to make them last longer</li>
            <li> These are actually more coarse and work really well. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I tried the knock offs, you get twice as many but they simply don&#x27;t work as well as the originals.  The Xtreme Course rollers work the best at smoothing your heels.  I&#x27;ve tried the red, the blues and worked my way up to the green as they came out.  Now I just go straight to the green.  I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
            <li> Felt and worked no different from the regular blue ones. Bummer.</li>
            <li> These are the best, and Amazon&#x27;s price is the best.</li>
            <li> love them my order came fast i would order again</li>
            <li> The XTREME COARSE rollers are a great product. They are much better than the original rollers that came with the tool.  However the batteries will not last as long, but they are cheap. I suggest using the MICRO-PEDI outside due to the very fine dust they all make if you have any type of allergy.  My tool is older, 2 years and still working, but I will consider buying a newer one,&lt;br /&gt;I think they have more power. They also have a cord tool ie. no battery. This is the best tool in the house, I love it.  Don&#x27;t buy a cheap brand like I did first,  they are toys.  john k...</li>
            <li> I really like this product it does what it says it will do ,no more calluses on the heels just nice smooth feet .yes I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Keep these replacement buffing heads coming, one can never have too many!  Great product!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Micro Pedi system is wonderful.  The course rolls work extremely well for very callous areas.  I would not go without this system.</li>
            <li> If you have calluses, these rollers are what you need to smooth your feet. A few things to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;1. As the Emjoi instructions say, you need to move slowly and not press down hard. If you press down too hard, the roller isn&#x27;t able to spin like it should so it isn&#x27;t able to remove the calluses properly. If you go to fast, the roller is only skimming the calluses and instead of speeding things up, you have to do more passes and it will take more time.&lt;br /&gt;2. Your calluses didn&#x27;t grow overnight. These magically rollers won&#x27;t be able to tackle hard, thick calluses in one seating. Plan to pamper you feet multiple times within a few days to get amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use the brush that was part of your Emjoi package to clean the rollers. I usually clean mine at least when changing from one foot to the other and when finished. Doing this will extend the life of the roller. (I actually use a SOFT bristle tooth brush on mine)</li>
            <li> ... However, it worn out quite quickly after first use compare to the price you pay for, hope it&#x27;s could last a bit longer</li>
            <li> I have moderately cracked feet.  It took a few times, but this did the trick and now maintenance is simple.</li>
            <li> They work well but I prefer the old fashioned grater method. These rollers take too long to remove calluses.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with my heals cracking for years and have finally found (a partial solution). These rollers are very rough so you need to take care when using them that you don&#x27;t keep it on one spot too long. I uses a slow back and forth motion keeping an eye on the progress so that I don&#x27;t sand to close to good skin. You need to have a gentle touch, no need to press down (as a matter of fact it will slow or stop the roller). Now if I could just find a cream/lotion/ointment that really works I will be a happy camper. I am really glad I have found this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 major back surgeries so taking basic care of my feet can be challenging.  Many years a physician recommended to me to use a Pumice Stone to keep my calluses under control.  At this point most of my spine is fused taking using a Pumice stone is a slow difficult and painful task.  The Callus shaver advertised and then read the consumer reviews which were impressive I decided to try it which worked out well because the tool gives me extra reach and its much faster and takes less effort than using a pumice stone.  This Grooming Tool is like a Pumice Stone on steroid&#x27;s!  When originally purchased this tool originally came with two of the standard course blue rollers which worked reasonably well but it was still not an easy task and longer I&#x27;m stretching in this awkward position the more pain I&#x27;m in.  When I saw the Courser rollers on the Amazon.com website I decided to give them a try and I&#x27;m glad I did with the standard Blue Rollers which I thought were OK the task took significantly longer and the Grooming Tool would sometimes get hot.. With these Extra Course Rollers the task is very rapid and the Tool doesn&#x27;t heat up. So at least in my case for the short amount of time I&#x27;m using this tool it doesn&#x27;t heat up the tool like it did with the standard course blue rollers. Using the Extra Course Rollers the task significanltly faster and smoother, and cooler because the rollers are heating up the same way which makes the task not only easier on my back but my feet as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine most of the people who buy this groomer tool and rollers are females and not physically challenged males, and most women that I know are significantly more fastidious about the appearance of their feet than I am.  I would recommend what should use reasonable caution, with this is a reasonable powerful grooming tool in combination with the extra course rollers which work very fast and it would be very easy to over do it which I imagine could leave ones feet overly sensitive.I would suggest that once you get past the tough stuff, you consider those who are inclined to get a more finished look switch to some kind of finishing tool. I know this company makes fine rollers as well which I imagine could be used for that purpose and I&#x27;ve seen other grooming tools which Amazon customers have recommended for this purpose.  I hope you find my review helpful.</li>
            <li> I purchase these rollers because my man has some really rough feet. The first time I used it on him he thought it was a joke because it felt so soft. By the time I finished his feet were much smoother but I realized it would take several weeks before his callouses would be completely gone.</li>
            <li> To all the people who claim the Emjoi Pedi doesn&#x27;t work...you need to do a few treatments.&lt;br /&gt;If you put a dark towel down and use it, you&#x27;ll see the (yucky) proof that this does remove A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much nicer to be able to treat my feet at home instead of an expensive pedi at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this...the rollers and the unit.</li>
            <li> These really work!  Much better than Blue Rollers that are just regular.&lt;br /&gt;The entire Emjoi Callas Remover is a must for at home pedicures.&lt;br /&gt;We have the recharge unit and use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with the Blue Rollers, but be sure to order extra Green Course !</li>
            <li> Really works on skin removal....</li>
            <li> These work great but seem to wear out somewhat quickly so that is the reason for the 4 stars. I have purchased many different grits of roller for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi and these seem to be the best as far as performance.</li>
            <li> These are much better than the blue ones I had been ordering.  I have a tough callous on my foot.  It would take much longer to work on with the last grinders that I used.  These are really course and remove the callous fast and has been lasting much longer.  They are a winner in my book.</li>
            <li> First of all, I absolutely love the Emjoi Micro-pedi!  I have the rollers that came with it and they work ok, but these super course ones are amazing!</li>
            <li> In love with these!  Highly recommended!  For dry skin it is the best.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly, but haven&#x27;t really noticed the difference between the these Xtreme Course Rollers and the standard rollers.</li>
            <li> you will need for very thick calluses</li>
            <li> My feet are harsh, and these rollers make my feet baby soft.</li>
            <li> These rollers are the best for really thick cracked feet. After that you might want to use a finer grit roller. I&#x27;m glad I bought these, as my feet were horribly thick and cracked. It sanded them to soft pink skin.</li>
            <li> If you really want to have smooth feet and get rid of dead skin, this is the best roller to order. The others are pretty much a waste of money.</li>
            <li> From what I could tell on the Emjoi website, this is their most coarse roller, and the best for stubborn calluses.  I got mine two weeks ago and am impressed how well they worked.  I previously used the default blue rollers that came with the machine, which did a good job smoothing my feet, but could not even come close to tackling my heels that are very rough since I basically walk around barefoot all but 1-2 hours every day.  I used these new xtreme roller was able to smooth out my heels in about 5 minutes per foot, but did not completely get rid of the calluses - that will take lots and lots of time, I am sure.  They seem to stay smooth for several days.  I would not recommend using this roller on soft parts of the feet - I switched out to the blue roller for the pads of my feet.</li>
            <li> these work well on my ruff heels</li>
            <li> Best foot file rollers ever. They remove all the rough spots without damaging the skin. They also last a long time before they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to have found this system; the Emjoi with separate rollers.  While I do not have the most calloused feet they are definitely dry and have some deep creases.  I used this about 4 nights in a row to get my feet the smooththness I was looking for.  I kept moving it while it was &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; rather than risk holding it in one place and burning my skin.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of dead skin that was coming off.  I then applied a thick foot cream and put socks on to go to bed.  Beautiful soft feet in the AM.  I previously had literally chunks of skin on my heels that were so bad they would drag on my sheets. No longer!  Love love love this.  Be care though and keep it to heel and very flat tight areas of skin because it can and will do damage if you are not careful.  It is a machine!</li>
            <li> Works well and last 5-6 months before you notice a need to change it- depending on how often you use it of course.</li>
            <li> Must buy with Emjoi Micro-Pedi</li>
            <li> My new Emjoi is the answer to my dry cracked feet.&lt;br /&gt;These extreme rollers will really eradicate dead skin.</li>
            <li> These are very good for rough feet. They made mine nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Wow, if this is XTREME coarse I will eat my underwear.  Yet tell me why you only pay almost $7 for each roller just because they say xtreme.  Is a 2&amp;#34; square of sandpaper more.  I have found that I can take these rollers that I already have and scrape the old used sandpaper off and roll and glue my own at about 1cent each.  Go figure.  Everything in this day and age is a RIP OFF</li>
            <li> It exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected on my horrible heals.</li>
            <li> would recommend; although you have to go over the areas several times before noticing results.</li>
            <li> I get extremely thick build up of hard dry skin on the soles of my feet.  With several passes these extremely coarse rollers do an excellent job of removing that extremely thick build up!</li>
            <li> We are glad to have found the extra coarse rollers.  They work better than expected and made the callus removal quick.</li>
            <li> This item works great for very rough feet. My dress shoes are murder on my feet and these help them look their best.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a new roller and when I saw that there was a coarse roller available I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;The product was as described and arrived in a timely manner. We would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;My wife said it is comfortable, quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;She tried it and liked it and will continue using them. She definitely like the coarse roller the best.</li>
            <li> As promised. Work great.</li>
            <li> LOVE these! Ive ordered a few other sets, but took longer to remove callouses, these ones are the best, they get rid of calloused skin fast! Use on your feet after showering, works the best then. Once i got my callouses under control, I only use 1 or 2x per week to save on the roller. Will reorder, saves me $ on the pedicure scene too.</li>
            <li> they definately work very well on the thick calluses</li>
            <li> My rough feet wear out the roller quick .</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, exactly as described, and excellent customer service.  Would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is great for people that have more calluses than usual. Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> great product, great price</li>
            <li> I love these rollers. Great for the heels.. I am always having dry heels and this has really helped. Makes the heels smooth.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as getting a professional pedicure but it does allow be to go much longer between pedicures, so it has paid for itself.</li>
            <li> came on time girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Great!&lt;br /&gt;works great and better than shaving that dead skin off your heels any old day&lt;br /&gt;out- stand- ing !</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction. Item as described. Go through them rather rapidlly but still better then using my dremel of any other product on the market.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done quickly and effectively. As far as coarseness...they don&#x27;t seem to be a whole lot coarser than the blue ones, however, they seem to last longer than those blue ones. Will buy these again for sure.</li>
            <li> Emjoi is a great way to maintain a pedicure for MONTHS.  the cost of the rollers is minimal and they last at least 8 + pedicures.  I also bought different coarse rollers for heals vs. polishing my legs.  My legs and feet look better then actually going for a pedicure.  I HIGHLY recommend Emjoi products.</li>
            <li> I ordered the green rollers and a blue one came with my Emjoi, I can tell a huge difference in the two.  The green one is much better and I&#x27;ll only be using them in the future!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like these rollers. I started off using the regular ones but switched to the xtreme coarse ones. My feet really aren&#x27;t that rough so I have to be careful using these. I like that it gets the job done quicker though.</li>
            <li> I bought to go with the Emjoi Micor-Pedi Power callus remover.  The Callus remover was a Christmas item for my son and have no idea if it works or not.  He has not said one way or the other, so guess it works.</li>
            <li> Well, the rollers truly are wonderful but my cute little feet could use a coarser grade!  Guess I&#x27;m hard on my feet.</li>
            <li> These new coarse rollers are great but don&#x27;t hesitate, unless you have diabetes, because they are not THAT coarse.</li>
            <li> I love emjoi.  But replacement rollers are so expensive.</li>
            <li> Like these better than the blue ones for my rough Southern California flip flop feet.&lt;br /&gt;I follow the treatment with Philosphy Hands of Hope..</li>
            <li> Good addition to my Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> These rollers are awesome!  They really remove a callous in short order.  I have had problem with my heals splitting for years.  Once I added the Emjoi to my weekly routine, along with Heal-tastic for moisture locking, did I see a total eradication of heal splits.  They would get so bad I&#x27;d have to have the Podiatrist super-glue the splits.  LOVE this machine!</li>
            <li> I purchase these along with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Power Callus Remover.  These will work great for my husband&#x27;s feet.  They&#x27;re very easy to insert and remove from the unit.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> the new abrasion-type of rollers are excellent for rough heels and even better than the previously available coarseness of roller. Recommended.</li>
            <li> These very coarse rollers are wonderful for stubborn dry skin.  But they do not remove the callouses at the ball of my foot.</li>
            <li> The whole family loves these sanders.  Live in the desert and wear sandals twelve months out of the year.  Much needed tool.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that this roller would be effective enough for the certain rought spots on my feet,but after experimenting with how to use the Emjoi micro pedi the right way(not applying pressure and letting the roller sort of file the rough spot delicately) I found it to be some what effective, considering the test my feet was putting it to. I believe after continued use I will get even better results.</li>
            <li> I was able to get them cheaper from the source - micropedi(dot)com. Join the club - it&#x27;s a free subscription program and you get a pack of 2 for $10. Plus there&#x27;s no true commitment - you can cancel right away. I just joined to take advantage of the free shipping and discount.</li>
            <li> These coarse rollers are just what they say they are coarse.  And that is exactly what I needed.  The problem is the device.  I got the battery powered one and it is basically a waste of time and money.  I will buy the electric larger powered unit and hope it will not be bogged down like the battery one is.</li>
            <li> Outstanding primary roller to be followed by the blue one to smooth.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful to have and work great ( best thing I&#x27;ve ever had ).  The only negative response is the replacement cost. Wish they would last longer because they are expensive. That being said, can&#x27;t live without them unless I go to a spa for pedicures.</li>
            <li> great price!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have brutally rough and calloused heels and tried this for the first time last night--and the results are remarkable!  Not sure that less extreme rollers would have helped as much.  Pain free treatment and super effective!  First rate-</li>
            <li> Did nothing as described...</li>
            <li> It does the trick!  I use this between pedicures and I like this one much more than the blue roller.</li>
            <li> this is a great heavy-duty roller.  i have psoriasis on my feet and this takes care of all the yuck.</li>
            <li> It is not too rough and gets the job done! I use it on my feet only. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> This course roller really gets off the dead skin and makes your feet soft.  Doesn&#x27;t take long.  Need to use over a trash can though because you can literally see a pile of dead skin fall off.</li>
            <li> Easy to install,  Works great on tough areas.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! In between pedicures it keeps my feet soft and looking like I just walked out of the salon! An amazing product for a good price!</li>
            <li> I have very rough skin on my heals.  The rollers that came with my Emjoi were okay but these work a lot better and faster.</li>
            <li> I wish I had saved my money! My feet are pretty rough and I thought I would use this product between pedicures. A waste of my money!</li>
            <li> If you own the Emjoi, or are thinking about it, forget the blue roller it comes with!  These are what you want for calluses.&lt;br /&gt;My feet are baby soft!  Bye-Bye P-Egg!  I&#x27;ve found a new &amp; MUCH better alternative!</li>
            <li> no issues with this item</li>
            <li> The xtreme rollers are the best.  Have tried different ones and these work great.  Takes much less time and makes your feet so smooth.</li>
            <li> These do exactly what they say.... I will not be able to use them on a regular basis bkz they are very rough, but if you have let your calluses go for a while, this is the roller to do the trick.. took way less time than using the regular roller (which I will use on a weekly basis during the summer).... Loved them, perfect for people who procrastinate during the winter :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are any different that the roller that came with the Micro Pedi.  They didn&#x27;t work any better so will save the money and buy the blue ones next time</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Micro-Pedi Xtreme Coarse Rollers are great for smoothing out rough skin.  I hope the company comes out with a wash and reuse roller.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> No problems with my order and fast delivery !</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed.  Not the roughest nor toughest.  I felt the product was the same as the blue roller.</li>
            <li> These are needed for refilling the: Emjoi Micro-Pedi Battery Operated Callus Remover</li>
            <li> These are sooo much better than the original rollers.  They really take off all the rough stuff from your feet.  I will purchase again.  Best used after shower and drying feet well.</li>
            <li> Just so everyone knows, these are the roughest refills Emjoi makes, check their web site to be sure but that is what I found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These coarse roller, however, are not so rough as to be hard on your skin.  I used them the first time I bought my Pedi and I was quite pleased.  The only piece of advice I will give you is to just press hard enough to slightly slow down the cylinder, too much pressure and it will stop.to prevent risking skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did accidentally used this on the sensitive skin around my ankles and aside from a sensation of being scraped there were no ill effects so I think any of these roller are fine for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note I am a male and as such my callouses are rather hard.  Women may prefer a less coarse roller.</li>
            <li> I am a runner and need to really take care of my feet.  This does the job easily. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Much better then the standard blue extra coarse rollers. If you think those are good and that the Emjoi is great, this makes the combination insane!!!. I&#x27;m a guy who has nice feet and wants to keep them that way. My girlfriend hasn&#x27;t used this yet and I may just get her , her own Emjoi because I&#x27;m getting very attached to this thing!.</li>
            <li> The blue rollers that come with the Micro Pedi are pretty good, but with these rollers and a brand new battery you can burn right through the extremely thick dry skin that some people can develop.</li>
            <li> All pros (no cons) for these Xtreme Coarse Rollers.  Does what it claims beautifully...baby feet now. My husband even noticed and thought I had sexy feet.  I am 50 yrs old with sexy, baby feet!!!!</li>
            <li> These work!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have very ugly coarse heels and now I don&#x27;t. Use once a week or when they start looking rough.</li>
            <li> High price $20 for two. I was not at all impressed with the coarseness. This coarse one was more like the blue one. In fact, i think the blue ones work better. I will not be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I needed this and am so glad I got it ... regular rollers just didn&#x27;t do the job.  No pain, so easy.</li>
            <li> A friend from Germany introduced me to this product and I am so happy I bought it.  It really works... it is totally painless and leaves my heels soft.  It allows the cream to penetrate the heel much better.  I used to have cracked skin on my heels that was painful to walk on and it bled sometimes.  I&#x27;ve been using it once every 3 days and now have no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!!!! totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I hoped they would be a big improvement over the blue regular rollers that came with my Emjoi.  Frankly, I found very little difference between results with these and the regular ones.  That said, they work well with the Emjoi and I don&#x27;t have any complaints.  These are just not a significant improvement over the regular rollers.</li>
            <li> works great love them will buy again</li>
            <li> I thought the coarse rollers would be better than the Blue ones. Not so..Slightly disappointed, but I love the product itself!!</li>
            <li> Better than a pumice stone</li>
            <li> absolutely great for tough callouses ad rough skin patches. Doesn&#x27;t hurt either when you use it. Helped remove the cracks in my heels.</li>
            <li> It was great. It did a better job than I expected. I highly reacommend this product. I do wish that it lasted longer, though.</li>
            <li> These work really well but they get dull really fast. One roller is only good for one time. However, I have very calloused, dry cracked heels and that may be why.</li>
            <li> Love this!  This takes all the dead skin off and leaves it feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it has been safely removing two calluses that caused me a lot of discomfort. It just takes me a couple of minutes after my shower and is making a big difference.</li>
            <li> these are perfect, my husband uses them like clock work, it&#x27;s a daily routine while watching his shows.</li>
            <li> Xtreme Coarse sanding replacement rollers for Emjoi Sanding/Buffers. The&lt;br /&gt;cartridges are well made and fit easily in all the Emjoi sanding/buffers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They clean easily with a dust brush...........or can be rinsed in water.</li>
            <li> It just doesnt go close to what they advertise. Like I said before, pummice stone does the job better, and these actually are very close in performance to the blue ones.</li>
            <li> I really like this. It works great.  It takes all of the dead skin away.  Shipping came on time like they said.  Thanks</li>
            <li> These work better than the blue ones and are not too agressive for frequent use. I have one very stubborn callus and these are helping to smooth it out; the blue ones did not. I will buy these whenever I need replacements.</li>
            <li> This product works great, it is better than the ones that come with the unit. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the regular blue rollers. Will continue to use just the blue ones. Green leaves more of a rougher finish than the blue which leaves my feet smoother.</li>
            <li> A little bit dissapointed; I expected to see better results</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. I love my Micro-Pedi but I really needed the extra coarse rollers to get the smooth results I want quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Love love love them!  The extra coarse rollers work great.  Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reason why these are built so small. Unless you&#x27;re buffing a child&#x27;s foot maybe. They are doing their job but do not last very long at all, therefore way overpriced. I go the Dremel route next.</li>
            <li> Does the job and does it well. My feet for the first time a smooth to the touch. Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s not as coarse as I thought it would be - wish it were more coarse. Does its job, I guess.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works very well. Best product around for home pedicures.</li>
            <li> Last for about two times then worthless.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased these extra coarse rollers along with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  I like to go barefoot and so I get pretty ugly calluses on my heels.  I used the coarse roller first and followed up with the original roller.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with how soft and smooth my feet feel.</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t seen these before finding them on Amazon.  Gave them a try and I think they are really good.  Especially if I have neglected using my Emjoi for a while. Price is very good!</li>
            <li> If you have cracked or thick calluses these green rollers will do the trick. The emjoi micro pedi is worth every penny. I have the battery operated one, which is SO handy on vacation. I&#x27;m going to buy the plug in one for more power and to save on batteries. This thing is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> They need to make a coarse roller.  It still takes forever to sand down dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works great with Emoji and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> They do work as advertised</li>
            <li> Just got them.  Failed to noitice there were only 2 in the package where the lesser coarse ones had 4.  Makes them kinda pricey.  The others worked fine so I have no reason to think these won&#x27;t be fine also.</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi but didn&#x27;t feel that these were really that coarse compared to their other rollers.  The blue rollers do just as well.  I have some really calloused areas on my heels and thought that these may completely eliminate the problem.  Oh well, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi is still the best device I have found for keeping my feet from getting just horribly nasty.</li>
            <li> Great replacements and convenient order from Amazon with great price.</li>
            <li> If you have tough callouses do not waste your money on the other rollers.  This roller is perfect and will do the job.</li>
            <li> Great addition to the roller collection for the Emjoi.  Nice to have for daily touch-ups, especially during our dry northern winters and in sandal weather!</li>
            <li> Great service and quality part</li>
            <li> I expected them to be coarser then they were..This is suppose to be the roughest and toughest? Not at all.</li>
            <li> misread how many were in pack.  they work very well</li>
            <li> The best callous remover yet.  You will love this if your feet are heavily calloused, but it might be too tough on sensitive feet.</li>
            <li> I love the machine. I really needed to order a new pair of micro pedi. Thank-you</li>
            <li> Love them and they work.</li>
            <li> these cost more, but work the best, get several uses from 1 roller.  most rollers are not coarse enough for my tough feet.  Also do the job faster</li>
            <li> my feet are now smooth as a babys a--</li>
            <li> Works great; better than paying for pedicures to get soft feet.</li>
            <li> If you have a good deal of hard skin on your heels and feet then this is the roller you want to use. It works fantastically at removing that hardened, tough skin.</li>
            <li> This is the roughest rollers they offer and I love it. I won&#x27;t use any other as I have bad&lt;br /&gt;calluses and this gets them off great and easily. A little pricey but it&#x27;s the only&lt;br /&gt;thing that works for me after trying EVERYthing and all those pedicure sloughing emery&lt;br /&gt;type boards and the Egg, too.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks~</li>
            <li> Wonderful refills. Couldn&#x27;t live without them!!!</li>
            <li> Winter in Ohio - these are a savior!!  I will always have these on hand.</li>
            <li> They were ok. I have really hard, tough, dry feet. Maybe after I get mine under control I won&#x27;t go through these as quickly. Wish there was an even coarser one.</li>
            <li> Worked very well, as expected.</li>
            <li> fit the micro-pedi pro buffer</li>
    </ol>
