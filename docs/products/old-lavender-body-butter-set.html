            <li>This is by far the best body lotion I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>By far the coconut is the best smelling.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin silky soft and smelling WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li>I received  a sample from Birchbox  and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent for an evening shower/bath and going to bed.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, one of my favorite lavenders.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it lasts on the body, making my skin feel silky and plump.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I would equate it to more of a day-to-day lotion.  </li>
            <li>So glad to be able to find this on amazon after costco stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>Really fabulous product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This cream has some great stuff in it for dry ski and works and smells so good.</li>
            <li>but fortunately a friend introduced me to Whish.</li>
            <li>Loved it and went back for more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh smelling and not heavy, which is great, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a true lavender smell.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this gift set at Costco for Christmas presents and myself.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and keeps my skin feeling soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing and moisturizing with a light lavender scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beyond awesome but not totally available near to me</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this in my birchbox and was excited to find it at a reasonable price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but more like a regular lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant - not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty easy to turn into something white and scaly</li>
            <li>the shea butter formula really does work to soften your skin.  </li>
            <li>I am holidaying in a very arid part of the country and the water here is as drying as the air</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about both the seller and the product and the value for the dollars spent.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned this is not a thick body butter</li>
            <li>Overall worth it, IMO.</li>
            <li>I love Whish products, as they have less garbage in them than other mass-produced skin products.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it make my skin extremely soft, it keeps the bugs away!</li>
            <li>Just a couple small things, that are more personal to me: I expected the lotion to be thicker, as it is called &amp;#34;body butter&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> Use it daily and you&#x27;ll have softer skin and no more bumps!</li>
            <li> I water it down a touch to make it a little thinner, like lotion.  </li>

            <li> This is by far the best body lotion I&#x27;ve used.  Great scent, but more than that the shea butter formula really does work to soften your skin.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> The best smelling and feeling lotion ever!</li>
            <li> I received  a sample from Birchbox  and fell in love.  This did not have the same  emollient  quality  as the sample...so it was returned</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent for an evening shower/bath and going to bed. Very soothing and moisturizing with a light lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, one of my favorite lavenders. I would describe it as &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; lavender. I got a sample of this in my birchbox and was excited to find it at a reasonable price here on Amazon. I took off one star because the scent does not seem to last as long as my sample did. I remember that one lingering for several hours if not all day. As others have mentioned this is not a thick body butter but more like a regular lotion. Overall worth it, IMO.</li>
            <li> Gosh - I love this stuff!! It&#x27;s great. I am holidaying in a very arid part of the country and the water here is as drying as the air so it&#x27;s pretty easy to turn into something white and scaly but fortunately a friend introduced me to Whish. It&#x27;s beyond awesome but not totally available near to me so I ordered it off Amazon. It came on the estimated delivery date and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about both the seller and the product and the value for the dollars spent. It is a fantastic product and I am one happy camper!!!</li>
            <li> Love the feel and the smell is heavenly!!  My husband likes it too😉</li>
            <li> Wonderful lotion!  Smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it lasts on the body, making my skin feel silky and plump.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. The best.</li>
            <li> Lavender &amp; a powdery baby scent all rolled up into one.  LOVE it.  I water it down a touch to make it a little thinner, like lotion.  Sooooo good!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Not only does it make my skin extremely soft, it keeps the bugs away!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this gift set at Costco for Christmas presents and myself.  Loved it and went back for more.  Sold out.  Ordered from Amazon.  This is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Smells amazing and keeps my skin feeling soft and moist.  Living in Colorado it can get very dry.  Use it every day!  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love Whish products, as they have less garbage in them than other mass-produced skin products.  I like this set - especially the travel size, since I travel a lot. The scent is pleasant - not overwhelming.  Just a couple small things, that are more personal to me: I expected the lotion to be thicker, as it is called &amp;#34;body butter&amp;#34;.  I would equate it to more of a day-to-day lotion.  It&#x27;s certainly not watery, but it&#x27;s not like other body &amp;#34;butters&amp;#34;.  Second, the scent smells like a mix of baby powder and lavender.  It&#x27;s fresh smelling and not heavy, which is great, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a true lavender smell.</li>
            <li> I had orginally bought this at Costco during the Christmas season and I haven&#x27;t used anything since! Forget the bath and body works lotions! Makes your skin feel and smell wonderful without an over powering scent. So glad to be able to find this on amazon after costco stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff! Every since I started using it it has helped alleviate itching due to dry skin on areas of my body.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but lotion exploded all over package upon arrival which was kind of a pain.</li>
            <li> Love this product! And this was an amazing price as well!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great shipping!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Not only smells absolutely wonderful, but makes your skin feel nice and silky!  It&#x27;s a definite buy again for me.</li>
            <li> Luxurious! Great moisturizer, one of the best on the market. Not greasy feeling and a little goes a long way.Use it daily and you&#x27;ll have softer skin and no more bumps! I&#x27;ve tried the lavender, coconut, and the pomegranate. By far the coconut is the best smelling. Really fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin silky soft and smelling WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion. I have bought it at Costco for months and can no longer find it at my local Costco store. I will definitely be ordering the lotion through Amazon in the future. The travel size is perfect to keep in my car.</li>
            <li> This cream has some great stuff in it for dry ski and works and smells so good.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like heaven. I love the pump!</li>
