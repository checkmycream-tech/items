            <li> Too soon for review the product</li>
            <li> Made my scalp beyond red/irritated, burns &amp; I actually think I lost more hair, something I was NOT looking forward to. Used it for 2 months religiously &amp; hate it.</li>
            <li> This products does the job. My hair was breaking and now the areas that was damage are growing in. I will definitely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item thinking, it would be a amazing help to my hair edges.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the process is a very slow development. Yet, it didn&#x27;t state it was a miracle grow.</li>
            <li> I have used Alter Ego for a couple of years. I was losing a lot of hair due to eccessive perms. I believe Alter Ego has helped get my hair back in shape. I can&#x27;t say my hair is thicker, but my hair has grown back around my temple area. Please keep in my I don&#x27;t think it was just this product that strengthen my hair. I had to get smart about my hair and stop useing perming products.</li>
            <li> My sister recommemned - her stylist recommended and I showed it to my stylist and she said yes - for helping hair growth!</li>
            <li> I love the product it is outstanding everybodyshould be using it</li>
            <li> I have used this Alter Ego Energizing Treatment Lotion product a couple times for my thining hair, and have been very pleased with the result.

However, I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Gods gift to thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I am a African American woman in her early 40&#x27;s with alopecia.  My sister uses this product and gave me a bottle. She insists this is the reason her hair is long (mid back).  I have tried it three times, and can tell you that my hair grew.  I am not sure it stopped it from falling out.  It did not stop it from itching.  But it did make it grow.  I plan to try and combine this with a product recommended by my Dominican Beauty salon (UNA Oxygenating Treatment - stop hair loss).  that product did stop the hair loss immediatly, and stop the itch.  I will do a test or two to see if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can confirm this product helps with hair growth, I have noticed this with the few tries.</li>
            <li> My edges are coming in nicely and my new growth is immensely thicker. If you do have relaxed hair it does take away the perm for those who know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Made my hair grow I love this item helps after u take out your weave</li>
            <li> It helps make your hair healthier using the irritation method. By irritating the scalp you draw more blood to it which is translated to more nutrients to your hair follicles.&lt;br /&gt;It burns so be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product but! You can save your money and use anything like chillie pepper, garlic, onion juice, eucalyptus, menthol, etc.mixed with cold pressed castor oil or whatever oil you like or veniger and some herbs like nettle, sage, etc. and It works the same.&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again: Maybe.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because it&#x27;s suppose to be a good product for thinning hair and hair loss. Well I&#x27;m 49 and have been a relaxing my hair for years on and off.  My hair has been shedding alot and I thought I give it a try. I &#x27;m still shedding alot and not sure how well it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> did not work, use to work, that&amp;#34;s why I purchase,&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend...&lt;br /&gt;need to look into that brand.</li>
            <li> Thsi product is great.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I have hair growth on a few areas of my scalp where there was none before. I am now on my third bottle. Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product at my local Dominican hair salon. I decided instead of paying them $5 to put several drops on my scalp I would buy my own. I have used this several times at home btwn washes and after I&#x27;ve washed my own hair... And I have noticed my hair is becoming stronger, not breaking or shedding as easily as it was before. Since I have started getting alil older my hair chemistry has changed completely and I feel this product has brought some stability to my hair. I rather enjoy the stimulating &amp; cooling effect it has on my scalp and the smell is calming to me. I would recommend this to any woman who&#x27;s hair is thinning, breaking or shedding.</li>
            <li> Love the energizing feel.</li>
            <li> good product and works as advertised</li>
