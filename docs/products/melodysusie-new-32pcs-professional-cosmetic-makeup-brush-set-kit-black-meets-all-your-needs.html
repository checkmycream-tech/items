            <li>Its like a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; kind of deal.</li>
            <li>I love the case.</li>

            <li>Mores than satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>but the price is not bad!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;There is a light smell to them but not that strong like some people say.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>but 32 brushes for this cheap...</li>
            <li>It is very nice, the only reason not 5 stars because they weren&#x27;t the softest</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>The easiest brushes I&#x27;ve had to clean.</li>
            <li>I just feel like they had that nice smooth professional touch in my eyes on how they appear.</li>
            <li>I will say I was super excited when i ordered this set of makeup brushes, I&#x27;m into makeup alot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie at make-up, but I have really taken the time to educate myself by watching tutorials and reading make-up books by some of the top make-up artist in the industry.</li>
            <li>Good for starting out with make up.</li>
            <li>The bag is very sturdy and holds way more than 32 brushes because you can stick two brushes in one hole sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even at those prices, the more recently purchased brushes are sooooooooooooo much better then any of the brushes in this set.</li>
            <li>there was like a few fly aways here and</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Fun, Fun,</li>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>including the different kind of kabuki brushes there are)</li>
            <li>The product arrived much sooner than expected, and is a very nice every-day brush kit.</li>
            <li>The way the brushes are set up is pretty acurate on how make up is applied.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the rest will most likely end up in my garbage.</li>
            <li>For the price I got them they are overall satisfying</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think there are that many different brushes(not</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes look more normal..</li>
            <li>first of all I loved how the shipping was super fast, however one of the brushes was broken when I opened the package :</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different brushes and these are great for starters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was gift for my niece because she wants to learn how to put on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;she</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them.  </li>
            <li>The big brushes look so cheap...</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li>I really struggle which one I should buy</li>
            <li>When i got my brushes delivered I thought they were beautiful since im into the black on black</li>
            <li>im just simply into black on black :D</li>
            <li>process was super easy, they arrived a lot earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>I love to mess with make up</li>
            <li>this will be an additional fun with the love I have to mess with make up!!!</li>
            <li>I love the fluffy ones though.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I dont use any of the fluffy ones because they tend to shed the most...</li>
            <li>The rest I threw away after I washed and dried them because they weren&#x27;t any better afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just starting to learn how to do makeup the right way</li>
            <li>They quickly respond, are very polite and extremely accomodating.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these to my friends with a little advice to air out the bag, wash the brushes before using them, and consider buying better brushes when they&#x27;re ready.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s really very soft and nearly met any makeup needs!</li>
            <li>You can put some to the side when you&#x27;re done with them and still have enough for the next day if you didn&#x27;t wash them yesterday(I spot clean all my brushes after I use them).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend these brushes, i like them so far.</li>
            <li>Soft when touch with finger</li>
            <li>not as soft was</li>
            <li>You can find many brushes in Amazon with different price, this one is just in the middle, not very high, not very low.</li>
            <li>The larger brushes do shed and are a tiny bit rough but they eye brushes are fantastic they are soft and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase from brands like e.l.f., Sigma, Real Techniques, and occasionally the other high end brands when I can afford.</li>
            <li>Since im not too crazy about the bright colors on brushes</li>
            <li>They are very soft and the handles are very long.</li>

            <li> They are very soft and the handles are very long.</li>
            <li> The little fan brush on the far left is the only brown brush I kept.</li>
            <li> The hair look so rough and cheap like worse than something you can get at 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> Finally when I decided to try them out they are OK especially if your a beginner, and since im not i will say i was disappointed only because they shed like crazy and to be honest</li>
            <li> The brush hairs are very thin and fall out easily.</li>
            <li> the eye-shadow brushes are extremely hard since they are very plasticish, and kinda feels like you have to stab your eye in order to blend your eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that the other one had different hairs.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of black brushes that can be used for different things.</li>
            <li> The hair on some of the brushes are a little different, but there are a couple duplicates</li>
            <li> purchased these not what I expected</li>
            <li> do not shed either, I washed them and I was really rough with them</li>
            <li> dont like the synthetic ones they feel too rough on my skin...</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this set I have still bought about 6 brushes from other make-up brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bag does smell a little when it comes out of the bag</li>
            <li> When I got the brushes half of them were broken or missing, such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> For others I would suggest taking the money you would spend on this set and investing in a few brushes from these retailers to start off your brush collection.</li>
            <li> This product is ok not amazing but not totaly horrible.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard and it hurts..</li>
            <li> I am a makeup fanatic but I&#x27;m also a beginner.</li>
            <li> There a lot of similar brushes but that&#x27;s not that bad because it has 32 brushes</li>
            <li> Is all plastic not good for a makeup artist</li>
            <li> (...) The face brushes that are brown are the worst, they aren&#x27;t soft and shed like crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NO bad review from her</li>
            <li> It arrived in 3 days and it didnâ€™t disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the case. The way the brushes are set up is pretty acurate on how make up is applied. Delivery beyond my expectation. The easiest brushes I&#x27;ve had to clean.</li>
            <li> purchased these not what I expected but the price is not bad! Definitely good for a starter kit. alot of the brushes look repeated.</li>
            <li> I do not suggest this product for anyone! I&#x27;m a newbie at make-up, but I have really taken the time to educate myself by watching tutorials and reading make-up books by some of the top make-up artist in the industry. This brush set is almost like a child&#x27;s pretend/dress-up toy. Since purchasing this set I have still bought about 6 brushes from other make-up brands. Some I have paid a whopping $1.50 each for and some I have paid around $9. Even at those prices, the more recently purchased brushes are sooooooooooooo much better then any of the brushes in this set. The only brushes that I will continue to use out of this set are the liner brushes and the big powder brushes, and that is the only reason I am giving this product two stars. Otherwise the rest will most likely end up in my garbage. The brushes seem to repeat themselves, but just in different sizes. I will never buy again and now that I know better I will continue to purchase from brands like e.l.f., Sigma, Real Techniques, and occasionally the other high end brands when I can afford. For others I would suggest taking the money you would spend on this set and investing in a few brushes from these retailers to start off your brush collection.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product as  a nice holiday gift for women. It is very nice, the only reason not 5 stars because they weren&#x27;t the softest</li>
            <li> The customer service from this company is outstanding.  They quickly respond, are very polite and extremely accomodating.  The product arrived much sooner than expected, and is a very nice every-day brush kit. I would definitely do business with them again.</li>
            <li> This was gift for my niece because she wants to learn how to put on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;she absolutely loved it and could wait to try them out.&lt;br /&gt;NO bad review from her lol</li>
            <li> I love my brushes.  I&#x27;m just starting to learn how to do makeup the right way so i needed good brushes to practice with.  I&#x27;d recommend these brushes, i like them so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter at Christmas.  She absolutely loves them.  I am pleased that she is so happy.</li>
            <li> The brush hairs are very thin and fall out easily. The metal brush and the wooden handle do not stay together well.</li>
            <li> I will say I was super excited when i ordered this set of makeup brushes, I&#x27;m into makeup alot so I obviously like to experiment every now and then. When i got my brushes delivered I thought they were beautiful since im into the black on black I just feel like they had that nice smooth professional touch in my eyes on how they appear. Since im not too crazy about the bright colors on brushes im just simply into black on black :D .......Finally when I decided to try them out they are OK especially if your a beginner, and since im not i will say i was disappointed only because they shed like crazy and to be honest the eye-shadow brushes are extremely hard since they are very plasticish, and kinda feels like you have to stab your eye in order to blend your eyeshadow. I will say that the eyeliner brushes are amazing for them cat eye lovers &amp;#60;3 ......This product is ok not amazing but not totaly horrible. Its like a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; kind of deal.</li>
            <li> You should know that the blush and foundation brush shed. Otherwise, rest of the set is awesome! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> The big brushes look so cheap... The hair look so rough and cheap like worse than something you can get at 99 cent store. The smaller brushes look more normal.. Soft when touch with finger but I tried it on my eyelid.. it&#x27;s hard and it hurts.. not as soft was people claim it.. maybe my set is different since there are different sellers are offering it. Definitely returning...The ones I purchased at Target are 10 times softer and with finer hair.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars because of the price.  The hair on some of the brushes are a little different, but there are a couple duplicates and I noticed that the other one had different hairs. Maybe done on purpose i don&#x27;t really know. but 32 brushes for this cheap...it&#x27;s well worth it. process was super easy, they arrived a lot earlier than expected. and in perfect shape. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Mores than satisfied with this purchase. The larger brushes do shed and are a tiny bit rough but they eye brushes are fantastic they are soft and they don&#x27;t shed. For the price I got them they are overall satisfying</li>
            <li> They work well, one of the brushes came apart, I put it back together. Good for starting out with make up.</li>
            <li> first of all I loved how the shipping was super fast, however one of the brushes was broken when I opened the package :(&lt;br /&gt;There is a light smell to them but not that strong like some people say.&lt;br /&gt;They do not shed either, I washed them and I was really rough with them there was like a few fly aways here and there but that&#x27;s about it.&lt;br /&gt;I dont like the synthetic ones they feel too rough on my skin... I love the fluffy ones though.&lt;br /&gt;Will I purchase again? Probably not..</li>
            <li> You can find many brushes in Amazon with different price, this one is just in the middle, not very high, not very low. I really struggle which one I should buyâ€¦â€¦ I decide to try this one. It arrived in 3 days and it didnâ€™t disappointed. Itâ€™s really very soft and nearly met any makeup needs! For the price, I will rate 5 for the product! Maybe next time I will try the cheapest one in Amazon see the difference!</li>
            <li> Fun, Fun, Fun I love to mess with make up this will be an additional fun with the love I have to mess with make up!!!</li>
            <li> Is all plastic not good for a makeup artist</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re alright, the shed and feel coarse on your skin. I dont use any of the fluffy ones because they tend to shed the most... I wouldnt recommend to a friend though...</li>
            <li> I am a makeup fanatic but I&#x27;m also a beginner. I&#x27;ve tried a few different brushes and these are great for starters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;The bag does smell a little when it comes out of the bag but I think that&#x27;s a personal opinion because my boyfriend said it smelled like candies and wouldn&#x27;t give it back.(...) The face brushes that are brown are the worst, they aren&#x27;t soft and shed like crazy. The little fan brush on the far left is the only brown brush I kept. The rest I threw away after I washed and dried them because they weren&#x27;t any better afterwards. There a lot of similar brushes but that&#x27;s not that bad because it has 32 brushes and I don&#x27;t think there are that many different brushes(not including the different kind of kabuki brushes there are). My spoolie brush came apart immediately but I glued it back on and it&#x27;s fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of black brushes that can be used for different things. Very nice eye shadow brushes that pick up and distribute a lot of colors, which is a majority of the brushes. You can put some to the side when you&#x27;re done with them and still have enough for the next day if you didn&#x27;t wash them yesterday(I spot clean all my brushes after I use them). They are very soft and the handles are very long. The bag is very sturdy and holds way more than 32 brushes because you can stick two brushes in one hole sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I would definitely recommend these to my friends with a little advice to air out the bag, wash the brushes before using them, and consider buying better brushes when they&#x27;re ready.</li>
            <li> i like this, but i think come something repeated. however it is a good product at a good price, recommended</li>
            <li> When I got the brushes half of them were broken or missing, such a waste of money. I wouldnt recomend this product to anyone</li>
