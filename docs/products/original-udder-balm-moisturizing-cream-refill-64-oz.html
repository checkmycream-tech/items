            <li>While some lotions will last an extra day or so, this rinses off easily with water, leaving skin feeling dry again.  </li>
            <li>Accept no other.  </li>
            <li>OK, but not great product.</li>

            <li> Have used this product for years. My dermatologist also thinks it is great.</li>
            <li> Best solution for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it &amp; so do I. Makes your skin sooo soft!!</li>
            <li> I bought it when it was sold in feed stores for cow tits. It sure was a lot cheaper then. I have never found anything that works this well. I would give it 10 stars if I could. It is somewhat thinner since this company bought it out, but the formula is the same. Sure hope they do not change that.</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome product.  Accept no other.  I have used this for years, when it was only available in vet catalogues.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer and makes skin always soft, even feet.</li>
            <li> I have used this for product for years. I work in a progession with my hand in water many times each day.  Udder balm works on dry split hands without being greasy, I apply it at night.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin lotion you will every use.  It is a must during the winter months after a shower for a all over skin moisturizer.  One application will last till the next day for wonderful moisturized skin.  No more dry patches on shins or elbow, arms or feet.  Smell very fresh and not greasy.  This size is a very good value.</li>
            <li> Awesome-Awesome-Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;As a guy, I can honestly say this is the best stuff out. I bought a small can of this at a local hardware store and was amazed at the results of this cream. Best of all; it smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling greasy. Impeccable results!</li>
            <li> very good product,it is smooth and really spreads easily and absorbs very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;l would recommend it to anyone and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;lt is very beneficial to my skin, will probably reorder in the future&lt;br /&gt;thank you for the service</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now after using many of the top products on the market for dry skin lesions caused by psoriasis. It is the only thing that worked.</li>

            <li> I have used tis lotion for more than 10 years. A co-worker of mine is a rock climber and he originally told me about this lotion. He said it kept his hands healthy and supple. I use this lotion after bathing and on my hands routinely, especially in the winter! Gotta try it - you&#x27;ll love it! Delivery was prompt and the product was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Been using it for years from head to toe.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my very rough hands feel and look BUT it would be such a better product without the too bright, added yellow color AND the added lemon fragrance.  The cream is great on its own and does not need the bright yellow color nor the potent lemon odor.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to see it changed, or at least offer two products, one without unnecessary added (chemicals?) ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I probably will not buy it again, unless I notice that it is changed.</li>

            <li> Moisturizing but waxy.  While some lotions will last an extra day or so, this rinses off easily with water, leaving skin feeling dry again.  I llike a lotion that makes my skin feel softer even after it is rinsed off.  OK, but not great product.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  Works well on really dry skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this udder balm before and it again exceeds my expectations. Don&#x27;t ever confuse it with bag balm in the green square tin can, for personal use. The Original has lanolin for clean use on legs and feet.</li>
