            <li>It compliments my brown skin VERY WELL!!!</li>
            <li>Rich texture.</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great pink for summer pedis.</li>
            <li>my niece (4yrs old) has already called dibs on a bottle! :)</li>
            <li>Overall color look so nice when apply on.</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite color pink of all time.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I have extra fair skin color and tiny hands,  so some bold pinks can overwhelm my hand.  </li>
            <li>I have Shorts Story and Strawberry Margarita which were two of my favorites, but personally I think this one is much better.</li>
            <li>I love OPI polish, however, I am not sure that this is the authentic brand.</li>
            <li>Does need multiple coats applied but, doesn&#x27;t chip easy.</li>
            <li>It is very appropriate for a child if they are patient enough to allow for the extra time for 2 coat drying time.</li>
            <li>Love the color pink.  </li>
            <li>But also not too light where you must put on several coats just so it&#x27;ll show!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Lovely pink color for summer!</li>
            <li>Not too loud.</li>
            <li>Pretty summer pink color, a matte finish and 2 coats to cover.  </li>
            <li>Most of OPI does not goon as thin.  </li>
            <li>It was a little bit on the thicker side, but it&#x27;s still so pretty.</li>
            <li>I just bought two new colors the other day.</li>

            <li> beautiful color I love it. Nice color for the spring and summer. I just bought two new colors the other day.</li>
            <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;what an awesome juicy color&amp;#34; this polish is!  Almost doesn&#x27;t need a second coat but for me, it seems to make it last longer and not chip.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color for summer, it goes a bit thinner , definite need 3 coats. Overall color look so nice when apply on. You won&#x27;t regret for this truth pink color.</li>
            <li> Great color and lasts a decent amount of time before it starts &amp;#34;fading&amp;#34; on the edge of my nails.</li>

            <li> Super fast shipping. Item just as described!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this polish. I had been wanting it for quite some time and I am very pleased with it. The color is a perfect pink for summer. Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Lovely color goes great with a tan and lasts.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, but the bottle dries out very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is not a coral peach color. Its pink. Its also watery i dont think its authentic.</li>
            <li> A lovely color for summer.  Was in love with it the minute I saw it.  I have extra fair skin color and tiny hands,  so some bold pinks can overwhelm my hand.  Beauty Shine did an extra great job getting it to me on schedule and in perfect shape. I would have no problem ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> I love Kiss Me I&#x27;m Brazilian!!!!! I like it in any season, now! It makes every outfit with open toe shoes pop! I get compliments EVERY TIME! It compliments my brown skin VERY WELL!!!</li>
            <li> I found this color when I had my last pedicure and knew I had to purchase it before Opi discontinued it.  I love the color.  Perfect for most skin tones.</li>
            <li> BEST color in the 2014 line.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color. Rich texture. Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful, fun, summery, and my niece (4yrs old) has already called dibs on a bottle! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with this purchase! Many thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite color pink of all time. It was a little bit on the thicker side, but it&#x27;s still so pretty.</li>
            <li> Love this color. It looks like a color barbie would wear. Does need multiple coats applied but, doesn&#x27;t chip easy.</li>
            <li> This polish streaks with just one coat but looks good if two coats are applied. It is very appropriate for a child if they are patient enough to allow for the extra time for 2 coat drying time.</li>
            <li> I love OPI polish, however, I am not sure that this is the authentic brand. The polish is thick and does not go on my nails evenly. Will not order from this vendor any longer.</li>
            <li> Best summer pink. Tons of compliments. And as always, OPI polish lasts.</li>
            <li> I love, love this color. Very beautiful pink color for summer. Not too loud. But also not too light where you must put on several coats just so it&#x27;ll show! Every time I have these on my toes &amp; wear sandals, I always get compliments!☺</li>
            <li> Pretty summer pink color, a matte finish and 2 coats to cover.  Wonderful price and quick delivery.  Thanks Amazon</li>
