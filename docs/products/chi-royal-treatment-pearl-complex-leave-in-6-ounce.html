            <li> Bought this for my wife.I overheard her talking about it and could not find a larger(ounce) size.Thanks to Amazon they had a larger size and I was able to purchase it for her.She was very surprised and did not know it could be purchase with more ounces.She loves it and I will be ordering more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> it is a little costly but my daughter, son, and myself have all different types and textures of hair. hers is curly at the bottom and tangles easy, my sons is super thick and unruley, and mine is just plain frizzy. Ever since i started with this product daughters is nearly tangle free, my sons hair has a smoother appearance and mine looks great. this actually is truthfull when is says WEIGHTLESS formula. you can&#x27;t tell anything is there. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The CHI Royal Treatment Pearl Complex is amazing. It leaves my hair managable and soft. Even when I put too much product in, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or sticky. I highly recommend the product and have done so to all of my friends. Also, when I received my first bottle, it was damaged in shipping and most of the product had leaked out of the container, at no fault by the shipper MyBeautyCenter. I called MyBeautyCenter as soon as I received the product and they immediately offered to ship out another bottle, free of charge and with no shipping fees. They didn&#x27;t even request that I send back the nearly empty bottle for verification. I will definitely be shopping them again and I truly appreciated the superb customer service!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. It will make your hair straighter and shinier. Smells good too. It&#x27;s actually the best of all hair products of this kind.</li>
            <li> Works great for taming the fly away hairs and gives hair a beautiful shine!!&lt;br /&gt;Just received but I love this product!</li>
            <li> Great product. My hairdresser uses this product which was how I first was introduced to it.  It makes your hair feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> This products seal was open upon delivery. I kept it but  I think it was open before being mailed!  I was not happy about a  personal product being tampered with.</li>
            <li> We love this product. It seems good for our hair. My daughter likes it for her long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my hair feel and how shiny my hair is.  It was recommended by my stylist.</li>
            <li> it is ok - i&#x27;m very pleased with the product. It&#x27;s non-greasy very light moisturizer formula for the hair. ok</li>
            <li> This product is  amazing &amp; well worth a try for those w kinky frizz who want Luscious Locks.&lt;br /&gt;I dont know why more salons dont sell it but you need to give it a try</li>
            <li> Bottle was not closed properly and product leaked out in shipment.  I called and requested a replacement and when the second bottle was shipped the same thing happened.</li>
            <li> This is a great leave in conditioner for my hair. I like that it feels very light, and makes my hair shine. It is very important to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Product as promised.  Excellent value.  Works well on hair treated with keratin or Brazilian blow out.  Keeps hair shiny, soft and reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> This leave in treatment is perfect for any hair type. If you have curly hair like I do you can just smooth a very small amount onto you hands and smooth through wet or dry hair to help control frizz and it smells fantastic! My sister has strait hair and it makes hers look shiny and healthy. Great buy!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this everytime she cuts and styles my hair. I liked it so I wanted it to use myself. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores but as always could find it on Amazon. I like the way it makes my hair look (shiny) and makes it easier to style. I think this a a good product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday.  Love the smell and love what it does to keep the frizz in control.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and have the worst time when windy or humid and Incorporating this product into my blow dry routine made my hair controllable!!  Very exciting!!!</li>
