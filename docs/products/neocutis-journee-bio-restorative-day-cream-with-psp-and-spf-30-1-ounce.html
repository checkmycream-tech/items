            <li>Love this cream...</li>
            <li>SPF 30 is perfect and I will be using this moisturizer for as long as its made.</li>
            <li>I tend to have skin on the shiny and oily side, but this moisturizer mattes my face perfectly as well as moisturize my sometimes dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great on sensitive skin!  </li>

            <li>I like the light feel of it on my face and</li>
            <li>This stuff ain&#x27;t cheap, so that&#x27; sorta why it bothers me.</li>
            <li>I hope they improve the packaging, but the cream itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Good product for mature skin also.</li>
            <li>It has a very light and like primer texture, your skin got a nice glow to receive make up or go just bare.</li>
            <li>Easy transaction with quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this product very much.</li>
            <li>The tint in the product acts as a foundation and is adequate for me in the summer.</li>
            <li>If I have received a &amp;#34;one-off&amp;#34; bottle of this brand new design then I will gladly write a retraction.</li>
            <li>It really erases the fine line around you face and neck area.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer absorbs quickly and easily, has very good SPF, and a slight tint to even skin tone; and does not look chalky and white.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but worth the $$.</li>
            <li>and it is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>While pricy, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It delivers on promises, pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always thought that it was worth it.</li>
            <li>There is no smell and it does far more than just protect your skin from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Originally made for scar repair, it really fixes your skin and keeps it fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it, but I don&#x27;t see any benefits other than it being a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Most important is that a dry clump is deposited each time you pump.</li>
            <li>Love this day cream just enough cover and sun screen  </li>
            <li>My first bottle is still not finished.</li>
            <li>To add, I have very sensitive skin and a mild form of rosacea.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon beats the Doctor&#x27;s office as it was only $85 versus $120 for the full size bottle!</li>
            <li>When my first bottle was almost empty, I looked on line for a better price.  </li>
            <li>burned my sensitive eyes as if my eyes absorbed whatever product I used.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper through Amazon than from my physicians office.</li>
            <li>It has really repaired wrinkling and sun damage to my face.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything I like as much.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it is not environmentally sound to double the amount of plastic that has no practical pusrpose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for over a year now, and really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I had been purchasing this through a physician, but found it on Amazon at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive and dry skin and break out very easily.</li>
            <li>Love it!..as well as the other neocutis products.</li>
            <li>My dermotologist recommended this product mainly for sunscreen benefits.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;would recommend highly for any age</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but my dermatologist charges even more.</li>
            <li>Love all Neocutis products, a little pricey though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li>do not like the new packaging.</li>
            <li>However, I have tried quite a few products that are more natural and</li>
            <li>Also, in spite of daily use, the first pump of every morning delivers an unusable clump of product.</li>
            <li>So, I wonder how much product I&#x27;d actually have if a small bit wasn&#x27;t wasted with each use (I&#x27;d imagine about 3 applications total), and it isn&#x27;t ideal for those who travel a lot (I put a piece of painters</li>
            <li>It has a tanish tint to it when it comes out, but goes on clear without color once you put it on.</li>
            <li>24 years old.</li>
            <li>Journee makes my skin smooth and moisturized all day, without feeling oily or heavy at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and gives me the sun protection that I need without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>I paid almost twice as much for my initial bottle, as I purchased it at the salon.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive acne prone skin to break out.  </li>
            <li>(actually it improve my face skin that was suffering so much because of that weather).</li>
            <li>Lighted tinted, sinks right in and protection of SPF30.</li>
            <li>First, one pump is not quite enough for the entire face, as it used to be.</li>
            <li>The new pump ALWAYS pumps out a small bit of dried old cream with each application, and the cap falls off very easily.</li>
            <li>The last order I received is in a new bottle.</li>
            <li>live in south Florida where humidity is almost a constant althrough</li>
            <li>I just recently purchased yet another bottle to find out that they have new packaging.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for at least the last couple of years and love it.</li>
            <li>In the old bottle, that never happened, even with the cover left off.</li>
            <li>It arrived with the top broken, can not see the amount remaining in container.</li>
            <li>If you are still skeptical about this review I invite you to take a moment of your time to investigate this on your own or just check out their website.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it four stars due to the expense and that I&#x27;m pretty leery of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend other skin and eyes by Neocutis, but not this one.</li>
            <li>If you want/need significant coverage, this is not a good product for you.</li>
            <li>It appears larger, but it is just the bottle that is bigger and every time I use it there is a dried out clump that first comes out of the pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 37 and live in South America with very humid weather, worst than Miami, and it works great as it worked in NYC all December in very dry and windy conditions</li>

            <li> I have used this product for at least the last couple of years and love it.</li>
            <li> In the old bottle, that never happened, even with the cover left off.</li>
            <li> It arrived with the top broken, can not see the amount remaining in container.</li>
            <li> If you are still skeptical about this review I invite you to take a moment of your time to investigate this on your own or just check out their website.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it four stars due to the expense and that I&#x27;m pretty leery of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend other skin and eyes by Neocutis, but not this one.</li>
            <li> If you want/need significant coverage, this is not a good product for you.</li>
            <li> It appears larger, but it is just the bottle that is bigger and every time I use it there is a dried out clump that first comes out of the pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and live in South America with very humid weather, worst than Miami, and it works great as it worked in NYC all December in very dry and windy conditions</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a long time</li>
            <li> One of the few sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t smell bad, isn&#x27;t greasy, and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> but strangely one bottle was practically empty.</li>
            <li> Therefore, each morning you require two pumps, which is a little more than necessary of this very expensive sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel very dry and distended my pores.</li>
            <li> I thought it was expense when I paid $120 for the 1 oz bottle at my doctors medi-spa but a little dab will do and last me over 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy about this product by Neocutis, had a weird smell and went on pastey.  </li>
            <li> I also do not like that the size is larger, it does not fit well in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> What fragrance it has, which is minimal and disappears after application, is scant as compared to sun-screen products that smell of suntan lotion and do not disappear after application.</li>
            <li> Meaning the cells are from human babies who have been essentially killed from their mother&#x27;s wombs with the consent of the mother and then processed to make beauty creams.</li>
            <li> Typically, I would prefer to think that this is a poorly executed product packaging re-design but fear that instead this is a veiled attempt to speed up, in fact, probably double the use for a price that already made this among one of the most expensive products on the market.</li>
            <li> So a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Keeps me from feeling dry and tight throughout the day</li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the new cheap packaging.</li>
            <li> and I like the slight tint and the type of sunscreen it contains.</li>
            <li> we do have some days that are less than 60% humity albeit not often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly tinted so</li>
            <li> A little pricey.  </li>
            <li> use it everyday instead of makeup</li>
            <li> Been using it now for a few years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not cheap</li>
            <li> I give it only 3 stars because I hate the new packaging.</li>
            <li> This new container is disappointing.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but am unhappy with the new packaging, which is decorative but not functional.  </li>
            <li> a small amount is all that  is needed for an application.</li>
            <li> I hardly EVER wear foundation anymore, but instead wear this.  </li>
            <li> Preferred my much less expensive moisturizer I was using before.</li>
            <li> Middled aged, always with different skin issues but the worst to deal with was everything I put on my face</li>
            <li> This is really not much more than an EXPENSIVE sunblock (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.  </li>
            <li> The packaging doubled the size of the item, making it difficult to transport in hand luggage during air travel.  </li>
            <li> Always hated foundation make-up; my skin didn&#x27;t like it and my face felt heavy.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I worked in a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office, this was a product staff used for their skin.</li>
            <li> This is really not much more than an EXPENSIVE sunblock (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.  My dermatologist recommended it, but I don&#x27;t see any benefits other than it being a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this product by Neocutis, had a weird smell and went on pastey.  Would highly recommend other skin and eyes by Neocutis, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Great on sensitive skin!  I have been using this product for several years and my skin in luminous, it evens out your skintone over time if you are prone to discoloration from break-outs.  Has the SPF built in, goes on like silk and it is the perfect foundation for me or if you need a bit more coverage its a great primer as well.</li>
            <li> Love this day cream just enough cover and sun screen  use it everyday instead of makeup&lt;br /&gt;would recommend highly for any age</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering and using NeoCutis products for years now and it shows!! My skin is firmer - with no wrinkles.  You&#x27;d never know my age!</li>
            <li> The PA at my dermatologist office recommended Journee Day Cream several years ago.  Middled aged, always with different skin issues but the worst to deal with was everything I put on my face burned my sensitive eyes as if my eyes absorbed whatever product I used.  Journee did not burn!  It is light weight, soothing, moisturizing and my face hasn&#x27;t been sunburned since I started using it.  I thought it was expense when I paid $120 for the 1 oz bottle at my doctors medi-spa but a little dab will do and last me over 6 months.  When my first bottle was almost empty, I looked on line for a better price.  Amazon has never failed to be the best price I have found for this product.  Be sure you are getting the 1 oz bottle. I would recommend this product 100%.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Neocutis Journee is a great sunscreen that pampers your skin. As a person prone to breakouts, Neocutis Journee was recommended by my Dermatologist. Breakouts are gone and skin looks great. Lighted tinted, sinks right in and protection of SPF30. A bit pricey, but worth the $$. Much cheaper through Amazon than from my physicians office.</li>
            <li> Recommend for everyone at any age</li>
            <li> this is a great product and  I enjoy usiing it. a small amount is all that  is needed for an application.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I give it only 3 stars because I hate the new packaging. I have been using this day cream for years. The last order I received is in a new bottle. It appears larger, but it is just the bottle that is bigger and every time I use it there is a dried out clump that first comes out of the pump. In the old bottle, that never happened, even with the cover left off. I also do not like that the size is larger, it does not fit well in my cosmetic bag. Really unhappy with the change.</li>
            <li> I tend to have skin on the shiny and oily side, but this moisturizer mattes my face perfectly as well as moisturize my sometimes dry skin. I love the tint it comes in and there&#x27;s no need to wear makeup over this! SPF 30 is perfect and I will be using this moisturizer for as long as its made. The price on Amazon beats the Doctor&#x27;s office as it was only $85 versus $120 for the full size bottle!</li>
            <li> I do like this product and it&#x27;s recommended by my dermatologist.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but my dermatologist charges even more.</li>
            <li> 24 years old. Been using the Journee for about 3 years now. I have extremely sensitive and dry skin and break out very easily. Journee makes my skin smooth and moisturized all day, without feeling oily or heavy at all. It has a tanish tint to it when it comes out, but goes on clear without color once you put it on. Love it!..as well as the other neocutis products.</li>
            <li> Great cream.  I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I love this product line.  It has really repaired wrinkling and sun damage to my face.  My skin glows and looks so much younger.  I&#x27;ve been using it a month and it is worth the price.  Originally made for scar repair, it really fixes your skin and keeps it fresh looking.  Very smooth, absorbs easily, and really feels great!  I love this product line!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer absorbs quickly and easily, has very good SPF, and a slight tint to even skin tone; and does not look chalky and white.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It was just what she wanted</li>
            <li> This product feels really good on my skin and I like the slight tint and the type of sunscreen it contains. I&#x27;m only giving it four stars due to the expense and that I&#x27;m pretty leery of the ingredients. However, I have tried quite a few products that are more natural and I haven&#x27;t found anything I like as much.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this many times and love the product but strangely one bottle was practically empty. How can I get a replacement?</li>
            <li> Love all Neocutis products, a little pricey though.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 4th bottle of this day cream. What fragrance it has, which is minimal and disappears after application, is scant as compared to sun-screen products that smell of suntan lotion and do not disappear after application. Actually it does this product a disservice to even mention \\&quot;suntan lotion\\&quot; which this product is not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in south Florida where humidity is almost a constant althrough we do have some days that are less than 60% humity albeit not often. This product is perfect. I use this under my foundation or alone and use between 1/2 - one generous pump of product on my dry-combination face and neck. To add, I have very sensitive skin and a mild form of rosacea. I find when I travel to drier climates, I have to use a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has there been a miraculous transformation? No, but it helps my skin enough to keep on reordering it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! One of the few sunscreens that doesn&#x27;t smell bad, isn&#x27;t greasy, and feels good on the skin. The tint in the product acts as a foundation and is adequate for me in the summer. While pricy, it&#x27;s worth it. Easy transaction with quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a long time and it really gives your face a nice moisturizing glow.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this day cream.  It goes on smooth and is tinted so it evens skin tone and hides the problem spots. Keeps me from feeling dry and tight throughout the day and it&#x27;s also great for the 30 SPF.  I bought this for post procedure however I have become a believer in this line of skin care.  I also REALLY love their eye cream.  It&#x27;s well worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product for some time. It delivers on promises, pricey but worth it. I am very disappointed in the new cheap packaging. It arrived with the top broken, can not see the amount remaining in container. Most important is that a dry clump is deposited each time you pump. If this packaging does not change I will discontinue use.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least the last couple of years and love it. It is pretty expensive but I&#x27;ve always thought that it was worth it. I just recently purchased yet another bottle to find out that they have new packaging. This new container is disappointing. First, one pump is not quite enough for the entire face, as it used to be. Therefore, each morning you require two pumps, which is a little more than necessary of this very expensive sunscreen. Also, in spite of daily use, the first pump of every morning delivers an unusable clump of product. Typically, I would prefer to think that this is a poorly executed product packaging re-design but fear that instead this is a veiled attempt to speed up, in fact, probably double the use for a price that already made this among one of the most expensive products on the market. If this is the case, shame on you! If I have received a &amp;#34;one-off&amp;#34; bottle of this brand new design then I will gladly write a retraction. Is anyone else experiencing this?</li>
            <li> My dermotologist recommended this product mainly for sunscreen benefits.  Been using it now for a few years.  Always hated foundation make-up; my skin didn&#x27;t like it and my face felt heavy.  I hardly EVER wear foundation anymore, but instead wear this.  I like the light feel of it on my face and my skin likes it too.  If you want/need significant coverage, this is not a good product for you.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but am unhappy with the new packaging, which is decorative but not functional.  The packaging doubled the size of the item, making it difficult to transport in hand luggage during air travel.  Additionally, it is not environmentally sound to double the amount of plastic that has no practical pusrpose.</li>
            <li> I use this day cream under my foundation.  It&#x27;s light and gives me the sun protection that I need without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cream for over a year now, and really like it a lot. My skin tone has evened out, and I love that it&#x27;s a sunscreen/tinted moisturizer/skin repair cream all in one. And, it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen which is an additional plus! However, they recently updated their packaging. The new pump ALWAYS pumps out a small bit of dried old cream with each application, and the cap falls off very easily. So, I wonder how much product I&#x27;d actually have if a small bit wasn&#x27;t wasted with each use (I&#x27;d imagine about 3 applications total), and it isn&#x27;t ideal for those who travel a lot (I put a piece of painters tape over the cap when I travel). This stuff ain&#x27;t cheap, so that&#x27; sorta why it bothers me. I hope they improve the packaging, but the cream itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, at a reasonable price, fast ship, great seller</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 9 months now. My first bottle is still not finished. So a little goes a long way. I paid almost twice as much for my initial bottle, as I purchased it at the salon. I have been hooked on this after about my second/third week of use. I have rosacea and hate caking on layer after layer of product (so no sun screen) on my face. I also don&#x27;t wear make-up and I have combination skin. I love this product because it has the SPF 30 and it has diminished my fine lines. I am 35 and no one could ever tell. my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li> good value for the price</li>
            <li> For those of you who are pro life this product contains an ingredient by the name of Processed Skin Cell Proteins, or PSP which comes from medically donated aborted human fetuses. Meaning the cells are from human babies who have been essentially killed from their mother&#x27;s wombs with the consent of the mother and then processed to make beauty creams. Most of the line of this brand contains this ingredient, so if you are pro life or just find it creepy where the ingredient comes from I recommend you do not buy this product. If you are still skeptical about this review I invite you to take a moment of your time to investigate this on your own or just check out their website. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It nourishes skin without being greasy.  Have used for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I love the product, however, when I went to use it the pump on the bottle does not work so I can not get product out!  Went to request replacement and the date to replace/return was April 25th so I am stuck with a bottle of product that can not be used.  Unhappy.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel very dry and distended my pores. Did not care for it at all. Preferred my much less expensive moisturizer I was using before.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It really erases the fine line around you face and neck area. Well worth the price as the results are great</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen product I have ever used.  There is no smell and it does far more than just protect your skin from the sun.  It is also a wonderful day cream that absorbs into the skin, leaving it soft and with a pretty sheen.  It also has evened out my skin tone and is probably the best facial product I have in my arsenal.  I had been purchasing this through a physician, but found it on Amazon at a much reduced price.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before, which I purchased at my dematologist office, so I knew what the results would be. Your skin glows!!! I have battled pigmentation for some time and this product is a sure thing!! Much better price on Amazon...will not buy at my Dr. office again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever. It is not oily on your face and it blends in perfectly. Make up easily applies over as it absorbs in your skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is healing as well as protecting with the 30SP.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it, my husband does, my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;I am so grateful my dermatologist told me about this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;It is not cheap but I have never found anything that compares.&lt;br /&gt;I receive so many complements on my skin and I think this is part of the reason why.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me if I just have one skin care product, this should be it.  It moisturizes well, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive acne prone skin to break out.  It has the appropriate amount of sunscreen.  It&#x27;s slightly tinted so the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t give me a ghostly appearance. And it has antioxidants.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for  about one year.  And my skin looks great..Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> It has a very light and like primer texture, your skin got a nice glow to receive make up or go just bare. I have been using it for 5 months and no acne or breakout (which I have tendency to). I&#x27;m 37 and live in South America with very humid weather, worst than Miami, and it works great as it worked in NYC all December in very dry and windy conditions (actually it improve my face skin that was suffering so much because of that weather). I really recommend it. It is also really a great post surgery product: my mom got a facelift and she is also 5 month using this and she is very happy with the improvement of her skin. Excellent product, you should give it a try!</li>
            <li> Love this cream...do not like the new packaging.</li>
            <li> Nice cream but don&#x27;t expext to look any bit younger!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product very much. A little pricey.  Works well with my oily skin. Good product for mature skin also.</li>
