            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser and wont be without.</li>
            <li>If you avoid parabens, chemicals--because they aren&#x27;t safe, Label is misleading.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and my face felt very clean</li>
            <li>The product was more strong than I thought.</li>
            <li>Plus It smells like something you could clean your bathroom with!</li>
            <li>This stuff works great to smooth and clear my skin.</li>
            <li>This seemed wise and realistic.  </li>
            <li>Too Strong for newbies.</li>
            <li>This is a strong and effective cleanser that will help even out skin tone and exfoliate very well.  </li>
            <li>But it works exceptionally well; with the first use I could feel a distinct difference in the cleanness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was light &amp; creamy...</li>
            <li>but you will know your skin is clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>This is a nice white cream non foaming cleanser, it smells like super strong Noxema,it has lessened some fine lines but not deeper ones.</li>
            <li>It did however bring about a deep zit that didnt look to good but</li>
            <li>and after it arrived I was able to find what I really wanted.</li>
            <li>so wanted a clean fresh complexion.</li>
            <li>My mother-in-law has tried about everything under the sun and was quickly drawn to this product.</li>
            <li>I love this new skincare line.  </li>
            <li>, I would like for the product to lather up a bit,  its strong but not  too much</li>
            <li>I went through a period of the uglies for a few days but now my face looks great.</li>
            <li>and it really helps smooth your skin out.</li>
            <li>Also, when you apply it you get that fresh minty feel.</li>
            <li>my skin feels fresh and and this cleanser has worked miracles for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this produce long engouh to give a really good review, but for the short time I used it I would say it was okay.</li>
            <li>WELL IT JUST MAKES SENCE RIGHT?)</li>
            <li>This product will sting ever so slightly, but it&#x27;s good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>it brought back the baby soft smoothness that i used to have years back.my complexion is even and bright</li>
            <li>I FIRST HAD GOTTEN A SAMPLE OF THIS CLEANSER WHEN I&#x27;D ORDERED AN ACID PEAL SOLUTION.</li>
            <li>MORE EVEN AND PORES ARE SMALLER.</li>
            <li>For me, this caused more red acne.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a clearing up of my skin (face/arms) within the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>i decided to give this glycolic cleanser a try and within the first two days i would say my acne cleared up signifigantly and within using it the first two weeks</li>
            <li>, I have noticed a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have compared my skin to other women who are younger, and I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>, I look 36, my skin glows with fresh new skins cells.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper then MD Forte.</li>
            <li>My chest is smooth and those deep wrinkles when I wake up are gone now.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the rapid shipping and minimal packaging.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is intense.</li>
            <li>Strong, so  don&#x27;t use it every day and don&#x27;t leave it on too long or you will end up with a peel.</li>
            <li>I think this one is a definite winner and had originally given the product 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I was not able to use it daily but it works great as a once a week product for me.</li>
            <li>I AM NOT SURE IF MY FINE LINES ARE GETTING ANY BETTER YET, BUT ITS ONLY BEEN A WEEK OR TWO.    </li>
            <li>Thinner than expected with a strong scent.</li>
            <li>My skin is combination and I would not use it more then twice a week because it drys your skin out a little.  </li>
            <li>( I SAY \\&quot;SHOULD\\&quot; BECAUSE UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES</li>
            <li>AS A NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE.</li>
            <li>buying the exact same ingredients in a foam, much less product for&lt;br /&gt;much more $$.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s because my chest has new skin now</li>
            <li>It also leaves my face very soft after.</li>
            <li>Not sure that it cleans and exfoliates better.</li>
            <li>I am, however, updating my review for the SECOND TIME because the price of this cleanser doubled after I first ordered it, then a couple weeks later went back to its original price.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels baby soft everytime</li>
            <li>iam 20 years old</li>
            <li>No black heads or whiteheads.</li>
            <li>One more thing: Just a little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li>LAST, HOWEVER I HAVE AN 18 MONTH OLD IN MY HOUSE</li>
            <li>WARNING: if you have sensitive skin, exit stage left!</li>
            <li>Since it is 15% Glycolic Acid, it was suggested by a professional makeup artist that I use this every-other-day or risk a thinning of my upper dermis and risk of sun damage.  </li>
            <li>As my natural sloughing off of dead skin is aided by this product, I see clear new skin coming up from beneath.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin (it might for you if you got sensitive skin)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin (it might for you if you got sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I purchased this only because I could not fine my normal cleanser</li>
            <li> As a lady with sensitive skin, I was looking for a cleanser that would take care of dark spots.  </li>
            <li> It has lightened those dark spots considerably.  </li>
            <li> This product removes the dead skin and lets new skin cells come out.  </li>
            <li> I will use this as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> continue to purchase this product as long as they make it.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin you might want to use small proportions &amp; less frequently.</li>
            <li> i did not have a single blemish come up.</li>
            <li> i have suffered from acne off and on for about a year and a half and i tried numerous products.</li>
            <li> SO I MIX A LITTLE FOAMING FACIAL CLEANSER WITH IT.</li>
            <li> If you are not familiar with glycolic dont use this strength starting out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to glycolic acid, work up slowly, maybe once every other day.</li>
            <li> My only user complaint about this product is that if you use it in the morning, you will notice a bit of extra oil on your skin during the day.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when youre using it though, if you got any scabs from healing whatevers</li>
            <li> You might be slightly pink for 10 minutes</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY</li>
            <li> I would like to try some other products.</li>
            <li> My skin does not appear any smoother, nor have the dark spots gotten any lighter.</li>
            <li> and i couldn&#x27;t wait that long...and can be irritating to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> SHE GOT INTO MY BATHROOM AND EMPTIED HALF</li>
            <li> I have less wrinkles on my face, and I am 62.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE WHEN YOU USE IT</li>
            <li> This is a little bit of a scrub, I like the texture.  </li>
            <li> I have a Clairisonic - I use this product once a week to remove dead skin caused by the Retin A regime I am on.  </li>
            <li> I have years of damage to my face and use a lot of make-up to cover uneven tone, scars and blemishes.</li>
            <li> When you use it, do not use it everyday...</li>
            <li> I noticed very little difference in my skin after using the product for three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started on my neck and chest 6 months ago - my sun spots on my chest are G-O-N-E, I&#x27;m serious!  </li>
            <li> Must have read page wrong.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t foam.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheaper than the MD Forte cleanser my derm prescribed as part of my retin-a regimen. It works just as well as the more expensive brand. I use in the morning to get rid of any flaking caused by the retin-a application the night before.</li>
            <li> This is a strong and effective cleanser that will help even out skin tone and exfoliate very well.  I use it once per day. If you&#x27;re new to glycolic acid, work up slowly, maybe once every other day. Package arrived promptly and good order.</li>
            <li> Great product. I will use this as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> Thinner than expected with a strong scent. Seems to work just ok. Much cheaper then MD Forte. Not sure that it cleans and exfoliates better. I would probably look for a different cleanser next time.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Strong, so  don&#x27;t use it every day and don&#x27;t leave it on too long or you will end up with a peel.</li>
            <li> The product was more strong than I thought. Be careful when youre using it though, if you got any scabs from healing whatevers the product will exfoliate the scab off. Anyways, I like the product. It doesn&#x27;t over dry your skin (it might for you if you got sensitive skin) and I saw an improvement in acne scarring. Also, when you apply it you get that fresh minty feel. Love it lol.</li>
            <li> I FIRST HAD GOTTEN A SAMPLE OF THIS CLEANSER WHEN I&#x27;D ORDERED AN ACID PEAL SOLUTION. I LOVE IT THEN SO I PURCHASED THE LARGER BOTTLE. IT KINDA STINGS A LITTLE WHEN YOU USE IT, BUT I LIKE THAT. I KNOW ITS WORKING.  IT DOESN&#x27;T SUDS UP SO I MIX A LITTLE FOAMING FACIAL CLEANSER WITH IT. MY SKIN LOOKS BETTER, MORE EVEN AND PORES ARE SMALLER. I AM NOT SURE IF MY FINE LINES ARE GETTING ANY BETTER YET, BUT ITS ONLY BEEN A WEEK OR TWO.    A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY AND THE BOTTLE SHOULD LAST A WHILE.  ( I SAY \\&quot;SHOULD\\&quot; BECAUSE UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES IT \\&quot;SHOULD\\&quot; LAST, HOWEVER I HAVE AN 18 MONTH OLD IN MY HOUSE AND THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE. SHE GOT INTO MY BATHROOM AND EMPTIED HALF THE BOTTLE ON THE FLOOR BECAUSE.....WELL IT JUST MAKES SENCE RIGHT?)</li>
            <li> simple to use&lt;br /&gt;Have been using for a month and cant tell if there are any results.&lt;br /&gt;nice healthy color.</li>
            <li> WARNING: if you have sensitive skin, exit stage left! Thats what I shoud have done as soon as I saw the word aggressive. I only bought it cause I thought it was light &amp; creamy... its not! Its waterry, Plus It smells like something you could clean your bathroom with! For me, this caused more red acne. If you have sensitive skin you might want to use small proportions &amp; less frequently. 3 for BOD.</li>
            <li> okk..not a big improvement ..maybe will need a lot of time to show some and i couldn&#x27;t wait that long...and can be irritating to sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a Clairisonic - I use this product once a week to remove dead skin caused by the Retin A regime I am on.  This product will sting ever so slightly, but it&#x27;s good for my skin.  I&#x27;m 46, I look 36, my skin glows with fresh new skins cells.  BUY IT.  I&#x27;ve started on my neck and chest 6 months ago - my sun spots on my chest are G-O-N-E, I&#x27;m serious!  This product removes the dead skin and lets new skin cells come out.  My chest is smooth and those deep wrinkles when I wake up are gone now.  It&#x27;s because my chest has new skin now and it&#x27;s thicker and does not wrinkle like it used to.  As if all this is not enough.. sleeping in your make-up once in awhile?  I do, we all do.  Wash your face with this in the morning and all that soaked in make up is gone.  You might be slightly pink for 10 minutes but you will know your skin is clean.  You don&#x27;t need a Clairisonic.  I use a wash cloth also.  You need only a tiny bit to do the job A+ for this product!</li>
            <li> This is a nice white cream non foaming cleanser, it smells like super strong Noxema,it has lessened some fine lines but not deeper ones.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and I am 30. I have years of damage to my face and use a lot of make-up to cover uneven tone, scars and blemishes. I use it between my peels. I have notice my pores are not as clogged after I started using the skin cleaner. I love the refreshing feel it leaves me from the eucalyptus. It also leaves my face very soft after. My mother-in-law has tried about everything under the sun and was quickly drawn to this product. I let her try it and she was very impressed. I will buy more from Infinite Skin again. I would like to try some other products.</li>
            <li> Thank you i have not used the product yet so I cant say how well it works at this time.</li>
            <li> It does what it says.  I have less wrinkles on my face, and I am 62.  I also use it on my neck and it also helps there also.  I have compared my skin to other women who are younger, and I am happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it.  I use it to remove dirt and grime from horseback riding.  No black heads or whiteheads. No complaints, here.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase this product as long as they make it.  I&#x27;m sure I could go to a store that has top priced face products, but I am happy with this cleanser!</li>
            <li> This is a little bit of a scrub, I like the texture.  Makes my face feel clean.</li>
            <li> I noticed very little difference in my skin after using the product for three weeks.  My skin does not appear any smoother, nor have the dark spots gotten any lighter.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great to smooth and clear my skin. I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t foam. Must have read page wrong.</li>
            <li> youre skin lightes up ,even my daughter bought one, I would like for the product to lather up a bit,  its strong but not  too much</li>
            <li> Totally love it will def by again. My skin feels baby soft everytime I use it. I also bought a lotion with 10% glycolic acid that work amazing together after washing with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> As a lady with sensitive skin, I was looking for a cleanser that would take care of dark spots.  I have noticed a clearing up of my skin (face/arms) within the first week of use.  Since it is 15% Glycolic Acid, it was suggested by a professional makeup artist that I use this every-other-day or risk a thinning of my upper dermis and risk of sun damage.  This seemed wise and realistic.  So just within three uses over one week, I have noticed a positive difference in my skin.  It has lightened those dark spots considerably.  As my natural sloughing off of dead skin is aided by this product, I see clear new skin coming up from beneath.  The name of this product says it all.  I was pleased with the rapid shipping and minimal packaging.  One more thing: Just a little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> I love this new skincare line.  You can feel it tingle when you put it on your face.  I think it makes a big difference in the overall appearance of my skin.  I was not able to use it daily but it works great as a once a week product for me.</li>
            <li> My only user complaint about this product is that if you use it in the morning, you will notice a bit of extra oil on your skin during the day.  But it works exceptionally well; with the first use I could feel a distinct difference in the cleanness of my skin.  I think this one is a definite winner and had originally given the product 5 stars.  I am, however, updating my review for the SECOND TIME because the price of this cleanser doubled after I first ordered it, then a couple weeks later went back to its original price.  $12 for 5 ounces is acceptable; $22 is not, so just keep an eye on price changes.</li>
            <li> Glycolic wash is what my dermatologist recommends and I find works. I&lt;br /&gt;was buying the exact same ingredients in a foam, much less product for&lt;br /&gt;much more $$. When you use it, do not use it everyday...about 3X a week&lt;br /&gt;is best.</li>
            <li> this cleanser is going to be a face wash that i will always use simply becasue it does the job like it described.. i have suffered from acne off and on for about a year and a half and i tried numerous products. i decided to give this glycolic cleanser a try and within the first two days i would say my acne cleared up signifigantly and within using it the first two weeks i did not have a single blemish come up. my skin feels fresh and and this cleanser has worked miracles for me.I even leave it on for a over night treatment and i found that it works even better this way so i can also conserve the product and make it last longer. it brought back the baby soft smoothness that i used to have years back.my complexion is even and bright and i have like this glow like appearance to my olive toned skin:) i love it. iam 20 years old and i think anyone can use this product..this is my beauty staple in my skin care routine</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and my face felt very clean but when I continued to use it on my face it burned.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is intense. I would only recommend this to people who have experience with glycolic acid. It is very strong. Do not use this product with an abrasive cleansing device or you may scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> It didn’t work for me.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and wont be without. It did however bring about a deep zit that didnt look to good but that tells me its doing its job. If you are not familiar with glycolic dont use this strength starting out. Too Strong for newbies. I went through a period of the uglies for a few days but now my face looks great. I dont like makeup so wanted a clean fresh complexion. This stuff ROCKS!!!</li>
            <li> Aloha,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product.  My skin is combination and I would not use it more then twice a week because it drys your skin out a little.  But otherwise I had no breakouts after I used the face wash and it really helps smooth your skin out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this only because I could not fine my normal cleanser and after it arrived I was able to find what I really wanted. I didn&#x27;t use this produce long engouh to give a really good review, but for the short time I used it I would say it was okay.</li>
            <li> This product contains 2 different parabens. How can you claim it to be \\&quot;safe\\&quot;? If you avoid parabens, chemicals--because they aren&#x27;t safe, Label is misleading.</li>
