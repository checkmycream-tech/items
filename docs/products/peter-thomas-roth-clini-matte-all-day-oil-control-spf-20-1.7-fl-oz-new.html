            <li>Great oil control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this and will keep this on hand every summer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>this product did not make me break out more and protected me from the sun!</li>
            <li>Someone turned me on to this and said it was one of the most popular oil control products out there.</li>
            <li>For the price, I would recommend finding a more effective product.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of products but this one so far is the best.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Would be much better if it were more of a lotion.</li>
            <li>If they gave even 2 ounces it would be a better value.  </li>
            <li>Having sun protection also is a cherry on top.</li>
            <li>This Clini-matte made my skin mattified, minimized my pores and my skin looked smoother and more even.</li>
            <li>The Pricing then was Decent, but at $41, even $156 for 2 LOL , DID PTR Die or something?</li>
            <li>shine free most of the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and easily useable.</li>
            <li>The product was ok, nothing special that another Matte Spf can&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>and my face is oil free all day.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product at Sephora and decided to buy the full size once I ran out.</li>
            <li>I have a tremendously oily face.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it, my friend told me, your skin looks so even!</li>
            <li>If people notice it, you know its working and is worth the $$</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for shiny faces like mine, but it does not stop shine all together.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be using it more - I also got the mattifying gel from Paul Thomas</li>
            <li>Overall a good solid product that works as it should.</li>
            <li>For some reason this product did not work as well as it normally does when I buy it fresh from Sephora.</li>
            <li>This really does work to keep my oily skin</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my face seems to get very oily by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I controls oil very well.  </li>
            <li>Living in Arizona, I absolutely need SPF  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like it as much since it&#x27;s not a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily.</li>
            <li>Plus, I find the price to be reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Lol this is a ridiculous price for a product, that can be substituted easily with other brands.</li>
            <li>I live in south Texas, where its hot and humid.</li>
            <li>I may have seen a slight decrease in shine, but that fact that I cannot say for sure speaks for itself.</li>
            <li>The SPF level is not as high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend PTR Clini-Matte over Murad&#x27;s matte product.</li>
            <li>Spent TONS of money on products that guaranteed a shine free face.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and normally within an hour</li>
            <li>I love most of Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s items - this is a bit disappointing.  </li>
            <li>I have 51 year old oily skin</li>
            <li>This is the time of the year I have problems with my face,once i go in the sun,it looks like I have poured a bottle of cooking oil on my face,i am hoping this will help but so far its working well.</li>
            <li>smaller by light not reflecting as much due the the matte surface caused by the product.</li>
            <li>I had a little success with Murad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to smooth onto skin, doesn&#x27;t spread well at all.  </li>
            <li>By mid-day my face has a little bit of shine, but I used a blotting sheet and my skin looks as it did when first applied.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For some reason this product did not work as well as it normally does when I buy it fresh from Sephora. I ended it tossing it out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  it&#x27;s been getting a little hard to find for some reason, and the price was higher the 2nd time I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shied away from sunscreen - especially on the face due to my oily skin and the fact I hate the feel of it.  I tried this based on tons of review reading and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  It does help control shine all day and gives you sun protection.  I don&#x27;t use this every day - just on the days I know I plan to be outside for long periods of time.  The sun protection definitely works as well!  I&#x27;m very pleased with this and will keep this on hand every summer.</li>
            <li> Not that matte believe me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had oily skin for years. No matter what products i&#x27;ve tried, nothing worked. Spent TONS of money on products that guaranteed a shine free face.  I had a little success with Murad but it stopped working after a couple of uses. Someone turned me on to this and said it was one of the most popular oil control products out there. It worked exceptionally well!  This product soaks up the oil and stays matted all day. Seriously give this a chance.</li>
            <li> I love most of Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s items - this is a bit disappointing.  Matte does not last all day.  I have 51 year old oily skin so I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li> This really does work to keep my oily skin shine free most of the day.  Works well under my oil control liquid foundation too.  However, it&#x27;s very, very thick - almost like Elmer&#x27;s paste.  It&#x27;s hard to smooth onto skin, doesn&#x27;t spread well at all.  I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again because it&#x27;s so thick.  Would be much better if it were more of a lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my face seems to get very oily by the end of the day.  The problem with oil control face moisturizer is that is it hard to find a product that creates a matte look WITH SPF.  In fact it&#x27;s almost impossible to find.  This product seems to be what I am looking for.  I controls oil very well.  I have combination skin).  Living in Arizona, I absolutely need SPF  so this kills two birds with one stone.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because you only get 1.7 oz.  If they gave even 2 ounces it would be a better value.  Overall a good solid product that works as it should.</li>
            <li> I have a T-zone that has a tendency to get oily no matter the weather or make-up I&#x27;m using. I have tried other products that promise oil-control that provide little to no results. Unfortunately, this product was one I added to that list. I may have seen a slight decrease in shine, but that fact that I cannot say for sure speaks for itself. For the price, I would recommend finding a more effective product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month or so now. It does go on feeling a bit slippery, but does wonders to control shine. I will definitely be using it more - I also got the mattifying gel from Paul Thomas but I don&#x27;t like it as much since it&#x27;s not a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Wow I bought this a few months back When it was $21, YES $21 dollars. The product was ok, nothing special that another Matte Spf can&#x27;t do. The Pricing then was Decent, but at $41, even $156 for 2 LOL , DID PTR Die or something? Lol this is a ridiculous price for a product, that can be substituted easily with other brands. NOT worth To buy at these ridiculous prices.</li>
            <li> Great oil control. The SPF level is not as high so couldn&#x27;t be used in summer. Sometimes I use it as a primer for make-up, because it does help to achieve a matte finish look</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have extremely oily skin. And I was hoping that this would be the answer to my prayers, the product that would help me to control the oil slick that is my face. I used it everyday for two weeks and only saw a slight difference in oil production. I still found myself using oil blotting sheets throughout the day while using this product. Because of the price I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The claim that a topical application makes pores smaller and regulates oil production seems to cross the line. Perhaps if there is an irritant that plumps up surrounding skin, the pore size would shrink. Or it may be the case that pores \\&quot;appear\\&quot; smaller by light not reflecting as much due the the matte surface caused by the product. But claiming that it controls oil production, systemic in nature, is crossing the line. It may control how surface oil acts or appears, but it cannot control sebaceous glands and hormones. If the product can help absorb oil and maintain a matte finish for about 8 hours, that is a glorious enough sales point in itself. Having sun protection also is a cherry on top.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great!  I have very oily skin and I have acne... this product did not make me break out more and protected me from the sun!</li>
            <li> I live in south Texas, where its hot and humid. I have combination skin and normally within an hour my face has a shine due to the humidity. I received a sample of this product at Sephora and decided to buy the full size once I ran out. I highly recommend PTR Clini-Matte over Murad&#x27;s matte product. This Clini-matte made my skin mattified, minimized my pores and my skin looked smoother and more even. By mid-day my face has a little bit of shine, but I used a blotting sheet and my skin looks as it did when first applied. Now I can&#x27;t go without it! First time I used it, my friend told me, your skin looks so even! If people notice it, you know its working and is worth the $$</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily.I have tried a lot of products but this one so far is the best.I apply it in the morning before I leave the house and my face is oil free all day.You only need to apply a very small amount.I don&#x27;t know how its going to be with summer just around the corner.This is the time of the year I have problems with my face,once i go in the sun,it looks like I have poured a bottle of cooking oil on my face,i am hoping this will help but so far its working well.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth Clini-Matte All Day Oil-Control SPF&lt;br /&gt;recommend for u Peter Thomas Roth Clini-Matte All Day Oil-Control SPF .</li>
            <li> Just a little background:  I have a tremendously oily face.  Oily hair, oily face.  I mean, grease pit.  Three hours after washing my face and putting makeup on, I&#x27;m shining like a disco ball.  That said, this product cuts down on the shine a lot.  The only other product that I found that worked for me was MediMatte by Cosmedicine, but they discontinued that product, and Clini-Matte doesn&#x27;t leave a white paste/flaky residue like the MediMatte.  Plus, I find the price to be reasonable.  Definitely worth it for shiny faces like mine, but it does not stop shine all together.  I still have to use blotting tissues, but not as often.</li>
            <li> Always a cloud pleaser. I have had no problems with it. It&#x27;s lightweight and easily useable. Will be using it for a long time.</li>
