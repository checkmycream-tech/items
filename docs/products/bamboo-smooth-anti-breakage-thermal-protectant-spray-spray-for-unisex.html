            <li>And it has a good smell too..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the UV+ product I also have by Alterna,</li>
            <li>It also smells good.  </li>
            <li>and it smells good.  </li>
            <li>It is so good to your hair.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good.  </li>

            <li>This has repaired my hair and it has never looked better!</li>
            <li>I tried this product and love it!</li>
            <li>However, I do feel based upon the reputation and abundance of positive reviews that if there were some type of heat protection this is one of the best products on the market.  </li>
            <li>Amazing heat protectant.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This is so nice.</li>
            <li>A lot of Alterna products smell kind of...spicy and musky, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Fast service and great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using the Bamboo color protectant shampoo and conditioner (my hair isn&#x27;t dyed, but it still makes my hair look really nice).</li>
            <li>Full of awesome ingredients, lasts quite a while, and I will keep using it for keeping my hair supple and full of moisture.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, it is fabulous fir my hair, i use it with each shampoo, it is a great value for me.</li>
            <li>My hair used to break very easily.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and now order thru Amazon at an amazing savings</li>
            <li>As far as heat protection goes, this product is superb.</li>
            <li>Great for frizzy ends and protecting from blow drying and hot iron damage.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a very light hand with this product and holding it about 12 inches away from your hair.</li>
            <li>:)) I have very very light blond hair</li>
            <li>The spritzer is really fine and comes out nice.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>you have greasy hair, DO NOT use more than 1-2 spritzes.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, excellent for protecting against heat.</li>
            <li>truly do not think my hair could look better</li>
            <li>and you would never know how many hair-damaging rituals I do to this head of hair by looking at it.  </li>
            <li>will add this is more a cream than a spray</li>
            <li>I love that you can spray it like hair spray or spray into your palm for a cream like application.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>As for the heat protectant, i dont have many split ends and its been 5 months since my cut.</li>
            <li>I won it from Allure magazine and fell in love.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>So many others I like better - one that&#x27;s even cheaper.</li>
            <li>Oribe, Miracle 7) that work so much better than this.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used aerosol products before and those are much better.</li>
            <li>Product as described fast shipment does great job protecting my hair from heat damage</li>
            <li>I love this and plan on buying it again and again.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure it truly worked.</li>
            <li>Came unwrapped and without top.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I will keep on using it.</li>
            <li>I have throughly enjoyed this product -</li>
            <li>love this for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it&#x27;s a faulty sprayer.</li>
            <li>Love love love the smell it leaves in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am now going to switch to more of the Alterna products.  </li>
            <li>I love this heat spray..</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love Alterna products.  </li>
            <li>but it squirts out in more of a gel/cream consistency than a spray.</li>
            <li>This may not matter to many, however, if you have an allergy to Gluten</li>
            <li>I love this detangler.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than even Aveda.  </li>
            <li>Of course it will smooth your hair if it has dimethicone in it!</li>
            <li>It is thick so sprays out a bit clumpy, but smoothes hair very nicely and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Smells good and makes your hair nice, soft and strong!</li>
            <li>I bought this heat protectant spray based solely on the great reviews &amp; high rating, because I&#x27;ve never even heard of this brand before.</li>
            <li>have tried a number of kinds from high end to medium range and this is definitely great for the value.</li>
            <li>I first bought this on QVC and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It smells great and feels so light but works really well.</li>
            <li>The nozzle gets clogged up and you have to scrape it to keep it in top condition, but it is easy to do and keeps this pumping well.  </li>
            <li>It has a great smell and as far as I can tell it&#x27;s doing the job!</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and really does seem to keep my hair in better condition during the weeks I choose to style my hair (mostly with curling irons).  </li>
            <li>This keeps my hair smooth no Frizies after blow drying love this</li>
            <li>Sometimes I apply it to my hair just to have a lovely, light scent.  </li>
            <li>I love Alterna Bamboo Smooth Anti-Breakage Thermal Spray.  </li>
            <li>Love this to smooth hair and protect from the heat.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers had mentioned that the product was excellent but the packaging (i.e. the nozzle) was not up to par.  </li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>But I do like the fact that it is a mist which makes it easy to apply to the hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>The spray is easy to manage and smells fantastic, as well as protects your hair from styling tools.</li>
            <li>A little prciey but the best product on the market for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You will LOVE the fragrance so much, you will be tempted to use it as a body spray!!  </li>
            <li>This has all made a HUGE difference to my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is left smooth, shiney and has a great texture after using this, with no worries of damage.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and weightless.</li>
            <li>:  I also wanted to add that I chose this product because it was FREE of sulfates, parabens, phthalates, gluten, sodium chloride, and synthetic colors.</li>
            <li>I use it every time I wash my hair....makes it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>frizz, pouf  hair, to smooth, silky hair.  </li>
            <li>This is fantastic stuff.  </li>
            <li>The jury is still out on that, but I do feel it protects because my hair was smooth even with my raggedy ends.</li>
            <li>Hair stays smooth and frizz free for way longer</li>
            <li>My hair did feel smooth and resilient even after flat-ironing.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>After using Alterna shampoo and conditioner with great results, I went in search of something to protect my hair from the heat of blow drying and flat ironing every day.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the protection it gives when usin heat; my hair feel great even after flat ironing it.  </li>
            <li>I have super fine hair in a chin length bob</li>
            <li>Works great, but I do recommend spraying into your hand and not directly into hair.</li>
            <li>Has helped my hair with breakage after the first use, just make sure not to over do it or your hair will get oily.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and prone to damage and this product really seems to have helped its resilience.</li>
            <li>Sticky and makes clean hair greasy.</li>
            <li>so the products fits right in!</li>
            <li>Since I just bought it and haven&#x27;t had enough time to see results yet, I am rating it 5 stars because it smells good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thermal protectant, but it left my hair feeling kinda greasy</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair that can look greasy if I use too much product in it, but this stuff is just fine for it.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous to use right before you straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li>Seriously the best, don&#x27;t think, just buy it.</li>
            <li>My hair is super frizzy.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product works great and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>Great product, I apply prior to blow drying and it makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars, but sometimes with my fine hair it moisturizes too much, and makes my hair look oily.</li>
            <li>Lol I&#x27;ll update within a few weeks to see if I notice any changes.</li>
            <li>My hair looked SO shiny and healthy and was so soft, without loss of volume.  </li>
            <li>I like a more naturally made product and that is why I chose this.</li>
            <li>Blended smoothly through my damp hair and made it light and soft while blow drying.</li>
            <li>I love this product so far.  </li>
            <li>Worth every dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was hoping this more natural product would come even close to the Living Proof.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>though it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it works so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>More natural/safe than most conventional heat protectants on the market.  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>As and as long as I cover the roots at the top of my hair before spraying, my hair stays smooth and shiny even when it&#x27;s raining.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great too, not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased at my high end salon.  </li>
            <li>I have semi fine, light blond (colored) long hair.</li>
            <li>Spray into your palms first, then work through your tips.</li>
            <li>and I had to bleach my hair first.</li>
            <li>Also on my clients :) Not only did this protect my hair from heat damage, it made it feel softer and healthier from chemical damage too.</li>
            <li>I first found about this product while I was at the hair salon.</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to work pretty well</li>
            <li>but my hair is pretty damaged</li>
            <li>My friend recommend me to try this out!It is sulfate free and natural smelling miracle in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this product, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day???</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my personal favorite.  </li>
            <li>1st of all there was no pump cover to stop leaks, but I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first because I thought maybe it has a foil closure under the pump.</li>
            <li>I love this product, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>With it, it was not weighed down, healthy looking and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new thermal spray and decided to try this based on other good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I only gave it 3 stars because I really don&#x27;t know for sure if it&#x27;s doing what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>My hair use to get so damaged with styling it with hot tool and now it doesn&#x27;t as much.</li>
            <li>Smells good, not sure if it protects.</li>
            <li>I love Alterna  hair products I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair  </li>
            <li>I love Alternaproducts, and decided to give this a try after being over processed and struggling with frizz and dry ends.</li>
            <li>I guess it wasn&#x27;t enough protein for my fine hair texture my hair startd to break off, so I threw the product out.</li>
            <li>I use about 3 to 4 sprays everyday and my hair is soft, healthy, and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>It seems to really be protecting my hair from too much heat damage.</li>
            <li>or if you use too much....</li>
            <li>Its a very concentrated serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they really work .I</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling soft and helps detangle when used on freshly washed-wet hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this stuff smells</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I was finding that on the days I forgot to use it that my hair was much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>&amp; it tangles so much after I wash it.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>really helps with frizz and to control damage from the flatiron and the hair dryer</li>
            <li>i really like it.</li>
            <li>so i try to take care of them as much as i can.</li>
            <li>I rarely use anything but natural products on mine and my daughters hair</li>
            <li>I agree with posts below -- this isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; feeling considering company marketing.</li>
            <li>i have processed hair and it really helps protect it.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap,  especially for the amount you receive, so I cam</li>
            <li>Honestly I wouldn&#x27;t expect to put product in my hair and not have some very slight residual.</li>
            <li>This is amazing for a simple blowout.my hair is smooth shiny and protected with very little product.</li>
            <li>Glad I read that on other reviews beforehand.</li>
            <li>but when I mix it with a serum like CHI&#x27;s Argan plus Moringa Oil or any other serum, it works even better.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so easy to comb out, I have very long hair</li>
            <li>Blow dry now its much easier and hair seems to be light and protected.100 %</li>
            <li>I bought this from Sephora after reading reviews on their website, so I already was aware that if you spray this directly onto your hair, you might end up with a greasy, weighed-down &#x27;do.  </li>
            <li>I was very skeptical of the reviews but this stuff works great!</li>
            <li>To avoid having that directly on one section of your hair, spray into your palm first and apply after spreading it out in your hands.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful how much I use as I have fine hair and</li>
            <li>I support Alterna Bamboo and normally love their products, but I feel like it makes my hair stick together slightly.</li>
            <li>I applied John Frieda Lux Volume Root Booster &amp; Living Proof Full Thickening Mousse as I normally do, then applied this product BY HAND, as noted above</li>
            <li>They had the top that doesseem to fit tapped on poorly.</li>
            <li>I tried Joico smoothing serum,Loreal professional,Moroccan oil,Organix ,Paul Mitchel Super skinny serum,Lanza,Aveda and finally came to this one.</li>
            <li>Its not greasy but its true you should spray about 3-4 pumps in your hand then rub into ends before blowing or flat ironing your hair.</li>
            <li>In checking the back of the bottle, it really is made of all the right quality, non-greasy moisturizing ingredients.  </li>
            <li>And I use high heat.</li>
            <li>I would highly  recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I saw that this was rated high on the Ulta website, so</li>
            <li>I need a few more months (at least one more trim cycle) and to actively monitory my split end progression between trims to confidently speak on whether or not this product really prevents heat damage.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and can get very frizzy.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair soft and ready to be straightened.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s one of the few things i have purchased more than once.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a normal spray like feel.</li>
            <li>My hair almost feels more dried out after I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde, but I love to dye my hair different colors</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and my blow out is very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and my blow out is very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use Alterna Smooth thermal spray every other day.</li>
            <li>I saw many reviews stating that its easy to over apply, or can be a little heavy or greasy side.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend enough - it does a fantastic job and the bottle last for months.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong out of the bottle but much less noticeable after its in my hair, which I was grateful for.</li>
            <li>I love Alterna Bamboo products, but this one I&#x27;m not sure about.  </li>
            <li>Especially since I am frying my hair, which is why I need heat protectant in the first place.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>1 month of daily use, I have long hair that is fine but lots of hair.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this, my hair had been feeling dry and the ends were becoming brittle from my everyday heat styling.  </li>
            <li>It kept my hair very soft for two full day and my hair was less frizzy.</li>
            <li>It protects your hair, it makes it soft as hell</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that explodes into frizz in no time</li>
            <li>but it does seem to make the hair soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, but not too soft to style it.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, not tacky.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I went ahead and sprayed it directly on my hands and rub it in then apply it to my hair in sections.</li>
            <li>Using direct heat is going to cause some damage.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and adds shine.</li>
            <li>Really only works well if your hair is straight, because it is too heavy for waves or light curls.</li>
            <li>Have had no trouble with the spraying function.</li>
            <li>Not much, and well worth the visible protection it&#x27;s giving.</li>
            <li>I prefer to spray this onto my hands and then run my hands through my hair as the product is a bit more thick.</li>
            <li>I do have longer hair that is definitely on the thick fuller side, so if anything this product aided and worked beyond what I have previously experienced with other heat protectants to have worked.</li>
            <li>Helps, when emulsified with water in my hand, to smooth and tame my curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Really helps seal the ends to lay flat.</li>
            <li>It just kind of squirts out thick all over the place and mostly all falls on the floor (making it very slippery and dangerous).</li>
            <li>Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  </li>
            <li>I use a flat iron on it and also occasional hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because the other heat protector product (Living Proof brand) has some dubious chemicals in it that I decided I don&#x27;t want to have on my hair...think about how you end up breathing the vapors of a product when you blow dry your hair, and how important it is to not breathe the chemicals...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for protecting your hair from blow drying, flat ironing or curling.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and everything I&#x27;ve tried previously leaves a greasy looking residue or makes my hair feel rough and strange.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist, and I see such damaged hair everyday-by looking in the mirror!</li>
            <li>It left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I agree with previous comments - spray into your hands first then distribute throughout hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it seems to really protect my hair from the heat of blow drying and straightening.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and I flat iron with ease.</li>
            <li>so I could use this stuff as a leave in on damp hair and it would dry kind of beachy looking but very tamed considering the alternative which is big crazy hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its worth it to have heat protection that makes your hair look like garbage :-/</li>
            <li>I would not use it for my whole head because ALTERNA  weighs the hair down somewhat.</li>
            <li>too much would weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>and this really protects it from heat styling without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I mean, you would think all this heat-styling (blow dry every other day but iron pretty much 6 days/week) as well as the highlighting would leave my hair a hot mess,</li>

            <li> And it has a good smell too..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the UV+ product I also have by Alterna,</li>
            <li> It also smells good.  </li>
            <li> and it smells good.  </li>
            <li> It is so good to your hair.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good.  </li>

            <li> This has repaired my hair and it has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and love it!</li>
            <li> However, I do feel based upon the reputation and abundance of positive reviews that if there were some type of heat protection this is one of the best products on the market.  </li>
            <li> Amazing heat protectant.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is so nice.</li>
            <li> A lot of Alterna products smell kind of...spicy and musky, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Fast service and great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using the Bamboo color protectant shampoo and conditioner (my hair isn&#x27;t dyed, but it still makes my hair look really nice).</li>
            <li> Full of awesome ingredients, lasts quite a while, and I will keep using it for keeping my hair supple and full of moisture.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, it is fabulous fir my hair, i use it with each shampoo, it is a great value for me.</li>
            <li> My hair used to break very easily.  </li>
            <li> Love the product and now order thru Amazon at an amazing savings</li>
            <li> As far as heat protection goes, this product is superb.</li>
            <li> Great for frizzy ends and protecting from blow drying and hot iron damage.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a very light hand with this product and holding it about 12 inches away from your hair.</li>
            <li> :)) I have very very light blond hair</li>
            <li> The spritzer is really fine and comes out nice.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> you have greasy hair, DO NOT use more than 1-2 spritzes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, excellent for protecting against heat.</li>
            <li> truly do not think my hair could look better</li>
            <li> and you would never know how many hair-damaging rituals I do to this head of hair by looking at it.  </li>
            <li> will add this is more a cream than a spray</li>
            <li> I love that you can spray it like hair spray or spray into your palm for a cream like application.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> As for the heat protectant, i dont have many split ends and its been 5 months since my cut.</li>
            <li> I won it from Allure magazine and fell in love.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> So many others I like better - one that&#x27;s even cheaper.</li>
            <li> Oribe, Miracle 7) that work so much better than this.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used aerosol products before and those are much better.</li>
            <li> Product as described fast shipment does great job protecting my hair from heat damage</li>
            <li> I love this and plan on buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it truly worked.</li>
            <li> Came unwrapped and without top.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I will keep on using it.</li>
            <li> I have throughly enjoyed this product -</li>
            <li> love this for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am sure it&#x27;s a faulty sprayer.</li>
            <li> Love love love the smell it leaves in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am now going to switch to more of the Alterna products.  </li>
            <li> I love this heat spray..</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love Alterna products.  </li>
            <li> but it squirts out in more of a gel/cream consistency than a spray.</li>
            <li> This may not matter to many, however, if you have an allergy to Gluten</li>
            <li> I love this detangler.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than even Aveda.  </li>
            <li> Of course it will smooth your hair if it has dimethicone in it!</li>
            <li> It is thick so sprays out a bit clumpy, but smoothes hair very nicely and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes your hair nice, soft and strong!</li>
            <li> I bought this heat protectant spray based solely on the great reviews &amp; high rating, because I&#x27;ve never even heard of this brand before.</li>
            <li> have tried a number of kinds from high end to medium range and this is definitely great for the value.</li>
            <li> I first bought this on QVC and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It smells great and feels so light but works really well.</li>
            <li> The nozzle gets clogged up and you have to scrape it to keep it in top condition, but it is easy to do and keeps this pumping well.  </li>
            <li> It has a great smell and as far as I can tell it&#x27;s doing the job!</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and really does seem to keep my hair in better condition during the weeks I choose to style my hair (mostly with curling irons).  </li>
            <li> This keeps my hair smooth no Frizies after blow drying love this</li>
            <li> Sometimes I apply it to my hair just to have a lovely, light scent.  </li>
            <li> I love Alterna Bamboo Smooth Anti-Breakage Thermal Spray.  </li>
            <li> Love this to smooth hair and protect from the heat.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers had mentioned that the product was excellent but the packaging (i.e. the nozzle) was not up to par.  </li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> But I do like the fact that it is a mist which makes it easy to apply to the hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> The spray is easy to manage and smells fantastic, as well as protects your hair from styling tools.</li>
            <li> A little prciey but the best product on the market for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You will LOVE the fragrance so much, you will be tempted to use it as a body spray!!  </li>
            <li> This has all made a HUGE difference to my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is left smooth, shiney and has a great texture after using this, with no worries of damage.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and weightless.</li>
            <li> :  I also wanted to add that I chose this product because it was FREE of sulfates, parabens, phthalates, gluten, sodium chloride, and synthetic colors.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I wash my hair....makes it smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> frizz, pouf  hair, to smooth, silky hair.  </li>
            <li> This is fantastic stuff.  </li>
            <li> The jury is still out on that, but I do feel it protects because my hair was smooth even with my raggedy ends.</li>
            <li> Hair stays smooth and frizz free for way longer</li>
            <li> My hair did feel smooth and resilient even after flat-ironing.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> After using Alterna shampoo and conditioner with great results, I went in search of something to protect my hair from the heat of blow drying and flat ironing every day.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the protection it gives when usin heat; my hair feel great even after flat ironing it.  </li>
            <li> I have super fine hair in a chin length bob</li>
            <li> Works great, but I do recommend spraying into your hand and not directly into hair.</li>
            <li> Has helped my hair with breakage after the first use, just make sure not to over do it or your hair will get oily.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and prone to damage and this product really seems to have helped its resilience.</li>
            <li> Sticky and makes clean hair greasy.</li>
            <li> so the products fits right in!</li>
            <li> Since I just bought it and haven&#x27;t had enough time to see results yet, I am rating it 5 stars because it smells good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thermal protectant, but it left my hair feeling kinda greasy</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair that can look greasy if I use too much product in it, but this stuff is just fine for it.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous to use right before you straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li> Seriously the best, don&#x27;t think, just buy it.</li>
            <li> My hair is super frizzy.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works great and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> Great product, I apply prior to blow drying and it makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars, but sometimes with my fine hair it moisturizes too much, and makes my hair look oily.</li>
            <li> Lol I&#x27;ll update within a few weeks to see if I notice any changes.</li>
            <li> My hair looked SO shiny and healthy and was so soft, without loss of volume.  </li>
            <li> I like a more naturally made product and that is why I chose this.</li>
            <li> Blended smoothly through my damp hair and made it light and soft while blow drying.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.  </li>
            <li> Worth every dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was hoping this more natural product would come even close to the Living Proof.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> though it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it works so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> More natural/safe than most conventional heat protectants on the market.  </li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> As and as long as I cover the roots at the top of my hair before spraying, my hair stays smooth and shiny even when it&#x27;s raining.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great too, not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased at my high end salon.  </li>
            <li> I have semi fine, light blond (colored) long hair.</li>
            <li> Spray into your palms first, then work through your tips.</li>
            <li> and I had to bleach my hair first.</li>
            <li> Also on my clients :) Not only did this protect my hair from heat damage, it made it feel softer and healthier from chemical damage too.</li>
            <li> I first found about this product while I was at the hair salon.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work pretty well</li>
            <li> but my hair is pretty damaged</li>
            <li> My friend recommend me to try this out!It is sulfate free and natural smelling miracle in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day???</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my personal favorite.  </li>
            <li> 1st of all there was no pump cover to stop leaks, but I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first because I thought maybe it has a foil closure under the pump.</li>
            <li> I love this product, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> With it, it was not weighed down, healthy looking and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new thermal spray and decided to try this based on other good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 3 stars because I really don&#x27;t know for sure if it&#x27;s doing what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My hair use to get so damaged with styling it with hot tool and now it doesn&#x27;t as much.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not sure if it protects.</li>
            <li> I love Alterna  hair products I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair  </li>
            <li> I love Alternaproducts, and decided to give this a try after being over processed and struggling with frizz and dry ends.</li>
            <li> I guess it wasn&#x27;t enough protein for my fine hair texture my hair startd to break off, so I threw the product out.</li>
            <li> I use about 3 to 4 sprays everyday and my hair is soft, healthy, and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> It seems to really be protecting my hair from too much heat damage.</li>
            <li> or if you use too much....</li>
            <li> Its a very concentrated serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they really work .I</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling soft and helps detangle when used on freshly washed-wet hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this stuff smells</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I was finding that on the days I forgot to use it that my hair was much softer and shinier.</li>
            <li> &amp; it tangles so much after I wash it.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> really helps with frizz and to control damage from the flatiron and the hair dryer</li>
            <li> i really like it.</li>
            <li> so i try to take care of them as much as i can.</li>
            <li> I rarely use anything but natural products on mine and my daughters hair</li>
            <li> I agree with posts below -- this isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; feeling considering company marketing.</li>
            <li> i have processed hair and it really helps protect it.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap,  especially for the amount you receive, so I cam</li>
            <li> Honestly I wouldn&#x27;t expect to put product in my hair and not have some very slight residual.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for a simple blowout.my hair is smooth shiny and protected with very little product.</li>
            <li> Glad I read that on other reviews beforehand.</li>
            <li> but when I mix it with a serum like CHI&#x27;s Argan plus Moringa Oil or any other serum, it works even better.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so easy to comb out, I have very long hair</li>
            <li> Blow dry now its much easier and hair seems to be light and protected.100 %</li>
            <li> I bought this from Sephora after reading reviews on their website, so I already was aware that if you spray this directly onto your hair, you might end up with a greasy, weighed-down &#x27;do.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of the reviews but this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> To avoid having that directly on one section of your hair, spray into your palm first and apply after spreading it out in your hands.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful how much I use as I have fine hair and</li>
            <li> I support Alterna Bamboo and normally love their products, but I feel like it makes my hair stick together slightly.</li>
            <li> I applied John Frieda Lux Volume Root Booster &amp; Living Proof Full Thickening Mousse as I normally do, then applied this product BY HAND, as noted above</li>
            <li> They had the top that doesseem to fit tapped on poorly.</li>
            <li> I tried Joico smoothing serum,Loreal professional,Moroccan oil,Organix ,Paul Mitchel Super skinny serum,Lanza,Aveda and finally came to this one.</li>
            <li> Its not greasy but its true you should spray about 3-4 pumps in your hand then rub into ends before blowing or flat ironing your hair.</li>
            <li> In checking the back of the bottle, it really is made of all the right quality, non-greasy moisturizing ingredients.  </li>
            <li> And I use high heat.</li>
            <li> I would highly  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I saw that this was rated high on the Ulta website, so</li>
            <li> I need a few more months (at least one more trim cycle) and to actively monitory my split end progression between trims to confidently speak on whether or not this product really prevents heat damage.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and can get very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and ready to be straightened.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of the few things i have purchased more than once.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a normal spray like feel.</li>
            <li> My hair almost feels more dried out after I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde, but I love to dye my hair different colors</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and my blow out is very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and my blow out is very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use Alterna Smooth thermal spray every other day.</li>
            <li> I saw many reviews stating that its easy to over apply, or can be a little heavy or greasy side.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend enough - it does a fantastic job and the bottle last for months.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong out of the bottle but much less noticeable after its in my hair, which I was grateful for.</li>
            <li> I love Alterna Bamboo products, but this one I&#x27;m not sure about.  </li>
            <li> Especially since I am frying my hair, which is why I need heat protectant in the first place.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> 1 month of daily use, I have long hair that is fine but lots of hair.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used this, my hair had been feeling dry and the ends were becoming brittle from my everyday heat styling.  </li>
            <li> It kept my hair very soft for two full day and my hair was less frizzy.</li>
            <li> It protects your hair, it makes it soft as hell</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that explodes into frizz in no time</li>
            <li> but it does seem to make the hair soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, but not too soft to style it.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, not tacky.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I went ahead and sprayed it directly on my hands and rub it in then apply it to my hair in sections.</li>
            <li> Using direct heat is going to cause some damage.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and adds shine.</li>
            <li> Really only works well if your hair is straight, because it is too heavy for waves or light curls.</li>
            <li> Have had no trouble with the spraying function.</li>
            <li> Not much, and well worth the visible protection it&#x27;s giving.</li>
            <li> I prefer to spray this onto my hands and then run my hands through my hair as the product is a bit more thick.</li>
            <li> I do have longer hair that is definitely on the thick fuller side, so if anything this product aided and worked beyond what I have previously experienced with other heat protectants to have worked.</li>
            <li> Helps, when emulsified with water in my hand, to smooth and tame my curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Really helps seal the ends to lay flat.</li>
            <li> It just kind of squirts out thick all over the place and mostly all falls on the floor (making it very slippery and dangerous).</li>
            <li> Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  </li>
            <li> I use a flat iron on it and also occasional hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because the other heat protector product (Living Proof brand) has some dubious chemicals in it that I decided I don&#x27;t want to have on my hair...think about how you end up breathing the vapors of a product when you blow dry your hair, and how important it is to not breathe the chemicals...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for protecting your hair from blow drying, flat ironing or curling.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and everything I&#x27;ve tried previously leaves a greasy looking residue or makes my hair feel rough and strange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist, and I see such damaged hair everyday-by looking in the mirror!</li>
            <li> It left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous comments - spray into your hands first then distribute throughout hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to really protect my hair from the heat of blow drying and straightening.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and I flat iron with ease.</li>
            <li> so I could use this stuff as a leave in on damp hair and it would dry kind of beachy looking but very tamed considering the alternative which is big crazy hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its worth it to have heat protection that makes your hair look like garbage :-/</li>
            <li> I would not use it for my whole head because ALTERNA  weighs the hair down somewhat.</li>
            <li> too much would weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> and this really protects it from heat styling without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I mean, you would think all this heat-styling (blow dry every other day but iron pretty much 6 days/week) as well as the highlighting would leave my hair a hot mess,</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair &amp; was looking for something that didn&#x27;t weight my hair down or dry it out when I straightened it -</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and protects it when I style it with a hair with a hair curler and other heated tools.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which product is working magic, but my hair is shinier and healthier than it has been in at least a year.</li>
            <li> I use this spray before blow drying my hair and again while flat ironing it or curling it.  </li>
            <li> use a Flat Iron so often my hair is bone</li>
            <li> (I only wash my long, highlighted hair every 6 days).</li>
            <li> It trukly works, my hair does not get heat damage from blowdrying and using the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I put about 6 squirts on before drying and don&#x27;t need to reapply before curling with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Flat ironing makes it look too flat</li>
            <li> The product seems like a liquid, but when it \\&quot;lands\\&quot;: it turns into a gel--and you do not want to flat iron your hair with greasy gel on it.</li>
            <li> The first pump always comes out as a thick clump.</li>
            <li> so if you spray directly it will weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> It smooths and gives shine to the hair as I low dry or straighten.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have necessarily frizzy hair, I have oily riots and medium dry ends.</li>
            <li> I barely use any other styling products with this.</li>
            <li> I was especially careful to coat this product at the ends of my hair, and they almost look completely repaired!  </li>
            <li> but I know that I don&#x27;t need to use direct heat such as the blow dryer or flat iron excessively.</li>
            <li> , it feel like it leaves a film on my hair as I dry it and leaves my hair &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; even after it&#x27;s been flat ironed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make my hair extra oily, but it is a little but oiler the next day compared to if I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I think part of it is because it also works as a detangler (definitely spray on wet hair before brushing).</li>
            <li> one that works, isn&#x27;t too heavy feeling or greasy feeling, makes my hair soft and controls the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and lots of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cream formula so it doesn&#x27;t really belong in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I put this on clients with long hair too to help de-tangle and it works like a charm-worth the $$ for that quality alone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair without it.</li>
            <li> I use this on the dry ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> and work it into the ends of my shoulder-length, salon-colored bob, then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I use this product after I towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair look&#x27;s dry on the end&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I had Google  what would help dry end&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I expected some fabulous scent, but it&#x27;s just mediocre</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed some frizziness if I don&#x27;t blow dry immediately after applying.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten it every day.</li>
            <li> but I do use a curling iron now and than I have noticed the damage it has done with this Thermal Protectant spray my hair has less breakage and is not dry .I</li>
            <li> I only use about 5-6 small pumps on my shoulder-length, chemically-treated blonde hair to apply by hand, so I think this may extend the life of my product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thin, and straight.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that my slow-to-grow locks will pick up the pace a little now that the heat styling isn&#x27;t doing daily damage!</li>
            <li> Shaking the bottle several times helps a little, but i should not have to do this considering the price I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> but everytime I went to the salon they had to cut more of my hair off because it was so bad.</li>
            <li> I really do not like it.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no comparison to drug store brands...</li>
            <li> That &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; aspect of the product is of minimal concern to me, however.</li>
            <li> I knocked of a star because the application is a drag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my second bottle and fully plan on continuing to use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I use a flat iron everyday, and do not trust my hair to anything else since I have found this.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin, curly and when it&#x27;s even slightly humid, becomes very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> do use other Alterna products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other oils (Kerastase) and thermal blowout sprays (</li>
            <li> Bamboo also works well with other products that boost volume.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> It has extremely helped my hair.</li>
            <li> that with any other product that I&#x27;ve used without even adding anything else to the hair.</li>
            <li> and so my hair was extremely damaged.</li>
            <li> It seems to leave my hair a bit stiff and not soft.</li>
            <li> I think this bottle will last me at least 6 plus months.</li>
            <li> It is a spray pump, but it&#x27;s thick and comes out almost like a white foam.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and use a blow dryer with a difusser almost daily.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t create the greasy head look, or weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or feel sticky at all.</li>
            <li> It makes me hair frizzy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I like how it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This product protects against the damaging effects of heat without leaving the hair weighed down.</li>
            <li> It smooths my hair without weighting down the volume ...</li>
            <li> Use once your hair is half dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is 90% less hair in my brush each month.</li>
            <li> I think it does, and my hair seems less damaged now that I&#x27;ve used the product 3 times</li>
            <li> This has a lotion consistency that I found quite odd for a spray mechanism.</li>
            <li> Finally a thermal protectant that actually works, doesn&#x27;t smell weird, and doesn&#x27;t change the texture of your hair.</li>
            <li> I am French, Irish, Scotch, Dutch, Welch and Native American and I have thick wavy hair that frizzes like crazy in humidity</li>
            <li> I did a blow out with a hairdryer and a brush, did a little back-comb lift at the crown, then heat styled with a ceramic iron.  </li>
            <li> It hadn&#x27;t really been cutting it, so I purchased this product from Sephora.</li>
            <li> This dried my hair out</li>
            <li> They resolved this by pumping a few squirts into their hand and applying by hand, so this is what I did and it worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky, and not to heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid issue and before meds I lost a lot of my hair and it dried out.</li>
            <li> Its just sitting in my bathroom and every time I look at it I see wasted money.</li>
            <li> so I switched to using the conair rotating round brush and</li>
            <li> i pulled out like half of it!</li>
            <li> and this helped tame it a bit.  </li>
            <li> My stylist added a small amount of this stuff to my hair and immediately i noticed no more frizziness.</li>
            <li> Wanted to switch up my usual hair products</li>
            <li> Usually I get a lot of frizz and flyaways, but not with this product.  </li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;A small drop of this miricle product and no more frizz!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to flowers and the scent is so strong it gives me a horrible headache.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time spraying it.  </li>
            <li> Icky, sticky, filmy and made my hair greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Also, it isn&#x27;t a spray, it&#x27;s a pump that pumps out a slightly thick product.  </li>
            <li> I have course, thick hair and this detangles and smooths my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick creamy product</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> also ,they are a little expensive</li>
            <li> The packaging was not good.</li>
            <li> Not a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> My hair does not look unhealthy</li>
            <li> Not happy and would like to return it.</li>
            <li> So far very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Invest in the health of your hair, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical of hair products because I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical because heat is heat</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t style it that often in the summer, so I will wait to see what happens as cold weather hits</li>
            <li> Trust me, I took that tip from another reviewer and it saved me a bad hair day.</li>
            <li> I will update if I find I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the packaging!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in quality of product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product and smells great.</li>
            <li> Loved it.... Great price</li>
            <li> I really do not like it.  It makes my hair feel greasy and the pump does not spray properly.This is just my opinion ... I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, I apply prior to blow drying and it makes my hair very soft. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I guess it wasn&#x27;t enough protein for my fine hair texture my hair startd to break off, so I threw the product out.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims! Great for frizzy ends and protecting from blow drying and hot iron damage. One of the best products I have used!</li>
            <li> Since I just bought it and haven&#x27;t had enough time to see results yet, I am rating it 5 stars because it smells good so that&#x27;s always a plus.... Lol I&#x27;ll update within a few weeks to see if I notice any changes. *Fingers Crossed*</li>
            <li> Since I started using the Anti-Breakage Thermal Protectant, my hair has fewer split ends and looks softer and silkier. It seems to really be protecting my hair from too much heat damage. I love it.</li>
            <li> This spay on conditioner and protector I originally purchased at my high end salon.  Love the product and now order thru Amazon at an amazing savings</li>
            <li> This stuff does everything everyone said it would do. It protects your hair, it makes it soft as hell and it smells really good. Use once your hair is half dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have greasy hair, DO NOT use more than 1-2 spritzes. Spray into your palms first, then work through your tips. If you use this product on your roots or the crown of your hair....or if you use too much....it WILL cause excess oil. Its a very concentrated serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, its awesome and has lasted me awhile!</li>
            <li> I love this product. There is 90% less hair in my brush each month. I think part of it is because it also works as a detangler (definitely spray on wet hair before brushing). I have semi fine, light blond (colored) long hair. This product doesn&#x27;t create the greasy head look, or weight my hair down. The smell could be improved (a bit herby), but it does fade over time. I use this with Loreal Serie Expert Absolut Repair (see my review on this product), so they may be working together to get this effect.</li>
            <li> This dried my hair out but I didn&#x27;t notice any breakage. I don&#x27;t think its worth it to have heat protection that makes your hair look like garbage :-/</li>
            <li> After using Alterna shampoo and conditioner with great results, I went in search of something to protect my hair from the heat of blow drying and flat ironing every day. My hair is very fine and prone to damage and this product really seems to have helped its resilience. I prefer to spray this onto my hands and then run my hands through my hair as the product is a bit more thick. Overall, excellent for protecting against heat.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Sephora after reading reviews on their website, so I already was aware that if you spray this directly onto your hair, you might end up with a greasy, weighed-down &#x27;do.  Other reviewers had mentioned that the product was excellent but the packaging (i.e. the nozzle) was not up to par.  They resolved this by pumping a few squirts into their hand and applying by hand, so this is what I did and it worked like a charm.  I only use about 5-6 small pumps on my shoulder-length, chemically-treated blonde hair to apply by hand, so I think this may extend the life of my product as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, my hair had been feeling dry and the ends were becoming brittle from my everyday heat styling.  I applied John Frieda Lux Volume Root Booster &amp; Living Proof Full Thickening Mousse as I normally do, then applied this product BY HAND, as noted above (it smells AWESOME, btw!).  I did a blow out with a hairdryer and a brush, did a little back-comb lift at the crown, then heat styled with a ceramic iron.  When I was finished, I was WOWED.  My hair looked SO shiny and healthy and was so soft, without loss of volume.  It did not feel greasy at all.  I was especially careful to coat this product at the ends of my hair, and they almost look completely repaired!  I am amazed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly do not think my hair could look better and you would never know how many hair-damaging rituals I do to this head of hair by looking at it.  I mean, you would think all this heat-styling (blow dry every other day but iron pretty much 6 days/week) as well as the highlighting would leave my hair a hot mess, right?  Not anymore!  This product is staying in my arsenal.  I am hoping that my slow-to-grow locks will pick up the pace a little now that the heat styling isn&#x27;t doing daily damage!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and weightless. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love Alterna  hair products I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair  but I do use a curling iron now and than I have noticed the damage it has done with this Thermal Protectant spray my hair has less breakage and is not dry .I do use other Alterna products also ,they are a little expensive but they really work .I will add this is more a cream than a spray therefore I put it on my hand than rub it in my hair so I can control the amount I use. I hope they never stop making these great products.</li>
            <li> I did a peek-a-boo hair coloring and I had to bleach my hair first. Once the color wore out the bleached hair was just a pain. It was always always always tangled and knotted and anytime i tried to brush it i pulled out like half of it! My stylist recommended this for me and the problem was like instantly gone. I was very impressed. I love that you can spray it like hair spray or spray into your palm for a cream like application. and it smells good!</li>
            <li> I really love Alterna products, and this one especially is good. The spray is easy to manage and smells fantastic, as well as protects your hair from styling tools. The only reason I give this a 4 is bc I prefer the cream to the spray version of this thermal protectant.</li>
            <li> Definitely spray into your hands, rub them together, and run fingers through your hair. Glad I read that on other reviews beforehand. It is thick so sprays out a bit clumpy, but smoothes hair very nicely and smells wonderful. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair without it.</li>
            <li> Can be sticky if it&#x27;s not used correctly. However, it did help to minimize split ends.</li>
            <li> Great. I saw many reviews stating that its easy to over apply, or can be a little heavy or greasy side. I found it to work easily and perfectly. I do have longer hair that is definitely on the thick fuller side, so if anything this product aided and worked beyond what I have previously experienced with other heat protectants to have worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this heat protectant spray based solely on the great reviews &amp; high rating, because I&#x27;ve never even heard of this brand before. I straighten/style my hair about every 2-3 days.. And I use high heat. So far, so good. And it has a good smell too.. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does protect your hair from thermal damage and keep the hair in that shape. It&#x27;s not sticky, and not to heavy on your hair. I was trying to burn with the match stick some of the hair from my hairbrush and it would not burn.:)) I have very very light blond hair and I used it with my curling irons or my straightener iron. My hair is not damaged. It&#x27;s my 4th purchase and will buy again when this product finishes.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this and I really like it. I would have given 5 stars, but sometimes with my fine hair it moisturizes too much, and makes my hair look oily. Other than that, it seems to really protect my hair from the heat of blow drying and straightening. I like a more naturally made product and that is why I chose this.</li>
            <li> This is so nice. It has a nice scent and really does seem to keep my hair in better condition during the weeks I choose to style my hair (mostly with curling irons).  I don&#x27;t style it that often in the summer, so I will wait to see what happens as cold weather hits and I pull out the hairdryer every day.  I will update if I find I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist, and I see such damaged hair everyday-by looking in the mirror! Also on my clients :) Not only did this protect my hair from heat damage, it made it feel softer and healthier from chemical damage too. I put this on clients with long hair too to help de-tangle and it works like a charm-worth the $$ for that quality alone! It smells great too. A lot of Alterna products smell kind of...spicy and musky, but this doesn&#x27;t. The smell is pleasant, and all of my clients love it!</li>
            <li> I first found about this product while I was at the hair salon. My hair is super frizzy. My stylist added a small amount of this stuff to my hair and immediately i noticed no more frizziness. I had to buy it. As for the heat protectant, i dont have many split ends and its been 5 months since my cut. But i limit my hair straightening to no more than 3 days a week, and I also soak my hair in hot coconut oil once a week.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous to use right before you straighten your hair.  Really helps seal the ends to lay flat.</li>
            <li> I did not have to pay for mine but I would! I won it from Allure magazine and fell in love. It smells great and feels so light but works really well. I am French, Irish, Scotch, Dutch, Welch and Native American and I have thick wavy hair that frizzes like crazy in humidity so I could use this stuff as a leave in on damp hair and it would dry kind of beachy looking but very tamed considering the alternative which is big crazy hair. I love this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got this yesterday, tried it out this morning.  I love Alterna Bamboo products, but this one I&#x27;m not sure about.  It is a spray pump, but it&#x27;s thick and comes out almost like a white foam.  I had a hard time spraying it.  I don&#x27;t see how it would evenly spray direcly on your hair, so I sprayed some in my hand and finger-combed it through my hair.  I have naturally curly hair that explodes into frizz in no time and this helped tame it a bit.  It&#x27;s not as good as the UV+ product I also have by Alterna, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I use this on the dry ends of my hair.  It makes my hair look shiny and healthy. I just squirt a tiny bit in the palm of my hand and use it on the bottom of my hair. A little goes a long way.  It also smells good.  I would not use it for my whole head because ALTERNA  weighs the hair down somewhat.</li>
            <li> So many others I like better - one that&#x27;s even cheaper. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. The spray pump doesn&#x27;t work well at all. The product doesn&#x27;t smell very good. I&#x27;ve had other oils (Kerastase) and thermal blowout sprays (Oribe, Miracle 7) that work so much better than this.</li>
            <li> I like Alterna products, but this one works okay, it feel like it leaves a film on my hair as I dry it and leaves my hair &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; even after it&#x27;s been flat ironed.</li>
            <li> Fast service and great product!</li>
            <li> Amazing heat protectant. It is helping my hair when I have to iron once per week.</li>
            <li> i am forever searching for the perfect heat styling product. one that works, isn&#x27;t too heavy feeling or greasy feeling, makes my hair soft and controls the frizz. this product does everything i need and want. it&#x27;s one of the few things i have purchased more than once.</li>
            <li> Blended smoothly through my damp hair and made it light and soft while blow drying. Didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or feel sticky at all. I have really long hair and lots of it and this product works perfectly for me. The spritzer is really fine and comes out nice. The smell is really pleasant also</li>
            <li> It seems to leave my hair a bit stiff and not soft.</li>
            <li> I blow-dry and flat-iron my hair 3 times a week so wanted something that would protect it from the heat. This stuff seems to work pretty well and it smells good.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue or anything like that. I like it.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair smooth no Frizies after blow drying love this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it actually helps with breakage but it does seem to make the hair soft.  Also, it isn&#x27;t a spray, it&#x27;s a pump that pumps out a slightly thick product.  I squirt this into my hand along with the Alterna Bamboo UV+ Fade Proof Fluide Spray (which also isn&#x27;t a spray!) and work it into the ends of my shoulder-length, salon-colored bob, then blow dry.  I only use about 3 or 4 squirts of each and rub them together before applying and my hair seems silky and shiny.  I only gave it 3 stars because I really don&#x27;t know for sure if it&#x27;s doing what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I use Alterna Smooth thermal spray every other day. It has done wonders on my hair. I use this product after I towel dry my hair. It leaves my hair soft and protects it when I style it with a hair with a hair curler and other heated tools. My hair use to get so damaged with styling it with hot tool and now it doesn&#x27;t as much. This product also doubled to me as a de-tangler. I will use this and recommend it to people.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, curly and when it&#x27;s even slightly humid, becomes very frizzy.  As and as long as I cover the roots at the top of my hair before spraying, my hair stays smooth and shiny even when it&#x27;s raining.  Bamboo also works well with other products that boost volume.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely!! Sometimes I apply it to my hair just to have a lovely, light scent.  I put it in my hair after towel drying, and it applies thoroughly and does not leave any residue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED:  I also wanted to add that I chose this product because it was FREE of sulfates, parabens, phthalates, gluten, sodium chloride, and synthetic colors.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I wash my hair....makes it smooth and manageable. My hairdress suggested it.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debbie</li>
            <li> I love Alternaproducts, and decided to give this a try after being over processed and struggling with frizz and dry ends. This is amazing for a simple blowout.my hair is smooth shiny and protected with very little product. I barely use any other styling products with this. 1 month of daily use, I have long hair that is fine but lots of hair. I think this bottle will last me at least 6 plus months.</li>
            <li> I have low porosity, 3a/3b hair and I have been using this product for a while now and I have to say it will always be a staple item to use on my hair. Leaves my hair feeling soft and helps detangle when used on freshly washed-wet hair. Not to mention the protection it gives when usin heat; my hair feel great even after flat ironing it.  I recommend this 100%.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this stuff smells let&#x27;s start there. Otherwise, I was finding that on the days I forgot to use it that my hair was much softer and shinier. It&#x27;s a thick cream formula so it doesn&#x27;t really belong in a spray bottle. It just kind of squirts out thick all over the place and mostly all falls on the floor (making it very slippery and dangerous). It makes me hair frizzy and weighed down. I&#x27;ve used aerosol products before and those are much better.</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.  It has a great smell and as far as I can tell it&#x27;s doing the job!</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough good things about this product! I&#x27;m always looking for a thermal protectant for blow drying and straightening and this takes care of both. I agree with previous comments - spray into your hands first then distribute throughout hair. It leaves hair shiny and glossy and protects from any heat tools.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Alterna products before, having worked in salons for years. Wanted to switch up my usual hair products and I found that I really love it! It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. My hair feels soft, but not too soft to style it. Highly recommend for protecting your hair from blow drying, flat ironing or curling.</li>
            <li> Product as described fast shipment does great job protecting my hair from heat damage</li>
            <li> I love Alterna Bamboo Smooth Anti-Breakage Thermal Spray.  It is awesome.  It is so good to your hair.  My hair used to break very easily.  I use a flat iron on it and also occasional hot rollers.  Also, I have highlights.  My hair is naturally curly and can get very frizzy.  I use this spray before blow drying my hair and again while flat ironing it or curling it.  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot.  It has no smell whatsoever so that&#x27;s good.  After using this product, the condition of my hair is so good.  I have also switched to DermOrganics shampoo and conditioning masque.  This has all made a HUGE difference to my hair.  I went from course, frizz, pouf  hair, to smooth, silky hair.  It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s not mine.  But it IS!  I love this and plan on buying it again and again.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it truly worked. The packaging was not good. They had the top that doesseem to fit tapped on poorly. But I do like the fact that it is a mist which makes it easy to apply to the hair.</li>
            <li> Great product. Bought this at the salon I go to and it was 26.00$ Saw it on Amazon and bought 3 for almost the price of one. Great product. I have a thyroid issue and before meds I lost a lot of my hair and it dried out. With the help of bamboo it is coming back to life.</li>
            <li> I like it because it does what is says it should do, when the squirt works.  What I don&#x27;t like of it is that that liquid thickens in the bottle clogging the spray mechanism causing to pump several times before anything comes out.  Shaking the bottle several times helps a little, but i should not have to do this considering the price I paid for it.  But when you get some on your hair, it does works well.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair on a daily basis.  This prevents it from ruining and burning my hair. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Came unwrapped and without top.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Product arrive without the lid.  Pump seems to still work however.</li>
            <li> WOW.  I first bought this on QVC and loved it.  They haven&#x27;t had it for awhile.  I was happy to see that Amazon had it and ordered it immediately.  Great product!  I have short hair and it works well with the blow dryer.  I will be ordering it from Amazon from now on as it was cheaper than QVC.</li>
            <li> Worth every dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best protectant product I have used. I even have my hairstylist using it and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does protect my hair, and smells great too!</li>
            <li> Frizzies be gone!  A little prciey but the best product on the market for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use a Flat Iron so often my hair is bone dry.&lt;br /&gt;A small drop of this miricle product and no more frizz!</li>
            <li> I bought this because the other heat protector product (Living Proof brand) has some dubious chemicals in it that I decided I don&#x27;t want to have on my hair...think about how you end up breathing the vapors of a product when you blow dry your hair, and how important it is to not breathe the chemicals...but my hair is pretty damaged and I was hoping this more natural product would come even close to the Living Proof.  I think it does, and my hair seems less damaged now that I&#x27;ve used the product 3 times (I only wash my long, highlighted hair every 6 days).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new thermal spray and decided to try this based on other good reviews.  My hair does feel softer and smoother after using it.  That being said, if you are looking for a spray on product like I was then don&#x27;t buy this.  It&#x27;s basically a lotion in a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; bottle so you have to squirt it in your hands and then apply to hair.  The scent is strong out of the bottle but much less noticeable after its in my hair, which I was grateful for.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so easy to comb out, I have very long hair &amp; it tangles so much after I wash it. Works great</li>
            <li> This product works great and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to flowers and the scent is so strong it gives me a horrible headache. Why do companies feel the need to add fragrance to everything.</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome if you use a lot of heat.  Smells good and makes your hair nice, soft and strong!</li>
            <li> Delivered fast. GREAT product! Makes my hair soft, not tacky. Smells good. Seems to be protecting my hair from heat.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of the reviews but this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in quality of product. It leaves quite a bit of residue. Not a great fragrance. Definitely not the product I was hoping it would be</li>
            <li> This is fantastic stuff.  The nozzle gets clogged up and you have to scrape it to keep it in top condition, but it is easy to do and keeps this pumping well.  I have a lot of allergies to hair products, but this has been no problem at all.</li>
            <li> My hair look&#x27;s dry on the end&#x27;s. I had Google  what would help dry end&#x27;s and this is how I found out about Alterna Bamboo. I love this product and I will keep on using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably NOT breaking anymore.  This spray protects my hair from the iron, it has definitely helped stop the breakage.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well.  I have to be careful how much I use as I have fine hair and too much would weigh it down.  Otherwise, it seems good.</li>
            <li> i bought this product strictly on the reviews I read - to my surprise I have throughly enjoyed this product - I have very curly hair &amp; was looking for something that didn&#x27;t weight my hair down or dry it out when I straightened it - I loved this product</li>
            <li> love this for my hair.  really helps with frizz and to control damage from the flatiron and the hair dryer</li>
            <li> It trukly works, my hair does not get heat damage from blowdrying and using the flat iron. i really like it. i recomend it.</li>
            <li> This spray comes out in a stream and can&#x27;t be used. I am sure it&#x27;s a faulty sprayer.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best, don&#x27;t think, just buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  I have course, thick hair and this detangles and smooths my hair.  Love love love the smell it leaves in my hair.  I am now going to switch to more of the Alterna products.  Also received before estimated arrival date and taped up in the box to prevent leakage!!!!  Will order from them again!  Awesome!!</li>
            <li> I love this heat spray..</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on other reviews. So far it&#x27;s ok. Nothing great. I expected some fabulous scent, but it&#x27;s just mediocre and I&#x27;ve noticed some frizziness if I don&#x27;t blow dry immediately after applying.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for breakage.  It has extremely helped my hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly  recommend this product.My friend recommend me to try this out!It is sulfate free and natural smelling miracle in the bottle.Seriously.I have damaged,dry,hard  and bleached hair so i try to take care of them as much as i can.I tried Joico smoothing serum,Loreal professional,Moroccan oil,Organix ,Paul Mitchel Super skinny serum,Lanza,Aveda and finally came to this one.Alterna beats all of them-it made my hair silky and shiny  shortly after application.It just made wonder with my hair.Blow dry now its much easier and hair seems to be light and protected.100 % recommend this product!!!Thanks to Alterna</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky, definitely a lotion consistency. After reading the reviews, I went ahead and sprayed it directly on my hands and rub it in then apply it to my hair in sections. My hair was soft and I flat iron with ease. As for protection, I had split ends prior to using, so I had to clip them after i straighten my hair. The jury is still out on that, but I do feel it protects because my hair was smooth even with my raggedy ends. The smell is great too, not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> This has a lotion consistency that I found quite odd for a spray mechanism. I was looking for a normal spray like feel. This is going to work well if you rather spray it on your palms and then rub it onto your hair. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with it. I think I bought it at the store but I always like to contribute reviews here. Hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of this product.  I use a flat iron everyday, and do not trust my hair to anything else since I have found this.  My hair is left smooth, shiney and has a great texture after using this, with no worries of damage.  You will LOVE the fragrance so much, you will be tempted to use it as a body spray!!  There is absolutely no comparison to drug store brands...I have tried them all.  Invest in the health of your hair, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My hair was literally gliding on the brush while I was blowdrying it.  I have curly hair, that is damaged from coloring and over processing.  Usually I get a lot of frizz and flyaways, but not with this product.  You cannot spray this...it&#x27;s a cream that comes out of the pump.  I love it.  It left my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I like how it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I have thick, curly hair and use a blow dryer with a difusser almost daily. This helps my ends from looking frazzled too!</li>
            <li> Simply Amazing! Alone it was great but when I mix it with a serum like CHI&#x27;s Argan plus Moringa Oil or any other serum, it works even better. It smooths and gives shine to the hair as I low dry or straighten. I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t want to ever run out of it.</li>
            <li> Finally a thermal protectant that actually works, doesn&#x27;t smell weird, and doesn&#x27;t change the texture of your hair. I have very fine hair, and everything I&#x27;ve tried previously leaves a greasy looking residue or makes my hair feel rough and strange. My hair dresser noticed the difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been skeptical of hair products because I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything. I saw that this was rated high on the Ulta website, so I though it was worth a try. It smells nice and a little bit goes a long way. It kept my hair very soft for two full day and my hair was less frizzy. Blow drying seemed easier as well.</li>
            <li> Although I no longer use it (trying to avoid heat tools), It was a great product for my hair...it moisturized and protected...</li>
            <li> I love Alterna products.  This product protects against the damaging effects of heat without leaving the hair weighed down.</li>
            <li> I cant stand girls who give ditzy reviews that detract from what the product is intended to do, which in this case is protect from heat.  The truth is I can&#x27;t speak for the heat...Sorry. But what I can say is that this product smells heavenly, and does a great job at moisturizing the ends of hair. Its not greasy but its true you should spray about 3-4 pumps in your hand then rub into ends before blowing or flat ironing your hair. In checking the back of the bottle, it really is made of all the right quality, non-greasy moisturizing ingredients.  My hair does not look unhealthy but I know that I don&#x27;t need to use direct heat such as the blow dryer or flat iron excessively. I need a few more months (at least one more trim cycle) and to actively monitory my split end progression between trims to confidently speak on whether or not this product really prevents heat damage. I&#x27;m skeptical because heat is heat-there is no way around it. Using direct heat is going to cause some damage. For this reason I will take away one star- I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a miracle worker, but wouldn&#x27;t discourage you from giving it a try. However, I do feel based upon the reputation and abundance of positive reviews that if there were some type of heat protection this is one of the best products on the market.  Either way. This stuff smells amazing. Full of awesome ingredients, lasts quite a while, and I will keep using it for keeping my hair supple and full of moisture.  Hope that is helpful.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. It makes my hair soft and adds shine. Some reviews saying that &amp;#34;the formula is too tick and sticky&amp;#34;, I disagree. I think that it&#x27;s great, smells nice, you just need to shake well before you apply</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thermal protectant, but it left my hair feeling kinda greasy</li>
            <li> Works well and smells great!  Does not leave my hair greasy in the slightest.  More natural/safe than most conventional heat protectants on the market.  Worth the money, very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I&#x27;ve compared blow drying with and without it. I don&#x27;t have necessarily frizzy hair, I have oily riots and medium dry ends. When I didn&#x27;t use it, my hair was frizzed and obviously affected from the heat. With it, it was not weighed down, healthy looking and smooth. Plus it smells great. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily make my hair extra oily, but it is a little but oiler the next day compared to if I didn&#x27;t use it. Not much, and well worth the visible protection it&#x27;s giving. Honestly I wouldn&#x27;t expect to put product in my hair and not have some very slight residual.</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair in a chin length bob and this really protects it from heat styling without weighing it down. I put about 6 squirts on before drying and don&#x27;t need to reapply before curling with a flat iron. Can&#x27;t recommend enough - it does a fantastic job and the bottle last for months.</li>
            <li> I blowdry and straighten (GHD) my hair every day, and have had a lot of damage/breakage. I&#x27;d been using CHI Silk Infusion as my thermal protectant. It hadn&#x27;t really been cutting it, so I purchased this product from Sephora. I&#x27;m also using the Bamboo color protectant shampoo and conditioner (my hair isn&#x27;t dyed, but it still makes my hair look really nice). I&#x27;m not sure which product is working magic, but my hair is shinier and healthier than it has been in at least a year. I have really fine hair that can look greasy if I use too much product in it, but this stuff is just fine for it. Also, it smells awesome. If you&#x27;re putting heat on your hair every day, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product for hair protection.</li>
            <li> Sticky and makes clean hair greasy. Its just sitting in my bathroom and every time I look at it I see wasted money. Not happy and would like to return it.</li>
            <li> Works great, but I do recommend spraying into your hand and not directly into hair. It&#x27;s a thick creamy product so if you spray directly it will weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I am head over heels about this product! Makes hair stronger, detangles and smells absolutely wonderful! :)&lt;br /&gt;Two pony-tails up.</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged bc I blow dry and straighten it every day. This has repaired my hair and it has never looked better! I also use the bamboo anti frizz or shine shampoo and conditioner. I rarely use anything but natural products on mine and my daughters hair so the products fits right in!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product for my hair! I use it all the time, it help with the freeze a lot. I apply it while I&#x27;m blow drying my hair and then style it.</li>
            <li> I agree with posts below -- this isn&#x27;t very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; feeling considering company marketing. It does feel like their is some silicone in the product. That &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; aspect of the product is of minimal concern to me, however. Especially since I am frying my hair, which is why I need heat protectant in the first place. As far as heat protection goes, this product is superb. My hair literally feels silky after blowdrying or curling. I knocked of a star because the application is a drag. The first pump always comes out as a thick clump. To avoid having that directly on one section of your hair, spray into your palm first and apply after spreading it out in your hands. Trust me, I took that tip from another reviewer and it saved me a bad hair day.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that gets frizzy in the humid weather. Flat ironing makes it look too flat so I switched to using the conair rotating round brush and this spray work just amazing!!!! It smooths my hair without weighting down the volume ... and I have A LOT of hair. Hair stays smooth and frizz free for way longer that with any other product that I&#x27;ve used without even adding anything else to the hair. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it works so it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> My hair almost feels more dried out after I use it.</li>
            <li> Has helped my hair with breakage after the first use, just make sure not to over do it or your hair will get oily.</li>
            <li> I support Alterna Bamboo and normally love their products, but I feel like it makes my hair stick together slightly. Really only works well if your hair is straight, because it is too heavy for waves or light curls.</li>
            <li> i use it every time i wash my hair. makes my hair soft and ready to be straightened. i have bought 2 now. i have processed hair and it really helps protect it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, will definitely purchase again! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and my blow out is very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> i just starting using this product and i think it works well and it smells great... but it squirts out in more of a gel/cream consistency than a spray. not what i was expecting, but its not a big problem</li>
            <li> Love this product, it is fabulous fir my hair, i use it with each shampoo, it is a great value for me.</li>
            <li> WOW!  Did you know that Gluten is found in many different products that you use every day??? This may not matter to many, however, if you have an allergy to Gluten like I do, this information is of mega importance!  Alterna is one of the very few companies who&#x27;s entire product line is Gluten Free!  I started using their line and stopped using another line that contained gluten (unbeknownst to me) and guess what - My hair started growing like a weed!!!  This spray is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product works, but causes flakes!</li>
            <li> Love this to smooth hair and protect from the heat.</li>
            <li> I love this detangler.  It&#x27;s much better than even Aveda.  It&#x27;s my personal favorite.  I was hesitant to try it but after one use, i was hooked.</li>
            <li> Helps, when emulsified with water in my hand, to smooth and tame my curly hair.  Have had no trouble with the spraying function.</li>
            <li> Icky, sticky, filmy and made my hair greasy by the end of the day. Smells good, not sure if it protects. My hair has never been dirtier!</li>
            <li> I literally just received this and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the packaging!  1st of all there was no pump cover to stop leaks, but I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first because I thought maybe it has a foil closure under the pump. So I unscrewed the pump and low and behold No Foil Seal! I&#x27;m scared to even try this product for fear of product tampering! This stuff isn&#x27;t cheap,  especially for the amount you receive, so I cam even review how the product actually performs. So far very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this product, will definitely purchase again! It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and my blow out is very shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Of course it will smooth your hair if it has dimethicone in it! I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t notice that before I purchased it. That being said, I did go ahead and try it. My hair did feel smooth and resilient even after flat-ironing. I would recommend using a very light hand with this product and holding it about 12 inches away from your hair. The product seems like a liquid, but when it \\&quot;lands\\&quot;: it turns into a gel--and you do not want to flat iron your hair with greasy gel on it.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thin, and straight. I&#x27;m a natural blonde, but I love to dye my hair different colors and so my hair was extremely damaged. I was trying to grow it out longer but everytime I went to the salon they had to cut more of my hair off because it was so bad. I tried this product and love it! I use about 3 to 4 sprays everyday and my hair is soft, healthy, and easy to comb through. I can now grow my hair out again and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;m now on my second bottle and fully plan on continuing to use this everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a great value in my opinion for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of kinds from high end to medium range and this is definitely great for the value.</li>
