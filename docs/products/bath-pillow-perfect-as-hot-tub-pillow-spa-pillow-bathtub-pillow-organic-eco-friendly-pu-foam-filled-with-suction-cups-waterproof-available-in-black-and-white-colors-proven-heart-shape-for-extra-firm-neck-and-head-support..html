            <li>Great for water birth since I labored there for about 2 and 1/2 hrs.  </li>

            <li>Looks great, perfect fit!</li>
            <li>loved it great seller</li>
            <li>something happens to the one I already own!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many bath pillows before this one and I can honestly say none have worked well in the tub until this one!!!  </li>
            <li>In my pursuit of the More Perfect Bubble Bath, I decided to test out this Bathtub Pillow.</li>
            <li>kind of defeats the purpose of having a bath pillow to begin with!</li>
            <li>and they keep the pillow in a good position on my bath tub.</li>
            <li>For bath enthusiasts that like to relax or perhaps just sit up a bit and read a book, this is going to be the most incredible option to purchase.</li>
            <li>The bath pillow is well made, comfortable, and conforms perfectly to my tub.</li>
            <li>It gave good support for my neck</li>
            <li>Good curvature.  </li>
            <li>It was good</li>
            <li>Very satisfied</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I found this tub pillow.  </li>
            <li>Just remember it doesn&#x27;t have to stay on lip of tub as it is even more comfortable when you have it suctioned to side of tub!!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this...there were so many others that were more affordable that I considered, but it actually is perfect.</li>
            <li>More than needed!</li>
            <li>I love this bath pillow!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My head fit great in the curved groves, and it supports my neck well.  </li>
            <li>My routine has always included bath salts, candles and now, this amazing bathtub</li>
            <li>I had a bath pillow like this many years ago and loved it.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  </li>
            <li>and I can lay for a while and relax without any kind of discomfort.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t sit as nice as I&#x27;d like -</li>
            <li>I Received This Product At A Discount In Exchange For An Honest Review.</li>
            <li>, it may not work as effectively depending on the shape of your tub.  </li>
            <li>really keeps it perfectly in place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my own version of a spa day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and when I bought this item, I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>It gives you the feeling of being in a 5-star spa without paying the 5-star price -- because you&#x27;re in the privacy of your own house.</li>
            <li>I like the nice heart shape of this pillow.</li>

            <li>It also cleans very easily, as there are no nooks and crannies on</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning this pillow is also very easy.</li>
            <li>The suction cups are very strong.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with this product and would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li>This is a nice bathtub pillow because it is form fitting</li>
            <li>It offers the perfect support I need for my neck.</li>
            <li>my old one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems perfectly sized - it molds itself to adapt to the shape of my head.</li>
            <li>It stays right where you want it, and gives great support to your neck and head.  </li>
            <li>This pillow really did the trick, as it fit perfectly on my jacuzzi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me it is perfect, and if you like a harder pillow it will be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It was the perfect size, never lost its place {thanks to the suction cups}, and was incredibly COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li>Great product, perfect neck cradle, fast shipping, great communication with the seller, I would definitely recommend for anyone that enjoys the true relaxation of a bath.</li>
            <li>though this would also work great in a hot tub or spa</li>
            <li>I found it very comfortable and</li>
            <li>I find this to be a very comfortable bath pillow.</li>
            <li>Very Comfortable.</li>
            <li>This a very comfortable addition to a relaxing bath.  </li>
            <li>It seems the new wave of excellent YA novels often fit the bill</li>
            <li>would be better without that part.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I love it since the 1st time we used it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this pillow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this bath pillow.</li>
            <li>I personally love the feel of this &#x27;pillow&#x27; (which is more of a neck support).</li>
            <li>I love, aside from the feel and firmness,</li>
            <li>I do remember many of these types of pillows years ago, but they tended to be softer than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You attach it to your tub of choice via the three 1-1/2” suction cups on the reverse side.</li>
            <li>I moistened them so they would adhere better and wouldn’t slip.</li>
            <li>- it makes a bath so much more relaxing and comfortable!  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for a heart shaped pillow bought many years ago.</li>
            <li>We have a SAFE STEP walk-in tub.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re going to keep it because we cannot find a better solution.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>There are three suction cups, one for the top of the bath and two on the bottom to attach to the side of the tub.  </li>
            <li>The shape and suction cups on the back seemed perfect.</li>
            <li>Now I spend more time in the tub because of the comfort it gives me.</li>
            <li>It makes things so much better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I also find the heart shape adorable and it looks cute on the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since this one rests on the top of the tub, I&#x27;m able to just leave it there</li>
            <li>Since this one rests on the top of the tub, I&#x27;m able to just leave it there</li>
            <li>I love to relax in the bathtub</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase some more from here.</li>
            <li>and I had to put more air in it.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited when I was given the opportunity to review this product at a discount for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I like to take long baths and this pillow works perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use this pillow because it came with an extremely strong smell that reminds me of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I also saw many more that reported how comfortable it</li>
            <li>I can tell it will be easy to rinse off after each use and keep nice and clean.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both enjoy using it and find it to be very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Fine for some people I am sure</li>
            <li>Love this spa pillow, our tub is free standing and egg shaped but the suction cups keep it in place.  </li>
            <li>My baths have never been more relaxing and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable design in my opinion</li>
            <li>Sooo easy to clean also!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man that likes a good warm bath, and after a long day, it just has something iconic.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that the return process was easy</li>
            <li>Was easy to rest neck and relax.</li>
            <li>The bath pillow itself attaches easily with a bit of moisture and stays put even as the temperature of the bathroom changes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds on by suction cups which ended up being really easy to remove and apply.  </li>
            <li>It is strong, but dissipated when I used a baking soda and water soak for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as good as new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable, easy to use, and will change the way you think about taking a bath.</li>
            <li>It was also delivered really quick; 3 days!</li>
            <li>This pillow is made from organic PU foam and is super comfy!</li>
            <li>Also this pillow works best on a free stand tub and not your typical enclosed bath tub.</li>
            <li>The price is right, the quality is the highest, and its very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This one is comfortable and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>The heart shape is great because I sometimes get pains in my neck/back, and now I can actually sit comfortably in the bath for longer periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get as comfortable a position on it as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>It is so comfortable.</li>
            <li>surface material is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm and is the perfect size for my size</li>
            <li>is this is easy to keep clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li>A fantastic pillow for the bath that I wish I had sooner.</li>
            <li>Plus I really enjoy reading in the bath tub.</li>
            <li>It has a substantial weight to it and the surface is smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is so comfortable,  </li>
            <li>It has made my alone time that much more sacred to me because it is so rare and so needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering getting separate pillows for each bath for convenience and because they&#x27;re so comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is already molded to fit your neck and head for support.</li>
            <li>Its comfortable, its durable, and I look forward to soaking in the bath tub again.  </li>
            <li>She finds it comfortable and helps her relax while bathing.</li>
            <li>first inspection, it kind of feels like a really plump bicycle seat, and the heart shape is adorable.</li>
            <li>Once we were able to bet it in place, it was actually pretty comfortable and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>I would return it, but no longer have the original packaging.  </li>
            <li>Works great in my tub for relaxing after a long stressful day at work!</li>
            <li>Right size, no odor, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I got a promotional special on it</li>
            <li>Just the right size and it sticks!</li>
            <li>Very Good Quality, Not Cheaply Made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a bath pillow that is perfect for a spa tub.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I saw this pillow and thought it was exactly the same</li>
            <li>I loved the extra firmness in this.</li>
            <li>Never knew such a product existed and knew when offered in exchange of a fair review.</li>
            <li>It fits perfects, cradles my head and even feels good on my back when I am sitting up!</li>
            <li>I bought this pillow because I had one similar to it years ago and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>The design seems more suited for standalone tubs as shown in the product photo as with &amp;#34;alcove&amp;#34; tubs, as most of us have, only the lower set of suction cups will be against anything.</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>This NEW bath pillow works even better than</li>
            <li>But even if you simply like to lie back and bask in the bubbly splendor, the pillow will help make your bath a more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>Now I take an epsom salts and baking soda bath almost every weekend to calm my nerves.  </li>
            <li>but of course the air always leaked out and it really wasn&#x27;t that comfortable.</li>
            <li>Well after using for a few weeks, I&#x27;m happy to report that this one</li>
            <li>Great quality and shape, suction cups hold firmly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but so worth it.  </li>
            <li>house has a jacuzzi tub that I rarely get to use.</li>
            <li>I enjoy being able to take a bath without the nagging voice in the back of my head telling me that at any moment I could slip.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve, surprisingly, haven&#x27;t had a problem with it slipping off once.</li>
            <li>The pillow is very comfortable, supports the head &amp; neck well &amp; stays in place better than other pillows I have tried</li>
            <li>The outer skin is very smooth and the design has no sharp angles or crevices to house mold, which is a problem in my master bathroom.</li>
            <li>stains and dirt come right</li>
            <li>but this one is just the right size because it doesn&#x27;t cover any bubble holes.</li>
            <li>This particular one is orthopedic grade, eco-friendly, organic PU foam filled and 100% waterproof.</li>
            <li>loves it, nice to relax after a long day &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>i thought it was way too small, but I installed it and to my great pleasure, its not only very comfortable, but it stays put.  </li>
            <li>I just thought that I loved my claw foot bathtub, the Bael Wellness Bath Pillow definitely gives me the complete spa experience.</li>
            <li>Suction cups are soft and provide a strong grip.  </li>
            <li>After you use the pillow, it’s very easy to wipe down and keep clean with its nonporous surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ever since I was a little girl, I have loved to take baths.</li>
            <li>She uses it all the time to relax before bed, and her neck and back are more relaxed now because of the pillow.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my Bael Decor spa pillow; it&#x27;s one of the most practical things I&#x27;ve bought recently, and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It definitely increased how much I am able to relax in the tub while taking time away from my children.</li>
            <li>First, it smelled like a mildewed rag when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li>I love this pillow and it definitely gets 5 stars!</li>
            <li>which really counter acts the relaxation aspect of taking a bath!</li>
            <li>daughter volunteered to try it out in our second bathroom to make sure it worked just as well.</li>
            <li>In some of the tubs, the ridge may be too small or too big for the pillow to sit perfectly.</li>
            <li>Most bath pillows are too big for a spa tub</li>
            <li>I had a bath cushion for many years, an inflatable one shaped like a big clam shell.  </li>
            <li>I must confess, when I first saw it  </li>
            <li>Also look at the photo and make sure your tub curves on the back like the one in the photo.</li>
            <li>but you can use it either way (flip it around and find out if heart side up or heart side down is more comfortable to you as both work with varying areas of pressure/support) and you don&#x27;t have to use it at the lip of the tub like the picture shows.  </li>
            <li>the White Bael Bath Pillow was delivered fairly quickly, and my wife has been very busy enjoying her bubble baths in the tub with the pillow.</li>
            <li>I read many, many reviews, and saw where some customers reported that this cushion is too hard.  </li>
            <li>I heard about Bael Decor from a number of different people in various forums, and almost everyone had good things to say about them.</li>
            <li>its out of the water as it really on the top rim of the bathtub as opposed to the back like the inflatable ones are.  </li>
            <li>Would probably work better for someone long bodied, or a tall man.  </li>
            <li>Be prepared, this pillow is not soft but I love how it holds your neck and head straight</li>
            <li>The review sample that I received is the white model, so it&#x27;s easy to see if there is mold taking hold.</li>
            <li>There are suction cups on the back that make it easy to adhere to any bathtub-</li>
            <li>It has to have a certain substantial presence</li>
            <li>The material it is made with is also of a better quality than most other tub pillows on the market, which tend to suffer from flimsy suction and get flat.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; it&#x27;s the most rewarding job in the world!</li>
            <li>The Bael Wellness pillow is quite firm, but I found it comfortable as it fit my head well.</li>
            <li>It is already contoured to fit the neck and the heart-shaped pillow rests on the back of my tub ready to offer up neck support.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you takes baths!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Also note that the channel in which you rest your neck is straight - there is no curve.</li>
            <li>Very well made and packaged.</li>
            <li>Protected in bubble wraps, this is a very well durable pillow.</li>
            <li>Wife absolutely just loves it.</li>
            <li>I really like the pillow.  </li>
            <li>I add some essential oils, and lay back and enjoy the organic eco-friendly PU foam filled heart shaped pillow.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s so important for your sanity and creativity to have quiet moments that allow you to relax and regroup.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one if your in the market for a bath pillow!</li>
            <li>does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ridge at the part allows it to sit comfortably on the edge of the tub and while I have two different tubs in my house, it works well in both.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not only comfortable, but has been design to support the neck area while bathing.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth enough for them</li>
            <li>so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to make an optimum pillow to fit for all bath tubs</li>
            <li>It feels unnatural if I sit up high enough to get in a comfortable place for my head.  </li>
            <li>It is a little firm at first, which I actually liked since it provided a lot of neck support, and it was still comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s upside down, but it&#x27;s better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more relaxing to have it down the side of the tub</li>
            <li>I use towels for pillows but they don&#x27;t remain comfortable for very long.  </li>
            <li>I have a deep soaking tub, so a regular sized bath tub would work better.</li>
            <li>It is clearly made very well, and I think I will enjoy using it for a long time.</li>
            <li>get the least amount of rest and need it and deserve it the most!</li>
            <li>get the least amount of rest and need it and deserve it the most!</li>
            <li>This goes onto the upper back end of your bath tub &#x3D;&#x3D;try different places for best comfort, and attaches with little suction cups.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than the inflatable ones because they are not thick enough to support your neck, but do offer some support for your back.  </li>
            <li>It sits too high on the edge of the tub for my head.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s kind of my fault for ignoring the customer reports saying it was hard</li>
            <li>As an adult, it&#x27;s such a rarity that it really is a special treat.</li>
            <li>Tried a few bath pillows out and fell in love with this one.  </li>
            <li>It does need to sit on the edge somewhat to be able to stick, so make sure your tub ledge is a comfortable place for the base of your neck to rest.  </li>
            <li>For another, if you have a neck larger than what I stated above this may not be comfortable.</li>
            <li>The pillow is very soft but sturdy and holds my neck well.</li>
            <li>Well I was totally surprised to find that this pillow blew me away!</li>
            <li>Relaxation paid off with a short labor and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The pillow I received has two large suction cups on the back that you adhere to your tub.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The material is completely water proof, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb a bunch of water and get heavy/droopy.</li>
            <li>This bath pillow is firm but comfortable.  </li>
            <li>and it drip dries well and completely and hasn&#x27;t produced any smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moms</li>
            <li>and it drip dries well and completely and hasn&#x27;t produced any smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moms</li>
            <li>I love it and definitely plan on buying a few of these for some friends of mine!</li>
            <li>But that seems to be the key; sitting up high.  </li>
            <li>but I would not buy it at regular cost as its priced way to high.</li>
            <li>Thought about sending it back but decided I&#x27;d live with it.</li>
            <li>It is solid yet light, firm but comfortable..like an industrial spa pad.</li>
            <li>Firm enough to hold shape and soft enough to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s firm enough to support my head and neck but soft enough to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>I cannot see how this pillow (extremely hard foam) could be comfortable on any neck.</li>
            <li>Enter the Bael Wellness Bath Pillow, a hard foam (with smooth plastic covering --waterproof).  </li>
            <li>but if you have a sensitive head, this one can actually give you a headache.</li>
            <li>But also the most exhausting.</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t be too dry and scientific, but also not too light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>My wife, on the other hand, didn&#x27;t care for it as much and said it dug into her neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really tried using a bath pillow before, but I do like to take baths a decent amount, so I decided to check some out online.</li>
            <li>highly recommend giving it a try, there&#x27;s no real comparison when you want to relax and come out feeling like a million dollars.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a tub-reader like me , it&#x27;s definitely nice to have a firm support in place instead of leaning your neck back against a hard, slippery surface.</li>
            <li>It was well made but smaller than I expected and much more firm than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Please note the 4 star rating is because the suction cups are hard to secure unless your bathtub is DRY.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this over any other especially the inflatable ones.  </li>

            <li> something happens to the one I already own!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many bath pillows before this one and I can honestly say none have worked well in the tub until this one!!!  </li>
            <li> In my pursuit of the More Perfect Bubble Bath, I decided to test out this Bathtub Pillow.</li>
            <li> kind of defeats the purpose of having a bath pillow to begin with!</li>
            <li> and they keep the pillow in a good position on my bath tub.</li>
            <li> For bath enthusiasts that like to relax or perhaps just sit up a bit and read a book, this is going to be the most incredible option to purchase.</li>
            <li> The bath pillow is well made, comfortable, and conforms perfectly to my tub.</li>

            <li> and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I found this tub pillow.  </li>
            <li> Just remember it doesn&#x27;t have to stay on lip of tub as it is even more comfortable when you have it suctioned to side of tub!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this...there were so many others that were more affordable that I considered, but it actually is perfect.</li>
            <li> More than needed!</li>
            <li> I love this bath pillow!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>

            <li> I had a bath pillow like this many years ago and loved it.</li>

            <li> It stays right where you want it, and gives great support to your neck and head.  </li>
            <li> This pillow really did the trick, as it fit perfectly on my jacuzzi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me it is perfect, and if you like a harder pillow it will be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>

            <li> This a very comfortable addition to a relaxing bath.  </li>
            <li> It seems the new wave of excellent YA novels often fit the bill</li>
            <li> would be better without that part.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this bath pillow.</li>
            <li> I personally love the feel of this &#x27;pillow&#x27; (which is more of a neck support).</li>
            <li> I love, aside from the feel and firmness,</li>
            <li> I do remember many of these types of pillows years ago, but they tended to be softer than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You attach it to your tub of choice via the three 1-1/2” suction cups on the reverse side.</li>
            <li> I moistened them so they would adhere better and wouldn’t slip.</li>
            <li> - it makes a bath so much more relaxing and comfortable!  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a heart shaped pillow bought many years ago.</li>
            <li> We have a SAFE STEP walk-in tub.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re going to keep it because we cannot find a better solution.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> There are three suction cups, one for the top of the bath and two on the bottom to attach to the side of the tub.  </li>
            <li> The shape and suction cups on the back seemed perfect.</li>
            <li> Now I spend more time in the tub because of the comfort it gives me.</li>
            <li> It makes things so much better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> I love to relax in the bathtub</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase some more from here.</li>
            <li> and I had to put more air in it.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited when I was given the opportunity to review this product at a discount for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I like to take long baths and this pillow works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use this pillow because it came with an extremely strong smell that reminds me of nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I also saw many more that reported how comfortable it</li>
            <li> I can tell it will be easy to rinse off after each use and keep nice and clean.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both enjoy using it and find it to be very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Fine for some people I am sure</li>
            <li> Love this spa pillow, our tub is free standing and egg shaped but the suction cups keep it in place.  </li>
            <li> My baths have never been more relaxing and comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not the most comfortable design in my opinion</li>
            <li> Sooo easy to clean also!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man that likes a good warm bath, and after a long day, it just has something iconic.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that the return process was easy</li>
            <li> Was easy to rest neck and relax.</li>
            <li> The bath pillow itself attaches easily with a bit of moisture and stays put even as the temperature of the bathroom changes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds on by suction cups which ended up being really easy to remove and apply.  </li>
            <li> It is strong, but dissipated when I used a baking soda and water soak for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still as good as new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable, easy to use, and will change the way you think about taking a bath.</li>
            <li> It was also delivered really quick; 3 days!</li>
            <li> This pillow is made from organic PU foam and is super comfy!</li>
            <li> Also this pillow works best on a free stand tub and not your typical enclosed bath tub.</li>
            <li> The price is right, the quality is the highest, and its very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This one is comfortable and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The heart shape is great because I sometimes get pains in my neck/back, and now I can actually sit comfortably in the bath for longer periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get as comfortable a position on it as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> It is so comfortable.</li>
            <li> surface material is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firm and is the perfect size for my size</li>
            <li> is this is easy to keep clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li> A fantastic pillow for the bath that I wish I had sooner.</li>
            <li> Plus I really enjoy reading in the bath tub.</li>
            <li> It has a substantial weight to it and the surface is smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It is so comfortable,  </li>
            <li> It has made my alone time that much more sacred to me because it is so rare and so needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering getting separate pillows for each bath for convenience and because they&#x27;re so comfortable.</li>
            <li> It is already molded to fit your neck and head for support.</li>
            <li> Its comfortable, its durable, and I look forward to soaking in the bath tub again.  </li>
            <li> She finds it comfortable and helps her relax while bathing.</li>
            <li> first inspection, it kind of feels like a really plump bicycle seat, and the heart shape is adorable.</li>
            <li> Once we were able to bet it in place, it was actually pretty comfortable and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> I would return it, but no longer have the original packaging.  </li>
            <li> Works great in my tub for relaxing after a long stressful day at work!</li>
            <li> Right size, no odor, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I got a promotional special on it</li>
            <li> Just the right size and it sticks!</li>
            <li> Very Good Quality, Not Cheaply Made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a bath pillow that is perfect for a spa tub.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I saw this pillow and thought it was exactly the same</li>
            <li> I loved the extra firmness in this.</li>
            <li> Never knew such a product existed and knew when offered in exchange of a fair review.</li>
            <li> It fits perfects, cradles my head and even feels good on my back when I am sitting up!</li>
            <li> I bought this pillow because I had one similar to it years ago and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> The design seems more suited for standalone tubs as shown in the product photo as with &amp;#34;alcove&amp;#34; tubs, as most of us have, only the lower set of suction cups will be against anything.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This NEW bath pillow works even better than</li>
            <li> But even if you simply like to lie back and bask in the bubbly splendor, the pillow will help make your bath a more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Now I take an epsom salts and baking soda bath almost every weekend to calm my nerves.  </li>
            <li> but of course the air always leaked out and it really wasn&#x27;t that comfortable.</li>
            <li> Well after using for a few weeks, I&#x27;m happy to report that this one</li>
            <li> Great quality and shape, suction cups hold firmly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but so worth it.  </li>
            <li> house has a jacuzzi tub that I rarely get to use.</li>
            <li> I enjoy being able to take a bath without the nagging voice in the back of my head telling me that at any moment I could slip.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve, surprisingly, haven&#x27;t had a problem with it slipping off once.</li>
            <li> The pillow is very comfortable, supports the head &amp; neck well &amp; stays in place better than other pillows I have tried</li>
            <li> The outer skin is very smooth and the design has no sharp angles or crevices to house mold, which is a problem in my master bathroom.</li>
            <li> stains and dirt come right</li>
            <li> but this one is just the right size because it doesn&#x27;t cover any bubble holes.</li>
            <li> This particular one is orthopedic grade, eco-friendly, organic PU foam filled and 100% waterproof.</li>
            <li> loves it, nice to relax after a long day &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i thought it was way too small, but I installed it and to my great pleasure, its not only very comfortable, but it stays put.  </li>
            <li> I just thought that I loved my claw foot bathtub, the Bael Wellness Bath Pillow definitely gives me the complete spa experience.</li>
            <li> Suction cups are soft and provide a strong grip.  </li>
            <li> After you use the pillow, it’s very easy to wipe down and keep clean with its nonporous surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ever since I was a little girl, I have loved to take baths.</li>
            <li> She uses it all the time to relax before bed, and her neck and back are more relaxed now because of the pillow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my Bael Decor spa pillow; it&#x27;s one of the most practical things I&#x27;ve bought recently, and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It definitely increased how much I am able to relax in the tub while taking time away from my children.</li>
            <li> First, it smelled like a mildewed rag when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li> I love this pillow and it definitely gets 5 stars!</li>
            <li> which really counter acts the relaxation aspect of taking a bath!</li>
            <li> daughter volunteered to try it out in our second bathroom to make sure it worked just as well.</li>
            <li> In some of the tubs, the ridge may be too small or too big for the pillow to sit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Most bath pillows are too big for a spa tub</li>
            <li> I had a bath cushion for many years, an inflatable one shaped like a big clam shell.  </li>
            <li> I must confess, when I first saw it  </li>
            <li> Also look at the photo and make sure your tub curves on the back like the one in the photo.</li>
            <li> but you can use it either way (flip it around and find out if heart side up or heart side down is more comfortable to you as both work with varying areas of pressure/support) and you don&#x27;t have to use it at the lip of the tub like the picture shows.  </li>
            <li> the White Bael Bath Pillow was delivered fairly quickly, and my wife has been very busy enjoying her bubble baths in the tub with the pillow.</li>
            <li> I read many, many reviews, and saw where some customers reported that this cushion is too hard.  </li>
            <li> I heard about Bael Decor from a number of different people in various forums, and almost everyone had good things to say about them.</li>
            <li> its out of the water as it really on the top rim of the bathtub as opposed to the back like the inflatable ones are.  </li>
            <li> Would probably work better for someone long bodied, or a tall man.  </li>
            <li> Be prepared, this pillow is not soft but I love how it holds your neck and head straight</li>
            <li> The review sample that I received is the white model, so it&#x27;s easy to see if there is mold taking hold.</li>
            <li> There are suction cups on the back that make it easy to adhere to any bathtub-</li>
            <li> It has to have a certain substantial presence</li>
            <li> The material it is made with is also of a better quality than most other tub pillows on the market, which tend to suffer from flimsy suction and get flat.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong; it&#x27;s the most rewarding job in the world!</li>
            <li> The Bael Wellness pillow is quite firm, but I found it comfortable as it fit my head well.</li>
            <li> It is already contoured to fit the neck and the heart-shaped pillow rests on the back of my tub ready to offer up neck support.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you takes baths!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Also note that the channel in which you rest your neck is straight - there is no curve.</li>
            <li> Very well made and packaged.</li>
            <li> Protected in bubble wraps, this is a very well durable pillow.</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely just loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like the pillow.  </li>
            <li> I add some essential oils, and lay back and enjoy the organic eco-friendly PU foam filled heart shaped pillow.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s so important for your sanity and creativity to have quiet moments that allow you to relax and regroup.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one if your in the market for a bath pillow!</li>
            <li> does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ridge at the part allows it to sit comfortably on the edge of the tub and while I have two different tubs in my house, it works well in both.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not only comfortable, but has been design to support the neck area while bathing.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth enough for them</li>
            <li> so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to make an optimum pillow to fit for all bath tubs</li>
            <li> It feels unnatural if I sit up high enough to get in a comfortable place for my head.  </li>
            <li> It is a little firm at first, which I actually liked since it provided a lot of neck support, and it was still comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s upside down, but it&#x27;s better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more relaxing to have it down the side of the tub</li>
            <li> I use towels for pillows but they don&#x27;t remain comfortable for very long.  </li>
            <li> I have a deep soaking tub, so a regular sized bath tub would work better.</li>
            <li> It is clearly made very well, and I think I will enjoy using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> get the least amount of rest and need it and deserve it the most!</li>
            <li> get the least amount of rest and need it and deserve it the most!</li>
            <li> This goes onto the upper back end of your bath tub &#x3D;&#x3D;try different places for best comfort, and attaches with little suction cups.  </li>
            <li> This is much better than the inflatable ones because they are not thick enough to support your neck, but do offer some support for your back.  </li>
            <li> It sits too high on the edge of the tub for my head.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s kind of my fault for ignoring the customer reports saying it was hard</li>
            <li> As an adult, it&#x27;s such a rarity that it really is a special treat.</li>
            <li> Tried a few bath pillows out and fell in love with this one.  </li>
            <li> It does need to sit on the edge somewhat to be able to stick, so make sure your tub ledge is a comfortable place for the base of your neck to rest.  </li>
            <li> For another, if you have a neck larger than what I stated above this may not be comfortable.</li>
            <li> The pillow is very soft but sturdy and holds my neck well.</li>
            <li> Well I was totally surprised to find that this pillow blew me away!</li>
            <li> Relaxation paid off with a short labor and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> The pillow I received has two large suction cups on the back that you adhere to your tub.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The material is completely water proof, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb a bunch of water and get heavy/droopy.</li>
            <li> This bath pillow is firm but comfortable.  </li>
            <li> and it drip dries well and completely and hasn&#x27;t produced any smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moms</li>
            <li> and it drip dries well and completely and hasn&#x27;t produced any smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moms</li>
            <li> I love it and definitely plan on buying a few of these for some friends of mine!</li>
            <li> But that seems to be the key; sitting up high.  </li>
            <li> but I would not buy it at regular cost as its priced way to high.</li>
            <li> Thought about sending it back but decided I&#x27;d live with it.</li>
            <li> It is solid yet light, firm but comfortable..like an industrial spa pad.</li>
            <li> Firm enough to hold shape and soft enough to be comfortable.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s firm enough to support my head and neck but soft enough to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> I cannot see how this pillow (extremely hard foam) could be comfortable on any neck.</li>
            <li> Enter the Bael Wellness Bath Pillow, a hard foam (with smooth plastic covering --waterproof).  </li>
            <li> but if you have a sensitive head, this one can actually give you a headache.</li>
            <li> But also the most exhausting.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t be too dry and scientific, but also not too light and fluffy.</li>
            <li> My wife, on the other hand, didn&#x27;t care for it as much and said it dug into her neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried using a bath pillow before, but I do like to take baths a decent amount, so I decided to check some out online.</li>
            <li> highly recommend giving it a try, there&#x27;s no real comparison when you want to relax and come out feeling like a million dollars.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a tub-reader like me , it&#x27;s definitely nice to have a firm support in place instead of leaning your neck back against a hard, slippery surface.</li>
            <li> It was well made but smaller than I expected and much more firm than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Please note the 4 star rating is because the suction cups are hard to secure unless your bathtub is DRY.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this over any other especially the inflatable ones.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I did feel relaxed each of the two times that I have used it thus far.</li>
            <li> Little too hard, I&#x27;d prefer it to be a little more soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this pillow in black 2 years ago for my new clawfoot tub.  </li>
            <li> Your head or your pillow will not slide off as long as the tub is at the same angle as with the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little hard but comfortable.</li>
            <li> The suction cups are very stable and don&#x27;t slip if you wet them a little before pushing it on the tub.</li>
            <li> There is no give to the contour of the pillow which means it will be difficult to fit on your tub unless you have a standard shape.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Bael D&amp;eacute;cor for this 100% waterproof, orthopedic grade, odor free, hot &amp; cold resistant pillow with heavy duty suction cups.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does, however, seem to be water tight, which is a plus in the south where the humidity prevents things from drying out completely quite often....</li>
            <li> In that case, you might face some trouble but as far as I am concerned, I have no troubles using this.</li>
            <li> This changes the game, and really is worth investing into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These come in red, white or black.</li>
            <li> you are larger than a 17 inch neck this may not fit as well as you lie back in the tub.</li>
            <li> When I received it you could tell it was not new.</li>
            <li> Then by accident it slid down the side of the back of the tub and voila</li>
            <li> The Bael Decor organic PU foam pillow isn’t the type that is soft and molds to the back of one’s head, but rather is firm and stiff.</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving 4 stars is because the back of the pillow had a half inch scratch on it when I received it.</li>
            <li> quick because it was so uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t want this type of pillow to be too soft but this one is very very hard and hurt the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit harder than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It it extra firm for one thing.</li>
            <li> I needed to prop it on the side of the tub so it would not get wet.</li>
            <li> It does have suction cups but in my experience, suction cups never really work in the tub.</li>
            <li> The pillow then is a bit harder to adhere with the suction cups.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a soft pillow, but a firm pillow to support your head.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this bath pillow for several reasons.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like this bath pillow, because it was uncomfortable when I placed it over the lip of the tub as it is shown in the photo.  </li>
            <li> other bath pillows</li>
            <li> If your tub curves sharply then the two lower suction cups on the bottom may not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical of buying something like this online</li>
            <li> This one is firm, not soft.  </li>
            <li> I wipe it down with a little disinfectant soap and thoroughly dry it between uses.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m having a hard time getting it back from her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> It slides down a bit when not in the tub but stayed in position while bathing.  </li>
            <li> We have placed the pillow up side down where two suction cups are in place and it holds</li>
            <li> I just sprayed it off with a cleaner and wiped it down.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bath pillow because my previous one would not stay suctioned to the tub.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, it is an odd shape</li>
            <li> all black e&#x27;erything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is heart shape that bends slightly to conform the edge of the tub.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I was just using a bunch of towels to try and prop my neck and head up a bit.</li>
            <li> After a heavy day at work, I spend half an hour with my wife in the bath tub.</li>
            <li> but the little seams and folds got moldy</li>
            <li> this bath pillow did not fit with our antique clawfoot therapy tub</li>
            <li> Does not fit my tub and</li>
            <li> Pillow is not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> If you like a firm pillow, I can recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for firm support this is one pillow</li>
            <li> I find the pillow to be unlike any that I have tried before since it is a firm material.</li>
            <li> The pillow itself is firm, and supports my head and neck.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m having trouble finding somewhere in my bathroom to store it.</li>
            <li> Yes is it firm...</li>
            <li> Too firm.</li>
            <li> I work in construction and sometimes come home with a stiff neck, so having a pillow that your neck melts into</li>
            <li> I can see why they are needed because my neck always ends up hurting and getting stiff</li>
            <li> This is a well made product but very hard, not soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This allows me to relax in my jacuzzi while I am taking a long bath, and my neck does not get tired.</li>
            <li> Second, it is too firm and forces my neck forward uncomfortably.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried at least a half dozen.</li>
            <li> This pillow is rock hard and did not fit on my oval shaped tub.  </li>
            <li> This pillow is optimally firm and even works on all three baths at my house!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also quite hard.  </li>
            <li> the problem is this pillow is hard...</li>
            <li> Hard. would not conform to the tub and would not stick.  </li>
            <li> The back was all scraped up and it was dirty.</li>
            <li> pillow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried bath pillows before and never really liked them.</li>
            <li> There are may reviews discussing peoples&#x27; disappointment about the product&#x27;s suction and comfort, but my wife loves it and still uses it over a year later.</li>
            <li> Even if it had, the pillow itself is small and a very hard foam surface.  </li>
            <li> We had a difficult time getting it to attach to our tub, but I read previous reviews, so I wasn&#x27;t caught off guard.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the material was very hard and not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very hard pillow.</li>
            <li> it very hard.</li>
            <li> so you can relax in the tub and not have to worry about the pillow sliding out from behind your head.</li>
            <li> Some of these pillows tend to get dirty and generate a bad smell after multiple uses.</li>
            <li> I found this pillow too hard and very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Always wanted to before, but  baths were just too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Not usable, uncomfortable and just doesn&#x27;t work well in my tub.</li>
            <li> It was also too expensive.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable</li>
            <li> I take my bubble bath time very seriously!</li>
            <li> It has 3 places that appear dirty and smudged, even under the plastic cover.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize just how horrible it was until a small leak showed up</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in what I received.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is I did not return it in time and now am stuck with a product I will never use!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> loved it great seller</li>
            <li> pointy bottom of the heart sticks into my neck....would be better without that part.</li>
            <li> I had a bath pillow like this many years ago and loved it. I could never find another one until now. Others are flimsy or spongy and absorb water. This one is comfortable and easy to keep clean. It was also delivered really quick; 3 days! &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> loves it, nice to relax after a long day &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this spa pillow, our tub is free standing and egg shaped but the suction cups keep it in place.  Be prepared, this pillow is not soft but I love how it holds your neck and head straight</li>
            <li> Very nice pillow.  Highly recommended if you takes baths!</li>
            <li> only had to pay a dollar and i love it!!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Yes the White Bael Bath Pillow was delivered fairly quickly, and my wife has been very busy enjoying her bubble baths in the tub with the pillow. She uses it all the time to relax before bed, and her neck and back are more relaxed now because of the pillow.  So I appreciate you for asking, and will definitely be ordering again in the future.~Skip</li>
            <li> this bath pillow did not fit with our antique clawfoot therapy tub</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried using a bath pillow before, but I do like to take baths a decent amount, so I decided to check some out online. I heard about Bael Decor from a number of different people in various forums, and almost everyone had good things to say about them. I picked this heart shaped bath pillow (or spa pillow) up a couple weeks ago, and it&#x27;s been awesome. My baths have never been more relaxing and comfortable. My wife loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is completely water proof, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb a bunch of water and get heavy/droopy. The heart shape is great because I sometimes get pains in my neck/back, and now I can actually sit comfortably in the bath for longer periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my Bael Decor spa pillow; it&#x27;s one of the most practical things I&#x27;ve bought recently, and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone. They&#x27;d also make a great gift, I&#x27;m thinking of buying a couple for a friend of mine for his jacuzzi. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Very hard pillow. Will not conform to head or bath tub.</li>
            <li> soaks up water and leaks</li>
            <li> I did not like the product.  It was well made but smaller than I expected and much more firm than I expected.  It also did not adhere to my bath tub.  I currently have a heart shaped bath pillow that is worn out and I was trying to replace it, but this was not the one.  I returned the product.  I do have to say that the return process was easy and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get as comfortable a position on it as I had hoped.  It seems a bit harder than I expected.  Thought about sending it back but decided I&#x27;d live with it. I do like that it won&#x27;t collect mold like the one I had before.</li>
            <li> Does not fit my tub and it very hard.</li>
            <li> Great product, perfect neck cradle, fast shipping, great communication with the seller, I would definitely recommend for anyone that enjoys the true relaxation of a bath.</li>
            <li> This is a nice bathtub pillow because it is form fitting so you can relax in the tub and not have to worry about the pillow sliding out from behind your head.</li>
            <li> this pillow is TINY and won&#x27;t stick to tub. the shape would work for a head rest if the suction worked.</li>
            <li> I returned mine - it just didnt work for me and my tub. Not the most comfortable design in my opinion</li>
            <li> This pillow is awesome! It is so comfortable. I am going to order one in red next.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Both my husband and I love it since the 1st time we used it. Right size, no odor, easy to clean. It is well built and sturdy, serves it purpose and work as advertised. Love it. Will recommend to friend and family.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this...there were so many others that were more affordable that I considered, but it actually is perfect. It is solid yet light, firm but comfortable..like an industrial spa pad. It hasn&#x27;t gotten slimy, waterlogged or moldy which is perfect.</li>
            <li> Read reviews, thought I would try it, should have thought about it longer. Suction cups would not stay suctioned. Pillow is not comfortable at all. Piece of crap. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love this pillow.  I purchased one years ago and needed to replace it.  Could not find one in brick and mortar stores anywhere and found it on Amazon. I was thrilled.  I look forward to my spa baths in comfort again!</li>
            <li> The quality of the pillow was a tad lacking.  It has 3 places that appear dirty and smudged, even under the plastic cover.  Also, much smaller than in the advertised picture.  it serves its purpose and function as a neck support for my wife while soaking in the tub.</li>
            <li> Little too hard, I&#x27;d prefer it to be a little more soft. Because I have a fiberglass tub/shower, the ledge of my tub is about an inch and the pillow is designed for a larger ledge. I would buy it regardless of this. It has great shape and the suction cups are very strong. I&#x27;m really enjoying this bath pillow.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay suctioned to the tub, if I move my head i&#x27;m fighting with re-positioning it.</li>
            <li> This bath pillow works great. Just the right size and it sticks! I was concerned that this would not work well with my tub shape but it is absolutely perfect! Does not slip and cushions both my head and shoulders. My husband and I both enjoy using it and find it to be very comfortable. I would definitely buy this pillow again.</li>
            <li> The Bael Wellness pillow is quite firm, but I found it comfortable as it fit my head well. My wife, on the other hand, didn&#x27;t care for it as much and said it dug into her neck and shoulders. The design seems more suited for standalone tubs as shown in the product photo as with &amp;#34;alcove&amp;#34; tubs, as most of us have, only the lower set of suction cups will be against anything. The manufacturer sent me a pillow and asked for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surface material is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I personally love the feel of this &#x27;pillow&#x27; (which is more of a neck support). It&#x27;s firm and is the perfect size for my size 16 neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are larger than a 17 inch neck this may not fit as well as you lie back in the tub. Also note that the channel in which you rest your neck is straight - there is no curve. It gives me the neck support I need to help me to relax in the tub, and also keeps my back straighter than if I were laying back in a softer neck rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love, aside from the feel and firmness, is this is easy to keep clean and sanitary. The outer skin is very smooth and the design has no sharp angles or crevices to house mold, which is a problem in my master bathroom. I wipe it down with a little disinfectant soap and thoroughly dry it between uses. The review sample that I received is the white model, so it&#x27;s easy to see if there is mold taking hold. Of course you should not leave it affixed to the tub between uses. I store mine in a linen closet in my master bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this may not be for everyone. It it extra firm for one thing. For another, if you have a neck larger than what I stated above this may not be comfortable. On the other hand, I did feel relaxed each of the two times that I have used it thus far. It&#x27;s definitely a five star product based on construction and design for those of us who do want extra firmness.</li>
            <li> I got this pillow so I would have something to lie back on in my jacuzzi, to support my head and neck. This pillow really did the trick, as it fit perfectly on my jacuzzi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a soft pillow, but a firm pillow to support your head. For me it is perfect, and if you like a harder pillow it will be good for you.&lt;br /&gt;If the pillow falls in the water...nothing to worry about! It also cleans very easily, as there are no nooks and crannies on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This allows me to relax in my jacuzzi while I am taking a long bath, and my neck does not get tired. If you like a firm pillow, I can recommend this to you. The dimensions are 11&amp;#34; x 8&amp;#34; x 3&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The Bael Decor organic PU foam pillow isn’t the type that is soft and molds to the back of one’s head, but rather is firm and stiff. It is already contoured to fit the neck and the heart-shaped pillow rests on the back of my tub ready to offer up neck support. I do remember many of these types of pillows years ago, but they tended to be softer than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You attach it to your tub of choice via the three 1-1/2” suction cups on the reverse side. I moistened them so they would adhere better and wouldn’t slip. Mind you, if you do not tolerate a plastic scent well, you may wish to take a pass. It is strong, but dissipated when I used a baking soda and water soak for a couple of days. After you use the pillow, it’s very easy to wipe down and keep clean with its nonporous surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the pillow was ultra-firm and provided support for my neck rather than a squishy, comfy experience. This pillow is almost an orthopedic assistive device for those who want and need neck and spine support in the tub. If you are looking for firm support this is one pillow you’ll definitely like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I loved the extra firmness in this. Was easy to rest neck and relax. Never knew such a product existed and knew when offered in exchange of a fair review. Very well made and packaged. Protected in bubble wraps, this is a very well durable pillow.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bath pillow because my previous one would not stay suctioned to the tub.  My tub has an angled back, and the Bael Wellness Bath Pillow suctioned well to my tub.  It slides down a bit when not in the tub but stayed in position while bathing.  I find the pillow to be unlike any that I have tried before since it is a firm material. My head fit great in the curved groves, and it supports my neck well.  I found it very comfortable and relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  I find this to be a very comfortable bath pillow. It is clearly made very well, and I think I will enjoy using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have experimented with a variety of bath pillows to use during my baths, and none compare to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest aspect that sets this product apart from the rest is the grooves. When I attached this to my tub and laid back on it, I felt as if this pillow was customized for my neck. I work in construction and sometimes come home with a stiff neck, so having a pillow that your neck melts into perfectly has given me something to look forward to when I get home. The material it is made with is also of a better quality than most other tub pillows on the market, which tend to suffer from flimsy suction and get flat. I got this product at Sears a while ago and it&#x27;s still as good as new. I&#x27;m now buying one for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning this pillow is also very easy. Some of these pillows tend to get dirty and generate a bad smell after multiple uses. I have yet to have any issues with smell with the Bael bath pillow, and stains and dirt come right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend giving it a try, there&#x27;s no real comparison when you want to relax and come out feeling like a million dollars.</li>
            <li> I read many, many reviews, and saw where some customers reported that this cushion is too hard.  I also saw many more that reported how comfortable it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it in my spa tub.  It feels unnatural if I sit up high enough to get in a comfortable place for my head.  But that seems to be the key; sitting up high.  The woman in the picture is somewhat too low.&lt;br /&gt;It is also quite hard.  I&#x27;m hoping that I&#x27;ll &#x27;break it in&#x27;.  I would return it, but no longer have the original packaging.  And it&#x27;s kind of my fault for ignoring the customer reports saying it was hard (I guess I just read what I wanted to read).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does, however, seem to be water tight, which is a plus in the south where the humidity prevents things from drying out completely quite often....mold, mildew, yuck.  So I don&#x27;t think that will be an issue with this pillow.</li>
            <li> the pillow gave my head and neck support but the suction cups do not attach to the back of the tub.</li>
            <li> Pillow works great.  Fits tub perfectly.  Just a little hard but comfortable. Wife absolutely just loves it. I do too.</li>
            <li> I have never tried bath pillows before until this one.The suction cups are very stable and don&#x27;t slip if you wet them a little before pushing it on the tub. The pillow itself is firm, and supports my head and neck. It definitely increased how much I am able to relax in the tub while taking time away from my children. More than needed!</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this bath pillow for several reasons.  First, it smelled like a mildewed rag when I first opened it.  It has taken weeks for the smell to go away. Second, it is too firm and forces my neck forward uncomfortably.  Third, the suction cups do not stick to my tub so it falls in every time I move.  Lastly, it is an odd shape so I&#x27;m having trouble finding somewhere in my bathroom to store it. I would not recommend this bath pillow to any potential buyers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I found this tub pillow.  I&#x27;ve always just used the back of my tub to rest my head only to end my bath quick because it was so uncomfortable.  The bath pillow itself attaches easily with a bit of moisture and stays put even as the temperature of the bathroom changes.  The look of the pillow is kinda a heart shape and looks very attractive even when not int use and the contour of the pillow seems made for resting the neck and I can lay for a while and relax without any kind of discomfort.  A fantastic pillow for the bath that I wish I had sooner.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like this bath pillow, because it was uncomfortable when I placed it over the lip of the tub as it is shown in the photo.  Then by accident it slid down the side of the back of the tub and voila - it makes a bath so much more relaxing and comfortable!  Now I take an epsom salts and baking soda bath almost every weekend to calm my nerves.  Always wanted to before, but  baths were just too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a heart shaped pillow bought many years ago. This product arrived quickly. Unfortunately the material was very hard and not very comfortable. Consequently, I returned it.</li>
            <li> I really like the pillow.  Our ledge for it to sit on in the tub is pretty small so it doesn&#x27;t sit as nice as I&#x27;d like - but the best I could find.</li>
            <li> We have a SAFE STEP walk-in tub.  The pillow will not work properly with the design of this tub.  There is not a surface that will match up to the three suction cups.  If used as seen in the picture, only one suction cup will hold and the pillow will fall over sideways.  We have placed the pillow up side down where two suction cups are in place and it holds okay.  It&#x27;s upside down, but it&#x27;s better than nothing.  We&#x27;re going to keep it because we cannot find a better solution.</li>
            <li> The pillow is very comfortable, supports the head &amp; neck well &amp; stays in place better than other pillows I have tried and I have tried at least a half dozen.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable! Doesn&#x27;t conform to your neck. I do not recommend this item</li>
            <li> I Received This Product At A Discount In Exchange For An Honest Review. Package Arrived On Time. Very Good Quality, Not Cheaply Made. Very Comfortable.</li>
            <li> The angle of the pillow didn&#x27;t work well with my bath tub. I ended up giving it away and purchased a different pillow.</li>
            <li> I just thought that I loved my claw foot bathtub, the Bael Wellness Bath Pillow definitely gives me the complete spa experience. I add some essential oils, and lay back and enjoy the organic eco-friendly PU foam filled heart shaped pillow. It offers the perfect support I need for my neck. I had to have disks C5 &amp; C6 fused and I have been on a mission to find the perfect bath pillow. Thank you Bael D&amp;eacute;cor for this 100% waterproof, orthopedic grade, odor free, hot &amp; cold resistant pillow with heavy duty suction cups. I love this pillow and it definitely gets 5 stars! I am more than pleased with this product and would recommend it to others! I was really excited when I was given the opportunity to review this product at a discount for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the product that was pictured.  Very disappointed in what I received.  It was not in the shape of what is shown which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this pillow in black 2 years ago for my new clawfoot tub.  I LOVE it.  Yes is it firm...but you can use it either way (flip it around and find out if heart side up or heart side down is more comfortable to you as both work with varying areas of pressure/support) and you don&#x27;t have to use it at the lip of the tub like the picture shows.  It&#x27;s more relaxing to have it down the side of the tub and you can rest fully in the water and you neck is fully supported.&lt;br /&gt;  I want to buy another one just in case something happens to the one I already own!  No water gets inside the cushion so it doesn&#x27;t start to smell.  There are 3 suction cups that work great. I&#x27;ve tried many bath pillows before this one and I can honestly say none have worked well in the tub until this one!!!  It&#x27;s pricey but so worth it.  I take a tub bath almost every day amd my fiance takes one twice a week and it has held up for almost 2 yrs now.&lt;br /&gt;  **Just remember it doesn&#x27;t have to stay on lip of tub as it is even more comfortable when you have it suctioned to side of tub!!!**</li>
            <li> We had a difficult time getting it to attach to our tub, but I read previous reviews, so I wasn&#x27;t caught off guard. Once we were able to bet it in place, it was actually pretty comfortable and serves its purpose. For what I paid, I have no room to complain.</li>
            <li> very nice  makes taking a bath so relaxing</li>
            <li> I take my bubble bath time very seriously! Sometimes it&#x27;s the only time I have to myself during a hectic day and I think it&#x27;s so important for your sanity and creativity to have quiet moments that allow you to relax and regroup. Plus I really enjoy reading in the bath tub. I also have strict rules for what constitutes a perfect bathtime book- it can&#x27;t be too dry and scientific, but also not too light and fluffy. It has to have a certain substantial presence or I&#x27;m likely just to toss it on the floor, close my eyes and daydream. It seems the new wave of excellent YA novels often fit the bill precisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway! In my pursuit of the More Perfect Bubble Bath, I decided to test out this Bathtub Pillow. This particular one is orthopedic grade, eco-friendly, organic PU foam filled and 100% waterproof. These come in red, white or black. You kittens know me, all black e&#x27;erything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first inspection, it kind of feels like a really plump bicycle seat, and the heart shape is adorable. It has a substantial weight to it and the surface is smooth and shiny.  I can tell it will be easy to rinse off after each use and keep nice and clean. There are suction cups on the back that make it easy to adhere to any bathtub- though this would also work great in a hot tub or spa setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heart shape isn&#x27;t just for cuteness. It cradles and supports your neck and head while helping to keep your back aligned in a corrective, comforting position. If you&#x27;re a tub-reader like me , it&#x27;s definitely nice to have a firm support in place instead of leaning your neck back against a hard, slippery surface. But even if you simply like to lie back and bask in the bubbly splendor, the pillow will help make your bath a more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> I use towels for pillows but they don&#x27;t remain comfortable for very long.  Tried a few bath pillows out and fell in love with this one.  Firm enough to hold shape and soft enough to be comfortable.  Stays in place and fits my head perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds on by suction cups which ended up being really easy to remove and apply.  Stays where you put it.  I highly recommend this one if your in the market for a bath pillow!</li>
            <li> This bath pillow is firm but comfortable.  It is heart shape that bends slightly to conform the edge of the tub.  There are three suction cups, one for the top of the bath and two on the bottom to attach to the side of the tub.  Suction cups are soft and provide a strong grip.  Your head or your pillow will not slide off as long as the tub is at the same angle as with the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other bath pillows, it may not work as effectively depending on the shape of your tub.  If your tub curves sharply then the two lower suction cups on the bottom may not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was sent to me for review and evaluation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was having surgery on my foot. I needed to prop it on the side of the tub so it would not get wet. The shape and suction cups on the back seemed perfect. When I received it you could tell it was not new. The back was all scraped up and it was dirty. I threw it away and just bath towels to prop my foot out of the water.</li>
            <li> After a heavy day at work, I spend half an hour with my wife in the bath tub. It is a perfect time for us but the bath tub was spoiling the day by hurting me at the neck when I rest on it. I didn&#x27;t knew that a product like this exists. I got this product immediately and it solved my issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction caps work perfectly and they keep the pillow in a good position on my bath tub. Now I spend more time in the tub because of the comfort it gives me. I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything else. The neck pain has gone.</li>
            <li> For bath enthusiasts that like to relax or perhaps just sit up a bit and read a book, this is going to be the most incredible option to purchase. I&#x27;m a man that likes a good warm bath, and after a long day, it just has something iconic. The bath pillow is well made, comfortable, and conforms perfectly to my tub. It makes things so much better. Previously, I was just using a bunch of towels to try and prop my neck and head up a bit. This changes the game, and really is worth investing into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s comfortable, easy to use, and will change the way you think about taking a bath. I love it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this bath pillow! It is so comfortable,  I fell asleep in the bath tub. The suction cup I&#x27;m the backside of this really keeps it perfectly in place. Sooo easy to clean also! I just sprayed it off with a cleaner and wiped it down. I would recommend this pillow to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love it! It fits perfects, cradles my head and even feels good on my back when I am sitting up!</li>
            <li> Being a mom is day in and day out 24/7 work! Don&#x27;t get me wrong; it&#x27;s the most rewarding job in the world! But also the most exhausting. It has made my alone time that much more sacred to me because it is so rare and so needed. Ever since I was a little girl, I have loved to take baths. As an adult, it&#x27;s such a rarity that it really is a special treat. It&#x27;s my own version of a spa day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our house has a jacuzzi tub that I rarely get to use. I have to do it after the kids go to bed or I end up with one of them, or two, jumping in with me! My routine has always included bath salts, candles and now, this amazing bathtub pillow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried bath pillows before and never really liked them. I can see why they are needed because my neck always ends up hurting and getting stiff which really counter acts the relaxation aspect of taking a bath! When I move to take the pressure off I end up with pain in the back of my head from the pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last pillow I tried actually blew up but of course the air always leaked out and it really wasn&#x27;t that comfortable. This pillow is made from organic PU foam and is super comfy! I just sink into it and it&#x27;s firm enough to support my head and neck but soft enough to be comfortable. I also find the heart shape adorable and it looks cute on the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I was concerned about was how it would stay on the tub. It does have suction cups but in my experience, suction cups never really work in the tub. Well after using for a few weeks, I&#x27;m happy to report that this one does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ridge at the part allows it to sit comfortably on the edge of the tub and while I have two different tubs in my house, it works well in both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter volunteered to try it out in our second bathroom to make sure it worked just as well. Now I&#x27;m having a hard time getting it back from her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another concern I have about anything that gets used in the tub is odor. They always seem to get slimy and yucky and get that bath smell, and I&#x27;m not talking about the good one! Since this one rests on the top of the tub, I&#x27;m able to just leave it there and it drip dries well and completely and hasn&#x27;t produced any smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moms get the least amount of rest and need it and deserve it the most! Take a moment for yourself with this bath pillow and get the rejuvenation you deserve!o get slimy and yucky and get that bath smell, and I&#x27;m not talking about the good one! Since this one rests on the top of the tub, I&#x27;m able to just leave it there and it drip dries well and completely and hasn&#x27;t produced any smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moms get the least amount of rest and need it and deserve it the most! Take a moment for yourself with this bath pillow and get the rejuvenation you deserve!</li>
            <li> This NEW bath pillow works even better than my old one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems perfectly sized - it molds itself to adapt to the shape of my head.The suction cups are very strong. I enjoy being able to take a bath without the nagging voice in the back of my head telling me that at any moment I could slip. This pillow is optimally firm and even works on all three baths at my house! I&#x27;m considering getting separate pillows for each bath for convenience and because they&#x27;re so comfortable. I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Great quality and shape, suction cups hold firmly.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me...or maybe my tub...but this bath pillow does not work for me. That being said...the pillow is constructed well...the suction cups work great...the problem is this pillow is hard...there is no comfort...no relaxing soak in the tub...kind of defeats the purpose of having a bath pillow to begin with!</li>
            <li> This a very comfortable addition to a relaxing bath.  It is not only comfortable, but has been design to support the neck area while bathing.  It has suction cups that allow it to be secured to your bathtub.  Please note the 4 star rating is because the suction cups are hard to secure unless your bathtub is DRY.  Notice the picture shows the customer using this item on a free-standing tub.  I would imagine this pillow would work wonderfully with those tubs.  My tub is not free-standing and of course is inset with a ceramic wall.  The pillow then is a bit harder to adhere with the suction cups.</li>
            <li> Looks great, perfect fit! Pillow stays where it&#x27;s placed when in use.</li>
            <li> I love to relax in the bathtub and when I bought this item, I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Especially since there are TONS of these on the market. Well I was totally surprised to find that this pillow blew me away! It was the perfect size, never lost its place {thanks to the suction cups}, and was incredibly COMFORTABLE. It gives you the feeling of being in a 5-star spa without paying the 5-star price -- because you&#x27;re in the privacy of your own house. I love it and definitely plan on buying a few of these for some friends of mine!</li>
            <li> I got this pillow for my spa and my customers are happy about it. I don&#x27;t know why people are complaining a lot here. It is difficult to make an optimum pillow to fit for all bath tubs but this product comes close to perfection. The design of the pillow makes it easy to use on my tubs and my customers are having good time with it. It is smooth enough for them and I have received no complaints regarding the pillow. I am going to purchase some more from here. In some of the tubs, the ridge may be too small or too big for the pillow to sit perfectly. In that case, you might face some trouble but as far as I am concerned, I have no troubles using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a bath pillow that is perfect for a spa tub. This is it! The pillow is very soft but sturdy and holds my neck well. Most bath pillows are too big for a spa tub but this one is just the right size because it doesn&#x27;t cover any bubble holes.</li>
            <li> The pillow did not attach on all the surfaces of my oval tub.  Even if it had, the pillow itself is small and a very hard foam surface.  I cannot see how this pillow (extremely hard foam) could be comfortable on any neck.</li>
            <li> It sits too high on the edge of the tub for my head.  Would probably work better for someone long bodied, or a tall man.  I also find it quite rigid and it throws my head forward.  I have a deep soaking tub, so a regular sized bath tub would work better.</li>
            <li> Good product! Arrived in a timely fashion,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical of buying something like this online but I saw it had a money back guarantee so I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to lose. I like to take long baths and this pillow works perfect for me. It is a little firm at first, which I actually liked since it provided a lot of neck support, and it was still comfortable. The suction works great and I&#x27;ve, surprisingly, haven&#x27;t had a problem with it slipping off once. I recommend this pillow, A+!</li>
            <li> Not usable, uncomfortable and just doesn&#x27;t work well in my tub.</li>
            <li> I found this pillow too hard and very uncomfortable. It was also too expensive. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it or buy it again.</li>
            <li> The pillow I received has two large suction cups on the back that you adhere to your tub. You just moisten them and then they will stay adhered. I like the nice heart shape of this pillow. It is already molded to fit your neck and head for support. The reason I am giving 4 stars is because the back of the pillow had a half inch scratch on it when I received it.</li>
            <li> Not as advertised. Can not be used with my bathtub.</li>
            <li> So bummed!  I bought this pillow because I had one similar to it years ago and absolutely loved it.  We eventually had to throw it out after years of use because mold started to set in.  I was so happy when I saw this pillow and thought it was exactly the same but it isn&#x27;t.  This pillow is rock hard and did not fit on my oval shaped tub.  There is no give to the contour of the pillow which means it will be difficult to fit on your tub unless you have a standard shape.  The worst part is I did not return it in time and now am stuck with a product I will never use!</li>
            <li> I used this in my garden tub while laboring.  This one is firm, not soft.  It gave good support for my neck so I could relax.  Good curvature.  The suction cups do give out eventually, but not during one use.  It does need to sit on the edge somewhat to be able to stick, so make sure your tub ledge is a comfortable place for the base of your neck to rest.  Great for water birth since I labored there for about 2 and 1/2 hrs.  Relaxation paid off with a short labor and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use this pillow because it came with an extremely strong smell that reminds me of nail polish remover. Gives me an instant headache. It appears to be a nice quality bath pillow. I got a promotional special on it but I would not buy it at regular cost as its priced way to high. Also this pillow works best on a free stand tub and not your typical enclosed bath tub.</li>
            <li> Too firm. Uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Works great in my tub for relaxing after a long stressful day at work!</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample to review-- I had a bath cushion for many years, an inflatable one shaped like a big clam shell.  It was good but the little seams and folds got moldy and it began to smell foul.  I didn&#x27;t realize just how horrible it was until a small leak showed up and I had to put more air in it.  Enter the Bael Wellness Bath Pillow, a hard foam (with smooth plastic covering --waterproof).  This goes onto the upper back end of your bath tub &#x3D;&#x3D;try different places for best comfort, and attaches with little suction cups.  I must confess, when I first saw it  i thought it was way too small, but I installed it and to my great pleasure, its not only very comfortable, but it stays put.  I also like that --while its waterproof, its out of the water as it really on the top rim of the bathtub as opposed to the back like the inflatable ones are.  Its comfortable, its durable, and I look forward to soaking in the bath tub again.  This is much better than the inflatable ones because they are not thick enough to support your neck, but do offer some support for your back.  However, you don&#x27;t need back support, the bath tub does that---but gives zero neck support.  THis fills the bill perfectly.  The price is right, the quality is the highest, and its very comfortable.  It stays right where you want it, and gives great support to your neck and head.  I highly recommend this over any other especially the inflatable ones.  Thank you Bael Wellness.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in my bathtub - may only work in free-standing tubs</li>
            <li> There are may reviews discussing peoples&#x27; disappointment about the product&#x27;s suction and comfort, but my wife loves it and still uses it over a year later. So it does not stay in one spot when not in use, but then cleaning the tub every now-and-then fixes that problem. She finds it comfortable and helps her relax while bathing. If she is happy, then so am I.</li>
            <li> Hard. would not conform to the tub and would not stick.  The tub was a double ended clawfoot.</li>
            <li> I bought it for our spa and it won&#x27;t work for our spa, have no use for it</li>
            <li> This is a well made product but very hard, not soft. Also look at the photo and make sure your tub curves on the back like the one in the photo. You wouldn&#x27;t want this type of pillow to be too soft but this one is very very hard and hurt the back of my head.  Fine for some people I am sure but if you have a sensitive head, this one can actually give you a headache.</li>
