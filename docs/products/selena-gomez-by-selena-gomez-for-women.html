            <li>It came in a large bottle and smells very good.  </li>
            <li>In the top notes that is, but it starts to change in the heart, and make something of it&#x27;s own.</li>

            <li>This is a must buy, must have if you love perfume.</li>
            <li>The bottle is cute as well.</li>

            <li>The bottle is so cute.</li>
            <li>, buy it here!!! :)</li>
            <li>if you Mind don&#x27;t send it with UPS , It&#x27;s better for me in the post office,</li>
            <li>Very unique bottle design.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice sugar sweet fruity perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful &amp; lingers on you for a long time.</li>

            <li>Great for the young generation of women.  </li>
            <li>I liked it, but since I tried some others I couldn&#x27;t really tell how amaizing it is until later, what a delicious fragance!!!!</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good perfume and very affordable.</li>
            <li>Good quality and fast shiping</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I decided its gonna be my signature scent.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s about time that there is a reasonable perfume that smells good and lasts.</li>
            <li>It is a light refreshing scent and its not overly strong or offensive.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think almost all perfumes and colognes are too strong.  </li>
            <li>but it seems like when I put one on, it&#x27;s just too strong.  </li>
            <li>Love Selena Gomez Perfume, is just amazing love the fact that amazon was really quick on the delivery thank you so much, highly recommend it, cheaper than Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed with the packaging and styling of this product overall</li>
            <li>The scent was fine but the bottle wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It has a light floral scent and it&#x27;s not too strong</li>
            <li>Its has a soft &amp; pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely fell in love with this perfume!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but not too light, it&#x27;s strong, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This scent is very pretty!  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is very light, crisp, sweet, and fruity!  </li>
            <li>Overall, great perfume.</li>
            <li>When I researched the fragrance notes, I thought it might be one that I&#x27;d enjoy</li>
            <li>The fragrance smells fantastic.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s sweet and fruity but not too strong.</li>
            <li>When I run out definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The tin flowers on top make it look like it&#x27;s a cheap bottle</li>
            <li>My new favorite!  </li>
            <li>I love it very, very much.</li>
            <li>My husband said it had a very fresh, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Overall an amazing purchase!</li>
            <li>love the smell and it stays with you all day, the bottle is pretty</li>
            <li>People saying this perfume is too sweet or cheaply made smell</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is original</li>
            <li>This is definitely a unique perfume.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unique smell</li>
            <li>The first time I got this was as a gift, I fell in love with it every since.</li>
            <li>What caught my attention at first was the cute bottle when I was trying some fragances at the perfumerie.</li>
            <li>but I love it so much anyway!</li>
            <li>I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li>I know that might sound gross, but it really is refreshing and a nice clean, grape scent smell.  </li>
            <li>When I wear this, people will tell me I smell clean and ask me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I fingued I would try this perfume for myself because I, too, love selena.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very cute, it has about 7-10 gold and purple lips at the top and its very long.</li>
            <li>and I cannot wear strong smelling fragrances, but this one is just right.  </li>
            <li>Smells like a better version of Pure Seduction //</li>
            <li>This perfume smells wonderfully sweet yet still somehow feminine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Selena really put a lot in to her perfume, and it shows; I love it.</li>
            <li>smells sweet</li>
            <li>Smells sweet, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume...and getting it here is much cheaper than at a department store.</li>
            <li>It is sweet but not overpowering in any way.  </li>
            <li>much they both love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is light and fresh and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>smells fruity and sweet</li>
            <li>good product would definitely recommend as a purchase...</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing, though.</li>
            <li>Selena Gomez created a strong, fruity scent that I would guess would be appealing to young girls.</li>
            <li>It made my girl happy so other</li>
            <li>Got it quick no issue.</li>
            <li>This item shipped to me quickly.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with smell at a high end retail store.</li>
            <li>First of all, this perfume is super cheap in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and initially I was very pleased with the way this perfume smelled.</li>
            <li>and it has just the right sweet smell for any teenager</li>
            <li>price for such a large amount of a nice, sweet, light scent that is super girly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the bottle is so pretty when I where it it feels like I am selena gomez !</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I am younger, 22, and I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>Its definitely one of my favorite!</li>
            <li>The box was destroyed on the top and when I opened the box, the little balloons on the top of the perfume&#x27;s cap fell off!</li>
            <li>exactly what i wanted and got!</li>
            <li>However, I quickly noticed that everything tasted like I&#x27;d sprayed the stuff right on my mouth.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing but what&#x27;s the point when it doesn&#x27;t last and you don&#x27;t smell like it?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, great, everyday scent.  </li>
            <li>well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>she loves it good for younger people not so much for adults</li>
            <li>Perfect parfume but the box was nearly broken</li>
            <li>I DESPISE powdery perfumes, but this one is a different kind of powder, my one exception.</li>
            <li>VERY much WORTH the money.</li>
            <li>Defiantly worth the $55.</li>
            <li>but if you like more mature scents its probably not for you.</li>
            <li>I have not found a better price thus far for this product in this size.</li>
            <li>I thought I was standing by some other girls that smelled so good.</li>
            <li>Right ?</li>
            <li>Selene Gomez has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li>and I can still smell it right now at 10:50 pm.</li>
            <li>Gomez was right on with this one...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fruity just right not overpowering like some can be.</li>
            <li>and I was right</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to odors and strong perfumes.  </li>
            <li>People would think it is only for young girls, but it&#x27;s an awesome after shower, daily fragance to use in the day time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet, subtle and sexy!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of the 1000 different sprays and scents that were constantly being used in the house, but I actually enjoy this one and more importantly, my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>People compliment me all the time and it does last which to me is very important.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic and I only wear it on special occasions.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume for my teenage daughter  and it was a huge hit!  </li>
            <li>I would definitely order this again. :)</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s one over her favorite perfumes next to Britney Spears believe.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, great smell</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it smells like raspberries and lasts.</li>
            <li>this is an almost exact dupe.</li>
            <li>Its more than enough for about 1-2-or even 3 years.</li>
            <li>fruity but elegant at the same time.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product a year ago after smelling it on someone else.</li>
            <li>You can trust this fragrance to last all day and get many compliments just like I did.</li>
            <li>I bought it at Macys when it first came out and paid around $60 for it.  </li>
            <li>for  a  hot  date&lt;</li>
            <li>The price is great and it came earlier than my expected delivery date</li>
            <li>but im willing to look past it because this scent is just too good to pass up.</li>
            <li>I knew this, but was tricked by the positive reviews, which I&#x27;m going to blame on hormones.  </li>
            <li>very warm and soft fragrance to wear everyday</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and sweet and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>Believe me, if people compliment you on certain perfumes it&#x27;s only because the strong smell of it literally begs for one.  </li>
            <li>The outside of the box looked fine and didn&#x27;t give a clue as to the problem inside.</li>
            <li>and I got a pretty decent sized box...</li>
            <li>2x as much parfum  </li>
            <li>Plus fast delivery</li>
            <li>And this is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast as well.</li>
            <li>and instead of 2 days, I got this in 4 (but really 6 days because of the weekend).</li>
            <li>a must have it is light and last all day</li>
            <li>This perfume is very fruity and powdery.</li>
            <li>After it&#x27;s been on the skin a while it starts to smell VERY powdery.</li>
            <li>but I just kept putting off buying it because I have so much perfume already</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very fruity.</li>
            <li>i dont really know</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>wife can use as much of this as she wants to..</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>This perfume has a nice, heavy citrus/grapefruit smell.  </li>
            <li>I loved the product, allot bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li>I own 4 and a half bottles of this!</li>
            <li>So glad it was available here at half the price!!!</li>
            <li>and I need to spray more than what I spray with other fragances I have purchased at retail stores</li>
            <li>The initial smell is sweet, but after the day, my boyfriend said that it smells like baby powder</li>
            <li>is sweet and big</li>
            <li>fruity notes are the most noticeable but towards the end there&#x27;s a slight hint of cacao.</li>
            <li>I bought it for a much better deal at Macy&#x27;s though and for the same price I got a combo pack including shower gel, lip gloss, lotion and the big perfume bottle, PLUS</li>
            <li>Item was much larger than i had expected :) Shipping was fast, Would defiantly recommend to others!</li>
            <li>Product came as promised, i highly recommend this fragrence.</li>
            <li>SHE GOT IT FOR GETTING HIGH HONOR ROLL.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to ascribe age to a fragrance and hate that people feel that once you&#x27;re a certain age you shouldn&#x27;t wear strong fruity fragrances - I think this is a delicious scent that a woman of any age can wear as long as she loves it</li>
            <li>On certain clothes it smell ok, and then on others not ok.</li>
            <li>as I get when I normally  buy it  in Kohls</li>
            <li>pretty fast- only took 4 days to get here.</li>
            <li>yet it is strong enough to last all day.</li>
            <li>and my mom just bought me the new Taylor Swift perfume.</li>
            <li>It also came very fast, before the estimated delivery date actually.</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh, wow!</li>
            <li>I never buy a perfume after trying it out first because you never know how it will smell mixed with your body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>Nothing unique, just a really strong powdery perfume smell, you know what I mean, that will end up making you regret not only the purchase but even putting it on.  </li>
            <li>Good for cold or hot weather.  </li>
            <li>Has other flowery or sweet notes in it..</li>
            <li>Bought for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas had to buy her another bottle for Her Birthday</li>
            <li>My order came in faster than unexpected .</li>
            <li>Completely.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 11year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Bought for 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 39 years old</li>
            <li>and I wanted something hip but not a smell that seemed too young for me.</li>
            <li>- initially it smells very fruity, a mash of pineapple.</li>
            <li>i bought this blindly and i loved it .</li>
            <li>bottle is so cute and thick and sturdy... got it for my daughter...</li>
            <li>This perfume is basically very, very strong, so strong it lasts forever, but in a bad way.  </li>
            <li>The smell is floral, but not super sweet.</li>
            <li>She was so excited she informed all of us she was GOING TO WEAR IT EVERYDAY</li>
            <li>Once i saw that it was running low, I immediately went to search for a new one.  </li>
            <li>The scent is barely noticeable after 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>When they arrived, i was very pleasantly surprised at how big the bottles are.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this perfume, however, the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>Unbelievable and very reliable!!</li>
            <li>I thought it was just going to be some young girl fragrance and not something I would use long term.  </li>

            <li> I liked it, but since I tried some others I couldn&#x27;t really tell how amaizing it is until later, what a delicious fragance!!!!</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s a good perfume and very affordable.</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast shiping</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I decided its gonna be my signature scent.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s about time that there is a reasonable perfume that smells good and lasts.</li>
            <li> It is a light refreshing scent and its not overly strong or offensive.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think almost all perfumes and colognes are too strong.  </li>
            <li> but it seems like when I put one on, it&#x27;s just too strong.  </li>
            <li> Love Selena Gomez Perfume, is just amazing love the fact that amazon was really quick on the delivery thank you so much, highly recommend it, cheaper than Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with the packaging and styling of this product overall</li>
            <li> The scent was fine but the bottle wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It has a light floral scent and it&#x27;s not too strong</li>
            <li> Its has a soft &amp; pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this perfume!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but not too light, it&#x27;s strong, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This scent is very pretty!  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is very light, crisp, sweet, and fruity!  </li>
            <li> Overall, great perfume.</li>
            <li> When I researched the fragrance notes, I thought it might be one that I&#x27;d enjoy</li>
            <li> The fragrance smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fabulous</li>
            <li> Really big bottle smells great</li>
            <li> The perfume is delicious and so far it last many hours on my body.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and overall a great product!!</li>
            <li> Great product, was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> So much for such a great price!  </li>
            <li> The smell is sweet , it lasts, has a sensual and sultry vibe, yet not too strong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sweet and fruity but not too strong.</li>
            <li> When I run out definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The tin flowers on top make it look like it&#x27;s a cheap bottle</li>
            <li> My new favorite!  </li>
            <li> I love it very, very much.</li>
            <li> My husband said it had a very fresh, clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Overall an amazing purchase!</li>
            <li> love the smell and it stays with you all day, the bottle is pretty</li>
            <li> People saying this perfume is too sweet or cheaply made smell</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is original</li>
            <li> This is definitely a unique perfume.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unique smell</li>
            <li> The first time I got this was as a gift, I fell in love with it every since.</li>
            <li> What caught my attention at first was the cute bottle when I was trying some fragances at the perfumerie.</li>
            <li> but I love it so much anyway!</li>
            <li> I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light</li>
            <li> I know that might sound gross, but it really is refreshing and a nice clean, grape scent smell.  </li>
            <li> When I wear this, people will tell me I smell clean and ask me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I fingued I would try this perfume for myself because I, too, love selena.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very cute, it has about 7-10 gold and purple lips at the top and its very long.</li>
            <li> and I cannot wear strong smelling fragrances, but this one is just right.  </li>
            <li> Smells like a better version of Pure Seduction //</li>
            <li> This perfume smells wonderfully sweet yet still somehow feminine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Selena really put a lot in to her perfume, and it shows; I love it.</li>
            <li> smells sweet</li>
            <li> Smells sweet, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume...and getting it here is much cheaper than at a department store.</li>
            <li> It is sweet but not overpowering in any way.  </li>
            <li> much they both love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is light and fresh and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> smells fruity and sweet</li>
            <li> good product would definitely recommend as a purchase...</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing, though.</li>
            <li> Selena Gomez created a strong, fruity scent that I would guess would be appealing to young girls.</li>
            <li> It made my girl happy so other</li>
            <li> Got it quick no issue.</li>
            <li> This item shipped to me quickly.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with smell at a high end retail store.</li>
            <li> First of all, this perfume is super cheap in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and initially I was very pleased with the way this perfume smelled.</li>
            <li> and it has just the right sweet smell for any teenager</li>
            <li> price for such a large amount of a nice, sweet, light scent that is super girly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the bottle is so pretty when I where it it feels like I am selena gomez !</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I am younger, 22, and I love this perfume!</li>
            <li> Its definitely one of my favorite!</li>
            <li> The box was destroyed on the top and when I opened the box, the little balloons on the top of the perfume&#x27;s cap fell off!</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted and got!</li>
            <li> However, I quickly noticed that everything tasted like I&#x27;d sprayed the stuff right on my mouth.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing but what&#x27;s the point when it doesn&#x27;t last and you don&#x27;t smell like it?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, great, everyday scent.  </li>
            <li> well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> she loves it good for younger people not so much for adults</li>
            <li> Perfect parfume but the box was nearly broken</li>
            <li> I DESPISE powdery perfumes, but this one is a different kind of powder, my one exception.</li>
            <li> VERY much WORTH the money.</li>
            <li> Defiantly worth the $55.</li>
            <li> but if you like more mature scents its probably not for you.</li>
            <li> I have not found a better price thus far for this product in this size.</li>
            <li> I thought I was standing by some other girls that smelled so good.</li>
            <li> Right ?</li>
            <li> Selene Gomez has done it right with his Fragrences</li>
            <li> and I can still smell it right now at 10:50 pm.</li>
            <li> Gomez was right on with this one...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fruity just right not overpowering like some can be.</li>
            <li> and I was right</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to odors and strong perfumes.  </li>
            <li> People would think it is only for young girls, but it&#x27;s an awesome after shower, daily fragance to use in the day time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet, subtle and sexy!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the 1000 different sprays and scents that were constantly being used in the house, but I actually enjoy this one and more importantly, my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> People compliment me all the time and it does last which to me is very important.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic and I only wear it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my teenage daughter  and it was a huge hit!  </li>
            <li> I would definitely order this again. :)</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s one over her favorite perfumes next to Britney Spears believe.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, great smell</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it smells like raspberries and lasts.</li>
            <li> this is an almost exact dupe.</li>
            <li> Its more than enough for about 1-2-or even 3 years.</li>
            <li> fruity but elegant at the same time.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product a year ago after smelling it on someone else.</li>
            <li> You can trust this fragrance to last all day and get many compliments just like I did.</li>
            <li> I bought it at Macys when it first came out and paid around $60 for it.  </li>
            <li> for  a  hot  date&lt;</li>
            <li> The price is great and it came earlier than my expected delivery date</li>
            <li> but im willing to look past it because this scent is just too good to pass up.</li>
            <li> I knew this, but was tricked by the positive reviews, which I&#x27;m going to blame on hormones.  </li>
            <li> very warm and soft fragrance to wear everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and sweet and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Believe me, if people compliment you on certain perfumes it&#x27;s only because the strong smell of it literally begs for one.  </li>
            <li> The outside of the box looked fine and didn&#x27;t give a clue as to the problem inside.</li>
            <li> and I got a pretty decent sized box...</li>
            <li> 2x as much parfum  </li>
            <li> Plus fast delivery</li>
            <li> And this is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast as well.</li>
            <li> and instead of 2 days, I got this in 4 (but really 6 days because of the weekend).</li>
            <li> a must have it is light and last all day</li>
            <li> This perfume is very fruity and powdery.</li>
            <li> After it&#x27;s been on the skin a while it starts to smell VERY powdery.</li>
            <li> but I just kept putting off buying it because I have so much perfume already</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very fruity.</li>
            <li> i dont really know</li>
            <li> not so much.</li>
            <li> wife can use as much of this as she wants to..</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a nice, heavy citrus/grapefruit smell.  </li>
            <li> I loved the product, allot bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I own 4 and a half bottles of this!</li>
            <li> So glad it was available here at half the price!!!</li>
            <li> and I need to spray more than what I spray with other fragances I have purchased at retail stores</li>
            <li> The initial smell is sweet, but after the day, my boyfriend said that it smells like baby powder</li>
            <li> is sweet and big</li>
            <li> fruity notes are the most noticeable but towards the end there&#x27;s a slight hint of cacao.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a much better deal at Macy&#x27;s though and for the same price I got a combo pack including shower gel, lip gloss, lotion and the big perfume bottle, PLUS</li>
            <li> Item was much larger than i had expected :) Shipping was fast, Would defiantly recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Product came as promised, i highly recommend this fragrence.</li>
            <li> SHE GOT IT FOR GETTING HIGH HONOR ROLL.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to ascribe age to a fragrance and hate that people feel that once you&#x27;re a certain age you shouldn&#x27;t wear strong fruity fragrances - I think this is a delicious scent that a woman of any age can wear as long as she loves it</li>
            <li> On certain clothes it smell ok, and then on others not ok.</li>
            <li> as I get when I normally  buy it  in Kohls</li>
            <li> pretty fast- only took 4 days to get here.</li>
            <li> yet it is strong enough to last all day.</li>
            <li> and my mom just bought me the new Taylor Swift perfume.</li>
            <li> It also came very fast, before the estimated delivery date actually.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, wow!</li>
            <li> I never buy a perfume after trying it out first because you never know how it will smell mixed with your body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> Nothing unique, just a really strong powdery perfume smell, you know what I mean, that will end up making you regret not only the purchase but even putting it on.  </li>
            <li> Good for cold or hot weather.  </li>
            <li> Has other flowery or sweet notes in it..</li>
            <li> Bought for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas had to buy her another bottle for Her Birthday</li>
            <li> My order came in faster than unexpected .</li>
            <li> Completely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11year old daughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Bought for 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 years old</li>
            <li> and I wanted something hip but not a smell that seemed too young for me.</li>
            <li> - initially it smells very fruity, a mash of pineapple.</li>
            <li> i bought this blindly and i loved it .</li>
            <li> bottle is so cute and thick and sturdy... got it for my daughter...</li>
            <li> This perfume is basically very, very strong, so strong it lasts forever, but in a bad way.  </li>
            <li> The smell is floral, but not super sweet.</li>
            <li> She was so excited she informed all of us she was GOING TO WEAR IT EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> Once i saw that it was running low, I immediately went to search for a new one.  </li>
            <li> The scent is barely noticeable after 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> When they arrived, i was very pleasantly surprised at how big the bottles are.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this perfume, however, the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable and very reliable!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was just going to be some young girl fragrance and not something I would use long term.  </li>
            <li> I will give it to my ten year old daughter not ok for an adult women</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for whimsical perfume bottles and thought this bottle was so cute the first time I saw it.  </li>
            <li> the only thing is the smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> it doesnt last long</li>
            <li> is that is does not last for long.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a perfume last this long!</li>
            <li> The scent last all day long too!</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars except that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> but really a simple tote for extra 20 dlls not worth it</li>
            <li> Was larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> It lasts moderately long on the skin, about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was running low on my other bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> The downside is that it does not last very long, even when I spray it a few times.</li>
            <li> If you have ever smelt \\&quot;Pure Seduction\\&quot; from Victoria&#x27;s Secret..</li>
            <li> Had no idea the bottle was so big... was expecting a little package in the mail</li>
            <li> There is not much floral in this.</li>
            <li> All my friends have very different tastes in perfumes and they usually hate the ones I love, but they&#x27;re always asking to wear this.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the smell and doesn&#x27;t wear any other scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nonetheless, I still recommend it due to</li>
            <li> Other than that, I adore this perfume.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re worried that this is an imitation, no concerns as this is legit</li>
            <li> Normally, I&#x27;ll use perfume for a little while and then get tired of it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> but i have only one complaint.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I bought the 3.4 oz bottle for less than half of the price that the 1oz bottle at Meijer was.</li>
            <li> Not your typical \\&quot;baby\\&quot; powder..</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t last too long, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This smells just like fruit punch with dark chocolate undertones!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried I&#x27;d smell like a baby prostitute (I&#x27;m 25,</li>
            <li> When people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing they are usually shocked that its a &amp;#34;celebrity&amp;#34; fragrance and by such a young celebrity.</li>
            <li> half the size anywhere else is 35+ yummy buy me!</li>
            <li> Well, when I spray my socks, I&#x27;ll get a whiff of this perfume instead of a bad odor when my feet get hot.  </li>
            <li> I thought this perfume would last hours but it merely lasts a few minutes.</li>
            <li> not sure what&#x27;s going on with Amazon Prime 2 day</li>
            <li> First, I thought I&#x27;d hate this perfume because it&#x27;s by Selena Gomez</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not floral, fruity or that nasty eternity strong smell.</li>
            <li> The lip decorations were broken off and the level of liquid was not full, indicating a leak.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for the celebrity fragrances.</li>
            <li> This sadly forced me to give this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Yes , half the price!!!</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that the bottle is a bit atrocious and the lip charms on the cap make it hard to store and pack.</li>
            <li> The smell is difficult to describe but it is fruity, not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> I officially hate Selena Gomez and who ever made this for making this perfume not lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed about that because it indicates that it is not a high quality perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like stale bubble gum.</li>
            <li> im so sad about that</li>
            <li> SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME ...</li>
            <li> Sorry, Sel, but don&#x27;t sell your soul.  </li>
            <li> and it was so expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> the packaging, not gunna lie, is ugly.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed Macy&#x27;s stop selling it.</li>
            <li> Horrible experience.</li>

            <li> My daughter loves this, great seller!</li>
            <li> I thought this perfume would last hours but it merely lasts a few minutes. The smell is amazing but what&#x27;s the point when it doesn&#x27;t last and you don&#x27;t smell like it? Ugh. Horrible experience. I officially hate Selena Gomez and who ever made this for making this perfume not lasting.</li>
            <li> love the smell and it stays with you all day, the bottle is pretty but i really don&#x27;t care for the flowers on top, but the sent is great smells like a piece of heaven</li>
            <li> This perfume has a nice, heavy citrus/grapefruit smell.  Good for cold or hot weather.  The delivery was extremely quick and it was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. The paint on bottle cap was bubbling off. I suppose it was part of a damaged lot hence the great price. Even so, it&#x27;s the fragrance that counts.</li>
            <li> Had no idea the bottle was so big... was expecting a little package in the mail and I got a pretty decent sized box... My sister is very pleased with this item... Wears it a lot... Will buy another!</li>
            <li> It smells like stale bubble gum. Not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> I loved the product, allot bigger than I expected. I use to buy from perfume mania. And this is so much cheaper. I would definitely order this again. :)</li>
            <li> Got it quick no issue. It made my girl happy so other then that it&#x27;s a must buy lol. Right ?</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet , it lasts, has a sensual and sultry vibe, yet not too strong. Arrived fast as well. Overall a great purchase!</li>
            <li> First, I thought I&#x27;d hate this perfume because it&#x27;s by Selena Gomez and I&#x27;m not a teeny bopper, but in fact, it&#x27;s great! Daytime/nighttime scent. I really like the smell of this perfume, however, the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long. When I sampled it in the store I felt that it lasted longer. Still, it&#x27;s a good perfume and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume ðŸ’œðŸ’œ</li>
            <li> My niece loved this  She was so excited she informed all of us she was GOING TO WEAR IT EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was running low on my other bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re worried that this is an imitation, no concerns as this is legit BUT I am an Amazon Prime Member and instead of 2 days, I got this in 4 (but really 6 days because of the weekend). This is the 2nd item that doesn&#x27;t arrive in 2 days...hmmm...not sure what&#x27;s going on with Amazon Prime 2 day delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, great, everyday scent.  I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s and love the smell. Can&#x27;t explain the smell but it&#x27;s not floral, fruity or that nasty eternity strong smell.</li>
            <li> I love Selena Gomez and i just HAD to get her perfume. It arrived on time and smells amazing but i have only one complaint.....it doesnt last long im so sad about that but it smells so good so thats ok :)</li>
            <li> This item seems to be marketed and designed for the younger set. Otherwise it is a good, strong perfume but a bit sweet-smelling.</li>
            <li> Great, fast shipping and have gotten so many compliments on this perfume!</li>
            <li> Bought for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas had to buy her another bottle for Her Birthday she absolutley loves it.  She gets a lot of compliments when she wears it and has people asking her what she&#x27;s wearing all the time.</li>
            <li> This smell so good a must have it is light and last all day I will recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li> This is a nice sugar sweet fruity perfume. There is not much floral in this. It smells like all fruits that are purple. Berries, plums, and even violet flowers. It&#x27;s very nice and elegant for day and night wear. Lasts about 3hrs before reapplying.</li>
            <li> Sorry about my english, It&#x27;s my first time buying a perfume without tried it first but i read the reviews and give it a chance, i bought this from amazon dll directly, and came in perfect conditions, the perfume smells amazing!!! the scent it&#x27;s sweet and fruity but not too strong.</li>
            <li> I bought the 3.4 oz bottle for less than half of the price that the 1oz bottle at Meijer was. Beautiful smell, came in perfect condition and well worth the wait. Fast shipping and overall a great product!! Would recommend for those who want a much larger quantity for the cheapest.</li>
            <li> My order came in faster than unexpected . I love it</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, wow! This smells just like fruit punch with dark chocolate undertones! Smells like a better version of Pure Seduction // Love Spell from Victoria Secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smelled this and I knew THIS is the perfume I want to wear all the time. It&#x27;s everything! I&#x27;d been looking for a perfume t hat I genuinely loved and this one stole my heart! Completely.</li>
            <li> First of all, this perfume is super cheap in my opinion. The scent is fantastic and I only wear it on special occasions. It is more on the flowery scale of scents, so if you don&#x27;t like flower scents, this product probably isn&#x27;t for you. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my teenage daughter  and it was a huge hit!  I&#x27;m not a fan of the 1000 different sprays and scents that were constantly being used in the house, but I actually enjoy this one and more importantly, my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as peachy as I would have hoped, but that&#x27;s not its fault. I was a little worried I&#x27;d smell like a baby prostitute (I&#x27;m 25, if I&#x27;m going to smell like a prostitute, I want it to be a grown one), but I just smell like flowers.  It&#x27;s my go-to &amp;#34;not trying to impress anyone but I want to smell like flowers&amp;#34; perfume.</li>
            <li> Good quality and fast shiping</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so nice. I bought it for my teenager but I find myself wearing it too. I recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. Love the smell! My signature scent. I absolutely love it!! Highly recommend it and the price is great!</li>
            <li> People saying this perfume is too sweet or cheaply made smell but I do not agree with them.&lt;br /&gt;This perfume smells wonderful and so romantic !</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11year old daughter for Christmas.  She loved it.  It came in a large bottle and smells very good.  It was a good purchase for the price.</li>
            <li> I love it the bottle is so pretty when I where it it feels like I am selena gomez !</li>
            <li> I bought it for my niece. She is extremely happy with it. It was her request as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and she loves it. She says it&#x27;s one over her favorite perfumes next to Britney Spears believe.</li>
            <li> Item arrived today and was a marvelous surprise. This perfume smells wonderfully sweet yet still somehow feminine.&lt;br /&gt;The fruity notes are the most noticeable but towards the end there&#x27;s a slight hint of cacao. Wonderful buy!</li>
            <li> Awesome! I never would have thought I&#x27;d be wearing Selena Gomez!</li>
            <li> This item shipped to me quickly. Its a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this at an afordable price and I finaly found it and it smells great and the bottle is so pretty that is my fave part and yah I am sels bigest fan and if u like her u should buy this.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, great smell and I love the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is original the smell does not stay all day and I need to spray more than what I spray with other fragances I have purchased at retail stores and I had sprayed this same fragrance that my sister had  that&#x27;s how I knew about this fragrance she purchased it at a retail store and when I would spray it on me I didnt have to spray a lot and smell would last all day.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t seem to find this in the stores anymore and this is one of her favorite perfumes! So glad to have found it and she was thrilled opening it on xmas!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gif for my daughter as she requested and she loved it . Smells pretty good. Not offensive . Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so beautiful. No matter what your taste, you&#x27;ll love this. All my friends have very different tastes in perfumes and they usually hate the ones I love, but they&#x27;re always asking to wear this. It also came very fast, before the estimated delivery date actually. Overall an amazing purchase!</li>
            <li> Bought for my niece she loves it good for younger people not so much for adults</li>
            <li> Best perfume ever! Bought this for my daughter and it smelled so good I bought some for myself. I&#x27;ve been wearing this for a couple years now and I hope it&#x27;s never discontinued. It is a light refreshing scent and its not overly strong or offensive. Love love love this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Great for the young generation of women.  I gave it my daughter as a gift.  Nice fragrance.  I liked it too.  She loves it and has switched to it being her favorite.</li>
            <li> Perfect parfume but the box was nearly broken</li>
            <li> Great product, was more than I expected. I arrive in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I fingued I would try this perfume for myself because I, too, love selena. I am younger, 22, and I love this perfume! When you first put it on it smells like raspberries and lasts. The downside is that it does not last very long, even when I spray it a few times. The initial smell is sweet, but after the day, my boyfriend said that it smells like baby powder and I agree. You have to spray it again thriughf the day in order to keep the fruity smell. Overall, great perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume that smells wonderful and it came in 1 day! Unbelievable and very reliable!! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with the packaging and styling of this product overall and initially I was very pleased with the way this perfume smelled. However, I quickly noticed that everything tasted like I&#x27;d sprayed the stuff right on my mouth. I chalked this up to using the spray into the air and walk through method...it was possible I&#x27;d gotten some on my face, although I&#x27;d never had that happen before. The next time I used it I sprayed it directly onto my midsection carefully away from my face and again shortly after felt as if it&#x27;d gotten in my mouth. There is NO way this could have gotten on my face yet I tasted it for hours. As soon as I got home that day I threw it immediately in the trash.</li>
            <li> The price on this big of a bottle truly blew me away!  So much for such a great price!  My daughter loves the smell and doesn&#x27;t wear any other scent.</li>
            <li> Just got this perfume in today. It smells too good for words, and easily makes it in to my Top 5. I am a sucker for the celebrity fragrances. What my entire collection consists of with a couple designer exceptions. In my opinion, the celebrity perfumes for the most part smell better than designer fragrances. If you have ever smelt \\&quot;Pure Seduction\\&quot; from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.. this is an almost exact dupe. In the top notes that is, but it starts to change in the heart, and make something of it&#x27;s own. This perfume is very fruity and powdery. When you first spritz it, all you get delicious sweet juicy fruits. After it&#x27;s been on the skin a while it starts to smell VERY powdery. The fruit is still there, but is covered with powder. Not your typical \\&quot;baby\\&quot; powder.. but kind of a \\&quot;Talc\\&quot; powder kind of scent. If you don&#x27;t like powdery perfumes.. PLEASE don&#x27;t let this scare you away from this. I DESPISE powdery perfumes, but this one is a different kind of powder, my one exception. It lasts moderately long on the skin, about 3 hours. Selena really put a lot in to her perfume, and it shows; I love it.</li>
            <li> SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME ... AND I WILL BE WAITING ... WHAT HAPPENS??? HAPPENS?? NEED ANSWERS?SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME</li>
            <li> Selene Gomez has done it right with his Fragrences I have not used one of his products I did not like but for me 18 is one of the better ones its a soft scent very light and it&#x27;s last it makes you wanna have sex with yourself it smells so good.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing! It has a light floral scent and it&#x27;s not too strong yet it is strong enough to last all day. It is defiantly a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for the summer months.</li>
            <li> I own 4 and a half bottles of this! (one is travel size). My mom steals this perfume from me all the time so I bought one for herself. Everyone compliments me when I wear this. Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> very warm and soft fragrance to wear everyday</li>
            <li> i bought this blindly and i loved it . smells sweet the only thing is the smell doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume. Perfect</li>
            <li> If you get perfume headaches, this is NOT for you.  Now, girls, Selena and her managers are ONLY trying to make money.  I knew this, but was tricked by the positive reviews, which I&#x27;m going to blame on hormones.  Believe me, if people compliment you on certain perfumes it&#x27;s only because the strong smell of it literally begs for one.  This perfume is basically very, very strong, so strong it lasts forever, but in a bad way.  Nothing unique, just a really strong powdery perfume smell, you know what I mean, that will end up making you regret not only the purchase but even putting it on.  Sorry, Sel, but don&#x27;t sell your soul.  It&#x27;s not worth it.  John 3:16.</li>
            <li> It was in great condition!</li>
            <li> fruity smell than flower smell.. but its ok .</li>
            <li> I absolutely fell in love with this perfume! I know that you think of teenie-bopper when you see Selena Gomez perfume, but I myself don&#x27;t care about the name. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and I love the smell. I would give it 5 stars except that the smell doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> Bought for 12 year old daughter.  Smells nice and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing!  Smells sweet, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites. It&#x27;s a sweet, subtle and sexy!! I was disappointed Macy&#x27;s stop selling it. Thank God for Amazon!</li>
            <li> This perfume is great.fun yet flirty.great blends.and the bottle is so pretty.i love it.im very happy i ordered it</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing! I got it a Macy&#x27;s for 55 dollars, AND it came with a cute burgundy lip shaped bag. The smell is floral, but not super sweet. I loved it so much I decided its gonna be my signature scent. The bottle is very cute, it has about 7-10 gold and purple lips at the top and its very long. Its more than enough for about 1-2-or even 3 years. The perfume lasts all day, everybody loved it including myself. My cousin would not stop hugging me because she loved the scent! Its definitely one of my favorite! I recommend it to every girl on this planet!</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume 2 years ago from macy&#x27;s and fell in love!  Once i saw that it was running low, I immediately went to search for a new one.  The price is great and it came earlier than my expected delivery date so i was ecstatic. The only problem I had was that the product came in damaged.  The box was destroyed on the top and when I opened the box, the little balloons on the top of the perfume&#x27;s cap fell off! On the package it says &amp;#34;FRAGILE HANDLE WITH CARE&amp;#34; but I guess this was overlooked. This sadly forced me to give this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this.  My granddaughters love it and I purchased a bottle for myself because it smells beautifully.</li>
            <li> I just got mine in the mail today.. I have been wanting it since it came out but I just kept putting off buying it because I have so much perfume already and my mom just bought me the new Taylor Swift perfume. But I finally decided to go ahead and get it since it&#x27;s about 17 bucks cheaper on here than it is at department stores! I absolutely love it- it&#x27;s very fruity. I sprayed it on myself when it showed up on my porch at 11:30 am and I can still smell it right now at 10:50 pm. I have never had a perfume last this long! Plus, the shipping was pretty fast- only took 4 days to get here. (:</li>
            <li> bottle is so cute and thick and sturdy... got it for my daughter... it smells so good! and she loves it... when shes done with it, shes gonna turn cap deco. into an accessory :)</li>
            <li> If I had known all my daughters would like this scent so well, I would have ordered 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li> This perfume has such a wonderful smell. I&#x27;ve never smelt anything like it. I&#x27;m 39 years old and I wanted something hip but not a smell that seemed too young for me. This has an undertone smell that keeps you wanting to smell more of it. I put it on in the store and then walked around. I thought I was standing by some other girls that smelled so good. Then I realized it was me. I immediately went back and bought it. I could still smell it on me the next morning when I woke up. This lasts a long time! VERY much WORTH the money. Gomez was right on with this one...it&#x27;s about time that there is a reasonable perfume that smells good and lasts.</li>
            <li> This stuff just smells heavenly. It&#x27;s obviously a matter of preference but my daughter n&#x27; I love this perfume...and getting it here is much cheaper than at a department store.</li>
            <li> In my opinion Selena Gomez came out with a perfect perfume. This is my favorite celebrity fragrance. I haven&#x27;t smelled nothing else like this. Defiantly worth the $55. I&#x27;ve already bought 3 bottles since it came out in May. It&#x27;s fruity just right not overpowering like some can be. I can&#x27;t get enough of this perfume. I hope she releases a sister fragrance next year, I&#x27;ll be waiting. This is definitely a unique perfume. This is a must buy, must have if you love perfume. The bottle is cute as well.</li>
            <li> A MI HIJA LE ENCANTO EL PERFUME, HUELE MUY BIEN, 1005 RESPONSABLES ... NO OPINO MAS PORQUE NO HABLO INGLES, RECOMENDADO 1000%</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very light, crisp, sweet, and fruity!  I was shopping at a Kohl&#x27;s store, when I spritzed some of this fragrance on, and I loved it.  My husband said it had a very fresh, clean smell.  It is sweet but not overpowering in any way.  When I wear this, people will tell me I smell clean and ask me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so delightful. It has a very light scent that I absolutely love. The scent last all day long too! Can&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
            <li> This scent is very pretty!  Not overpowering!  Sweet floral/fruity scent that is so nice!  The combination is truly unique!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;ve found with this fragrance is that is does not last for long.  The scent is barely noticeable after 2 hours.  I&#x27;m disappointed about that because it indicates that it is not a high quality perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, I still recommend it due to it&#x27;s unique smell that I feel any woman of any age can wear!</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this perfume is amazing! The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product four stars is because of the packaging. I opened up this perfume and found that the bottle was leaking. Other than that, I adore this perfume. The smell is difficult to describe but it is fruity, not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE SCENT.  SHE HAS WANTED THIS PERFUME FOR A WHILE.  SHE GOT IT FOR GETTING HIGH HONOR ROLL.  WTG MOLLY</li>
            <li> Loved this perfume. So in love with the smell. It&#x27;s soft and sweet and not overbearing. Perfect size bottle for the prize.</li>
            <li> exactly what i wanted and got! for an excellent and competitive price! would definately recommend product to anyone that likes clean and light scents!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for whimsical perfume bottles and thought this bottle was so cute the first time I saw it.  When I researched the fragrance notes, I thought it might be one that I&#x27;d enjoy and I was right - initially it smells very fruity, a mash of pineapple. freesia &amp; peach then as it dries, I smell more coconut &amp; chocolate.  This perfume also lasts practically the entire day so I don&#x27;t feel the need to refresh until 4pm (after putting it on at 7am).  I&#x27;m not one to ascribe age to a fragrance and hate that people feel that once you&#x27;re a certain age you shouldn&#x27;t wear strong fruity fragrances - I think this is a delicious scent that a woman of any age can wear as long as she loves it &amp; it makes her feel good wearing it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!! It also arrived on time &amp; was packaged nicely!! When I run out definitely buying more!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent. im a fruity scent person. its sort of mixed with floral maybe? i dont really know but it smells amazing. the packaging, not gunna lie, is ugly. but im willing to look past it because this scent is just too good to pass up. wonderful job they did with the scent the packaging not so much. if you are a fruit person this is probably for you. but if you like more mature scents its probably not for you.</li>
            <li> I had been waiting for the price on this to drop, and I&#x27;m so glad it did! I adore the fruity, floral scent and I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on it at work. The only downfall is that the bottle is a bit atrocious and the lip charms on the cap make it hard to store and pack.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! The first time I got this was as a gift, I fell in love with it every since. The smell is wonderful &amp; lingers on you for a long time. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments. It&#x27;s a must have! Shipped within days.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this for a while and it was so expensive in the stores. So glad it was available here at half the price!!! Yes , half the price!!! The fragrance smells fantastic. I will be sneaking in a squirt here and there.LOL...Was packaged well for shipping and has a lovely container for display on the dresser. A definite must have....</li>
            <li> I got this perfume as a gift for my daughter on her birthday she loved it , very elegant bottle and cheap price</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume for my teenage daughter and her cousin, both as birthday gifts separately. When they arrived, i was very pleasantly surprised at how big the bottles are. Especially for the price I paid for them on line here. I have not found a better price thus far for this product in this size. A lot for your money!</li>
            <li> What caught my attention at first was the cute bottle when I was trying some fragances at the perfumerie. I asked for it to try it and... I liked it, but since I tried some others I couldn&#x27;t really tell how amaizing it is until later, what a delicious fragance!!!! Gets better and better! I have a 100 ml bottle and I&#x27;ll make sure I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> My niece Cheyanne loved.  She requested it. Cones with the box</li>
            <li> Great - but doesn&#x27;t last too long, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift for a girl&#x27;s 16th birthday. She loves it! And so do i! I want to buy it for me! It smells so good!</li>
            <li> this is a nice perfume. I have both of hers and I do like them. People compliment me all the time and it does last which to me is very important.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely perfume and cute bottle to boot.  I bought it for a much better deal at Macy&#x27;s though and for the same price I got a combo pack including shower gel, lip gloss, lotion and the big perfume bottle, PLUS a choice of one of two pocketbook/tote bag and it all came in a beautiful box which I have been reusing.</li>
            <li> smells so so good and the best deal i could find anywhere! half the size anywhere else is 35+ yummy buy me!</li>
            <li> The smokey raspberry scent is wonderful.. Has other flowery or sweet notes in it..&lt;br /&gt;My wife can use as much of this as she wants to..it&#x27;s a pretty fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The tin flowers on top make it look like it&#x27;s a cheap bottle...&lt;br /&gt;Good price for such a large amount of a nice, sweet, light scent that is super girly.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my wife and daughter this because I overheard them talking about&lt;br /&gt;how much they both love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am a Selena Gomez fan, and I smelled this at the department store, with the intension of buying it. It gave me a fruity headache. My parents liked it, and the bottle is cute, but I can&#x27;t stand it! Selena Gomez created a strong, fruity scent that I would guess would be appealing to young girls.</li>
            <li> this perfume is absolutely wonderful!!! I haven&#x27;t liked a scent this much in years--this one is number 1 with me now!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The scent was fine but the bottle wasn&#x27;t. The lip decorations were broken off and the level of liquid was not full, indicating a leak. It was a gift and I repaired the decorations after it was opened. The outside of the box looked fine and didn&#x27;t give a clue as to the problem inside.</li>
            <li> My new favorite!  I get complemented multiple times per day when I wear this perfume.  Highly recommend. fruity but elegant at the same time.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product a year ago after smelling it on someone else. I never buy a perfume after trying it out first because you never know how it will smell mixed with your body chemistry.  Well this smells wonderful. When people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing they are usually shocked that its a &amp;#34;celebrity&amp;#34; fragrance and by such a young celebrity. I am complemented all the time.  Personally, I don&#x27;t care for the bottle at all. It&#x27;s those lippy baloon things on the cap I can&#x27;t stand. I would recommend this fragrance to any woman of any age.  It is light and fresh and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Excelet I love the perfume and I think that is the bets pefum that I have in the moment is sweet and big</li>
            <li> Very unique bottle design.  Beautiful box.  Fabulous price.&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is both floral and fruity.&lt;br /&gt;Very feminine.  I would recommend this youthful cologne.</li>
            <li> Was an xmas gift for my niece. Really big bottle smells great</li>
            <li> the bottle is beautiful, great aroma, decorating my nightstand, I recommend it 100%, aroma of sensuality and seduction, ideal for any time of day</li>
            <li> smells fruity and sweet I will give it to my ten year old daughter not ok for an adult women</li>
            <li> 2/3rds of this fragarence was my idea. I like the color of the decanter as well. I love Selena, yeah.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! I wish that it lasted longer on my skin but I love it so much anyway!</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter as a Christmas gift and she absolutly Loved It! Item was much larger than i had expected :) Shipping was fast, Would defiantly recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness this fragrance has got to be one of the best things I have ever smelled!! It&#x27;s light, but not too light, it&#x27;s strong, but not overpowering. You can trust this fragrance to last all day and get many compliments just like I did. My order came just one day after  I ordered and I was very pleased with the secure packaging. Great price, great value, fabulous smell.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  I think it smells like grape.  I bought it at Macys when it first came out and paid around $60 for it.  I thought it was just going to be some young girl fragrance and not something I would use long term.  Well, I ended up using the entire 3.4 oz bottle.  I am amazed.  Normally, I&#x27;ll use perfume for a little while and then get tired of it.  Not this one!  I use it every day.  I get complements on it every time I wear it.  I work in a hospital and I cannot wear strong smelling fragrances, but this one is just right.  I am very sensitive to odors and strong perfumes.  In fact, I think almost all perfumes and colognes are too strong.  I love to smell a great perfume but it seems like when I put one on, it&#x27;s just too strong.  I don&#x27;t feel that way with this perfume.  Also, I found that it is great to keep my shoes smelling fresh.  I spray the bottom of my socks every day before I put on my shoes.  You know how sometimes when you wear dress shoes that you smell a sweaty or smelly odor periodically through the day?  Well, when I spray my socks, I&#x27;ll get a whiff of this perfume instead of a bad odor when my feet get hot.  I know that might sound gross, but it really is refreshing and a nice clean, grape scent smell.  I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Fell in love with smell at a high end retail store. Had never paid $60 a bottle for anything in my life. Now to get it for this cost is great - stocked up - can&#x27;t stand Selena, but she&#x27;s got a great smelling product - I get a lot of compliments on it from men and women both.</li>
            <li> its a gift for family.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I fell in love with the fragance when my grandaughter got this fragance for Christmas, and I happen to try it.  People would think it is only for young girls, but it&#x27;s an awesome after shower, daily fragance to use in the day time.  Ladies, this fragance is also for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift for someone.  She will be happy when she opens it, because she tried the tester at macys. She wanted the parfum since then. I think this scent is great for pre-teens &amp; teens. Its has a soft &amp; pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase. The perfume is delicious and so far it last many hours on my body. The bottle is so cute.</li>
            <li> This product reached all my needs. I love it very, very much. I never want to run out! Thank you Selena Gomez!</li>
            <li> Still trying to get use to this fragance. On certain clothes it smell ok, and then on others not ok.</li>
            <li> because  it  does  turn  on  my  boyfriend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s  good  for  a  hot  date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the  shake  it  up  girls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the  power</li>
            <li> good product would definitely recommend as a purchase... shipping time was excellent</li>
