            <li>I found a great one in Bijan</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>I bought this in a department store and found that the fragrance was very nice and that it lasted for hours.  </li>
            <li>It is not too strong, perfect for someone with allergies like me.  </li>
            <li>, I realized one of the reasons I loved</li>
            <li>Good deal.wife loves it.</li>

            <li>see my comment on the Bijan for Men - It&#x27;s my favorite woman&#x27;s scent on the planet - and now they have one for Mwen!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but I have to be honest....</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fool yourself ladies, this is not Bijan ... doesn&#x27;t have that warm, underlying scent.  </li>
            <li>I immediately went out and bought my own.  </li>
            <li>Strangers walk up to me and tell me how nice I smell or ask me what frangrance I&#x27;m wearing.  </li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m coming into my own with it.</li>
            <li>So glad you can still find this perfume, been looking for it for awhile, great scent and lovely bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cheap copy.  </li>
            <li>Prefect, huge bottle!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is inexpensive and my mother loves it.</li>
            <li>I will order it and hope it is ok.  </li>
            <li>So glad I took the chance</li>
            <li>love the EDT.</li>
            <li>would order more if this wasn&#x27;t the case</li>
            <li>This is my favorite smell.  </li>
            <li>Better price at Amazon than mall.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne.  </li>
            <li>I got 2 for $30 instead of $30 or more dollars for 1.</li>
            <li>Love it and the price for both (men &amp; women)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more compliments on this fragrance than anything I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>

            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>it smells on me, it makes me feel so sexy.</li>
            <li>This IS NOT the original Bijan!</li>
            <li>Also shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and easy on my sinuses, not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>My skin tends to turn most fragrances to an &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; scent - but Bijan stays true to it original fragrance and lasts for hours and hours.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells clean with a beautiful balance between light, medium and deep tones.</li>
            <li>I needed to purchase something else to get the free shipping</li>
            <li>It smells cheap</li>
            <li>and I feel cheap wearing it.</li>
            <li>I love Bijan and I LOVE not having to pay full price ;)</li>
            <li>I knew better, but it received such good reviews ...</li>
            <li>Individuals are unique and therefore have preferences</li>
            <li>This has a wonderful not overwhelming aroma</li>
            <li>I wore the original Bijan for over 10 years, it was my signature scent</li>
            <li>Great price, delivered when expected.</li>
            <li>So I was pleased to find this real stuff.</li>
            <li>Very smooth transaction and highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is warm, long lasting and great for evening wear.</li>
            <li>It smells like a cheap, impostor perfume -- which is exactly what it is.  </li>
            <li>It a wonder spray that I been using for a  long time by getting on line it just as good as gooding to a department store buying it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice big bottle of this spray.</li>
            <li>Just as nice the second time around.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described super fast delivery</li>
            <li>, I recommend this to anyone who loves Bijan or anyone looking for a deep, sensual, relaxing scent :)</li>
            <li>but I remember it smelling better back then.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This perfume was distributed by a company called Five Star Fragrance Company (stated on the box), not Bijan Beverly Hills (like the REAL Bijan states).  </li>
            <li>was reasonable.</li>
            <li>And, some of those perfume discount houses are not sellilng the real Bijan, but a copy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks or the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>I am sure it will last me a very long time, but when it gets low, I will for sure order it again from this company.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells like old ladies.</li>
            <li>and apparently they don&#x27;t accept returns.</li>
            <li>Product arrived in time for christmas and was exactly what I expected!!</li>

            <li> , maybe it&#x27;s less expensive because it&#x27;s not as popular anymore&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The perfume was so watered down you could barely smell any fragrance.</li>
            <li> A few years later, I tried looking for it online - and there it was!!  </li>
            <li> then I spayed a little on and I melted!  </li>
            <li> I usually pick up two at a time.</li>
            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> This is an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> this toilette spray seems to be too weak.</li>
            <li> but it seems to me that it smells outdated.</li>
            <li> This is her fave and is very hard to find, and when you do, it&#x27;s expensive!  </li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t return it-already discarded box.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when it was discontinued in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> am disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this product is awful and you couldn&#x27;t pay me to wear it.</li>
            <li> It smells awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ordered this cologne for my Mom.  She&#x27;s been using it for years and loves it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love, love this fragrance!!!  I was so disappointed when it was discontinued in retail stores.  A few years later, I tried looking for it online - and there it was!!  I love Amazon! I eventually ordered a second one!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is inexpensive and my mother loves it. I usually pick up two at a time. Lasts for about a year (not a perfume). Just like any perfume or Cologne, I suggest you smell it before you buy it. Individuals are unique and therefore have preferences</li>
            <li> I know it is iffy to buy fragrances on line but I have to be honest....I needed to purchase something else to get the free shipping lol  I have been looking for a scent I would like....came across this and said what the heck!  I will order it and hope it is ok.  I got it today and as I was holding it, I realized one of the reasons I loved it was the bottle and weight....then I spayed a little on and I melted!  It is heaven!  So glad I took the chance, I recommend this to anyone who loves Bijan or anyone looking for a deep, sensual, relaxing scent :)</li>
            <li> Thank you. love the EDT. Very smooth transaction and highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> worn this perfume for years and years - always receive compliments</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for Years. The compliments just&lt;br /&gt;keep on coming.  This has a wonderful not overwhelming aroma</li>
            <li> One of the Perfumes does not smell authentic&lt;br /&gt;I  am dissatisfied and disappointed&lt;br /&gt;I would order more if this wasn&#x27;t the case</li>
            <li> Do not buy this perfume from Amazon.  It smells like a cheap, impostor perfume -- which is exactly what it is.  Since I can&#x27;t find this perfume at any of the department stores, I took a chance on this ... I knew better, but it received such good reviews ... I look a chance AND LOST!  This perfume was distributed by a company called Five Star Fragrance Company (stated on the box), not Bijan Beverly Hills (like the REAL Bijan states).  My mistake was thinking &amp;#34;Well, maybe it&#x27;s less expensive because it&#x27;s not as popular anymore&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t fool yourself ladies, this is not Bijan ... doesn&#x27;t have that warm, underlying scent.  It&#x27;s a very cheap copy.  It smells cheap and I feel cheap wearing it.</li>
            <li> It a wonder spray that I been using for a  long time by getting on line it just as good as gooding to a department store buying it.</li>
            <li> Hello. I hope this finds everyone well? This product  pop&#x27;d up underneath my recommendations page. I remember my mother wearing this when I was growing up back in the 1980s. I went ahead and got it. Well it smelled just like it used to. A wonderful memory. It arrived on time.</li>
            <li> My daughter had it and I used it all.  The smell is light and easy on my sinuses, not overpowering.  It took a while for me to&lt;br /&gt;find it but I finally did.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite smell.  I&#x27;m 60 and by now I&#x27;d know..lol&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;It smells clean with a beautiful balance between light, medium and deep tones.</li>
            <li> This is a nice big bottle of this spray. Smells wonderful! I am sure it will last me a very long time, but when it gets low, I will for sure order it again from this company.</li>
            <li> I wore this fragrance several years ago and forgot about it until I saw it on Amazon.  Just as nice the second time around.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance. Better price at Amazon than mall.</li>
            <li> I have used Bijan for Women since 1989 - still quite a classic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is warm, long lasting and great for evening wear.</li>
            <li> Awesome transaction. I looked everywhere in stores looking for this and no one had this. Where else could I go but Amazon!!! Product arrived in time for christmas and was exactly what I expected!!</li>
            <li> Product not what I expected!&lt;br /&gt;Does not come close to smelling anything like a Bijan product! Too bad I can&#x27;t return it-already discarded box.</li>
            <li> Prefect, huge bottle!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne.  It is not too strong, perfect for someone with allergies like me.  I stronly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Good deal.wife loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the best deal I have ever received on buying this perfume.  I&#x27;ve used this for over 17 years and have never gotten it at this price.  Thank you.  I&#x27;ll try this site again to see if I can get it at the same discounted price as I did when I&#x27;m through with the 2 I did buy. I got 2 for $30 instead of $30 or more dollars for 1. Love it!</li>
            <li> Great price, delivered when expected.</li>
            <li> see my comment on the Bijan for Men - It&#x27;s my favorite woman&#x27;s scent on the planet - and now they have one for Mwen! I got one of each and couldn&#x27;t be happier - Just need a girlfriend to give this bottle to!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who has been wearing it for years.  This is her fave and is very hard to find, and when you do, it&#x27;s expensive!  Great price on a great product! Also shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like old ladies.</li>
            <li> It wa for my mom and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Wanted to get a cologne the same as my &amp;#34;MAN&amp;#34;.  This fragrance is wonderful on us.  Love it and the price for both (men &amp; women) was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love it! Excellent Transaction!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Bijan since Christmas of 1993. My friend received it as a gift; I loved it and tried hers.  I immediately went out and bought my own.  I&#x27;ve had more compliments on this fragrance than anything I&#x27;ve ever worn. Strangers walk up to me and tell me how nice I smell or ask me what frangrance I&#x27;m wearing.  I wear only Bijan for women - I&#x27;m not a person who likes to try a different fragrance every day.  My clothes are infused with Bijan and it&#x27;s become my signature scent.  My skin tends to turn most fragrances to an &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; scent - but Bijan stays true to it original fragrance and lasts for hours and hours.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> this toilette spray seems to be too weak. it does not have&lt;br /&gt;much smell at all. Perhaps I should have ordered the parfum.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for many years and love it, but need a stronger scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure but it seems to me that it smells outdated.I haavent used bijan in awhile maybe I just forgot what it smelled like.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell good, and you want compliments, even compliment yourself, this is the fragrance to have. It&#x27;s been around for awhile, but now I&#x27;m coming into my own with it.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Well packaged.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite smell like I remember it smelling when I wore it in the 90&#x27;s. Still smells good but I remember it smelling better back then.</li>
            <li> I love Bijan and I LOVE not having to pay full price ;)</li>
            <li> I have used Bijan for years.  However, trying to locate a Bijan seller is difficult,  I was pleased to find it through Amazon.  And, some of those perfume discount houses are not sellilng the real Bijan, but a copy.  So I was pleased to find this real stuff.</li>
            <li> I wore the original Bijan for over 10 years, it was my signature scent and I absolutely loved it! This IS NOT the original Bijan! It&#x27;s not the same color, and definitely not the same scent! In my opinion, this product is awful and you couldn&#x27;t pay me to wear it. I tried to return it and apparently they don&#x27;t accept returns. So disappointed! It&#x27;s going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Once in awhile, a scent comes along that stands out, yet doesn&#x27;t overpower the user.  I found a great one in Bijan</li>
            <li> So glad you can still find this perfume, been looking for it for awhile, great scent and lovely bottle. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell at all like the Bijan that I remember.  It smells awful.  Hopefully I can find someone to give it to.</li>
            <li> I bought this in a department store and found that the fragrance was very nice and that it lasted for hours.  This one does not last.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this and so do I.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this scent.</li>
            <li> The perfume was so watered down you could barely smell any fragrance. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.LZ</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance...</li>
            <li> Exactly as described super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Have been using Bijan forever!  I absolutely love it and get compliments when using I&#x27;m wearing it.  This is an unbelievable price. So good I bought 2 bottles!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Thanks or the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I choose this product Bijan for women because I like they way it smells on me, it makes me feel so sexy.</li>
