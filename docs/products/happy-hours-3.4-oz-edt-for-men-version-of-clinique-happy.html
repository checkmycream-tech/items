            <li>When I received the product and tested it, I was very pleased!</li>
            <li>Smells just like Clinique Happy.</li>
            <li>I just say Happy For men</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Great product smells good would recommend this others.</li>
            <li>Perfect transaction, thanks, Excellent!!!!</li>
            <li>A must buy if you love clinique happy for men.</li>
            <li>I recommend very good buy, it&#x27;s super for sharpshooters who likes things</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice  citrus but synth  smell.</li>
            <li>The bottle and box are also nice.</li>
            <li>I keep this cologne in my car so if I need to freshen up after work or just want to smell nice</li>
            <li>It smelled.pretty nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusively, if what you are looking to find in this product is the original Clinique Happy for men, this is not your product.</li>
            <li>The cologne does not smell very much like happy by Clinique.</li>
            <li>While it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Clinique Happy for Men</li>
            <li>Ok It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Happy but</li>
            <li>Mostly because it is on my cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still smells pretty good just not near as good as the original happy by Clinique!</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells very clean.</li>
            <li>Buy for decent smell but not to replace Happy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Happy Hours.</li>
            <li>Very similar scent to Happy by Clinique.</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Clinique Happy for Men since it&#x27;s release back in 1999.</li>
            <li>but at this price it is cheap to reapply it as needed.</li>
            <li>$10 to the original product.</li>
            <li>Close to original fragrance.  </li>
            <li>i guess its good to have as a back up though.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off getting the real product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last all day only for about 6 hours,  perfect for special occasions.</li>
            <li>If you want something like Happy but half the cost I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Issue: It smells only remotely similar to the true Clinique Happy for men.</li>
            <li>but it fades very fast.</li>
            <li>Even bathroom colognes smell ten times better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not as  strong and the sent doesn&#x27;t last all day .</li>
            <li>really close. ..</li>
            <li>if you are in a pinch and need something - super similar.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, however my bottle arrived broken</li>
            <li>While I still like the scent, I wish it was a little more similar.&lt;br /&gt;2nd</li>
            <li>Like the original too it does not stay on me for very long.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to</li>
            <li>I purchased this cologne with pretty low expectations.</li>
            <li>Okay with this price, however I found the same one half price nearby my house</li>
            <li>Instead of having a hint of citrus has a hint of old spice smell.</li>
            <li>This spray came so fast and the smell itself lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The smell of it close is close to happy, but sadly doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s an apparent &#x27;alcohol&#x27; smell while spraying it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s close. . .  . really close. .. . but you have to use a lot and it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. Very similar scent to Happy by Clinique. .. .. but there&#x27;s an apparent &#x27;alcohol&#x27; smell while spraying it. I say. .  . if you are in a pinch and need something - super similar. .. .go for it.</li>
            <li> This is just like the Clinique mens fragance</li>
            <li> Smells just like Clinique Happy. My husband loves this.  You can smell it for hours after applying it.</li>
            <li> This spray came so fast and the smell itself lasts a long time. It smells just like the same thing if not better. I would definitely purchase this again especially for the price. A must buy if you love clinique happy for men.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells very clean. It doesn&#x27;t last all day only for about 6 hours,  perfect for special occasions. I would buy it again especially at this price.</li>
            <li> Ok It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Happy but close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not as  strong and the sent doesn&#x27;t last all day . Not Much projection hugs the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned to spray under neck rub in on face like after shave. I pray some in my hands and rub on my arms and if I am going on a date a  little under my arms on the shirt I am wearing. I spray all these area in small amounts and it help to make it last all day. Mostly because it is on my cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice  citrus but synth  smell. If you want something like Happy but half the cost I would recommend. YOu and your girl wont be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh I do get questions like. What are you wearing? I just say Happy For men LOL</li>
            <li> smells just like clinique but it fades very fast. i put some on before i go out and people cant even smell it a half hour later... ill stick to the real happy i guess its good to have as a back up though.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Clinique Happy for Men since it&#x27;s release back in 1999. I&#x27;m usually not a fan of knock off colognes, but this is so close to the original its a little unbelievable!! Very Happy Customer!!</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, however my bottle arrived broken and I had a bag of cologne instead of a bottle I intended to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> The smell of it close is close to happy, but sadly doesn&#x27;t last too long. You&#x27;re better off getting the real product.</li>
            <li> The cologne does not smell very much like happy by Clinique. Instead of having a hint of citrus has a hint of old spice smell. It still smells pretty good just not near as good as the original happy by Clinique! Buy for decent smell but not to replace Happy.</li>
            <li> I gave it only 2 stars because of a couple differing issues that eventually led to my rating.&lt;br /&gt;1st Issue: It smells only remotely similar to the true Clinique Happy for men. While I still like the scent, I wish it was a little more similar.&lt;br /&gt;2nd Issue: The scent wears off in about 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusively, if what you are looking to find in this product is the original Clinique Happy for men, this is not your product. Do yourself a favor and learn from my testimony to save the $10 that would&#x27;ve been spent shipping this product to your doorstep and funnel that. $10 to the original product. You will thank me later!</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money.  Close to original fragrance.  Like the original too it does not stay on me for very long.</li>
            <li> Okay with this price, however I found the same one half price nearby my house</li>
            <li> I recommend very good buy, it&#x27;s super for sharpshooters who likes things this is one of best of the best</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase-smells like Happy without the price tag!  I will purchase again, without a doubt! I highly recommend Happy Hours.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne with pretty low expectations. When I received the product and tested it, I was very pleased! While it doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like Clinique Happy for Men it has the same essence that I like about it. The bottle and box are also nice. It also doesn&#x27;t last the longest but at this price it is cheap to reapply it as needed. I keep this cologne in my car so if I need to freshen up after work or just want to smell nice it&#x27;s there. I will buy this again after I run out!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like it to but it does the trick!</li>
            <li> Perfect transaction, thanks, Excellent!!!!</li>
            <li> This was for me. It smelled.pretty nice. Doesn&#x27;t last long. But for the price can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Great product smells good would recommend this others.</li>
            <li> It might look like the clinique bottle but smells nothing like it. Even bathroom colognes smell ten times better. I wouldnt recommend this bottle for anyone unless they are trying to impress someone that doesnt have the ability to smell.</li>
