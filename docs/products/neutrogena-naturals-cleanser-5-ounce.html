    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and this is the best that there is for me.</li>
            <li>In my case, this product was perfect for my dry-combination skin.</li>
            <li>I started doing a ton of research and read that salicylic acid is great for helping with acne.</li>
            <li>Great seller.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser that makes my face &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; when I use it.</li>
            <li>My friend bought this and did not have a great experience.</li>
            <li>This product gave me a happy medium.</li>
            <li>I thought I loved it because it has a cooling  tingling feelings (which I suspect to be menthol now)</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>and she loved the scent also.</li>
            <li>Follow this with a good moisturizer as always and you&#x27;ll be really satisfied!</li>
            <li>This one is minty and fresh, and it keeps my face feeling awesome without being flaky.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this face wash!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>This is definitely gentle and soothing, it doesn&#x27;t lather, is creamy and has a wonderfully minty cooling sensation that soothes any sore spots on my face and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li>It is especially good if you have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>It was very light and didn&#x27;t leave my skin squeaky afterward.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>well, we love everything \\&quot;natural\\&quot; here.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser and have been using it for 2 years now.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Most of my skin products come from neutrogena</li>
            <li>Well, here&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s been discontinued on the shelves, so I had to turn to Amazon to order more when I ran out.</li>
            <li>I like most things on the Neutrogena Naturals line, but this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>I should have read the ingredient list better.</li>
            <li>It has a nice cool soothing feeling.  </li>
            <li>It was kind of a shock when I first used it, because it gave this cool kind of tingling sensation</li>
            <li>Feels like it&#x27;s cleaning your face real good, but the results are less than satisfying.</li>
            <li>Nothing has ever made my face feel as clean or as soothed, it&#x27;s refreshing in the morning</li>
            <li>At first there is a nice tingling feeling that ended up turning into pain</li>
            <li>yet I have been fine with using their washes from time to time.</li>
            <li>But in this case it was a huge win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It toom a few days for my skin to adjust but it is the best face wash I have bought without having to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li>I am a pretty healthy eater anyway</li>
            <li>The smell was fantastic and sweet.</li>
            <li>so I was extremely excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>, I really was excited that I could find an all-natural acne cleanser from my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m totally willing to shake out the cap for a second considering how great this is for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I was bright red!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not really doing a great job of cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for your skin obviously..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Neutrogena products up until this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li>This is the first effective product in years I&#x27;ve found to ward off adult acne.</li>
            <li>I felt refreshed and clean after the first use.</li>
            <li>Great product, face feels really clean and fresh after using it, clears patches of old dry skin caused by spots.</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective - it has never dried out my skin.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>As far as I know I&#x27;m not allergic to any of the ingredients but this cleanser surely burned me.</li>
            <li>so I took it right off.</li>
            <li>After years of trying different kinds of facial cleansers, I finally found the one that is not only effective, but wonderful to use.</li>
            <li>So I ran home to try it and the first couple of minutes</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be ok since it&#x27;s from the same line</li>
            <li>and I was interested</li>
            <li>This is a great product for people with skin that becomes dry from stronger facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try a cream cleanser since I heard they are better for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I read that certain foods can have an affect on your skin</li>
            <li>This product works very well mild and not harsh to my skin.</li>
            <li>so I cut out soda, sugar, fried foods, reduced my salt intake and stoped eating fast food.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t rate things unless they really work for me.</li>
            <li>And I really hope the redness subsides soon.  </li>
            <li>I usually really like Neutrogena products</li>
            <li>I was attracted to this product by the cream aspect and the advertising that it is gentle.</li>
            <li>My other cleanser was ok to use around my eyes to remove mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, It really helps me skin but be careful it might hurt overly sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>version because it&#x27;s gentler on my sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve used the regular version and that works just fine, too.</li>
            <li>I was in high school.</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra money</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone who has problems with normal cleansers drying them out or leaving their face feeling rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:</li>
            <li>I normally need to rush to get some moisturizer on my face post wash.</li>
            <li>One thing I will say is, during your first few uses your face will get a tint pink and might warm up your face</li>
            <li>Just something new your skins getting used to.</li>
            <li>so I had to try it because I live in Portland and</li>
            <li>I wear very little makeup and my skin is looking better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>Rinse thoroughly and wait 10 min or more before using other skin products such as peroxide or toners/astringents.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, do not buy it!</li>
            <li>After trying it the first time, I could feel the different.</li>
            <li>The first time she used it, her face started to burn and itch, and she hurried to rinse it off only seconds after it touched her face.</li>
            <li>my face is about this clear from using this.</li>
            <li>The natural mint in this product is what I like about it, but beware if your skin is sensitive to Salicylate products, because it will damage</li>
            <li>It completely obliterated all traces of makeup and dirt on my face.</li>
            <li>This stuff can&#x27;t go anywhere near your eyes between the mint and salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years old and my dermatologist says that it is a pre-menopausal acne</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend using this in conjunction with their Natural&#x27;s spot treatment and Multivitamin Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After using this product my face usually burns and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve actually started breaking out more now</li>
            <li>I have been an avid Neutrogena customer for over ten years, I have only purchased Neutrogena products for acne/face wash.</li>
            <li>It might not be for everyone, but for folks with minor breakouts and combination skin like me, i highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It took two hours for my face to finally calm down after using aloe Vera and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my skin clear, and wow does it work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you can get mildew if you&#x27;re not careful!</li>
            <li>So, of course, the major retailers are no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s a new fragrance on your face, so after the 2nd week your skin won&#x27;t react like that anymore.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not irritating, nor does it dry my face out or turn it red when I use it.</li>
            <li>I only bought this because my local store suddenly stopped carrying the other Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleanser I was using.</li>
            <li>I only stumbled across it because I looking for something with Salicylic acid in it - literally the only thing that keeps my face clear of breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that keeps my acne at bay without causing major dryness.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t be getting anything off the shelf that isn&#x27;t natural or organic ingredients because that can ruin your face in the long run.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li>but as soon as I washed off my face, I was shocked to look in the mirror and see my entire face bright red.  </li>

            <li> I have sensitive dry skin</li>
            <li> but as soon as I washed off my face, I was shocked to look in the mirror and see my entire face bright red.  </li>
            <li> I am curious to know what it causing the redness in this \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product and why Neutrogena didn&#x27;t do enough test groups to realize this was a major issue.&lt;br /&gt;Please see Neutrogena&#x27;s site for others with the same problem:</li>
            <li> Long story short, after using this product my face was burning and very red.</li>
            <li> I have tried cleansers from Clearasil, Mary Kay, BeautiControl, Lancome and even the normal line for Neutrogena, but they all left my skin irritated and dried out.</li>
            <li> I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Acne Therapy System and my skin was so badly dried that it took months of using cleansing lotions and tons of moisture intensive treatments to bring it back to normal.</li>
            <li> The next day my entire face was itchy, dry, and peeling.</li>
            <li> I use several of the other products in the Neutrogena Naturals line and have had no problems with them.</li>
            <li> I did something I normally don&#x27;t do and ignored all the negative reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> I have a serious problem finding acne products that don&#x27;t dry my skin to high heaven.</li>
            <li> you use it in the shower, just be careful not to trap water in the cap.</li>
            <li> and there is not much that can be done about it.</li>
            <li> If anything I think this one is just a little less drying vs. the regular Neutrogena line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t drain or dry very well</li>
            <li> Unlike the other reviewer, I had no redness or burning after using the product.</li>
            <li> All other acne cleansers across the board either dried my skin out or made me oily.</li>
            <li> Back then, when I started having serious breakout all over my face, I was trying all kinds of cleanser that would not irritate my skin and still do the cleaning stuff.</li>
            <li> With this product my skin never felt tight.</li>
            <li> It was burning a little bit while I immediately piled on the moisturizer to alleviate the burning sensation.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t seem irritated at all, and nor was my skin &#x27;tight&#x27; or itchy or dried out.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t have harsh chemicals so..</li>
            <li> And that wasn&#x27;t with everyday use of it..</li>
            <li> This thing is so harsh, my God.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This cleanser makes my face sooo red and leaves it with a burning sensation, it&#x27;s worse than a sunburn!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve tried everything, and I mean everything, and nothing is taking it away.</li>
            <li> Just because it doesn&#x27;t work for you doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for someone else.</li>
            <li> Using as directed and After less than a minute on my face, I came away with a bad chemical burn that felt and looked like an extreme sunburn.</li>
            <li> It broke me so bad after the second use.</li>
            <li> I hope this experience doesn&#x27;t make my acne even worse than it is now.</li>

            <li> but I had to share my disappointment with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> It smells bad and doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that&#x27;s a terrible ingredient.</li>
            <li> The Acne cream cleanser is probably the worst thing I&#x27;ve had on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done that before with HORRIBLE results.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it in the shower.  It has a nice cool soothing feeling.  Feels like it&#x27;s cleaning your face real good, but the results are less than satisfying.</li>
            <li> This stuff chemically burned my face!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It is especially good if you have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts. Gentle and effective - it has never dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a stronger acidic cleanser with 1% instead of .5 (½)%  salicylic acid. Rinse thoroughly and wait 10 min or more before using other skin products such as peroxide or toners/astringents.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at $ Store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my face cleanser soulmate! I want to buy this product in bulk so I never run out even if they stop making it. I want to pass a bottle on to my firstborn child someday. Nothing has ever made my face feel as clean or as soothed, it&#x27;s refreshing in the morning and it&#x27;s gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash! I have always been a fan of neutrogena but about a year ago, I started getting acne. It was so frustrating and annoying to be in my mid 20&#x27;s and have ance like I was in high school. I started doing a ton of research and read that salicylic acid is great for helping with acne. So I found this affordable face wash and tried it out. I saw instant results within a week. It toom a few days for my skin to adjust but it is the best face wash I have bought without having to spend a fortune. I srill get the occasional breakout, but nothing like I was experiencing.  I also changed my diet a bit. I read that certain foods can have an affect on your skin so I cut out soda, sugar, fried foods, reduced my salt intake and stoped eating fast food. I am a pretty healthy eater anyway but with these adjustments and daily use of this facial wash, the results have exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t have harsh chemicals so.. it&#x27;s good for your skin obviously.. my face is about this clear from using this. I wasn&#x27;t a regular face washer but now I am cause I wanted healthier and younger looking skin and this product did that for me after about 3 weeks max. And that wasn&#x27;t with everyday use of it.. so that&#x27;s definitely worth it. I don&#x27;t rate things unless they really work for me. You shouldn&#x27;t be getting anything off the shelf that isn&#x27;t natural or organic ingredients because that can ruin your face in the long run. One thing I will say is, during your first few uses your face will get a tint pink and might warm up your face but it&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s a new fragrance on your face, so after the 2nd week your skin won&#x27;t react like that anymore. Just something new your skins getting used to. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Yes it tingles. Yes it makes my face red. But it has cleared all trace of problem acne. I use it about 5 nights a week and it balances my skin and makes it feel so refreshed before bedtime. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  This is the first effective product in years I&#x27;ve found to ward off adult acne. Well worth the extra money</li>
            <li> PRODUCT DELIVERS AS PROMISED...</li>
            <li> It smells bad and doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work for some people though it&#x27;s a risk buying it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine at walmart though</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve known people who have gotten rashes and stuff from Neutrogena products yet I have been fine with using their washes from time to time. I saw this in the store so I had to try it because I live in Portland and well, we love everything \\&quot;natural\\&quot; here. So I ran home to try it and the first couple of minutes I thought I loved it because it has a cooling  tingling feelings (which I suspect to be menthol now) but as soon as I washed off my face, I was shocked to look in the mirror and see my entire face bright red.  It was burning a little bit while I immediately piled on the moisturizer to alleviate the burning sensation. Not gonna lie, it&#x27;s freaking me out! I hope this experience doesn&#x27;t make my acne even worse than it is now. And I really hope the redness subsides soon.  Ugh!</li>
            <li> After one use I was left with a burning red face. It broke me so bad after the second use. This thing is so harsh, my God. Waste of my money. If you have sensitive skin, do not buy it!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser and have been using it for 2 years now. Back then, when I started having serious breakout all over my face, I was trying all kinds of cleanser that would not irritate my skin and still do the cleaning stuff. After trying it the first time, I could feel the different. It was very light and didn&#x27;t leave my skin squeaky afterward. The smell was fantastic and sweet. I bought it together with the cream. I didn&#x27;t end up using all the cream but giving it to my mom. She loved it. She told me it was moisturizing her skin so well and she loved the scent also. I would recommend you to get this.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my skin clear, and wow does it work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this once daily to wash my face in the shower. The cooling sensation helps wake me up, too! I like this &amp;#34;naturals&amp;#34; version because it&#x27;s gentler on my sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve used the regular version and that works just fine, too. If anything I think this one is just a little less drying vs. the regular Neutrogena line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it in the shower, just be careful not to trap water in the cap. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t drain or dry very well and you can get mildew if you&#x27;re not careful! But I&#x27;m totally willing to shake out the cap for a second considering how great this is for my skin.</li>
            <li> Great seller. This product works very well mild and not harsh to my skin.</li>
            <li> I usually really like Neutrogena products but this one didn&#x27;t work so well for me. After using this product my face usually burns and I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve actually started breaking out more now that I use this product. I have sensitive dry skin so I wanted to try a cream cleanser since I heard they are better for people with dry skin. But I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Most of my skin products come from neutrogena so I was extremely excited to try this product. Long story short, after using this product my face was burning and very red. I will never use another neutrogena product and if I could give this 0 stars, then I would. Do not buy this!!!!!</li>
            <li> Well, here&#x27;s another thing that&#x27;s been discontinued on the shelves, so I had to turn to Amazon to order more when I ran out. This is a great cleanser that makes my face &amp;#34;breathe&amp;#34; when I use it. It&#x27;s not irritating, nor does it dry my face out or turn it red when I use it. A little bit goes a long way too. I like most things on the Neutrogena Naturals line, but this one is my favorite. So, of course, the major retailers are no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li> Great product, face feels really clean and fresh after using it, clears patches of old dry skin caused by spots.</li>
            <li> After years of trying different kinds of facial cleansers, I finally found the one that is not only effective, but wonderful to use. This is a great product for people with skin that becomes dry from stronger facial cleansers. I have tried cleansers from Clearasil, Mary Kay, BeautiControl, Lancome and even the normal line for Neutrogena, but they all left my skin irritated and dried out. This one is minty and fresh, and it keeps my face feeling awesome without being flaky. I recommend it to everyone who has problems with normal cleansers drying them out or leaving their face feeling rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: My friend bought this and did not have a great experience. The first time she used it, her face started to burn and itch, and she hurried to rinse it off only seconds after it touched her face. She checked later with her dermatologist and she found out that she was allergic to mint and menthol products. The natural mint in this product is what I like about it, but beware if your skin is sensitive to Salicylate products, because it will damage</li>
            <li> I really love this. I only stumbled across it because I looking for something with Salicylic acid in it - literally the only thing that keeps my face clear of breakouts. It was kind of a shock when I first used it, because it gave this cool kind of tingling sensation I suspect is from the menthol. It completely obliterated all traces of makeup and dirt on my face. Unlike the other reviewer, I had no redness or burning after using the product. My face didn&#x27;t seem irritated at all, and nor was my skin &#x27;tight&#x27; or itchy or dried out. I really like this! I&#x27;m definitely buying it again.</li>
            <li> I agree with the last post. I&#x27;ve used the neutrogena naturals line for a while, but it never helped with my problem combination skin. All other acne cleansers across the board either dried my skin out or made me oily. This product gave me a happy medium. I felt refreshed and clean after the first use. I normally need to rush to get some moisturizer on my face post wash. With this product my skin never felt tight. It might not be for everyone, but for folks with minor breakouts and combination skin like me, i highly recommend! I use the night cream before bed, and the even tone SPF 30 cream during the day. I wear very little makeup and my skin is looking better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, It really helps me skin but be careful it might hurt overly sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I feel like beauty products that contain mint should have a giant warning label. It&#x27;s not that&#x27;s a terrible ingredient. It&#x27;s just a shock when it hits your skin and you aren&#x27;t prepared for that cool/burning affect. I only bought this because my local store suddenly stopped carrying the other Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleanser I was using. I thought it would be ok since it&#x27;s from the same line but I&#x27;m not a fan. I should have read the ingredient list better. My other cleanser was ok to use around my eyes to remove mascara. This stuff can&#x27;t go anywhere near your eyes between the mint and salicylic acid.  My skin doesn&#x27;t break out enough to warrant salicylic acid exposure every day. Thank goodness Amazon still carries my preferred one in two packs!</li>
            <li> I use several of the other products in the Neutrogena Naturals line and have had no problems with them. The Acne cream cleanser is probably the worst thing I&#x27;ve had on my face. Using as directed and After less than a minute on my face, I came away with a bad chemical burn that felt and looked like an extreme sunburn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Neutrogena products up until this facial cleanser. At first there is a nice tingling feeling that ended up turning into pain so I took it right off. I looked at my face in the mirror and I was bright red! As far as I know I&#x27;m not allergic to any of the ingredients but this cleanser surely burned me. It took two hours for my face to finally calm down after using aloe Vera and moisturizer. The next day my entire face was itchy, dry, and peeling. Will not be using a Neutrogena Naturals product again</li>
            <li> This is the only product that keeps my acne at bay without causing major dryness. I wish it would take it away but I&#x27;ve tried everything, and I mean everything, and nothing is taking it away. I&#x27;m 50 years old and my dermatologist says that it is a pre-menopausal acne and there is not much that can be done about it. Even though it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of the acne, I give it five stars because I feel like I&#x27;ve literally tried everything and this is the best that there is for me.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid Neutrogena customer for over ten years, I have only purchased Neutrogena products for acne/face wash. I saw this Naturals Acne Cream Cleanser in Target and I was interested, I really was excited that I could find an all-natural acne cleanser from my favorite brand. I don&#x27;t often write online reviews but I had to share my disappointment with Neutrogena. This cleanser makes my face sooo red and leaves it with a burning sensation, it&#x27;s worse than a sunburn! And if I use a toner or witch hazel after I wash I still get leftover dirt/make-up. So for all that redness and irritation it&#x27;s not really doing a great job of cleaning my face. Totally disappointed in this product. I am curious to know what it causing the redness in this \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product and why Neutrogena didn&#x27;t do enough test groups to realize this was a major issue.&lt;br /&gt;Please see Neutrogena&#x27;s site for others with the same problem: [...]</li>
            <li> I did something I normally don&#x27;t do and ignored all the negative reviews on this product. I&#x27;ve done that before with HORRIBLE results. But in this case it was a huge win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s skin is different when rating a product. Just because it doesn&#x27;t work for you doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for someone else. In my case, this product was perfect for my dry-combination skin. I have a serious problem finding acne products that don&#x27;t dry my skin to high heaven. I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Acne Therapy System and my skin was so badly dried that it took months of using cleansing lotions and tons of moisture intensive treatments to bring it back to normal. I was attracted to this product by the cream aspect and the advertising that it is gentle. This is definitely gentle and soothing, it doesn&#x27;t lather, is creamy and has a wonderfully minty cooling sensation that soothes any sore spots on my face and leaves my skin glowing. After using it for only a matter of days, I&#x27;ve noticed the cluster of whiteheads and acne that have been on my chin for months are finally clearing up. Follow this with a good moisturizer as always and you&#x27;ll be really satisfied! I&#x27;d recommend using this in conjunction with their Natural&#x27;s spot treatment and Multivitamin Moisturizer.</li>
