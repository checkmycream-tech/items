            <li>It&#x27;s cheap!!</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my hair after I wash with it!</li>
            <li>I often get compliments on how nice my hair smells after using this.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t justify spending that kind of money on shampoo.</li>
            <li>Really nice smell.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well, but I would have liked to have known it has a coconut-like scent.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it feels.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is awesome, especially with our Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and still love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with a conditioner (I like to switch up between Suave Humectant Conditioner and Aussie Moist), and my hair always feels healthy.</li>
            <li>My kids love the smell of this shampoo...kind of coconutty.  </li>
            <li>This, along with same conditioner, is awesome!!  </li>
            <li>like this shampoo/conditioner set much better than the gold</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>love this shampoo</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>this is top shelf quality for suave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously though, if I didn&#x27;t use Suave moisturizing conditioner I would never be able to get a comb or brush through my ultra-fine hair without ripping it out or breaking it off.</li>
            <li>it...if you don&#x27;t love it, you can get your money back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I partially dry my hair while scrunching it and that seems to keep the curl the best,  or of course curlers.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not so easy to find in my area.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a big bottle and it works great and was very worth the price would buy again!</li>
            <li>This Humectant Moisture leaves my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the ONLY thing good about having terribly fine hair...</li>
            <li>I follow up with the conditioner as well and the clean smell lasts longer than I am clean.</li>
            <li>Always felt like my hair is clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>your shampoo costs are minimal - lol.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Above all this is a good shampoo, but you need to use it in combination with the conditioner, especially if you are buying it for the purpose of using on</li>
            <li>It does smell great and you can&#x27;t beat the price for a large bottle (especially if you purchase it through subscribe and save).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shampoo, but not worth the money these third-party Amazon sellers are asking for it.</li>
            <li>Used with the conditioner I can easily comb and untangle my hair gently after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large</li>
            <li>/&gt;Redken All-Soft is fantastic for moisturizing and conditioning but you will pay about 10X as much.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Seems pretty close to Nexxus Therrape, and a lot cheaper too.</li>
            <li>BUT...if you sign up for the &amp;#34;Subscribe &amp; Save&amp;#34; (automatic shipping every &amp;#34;so often&amp;#34; ) you don&#x27;t have to have a minimum purchase.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny and clean with this inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>Extremely silky effect, great big bottle.</li>
            <li>I have very long, dry, coarse and curly hair that requires a lot of product to style, which would then require a good shampoo to cleanse without drying my hair even more, and this is the only shampoo that is able to cleanse my hair well and keep moist.</li>
            <li>Not only does this shampoo clean all of the product right out, but it repairs the damage from blow-drying.</li>
            <li>&gt;  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It REALLY helps.</li>
            <li>One consideration is that I do use a very pricey conditioner with this.</li>
            <li>it really does the job...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleans hair gently while keeping moisture or</li>
            <li>they did a good job very equal to nexxus brand which is extremely expensive!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not get the conditioner because I use  Neutrogena Clean Replenishing Deep Recovery Hair Mask.</li>
            <li>(main reason I bought it)</li>
            <li>Super low price.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well as any high priced shampoo</li>
            <li>Usually shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; soft at all, but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>have ultra fine hair, it breaks easily and tangles horribly without the use of good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortuantely, Amazon no longer offers this shampoo as part of the Subscribe and Save program, so I&#x27;ve stopped buying from them</li>
            <li>Surprised me...</li>
            <li>(I use the conditioner too, and don&#x27;t rinse all of it out - my hair is so soft &amp; silky -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Originally, this was an Amazon &amp;#34;Add On&amp;#34; item, meaning you have to have a purchase of at least $25 or more to qualify, even if you are a Prime Member...</li>
            <li>Suave shampoo does exactly the same at a fraction of the cost--and it even smells the same!</li>
            <li>From the second I start shampooing, my hair is sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, straight Asian hair, so I use a lot of products on a daily basis to style it and give it some life.</li>
            <li>I think this is a little higher quality than the matching conditioner.  </li>
            <li>With most shampoo products my hair either feels dried out, waxed down, smells of flowers or my skin is left feeling red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is absolutely as good as, if not better than, any expensive &#x27;salon&#x27; shampoo.  </li>
            <li> used may diffent products both expensive and cheap</li>
            <li> dry hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> to go on record, I think the ingredients listed here are wrong with Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, my bottle clearly states Sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) and that is not to be confused with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) that so many people are trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even though Suave is probably one of the most inexpensive brands on the market, almost every other brand, be it really expensive or not, does not do half a well as what Suave does!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being that I also have very dry skin, I have found that using this shampoo as a body wash followed by the conditioner helps.</li>
            <li> bottle should last a few months.</li>
            <li> Why the dramatic price change?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I really like this shampoo for moisturizing my hair.</li>
            <li> cause i usually have of items in same box</li>
            <li> the years I have used many expensive and not so expensive shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Suave</li>
            <li> Not when Suave Humectant is availble for less than $2</li>
            <li> Our hairdresser noticed, however, that their hair was very dry after using this the past 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Works beautifully on long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It does take a while to wash the conditioner off, but I don&#x27;t mind staying in the shower a little longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it seems to heavy for your hair, you can put it on the ends.</li>
            <li> As a Caucasian male with thin oily hair</li>
            <li> Tried other but other brands left my hair feeling dirty</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this isn&#x27;t described somewhere on the bottle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to find products that work.</li>
            <li> I hate my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just hate going to Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Bought this shampoo to try it out. Love the smell and the way it feels. Amazon price is awesome, especially with our Subscribe &amp; Save. The shampoo has a pleasant smell that is not overpowering so that you don&#x27;t feel like you just took a bath in perfume. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This item was as described arrived on time it&#x27;s a big bottle and it works great and was very worth the price would buy again!</li>
            <li> Seems pretty close to Nexxus Therrape, and a lot cheaper too. No need to spend $20 a bottle on shampoo</li>
            <li> I often get compliments on how nice my hair smells after using this. My hair is soft, shiny and clean with this inexpensive product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and still love it.</li>
            <li> Suave, shampoo, humectant moisture, 28oz  ...really one of the best suave hair products out there.. smells great &amp; cleans your hair great</li>
            <li> Smells great. Moisturizes great. EXCELLENT value for your $$.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have used many expensive and not so expensive shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;Suave Humectant is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else comes close to this performance/dollar ratio.&lt;br /&gt;Redken All-Soft is fantastic for moisturizing and conditioning but you will pay about 10X as much. I&#x27;m a working class girl and I can&#x27;t justify spending that kind of money on shampoo. Not when Suave Humectant is availble for less than $2</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. I have dry, straight Asian hair, so I use a lot of products on a daily basis to style it and give it some life. Not only does this shampoo clean all of the product right out, but it repairs the damage from blow-drying. I use this in combination with a conditioner (I like to switch up between Suave Humectant Conditioner and Aussie Moist), and my hair always feels healthy. Unfortuantely, Amazon no longer offers this shampoo as part of the Subscribe and Save program, so I&#x27;ve stopped buying from them and I now buy from local big-box retailers. It&#x27;s a great shampoo, but not worth the money these third-party Amazon sellers are asking for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap!! Effective!! And smells really good! I love the feel of my hair after I wash with it! Can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
            <li> My kids love the smell of this shampoo...kind of coconutty.  It does smell great and you can&#x27;t beat the price for a large bottle (especially if you purchase it through subscribe and save).  Our hairdresser noticed, however, that their hair was very dry after using this the past 2 months.  Since my kids still like it, we still use it, but alternate between another shampoo.</li>
            <li> This, along with same conditioner, is awesome!!  Usually shampoo doesn&#x27;t make my hair \\&quot;feel\\&quot; soft at all, but this stuff is amazing.  From the second I start shampooing, my hair is sooo soft.  Surprised me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this shampoo/conditioner set much better than the gold Suave (argan??).  This Humectant Moisture leaves my hair silky smooth.  (I use the conditioner too, and don&#x27;t rinse all of it out - my hair is so soft &amp; silky - not greasy/oily at all!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair doesnt feel stripped when I use this. I follow up with the conditioner as well and the clean smell lasts longer than I am clean.</li>
            <li> Why the dramatic price change?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I really like this shampoo for moisturizing my hair. If I leave in curly or I strighten it. It REALLY helps. At $2.88, 28 oz; who wouldn&#x27;t try. I think its great for almost all hair types. If it seems to heavy for your hair, you can put it on the ends. I did not get the conditioner because I use  Neutrogena Clean Replenishing Deep Recovery Hair Mask. For the summer I will buy the conditioner because I tend to wash my hair more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on Amazon November 20th and only paid $2.88 (main reason I bought it) I wanted to order another one yesterday but I&#x27;m reluctant because its now $10.95. I will probably buy at the store instead of paying $10.95. I use amazon prime by the way.</li>
            <li> Finally found a shampoo, and an affordable one too, that maximizes the wave in my hair! Been using it for 6 months and am sticking with this one.  I partially dry my hair while scrunching it and that seems to keep the curl the best,  or of course curlers.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  It works just as well as any high priced shampoo but it&#x27;s not so easy to find in my area.  One consideration is that I do use a very pricey conditioner with this. My hair is coarse and wavy.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for the price.  Have been using this for years and wont buy anything else.  Tried other but other brands left my hair feeling dirty</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look good. I think this is a little higher quality than the matching conditioner.  Always felt like my hair is clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo it really does the job...used may diffent products both expensive and cheap but this shampoo is wonderful</li>
            <li> As a Caucasian male with thin oily hair it&#x27;s hard to find products that work. With most shampoo products my hair either feels dried out, waxed down, smells of flowers or my skin is left feeling red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to go on record, I think the ingredients listed here are wrong with Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate, my bottle clearly states Sodium laureth sulfate (SLES) and that is not to be confused with sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) that so many people are trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that I also have very dry skin, I have found that using this shampoo as a body wash followed by the conditioner helps. It does take a while to wash the conditioner off, but I don&#x27;t mind staying in the shower a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all this is a good shampoo, but you need to use it in combination with the conditioner, especially if you are buying it for the purpose of using on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this shampoo works great for my family and I hope it works for yours. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Forget the overpriced salon shampoo. Suave shampoo does exactly the same at a fraction of the cost--and it even smells the same!</li>
            <li> Same as conditioner. Really nice smell. Great value for the price. Works just as well as salon products. Good buy</li>
            <li> I have very long, dry, coarse and curly hair that requires a lot of product to style, which would then require a good shampoo to cleanse without drying my hair even more, and this is the only shampoo that is able to cleanse my hair well and keep moist. I&#x27;ve used it for 7 years.</li>
            <li> good price. good quailty. great smelling. this is top shelf quality for suave. been using this for quite some time now. i used to use nexxus humectris .which is basiclly what they copied. they did a good job very equal to nexxus brand which is extremely expensive!!&lt;br /&gt;come in sealed plastic bag in case of accident. which is great idea cause i usually have of items in same box</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, but I would have liked to have known it has a coconut-like scent. I am not sure why this isn&#x27;t described somewhere on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Best when used with the matching humectant moisturizing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ultra fine hair, it breaks easily and tangles horribly without the use of good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans hair gently while keeping moisture or whatever...blah, blah. blah.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, if I didn&#x27;t use Suave moisturizing conditioner I would never be able to get a comb or brush through my ultra-fine hair without ripping it out or breaking it off. I hate my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funny thing...even though Suave is probably one of the most inexpensive brands on the market, almost every other brand, be it really expensive or not, does not do half a well as what Suave does! This is the ONLY thing good about having terribly fine hair...your shampoo costs are minimal - lol. Used with the conditioner I can easily comb and untangle my hair gently after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large 28 oz. bottle should last a few months. I am timing it out now to have it automatically delivered every &amp;#34;so often.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally, this was an Amazon &amp;#34;Add On&amp;#34; item, meaning you have to have a purchase of at least $25 or more to qualify, even if you are a Prime Member...BUT...if you sign up for the &amp;#34;Subscribe &amp; Save&amp;#34; (automatic shipping every &amp;#34;so often&amp;#34; ) you don&#x27;t have to have a minimum purchase. Either way, the price is great, and saves me time, money and hassle of having to go to..ugh.. Wal-Mart. I just hate going to Wal-Mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it...if you don&#x27;t love it, you can get your money back.&lt;br /&gt;If this review has helped...hit the thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Extremely silky effect, great big bottle. Super low price.  This is absolutely as good as, if not better than, any expensive &#x27;salon&#x27; shampoo.  Works beautifully on long thick hair.</li>
