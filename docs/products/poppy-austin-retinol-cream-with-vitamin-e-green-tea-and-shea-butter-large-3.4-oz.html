            <li>I am glad that I took advantage of it.</li>
            <li>I love the pump vs tube containers.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream because it can be used by both he and I.</li>
            <li>Teens and younger girls in their 20s can help to keep their skin looking its best.</li>
            <li>I ordered this anti aging moisturizer because many ingredients that make up this moisturizer are organic.  </li>
            <li>This face cream is just okay.  </li>
            <li>The feel and texture of the cream is very nice, and not thick or goopy.  </li>
            <li>I love the Poppy Austin line and was excited to try their Retinol cream.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily and you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your face.  </li>
            <li>I apply it before makeup as my new morning routine as well as before bedtime after a good facewashing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 now and fine wrinkles have started forming around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The product is smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>I use this as a night cream and u wake up to sift, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I currently use their vitamin C serum and have been happy with it.</li>
            <li>I am in my early thirties and should have started a better skin care routine sooner, but I feel confident that this one is doing its job well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the vender offers more ounces than competitors while maintaining discount pricing.</li>
            <li>I also love how much cream I received.</li>
            <li>There is a light fragrance to the cream when you first apply but it does not linger.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list also includes jojoba oil which is one of my favorite new oils to use on my skin to soften it up.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and neither of our skin feels oily or sticky after using it, but it does feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am hoping to mainly smooth out fine lines around my eyes and fade old acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft and radiant my skin is after using the product.</li>
            <li>The bottle is elegant and professional in style.</li>
            <li>I have been using this anti aging moisturizer at night because it does say it can be sun sensitive during the day, so just to be on the safe side</li>
            <li>so if you are sensitive to smells, I think this one is ok.  </li>
            <li>The above comments are my own words.</li>
            <li>This one is lovely but so very faint in scent that it&#x27;s perfect for what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That is pretty rare for company.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of allergies and very sensitive skin, but know that I would be fine with the retinol and my instincts were correct.  </li>
            <li>I like the dispenser since it does not waste product, and comes out easily.  </li>
            <li>I really liked that there was very little scent, as I am irritated easily by strong scents.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the simple, sleek bottle.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the makers of this product!</li>
            <li>and my face is feeling better overall since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would gladly use these ingredients independent of each other, but am excited to have a single cream combining all the things I know to be good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely notice a difference in my skin - fine lines are fading after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Purchased for improving facial fine lines.</li>
            <li>This one is very soothing and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>and I am freaking out about wrinkles and my skin looking fresh and young.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, the pump dispenser does not clog or dispense too much or too little of the cream.</li>
            <li>(there are other ingredients, but I am listing my favorite ones that have been included in this cream)  </li>
            <li>SO, I am trying out some new products to reduce my anxiety of the lines on my face!  </li>
            <li>Now that we are in our mid 30s it has become increasingly important to use to keep our faces looking as young as we can.</li>
            <li>So many similar products come in much smaller volumes.</li>
            <li>and I was concerned about most Retinol products being harsh.</li>
            <li>I love the combination of retinol, green tea shea butter and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>It helps to reduce the signs of aging, reduce the affects of sun damaged skin, lighten dark spots, fill in fine lines and wrinkles and reduce the appearance of age spots.</li>
            <li>This cream was thick but felt very light on my face.  </li>
            <li>Made my face soft and look smoother</li>
            <li>The Retinal cream does on and feels light and not greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li>I was like wow</li>
            <li>and then I gasped &amp; said out loud &amp;#34;IT&#x27;S THAT RETINOL CREAM!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>This product works well with my skin which is sensitive with rosacea.</li>
            <li>I like it so far, don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in my skin, but I like the ingredients</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product a few days, but I feel confident it is working.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any major difference on my skin after weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much into creams and such, but whatever is in this bottle really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I have a very hard time with strong perfume smells or overly scented products.  </li>
            <li>I only use a little bit and it&#x27;s a large bottle!</li>
            <li>But it can also be used to hydrate dry skin or to keep young skin healthier.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I know I need a good retinol based cream. I&#x27;m 45 now and fine wrinkles have started forming around my eyes.  I am now using this cream from Poppy Austin for three days and it feels soothing on my skin and I was concerned about most Retinol products being harsh. Not this one. No harmful ingredients to cause a skin reaction.  I am very sensitive and my skin breaks out if I get any greasy or thick cream, and I get red splotches with some creams.  This one is very soothing and does not irritate my skin.  It feels very good at night and in the morning.  I apply it before makeup as my new morning routine as well as before bedtime after a good facewashing.  I like the dispenser since it does not waste product, and comes out easily.  The feel and texture of the cream is very nice, and not thick or goopy.  It&#x27;s not greasy and the scent is so very light.  I have a very hard time with strong perfume smells or overly scented products.  This one is lovely but so very faint in scent that it&#x27;s perfect for what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shop a lot on Amazon and love health and beauty products, so I was thrilled to receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  Poppy Austin has a great product and I will be happy to reorder again.  This bottle will last a very long time though.  I only use a little bit and it&#x27;s a large bottle!</li>
            <li> realy like this feels good great container and good price</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because I am not sure if I like it yet , it hasn&#x27;t been long time to see results</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this product. The fragrance is perfect and not over powering. The product is smooth and creamy. After exfoliating I apply it and it feels so good on my skin. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as it use to. I love this is will reorder.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love the simple, sleek bottle.  This cream was thick but felt very light on my face.  I have been concerned in the past about Retinol creams being too harsh on my sensitive skin but this one has not aggravated my face at all.  I am in my early thirties and should have started a better skin care routine sooner, but I feel confident that this one is doing its job well. I am using it at night after washing and exfoliating.  I use it in the morning and have had no problems applying make up afterwards. I really liked that there was very little scent, as I am irritated easily by strong scents.&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping to mainly smooth out fine lines around my eyes and fade old acne scars.  I have only been using this product a few days, but I feel confident it is working.  I will update as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to receive this product at a discounted price in exchange of an HONEST review.</li>
            <li> Loved it!! Made my face soft and look smoother</li>
            <li> Amazing cream - I love the Poppy Austin line and was excited to try their Retinol cream. I definitely notice a difference in my skin - fine lines are fading after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream and u wake up to sift, smooth skin.</li>

I had the opportunity to get this product through a promotion and I am so glad that I was able to try it.  I would purchase this product again and have already recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. It works well with the Poppy Austin Argan oil I use before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Great product and value!!! Customer service is excellent!</li>
            <li> This is AAAHHH-MAZZZ-INNNGG!! After using this for only 2 days. (one application at night) I happened to be walking past a mirror &amp; did a double take.  I was like wow my skin looks good...and then I gasped &amp; said out loud &amp;#34;IT&#x27;S THAT RETINOL CREAM!&amp;#34;  I also use the rosehip oil after applying.  I absolutely love this brand &amp; am glad I took advantage of the promotional offer! #HOOKEDONPOPPY</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, very rich and moisturizing, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using retinol cream since March. I started with another brand but switched to Poppy Austin in June when I saw they came out with this product. I currently use their vitamin C serum and have been happy with it. One thing that I like about this retinol anti aging moisturizer is that it&#x27;s cream based and not oil. It spreads easily and you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover your face.  I also like the other ingredients included with the retinol: green tea, vitamin E and Shea butter.  This product works well with my skin which is sensitive with rosacea. Since I have been using this product my nose which is normally red and irritated from rosacea has cleared up. I received a discount when purchasing this product. I am glad that I took advantage of it.</li>
            <li> Despite the good reviews, I find this too greasy for combination skill, even on the cheeks.  I have used it for a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in my skin, but I like the ingredients so I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for improving facial fine lines.Works great. Very light non greasy. No overpowering scent. Just as described by the vendor. I&#x27;m glad the vender offers more ounces than competitors while maintaining discount pricing. I love the pump vs tube containers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and had one white bump under my eye.  Looked it up online and it&#x27;s called Melia.  Looked for solutions and retinol cream popped up.  I&#x27;ve had this bump foe 2 months and tried everything to get it to go away.  I used this product for 2 days and it turned dark and fell off. No joke. I&#x27;m not much into creams and such, but whatever is in this bottle really worked for me. Thanks to the makers of this product! 😆</li>
            <li> I have seen no results from using this product</li>
            <li> I received this Retinol Cream by Poppy Austin and I really love it. I use it every night before I go to bed, but my husband uses it every morning before he goes to work and before he goes to bed. Now that we are in our mid 30s it has become increasingly important to use to keep our faces looking as young as we can. I love this cream because it can be used by both he and I. There is a light fragrance to the cream when you first apply but it does not linger. It absorbs very quickly and neither of our skin feels oily or sticky after using it, but it does feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This retinol cream is filled with ingredients that are great for skin. I love the combination of retinol, green tea shea butter and jojoba oil. I would gladly use these ingredients independent of each other, but am excited to have a single cream combining all the things I know to be good for my skin. (there are other ingredients, but I am listing my favorite ones that have been included in this cream)  I love how soft and radiant my skin is after using the product. It is very easy to use, the pump dispenser does not clog or dispense too much or too little of the cream. The bottle is elegant and professional in style. I also love how much cream I received. So many similar products come in much smaller volumes. This size will last my husband and me a couple of months of daily use which is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intended uses of this cream to is to promote healthier, younger looking skin. It helps to reduce the signs of aging, reduce the affects of sun damaged skin, lighten dark spots, fill in fine lines and wrinkles and reduce the appearance of age spots. But it can also be used to hydrate dry skin or to keep young skin healthier. Teens and younger girls in their 20s can help to keep their skin looking its best. I wish I would have started face skin care when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very interesting fact about this product is that it is manufactured in a woman operated and staffed facility. That is pretty rare for company.  They offer a complete money back guarantee with no questions asked within 90 days of purchase for anyone that is not pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Poppy Austin Argan oil until I tried this.  Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as the organ oil.  No noticeable benefit to using it.  It does feel wonderful putting it on.  Very soothing.</li>
            <li> I am turning 40 this month and I am freaking out about wrinkles and my skin looking fresh and young.  SO, I am trying out some new products to reduce my anxiety of the lines on my face!  I ordered this anti aging moisturizer because many ingredients that make up this moisturizer are organic.  The ingredient list also includes jojoba oil which is one of my favorite new oils to use on my skin to soften it up.  It also has organic sunflower oil and aloe vera.  I have been using this anti aging moisturizer at night because it does say it can be sun sensitive during the day, so just to be on the safe side, I chose to use it as my nighttime moisturizer.  I use it after I wash my face and apply my vitamin c serum.  I apply it all over my face and neck and go to bed.  I don&#x27;t feel like there is any smell to this moisturizer so if you are sensitive to smells, I think this one is ok.  It feels great when it goes on and my face is feeling better overall since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  The above comments are my own words.</li>
            <li> This face cream is just okay.  I haven&#x27;t seen any major difference on my skin after weeks of using it.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it after some weeks.</li>
