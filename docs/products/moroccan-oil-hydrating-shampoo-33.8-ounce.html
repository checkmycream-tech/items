            <li> Great stuff! I have old guy thinning hair, though still long. (Old Hippy!) This shampoo has no sulfites in it, so it&#x27;s much better for your hair than most shampoos. It makes my hair feel much thicker and smoother and a bottle this size (33.8 oz) will last a looooong time. Smells great, too. Use Moroccan Oil Hair treatment along with it and you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers mentioned, to my disappointment my product also came in the mail leaking shampoo in the box. I expect if I&#x27;m purchasing such high quality shampoo that the packaging should match, but I guess that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> Love this product.... my hair is healthier, shinier, bouncier and smells fantastic!  So glad you carry this product on line!</li>
            <li> This product was wonderful. It made my hair soft and ended my split ends.i would highly recommend it. It is the best.</li>
            <li> Feels oily and doesn&#x27;t lather well.  Can&#x27;t seem to rinse it totally out of my hair.  Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and cleans hair down to your roots!</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan Oil shampoo for over 5 years, having always bought it from my salon.  Love it!  The local distributor, however, no longer carries Moroccan Oil, so I was forced to buy it elsewhere.  THIS is not genuine Moroccan Oil shampoo!  I noticed the difference as soon as I pumped the first pump into my palm.  It&#x27;s much thicker than the genuine product.  Then, I washed with it!  My hair was like straw...  Buyers beware.  This is a cheap impostor!</li>
            <li> This product dried my hair out really bad. I thought this was the repair but then saw I had ordered the wrong product. So I don&#x27;t know if all hydrating Moroccanoil shampoo does this or just this specific bottle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as it should. Has a chemical smell</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for over a year.  It has repair my damaged hair.  It is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan Oil Hydrating Shampoo for years, and this is not it.  The packaging is the correct, however the shampoo is not.&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back!!!!!</li>
            <li> I always have liked the Moroccan Oil products. This one does lather up a lot more than the other shampoos. I prefer the normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for almost 5 years and I really like it. I have curly hair and live in a humid place so my hair tends to freeze sometimes. This shampoo really leaves my hair soft and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Its not real one. I was buying before this brand in  special salon,and my hair was great after using shampoo. But after that my hair started to stink. And its just different because i can compare with my previous experience.AwfulAwful!!!!!!!NOT REAL ONE!!!!!!!!!!Dear buyers BE AWARE please!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Not first time when i order hair products online im not sure if its real or not!!!!!!so disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is great if your hair tends to be dry and frizzy. When you use it with the MorrocanOil hydrating hair masque it makes your hair much softer. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccan Oil Hydrating Shampoo for about 3 years.  I have long, thick hair not too oily or dry.  Moroccan Oil shampoo always leaves my hair shiny and soft without the need to add a conditioner.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but I always buy the &amp;#34;back bar&amp;#34; size (33.8 oz) so it lasts a long time and Amazon usually has the best price on the internet.</li>
            <li> Have no words to describe how great this product is. Hair gets smooth and no frizz at all. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, great price.</li>
