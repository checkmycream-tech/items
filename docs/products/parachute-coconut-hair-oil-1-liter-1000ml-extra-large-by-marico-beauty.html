            <li>This might be TMI but is great for lubricant too &amp; safe :) XOXO Happy Shopping :)</li>
            <li>So I just put the bottle in warm water.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and nutty.  </li>
            <li>It also helps with my moms arthritis, we warm</li>
            <li>It smells nice and makes my hair shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>and by morning it&#x27;s completly absorbed and it just looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>you can truly smell this and easily be reminded of the tropics!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have been using Parachute Pure Coconut Oil for more than three decades, and affirm that it is the best brand of coconut oil that is available for use as hair-oil in India.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Promotes a healthy scalp and healthy hair, reduces shedding if you have any and reduces/ eliminates dandruff if you have any.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>This product works :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know this type of oil was more, well oily.</li>
            <li>Love this coconut oil for my hair</li>
            <li>it has a great taste to it, smells very nutty as it should.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s very healthy for your skin too, It just feel kind of funny to me, so you&#x27;ll need to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li>In addition to that, I ride a motorcycle and most times without a helmet so then again it gets wind and sun damage.  </li>
            <li>This product can be used for many things.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this oil...</li>
            <li>It also makes a good moisturizer for the hair,skin and is useful when cooking</li>
            <li>a week before I deep condition with great results!</li>
            <li>would be better with spout-like top that could be removed as needed so that users can pour or scoop as needed.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have more energy, regardless of my many illnesses.  </li>
            <li>Double whammy lol!</li>
            <li>and I am ready to go!!!!</li>
            <li>I WOULD SAY THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD OIL</li>
            <li>Love it and strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is also the best brand for applying on dry and chapped skin and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thus the 1 liter pack should be purchased only by those people who use coconut-oil for oil-bath or whole-body-message, for which this is a very good oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone from natural to relaxed and it works great on both types of hair.</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair.</li>
            <li>It smells almost like a toasted/burnt coconut smell, but its not too strong.</li>
            <li>I will only and forever use this product to achieve beautiful lustrous hair.</li>
            <li>This may sounds strange but I just thought it would have a more thicker consistancy but it works great this way.</li>
            <li>actually bought for scalp and skin application, its a great product.</li>
            <li>cover comes sealed to ensure that the oil is unadulterated.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my hair and it makes it so smooth...</li>
            <li>Hair grew fast and strong!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve witness a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>and I am sure that Parachute Coconut Oil is 100% pure and REAL</li>
            <li>First I do have to say that if you keep your home cool this oil will solidify.</li>
            <li>my only wish would be that the product came with a wider cap so its easier to get at instead of having to warm up the bottle to get at it.</li>
            <li>This way, I will not have to warm the entire container every time I need the oil.  </li>
            <li>I CANT FIND ANY OTHER GOOD COCONUT HAIR OIL ON AMAZON.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to use on my hair only and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So make sure you&#x27;re getting something not expired or it will be rancid and gross.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a hot oil treatment before I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and what the descriptions said.</li>
            <li>It is solid in cool places, just run it under warm water and it will loosen up enough to pour out.</li>
            <li>but the oil really makes my hair and skin feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Love it, ad you can use it to cook with also as well as for your hair or hot oil treatment for your hair, and for your body as a moisturizer as long as you don&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to coconuts.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin super soft and husband loves the coconut aroma.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pure coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so I know what real coconut oil is supposed to smell like, look like and feel like</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase a larger bottle of the same brand for a cheaper price right here in my neighborhood.</li>
            <li>Only used small amounts and was told this was a great product</li>
            <li>and I usually make my own coconut oil</li>
            <li>Smells more like a food and less like a fragrance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you research the benefits of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>This coconut oil really helps to lock in moisture on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my very temperamental and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I thought all prices at AMAZON must b a good prices and purchased it without checking anywhere else only to find later that THE SAME BRAND SAME SIZE is avaible in Indian grocery stores for $6 ($5.99) or $7 ($6.99) while at Amazon they were selling it FOR SIXTEEN DOLLARS ($15.98)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In the summer I live in the pool with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is very soft and my tattoo is even brighter.</li>
            <li>Im not a big review writer but i felt absolutely compelled to write one!</li>
            <li>Its all natural which is a plus!</li>
            <li>Since it solidifies at room temperature, I warm the entire container up and put the oil in small containers.  </li>
            <li>love it on my hair!!!keeps my hair conditioned, less breakage,nice shine and last forever.</li>
            <li>These things aside - coconut oil is a fantastic deep conditioning treatment for hair that has been over processed or dry and curly.  </li>
            <li>it stays on your skin much longer before being absorbed, so use less than you think you&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li>plus it has the nicest natural coconut smell (my husband hates</li>
            <li>Once this seal is broken, and once the top cover is opened, the screw-in cover gives a tight fit so as to keep air and oxygen out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>just a few times (oil treatment on my hair, for my toddler&#x27;s super dry winter skin and as a facial &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; for myself) and it was definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I had also hoped that when applied to my hair, it would smell like coconut, but it actually smells like the deep fryer at a fast food restaurant.  </li>
            <li>and by the way REAL COCONUT OIL IS NEVER SOLID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE ONLY WHEN PLACED IN THE FRIDGE FOR A WHILE</li>
            <li>Never tried coconut oil before, but I&#x27;m super addicted to using it instead of normal lotions.</li>

            <li> Never tried coconut oil before, but I&#x27;m super addicted to using it instead of normal lotions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coconut oil becomes stale very fast, particularly if it is exposed to air.</li>
            <li> While Parachute adds preservatives to prevent this from happening, it still does happen if the oil is kept too long on your shelf.</li>
            <li> Keep hair soft and shiny and is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair quite often and it is very long so the hair take abuse over and over again.  </li>
            <li> Put it on dry hair and sleep with it overnight.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who has dry and/or split ends.  </li>
            <li> If you use it before you use soap, your skin will not be as dry.</li>
            <li> In short, my hair was a mess.  </li>

            <li> Received it faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I had to slowly heat up the container in the microwave, then pour the oil into the smaller container, which when it returned to room temperature, was again solid.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Im not a big review writer but i felt absolutely compelled to write one! This is the best product i have ever used &amp; i am a PRODUCT JUNKIE LOL, i put it in my hair after i take a shower (while its still damp) and it is unbelievably soft &amp; luxurious plus it has the nicest natural coconut smell (my husband hates coconut/coconut scents)but LOVES THE SMELL. I also used it as body moisturizer and my lips and my skin is very soft and my tattoo is even brighter. I have heard people using it in they&#x27;re cooking, that i haven&#x27;t tryed yet but i will write another review as soon as i do! This might be TMI but is great for lubricant too &amp; safe :) XOXO Happy Shopping :)</li>
            <li> Love it, ad you can use it to cook with also as well as for your hair or hot oil treatment for your hair, and for your body as a moisturizer as long as you don&#x27;t have any allergic reactions to coconuts.</li>
            <li> my husband donest like it he says it smells like burnt coconut i dont mind the smell and no one complains but him</li>
            <li> Great product at an ever better price. Two thumbs up! I use coconut oil in my hair and it works wonders! Promotes a healthy scalp and healthy hair, reduces shedding if you have any and reduces/ eliminates dandruff if you have any. Ive never had dandruff and my hair only sheds during the winter but it&#x27;s not much. Wonderful product. Highly recommend you research the benefits of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. This coconut oil really helps to lock in moisture on my natural hair. I will only and forever use this product to achieve beautiful lustrous hair. I am African American with 4a 4b hair type. This product works :)</li>
            <li> Love Love Love!!!!!! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Had no problem other than how hard the content was in the container. I expected it to be in oil form. At the time ordering...... I didn&#x27;t know I could buy at the local walmart.</li>
            <li> I got what I wanted which is absolutly perfect! It smells nice and makes my hair shiny and healthy. I didn&#x27;t know this type of oil was more, well oily. This may sounds strange but I just thought it would have a more thicker consistancy but it works great this way. No goopy residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Update 10/4/11&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product everyday since I purchased it in June and it works bueatifully. I coat my hair from root to tip every night before wrapping it up and my hair has never been softer or shinier. I&#x27;ve gone from natural to relaxed and it works great on both types of hair. I use about quarter sized amount or less each night (I&#x27;m only half way through the bottle I bought in June!) and by morning it&#x27;s completly absorbed and it just looks and feels great. Be warned though if you have abosorbing (ex cotton) pillowcase the oil might leave stains on it. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the coconut oil or something else I was using at the time. I started using a satin pillowcases anyways problem solve.</li>
            <li> Love this coconut oil for my hair</li>
            <li> First I do have to say that if you keep your home cool this oil will solidify. Keep in kitchen cabinet or under the bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use this oil on my hair, skin, and I cook with it.  it has a great taste to it, smells very nutty as it should.  This stuff CAN go bad though.  So make sure you&#x27;re getting something not expired or it will be rancid and gross.  I brought a bunch of bottles back with me when I went to India.  When I run out I plan to purchase here.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great price.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pure coconut oil.  It goes on very smooth.  The only thing that annoys me is that it is hard to get the oil out since coconut oil hardens at room temperature.  So I just put the bottle in warm water.  It leaves skin super soft and husband loves the coconut aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed on the way it works on my hair, It&#x27;s good for any part of the body, but I don&#x27;t like the way feel&#x27;s on my skin. Yes it&#x27;s very healthy for your skin too, It just feel kind of funny to me, so you&#x27;ll need to try it for yourself. It may not be that way for you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the product would be solid, not liquid. Smells more like a food and less like a fragrance. Container has a food label, not really a hair product.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair quite often and it is very long so the hair take abuse over and over again.  In addition to that, I ride a motorcycle and most times without a helmet so then again it gets wind and sun damage.  In the summer I live in the pool with chemicals.  In short, my hair was a mess.  Now I use Parachute once a week.  Put it on dry hair and sleep with it overnight.  In the morning I shampoo my hair and it is like I have someone else&#x27;s hair.  The change is unbelievable and I will never stop using it.  I recommend it to anyone who has dry and/or split ends.  If it heals my hair it will heal anything.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I assumed it was a larger container thats why its just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but it is what I wanted&lt;br /&gt;and it came on time in good condition. Just wanted a larger one.</li>
            <li> Love love love it! Hair grew fast and strong!</li>
            <li> This product can be used for many things. I used it during bath and for my hair and I&#x27;ve witness a tremendous difference. Love it and strongly recommend it. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of coconut oil for about a year now.  This was a great price and had some great reviews so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I&#x27;ve used it just a few times (oil treatment on my hair, for my toddler&#x27;s super dry winter skin and as a facial &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; for myself) and it was definitely worth the money.  It smells almost like a toasted/burnt coconut smell, but its not too strong.</li>
            <li> Weighs my hair down, not impressed and the smell doesnt help.  Only used small amounts and was told this was a great product but I dont think it is for my hair type.</li>
            <li> love it on my hair!!!keeps my hair conditioned, less breakage,nice shine and last forever. I heat it in the microwave for 40 seconds and rub in my hair and I am ready to go!!!!</li>
            <li> actually bought for scalp and skin application, its a great product. my only wish would be that the product came with a wider cap so its easier to get at instead of having to warm up the bottle to get at it.</li>
            <li> I intended to decant the oil into a smaller bottle to deep condition hair - what I discovered was an oil that is solid at room temperature.  I had to slowly heat up the container in the microwave, then pour the oil into the smaller container, which when it returned to room temperature, was again solid.  I had also hoped that when applied to my hair, it would smell like coconut, but it actually smells like the deep fryer at a fast food restaurant.  These things aside - coconut oil is a fantastic deep conditioning treatment for hair that has been over processed or dry and curly.  P3 Hair Design, Minnetonka MN</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this oil...you can truly smell this and easily be reminded of the tropics! Its all natural which is a plus! It also makes a good moisturizer for the hair,skin and is useful when cooking and I use it for all of those purposes.</li>
            <li> Although this is food grade I don&#x27;t eat it, doesn&#x27;t taste good to me at all.  My hair on the other hand loves it!  I have processed aging hair which has been dulling drying and breaking off.  I use this at least twice a week and my hair is so soft! I also use it overnight once a week before I deep condition with great results!</li>
            <li> I am from the tropic and I usually make my own coconut oil so I know what real coconut oil is supposed to smell like, look like and feel like and I am sure that Parachute Coconut Oil is 100% pure and REAL and it smells absolutely great! It can be used for cooking and its also great for skin and hair nourishment and care. I purchased this to use on my hair only and so far so good. I&#x27;s say buy it! and the shipping time was great too. I had no delays at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and by the way REAL COCONUT OIL IS NEVER SOLID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE ONLY WHEN PLACED IN THE FRIDGE FOR A WHILE DOES IT START TO SOLIDIFY.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  The smell is nice and nutty.  It takes time to get use to it but the oil really makes my hair and skin feel smooth and soft.  I use it as a hot oil treatment before I wash my hair.  I oil my body with it before I bath.  If you use it before you use soap, your skin will not be as dry. Since it solidifies at room temperature, I warm the entire container up and put the oil in small containers.  This way, I will not have to warm the entire container every time I need the oil.  The price was great for this amount of oil. My entire family uses it and that consist of 10 people.  This container last me for two months.  I will need to stock up on this. I hope this helps those that are thinking of using it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I am African-American, with 3c hair, with no relaxer and I use this coconut oil as the base for mixing my unique leave in hair conditioner.  I like the size of the container.  It really goes a long way.  It is solid in cool places, just run it under warm water and it will loosen up enough to pour out.</li>
            <li> I have been using Parachute Pure Coconut Oil for more than three decades, and affirm that it is the best brand of coconut oil that is available for use as hair-oil in India. It is also the best brand for applying on dry and chapped skin and lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parachute sources best quality coconuts for producing its Coconut Oil. The production, purification, and packing  add to the quality and preservation of the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut oil becomes stale very fast, particularly if it is exposed to air. While Parachute adds preservatives to prevent this from happening, it still does happen if the oil is kept too long on your shelf. Thus the 1 liter pack should be purchased only by those people who use coconut-oil for oil-bath or whole-body-message, for which this is a very good oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover comes sealed to ensure that the oil is unadulterated. Once this seal is broken, and once the top cover is opened, the screw-in cover gives a tight fit so as to keep air and oxygen out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I keep this in my car for use on my skin and hair with great results. Keep hair soft and shiny and is not too heavy. Does not irritate my very temperamental and sensitive skin.  Can be hard to get out of the container when it is not melted- would be better with spout-like top that could be removed as needed so that users can pour or scoop as needed.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Work great in my daughter&#x27;s hair. Great price and I like that I can purchase a big size. Received it faster than expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and what the descriptions said.</li>
            <li> I ordered hair oil along with the Coconut oil and got all Coconut oil....did not receive my hair oil.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair. .my hair soaks up hair oil but this worls wonderful. .hair has grown</li>
            <li> I thought all prices at AMAZON must b a good prices and purchased it without checking anywhere else only to find later that THE SAME BRAND SAME SIZE is avaible in Indian grocery stores for $6 ($5.99) or $7 ($6.99) while at Amazon they were selling it FOR SIXTEEN DOLLARS ($15.98)&lt;br /&gt;I got Ripped off!!!!</li>
            <li> The health benefits are amazing!  I haven&#x27;t weight under 126, since my twenties!  I have more energy, regardless of my many illnesses.  This is the only thing I&#x27;ve added in the last year and its the first time, in forever, since I went vCard through a month without getting sick!  I&#x27;ve gotten sick with a cold, once thus year, that&#x27;s amazing for me!!!</li>
            <li> I CANT FIND ANY OTHER GOOD COCONUT HAIR OIL ON AMAZON. I WOULD SAY THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD OIL</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hair and it makes it so smooth...It also helps with my moms arthritis, we warm i tup and she massages it on the problem area. Double whammy lol!</li>
            <li> The contents of the bottle was great. The price is what I have a problem with. I was able to purchase a larger bottle of the same brand for a cheaper price right here in my neighborhood.</li>
            <li> it appears to be in solid form.  no instructions on how to use on hair and get out of the bottle.  frustrating</li>
            <li> I was told to use this for my hair. It smelled so bad i threw it away. Save for cooking only.</li>
            <li> Never tried coconut oil before, but I&#x27;m super addicted to using it instead of normal lotions. Word to the wise, though- it stays on your skin much longer before being absorbed, so use less than you think you&#x27;d need. I&#x27;m still shiny from 40 minutes ago.</li>
