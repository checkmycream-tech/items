            <li>strong--</li>
            <li>Product came as described and quickly!  </li>
            <li>I really like this and more importantl so doe my wife!</li>
            <li>The 4.0 Fluid Ounce is a great bargain.</li>
            <li>Great smell and will last all day.</li>
            <li>Fantastic value.</li>
            <li>This is the only cologne my husband wears, and I love that I can get it at a good price instead of the inflated prices at the department stores here.</li>
            <li>It still do not smell like the original.</li>
            <li>Ok, but got my doubt&#x27;s about whether it&#x27;s the REAL stuff or not!</li>
            <li>Also love Amazon for ease of order and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li>I bought this at a retail store not to long ago for my birthday,  and it smelled really good when i tested it.</li>
            <li>Walked thought the store for about an hour or so and it was still as strong, That was convincing enough for me to buy the full thing through and through.</li>
            <li>This, however, was worth the risk.</li>
            <li>I have been a very satisfied user of Obsession for a number of years and in the past paid much more for this product.  </li>
            <li>Calvin Klein makes this product in a spray cologne and &amp;#34;eau de toilette&amp;#34; is a term denoting a lesser quality product whose essence fades more rapidly.</li>
            <li>Great price, larger bottle than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>dunno about the cologne angle just be aware this stuff is REALLY</li>
            <li>The only problem is it did not seem to be as strong as I have had before.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much because you should know the scent is lasting and is strong.</li>
            <li>This stuff is classic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet but not too sweet and at the same time I feel masculine when I wear this cologne!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always apprehensive about ordering such a product on line because I cant smell it to determine if it is genuine.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>My wife loves the way I smell in this stuff, and she is VERY picky about smells.  </li>
            <li>store.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is putting my mind to rest, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I wonder if these name brand colognes are not diluted to make there prices so much cheaper than the mortar and brick store.</li>
            <li>one day so i decide to shake it up a bit to really see if that helps. . .</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>WILL BE ORDERING MORE IN NEAR FUTURE!!!</li>
            <li>Very well packaged and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite cologne of all time.</li>
            <li>This arrived right on time for Christmas, was packaged well and am pleased that my husband likes it and the fragrance seems to last as usual.</li>
            <li>So I was pleasantly surprised that it was genuine and not a knock off or watered down.</li>
            <li>Its not harsh or too loud of a scent.</li>
            <li>Old memories.  </li>
            <li>Bought it as a present for my dad- classic scent, he loves it.</li>
            <li>then you have to send it back and wait for the right thing, which just takes too long.</li>
            <li>Thanks, that is what I expected</li>
            <li>I actually wanted to try it as an attractant for wild cats which has been featured in some biology articles for trapping and trail cams.&lt;br /&gt;Traditionally used beaver castorium for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always worried about getting a knock-off instead of the real thing when it&#x27;s half the price you&#x27;d pay in a department</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered tons of perfume and have never had a problem as long as I order directly from Amazon and not a third party vendor.</li>
            <li>This was a good deal as it was much less expensive than what was offered in the stores.  </li>

            <li> This smell i knew was no longer there and was just pure disgusting.</li>
            <li> Can not go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obsession for 35 years and have been disappointed with any divergence from this scent.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m always apprehensive about ordering such a product on line because I cant smell it to determine if it is genuine. So I was pleasantly surprised that it was genuine and not a knock off or watered down. This is my husbands cologne of choice and he was happy as well with the purchase. Love the price too. Will have to keep this as a fav. for future gifts</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Trusty Obsession, great smell for a great price.</li>
            <li> Another great cologne for men! Its not harsh or too loud of a scent. It also lasts long so a little goes a long way. My husband uses it often. I might have to get a refill next year.</li>
            <li> This stuff is classic! Women love it!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Bought it as a present for my dad- classic scent, he loves it.</li>
            <li> Dolce perfume I purchased did not smell. Think its watered down.</li>
            <li> Why do all men&#x27;s colognes smell like either citrus or leather? Calvin Klein started something great with Obsession. It&#x27;s a signature scent that&#x27;s appropriate for any occasion, and any season. If the scent reminds you of another product it&#x27;s probably because they tried to copy this one. I&#x27;ve used it for years and would recommend it for it&#x27;s sophistication and value.</li>
            <li> Great price, larger bottle than I had expected.  Fast delivery</li>
            <li> No other scent is as subtle yet pleasing as this one.  I have been using Obsession for 35 years and have been disappointed with any divergence from this scent.  Subtle, very pleasing, not overwhelming.  My wife still comments how nice I smell after work.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift, person loved it. I was very pleased at the price in which I had to pay for it.</li>
            <li> Product came as described and quickly!  Got this as a gift for my Father.  He loved it and so will you.</li>
            <li> One problem:the last order I placed did not show ounces and I made the mistake that the price was for 4.5 ounc4s, when it was for 4.0.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the way I smell in this stuff, and she is VERY picky about smells.  How could I not love it?</li>
            <li> Good price compared with others store. Excellent buy</li>
            <li> very beautiful, I loved</li>
            <li> Great Cologne.  A+ Seller</li>
            <li> If the product being shipped is the same as the photo shows, it is not Obsession Cologne. Calvin Klein makes this product in a spray cologne and &amp;#34;eau de toilette&amp;#34; is a term denoting a lesser quality product whose essence fades more rapidly. This ad should be ended.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal as it was much less expensive than what was offered in the stores.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a long time</li>
            <li> just what i ordered.  will order again.  glad i found them.  excellent gift items and for my own personal use</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this cologne smells on my husband!</li>
            <li> given as a gift, they loved it</li>
            <li> Love it, have been using it for years. Clean fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Smells Wonderful everyone loves it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always worried about getting a knock-off instead of the real thing when it&#x27;s half the price you&#x27;d pay in a department store.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is putting my mind to rest, it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne my husband wears, and I love that I can get it at a good price instead of the inflated prices at the department stores here.</li>
            <li> Dose not smell the same as when you buy in store been using obsession for years just.has a weak smell</li>
            <li> I bought it for my boyfriend, and he smell really good all the time.</li>
            <li> Great On-Line price!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. My dad LOVES this Cologne!</li>
            <li> My husband wears this well!</li>
            <li> Thanks, that is what I expected</li>
            <li> I love Obsession for Men great cologne.  Also love Amazon for ease of order and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Godo product and excellent supplier</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SERVICE,AS PROMISED</li>
            <li> Never tried this one before, but wife and I VERY HAPPY. WILL BE ORDERING MORE IN NEAR FUTURE!!! Simply Enchanting.</li>
            <li> I love it and I buy the same cologne.</li>
            <li> I really like this and more importantl so doe my wife!</li>
            <li> The cologne arrived promptly as stated. The only problem is it did not seem to be as strong as I have had before. Sometimes I wonder if these name brand colognes are not diluted to make there prices so much cheaper than the mortar and brick store.</li>
            <li> Old memories.  It was a gift.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, 2day delivery with prime,</li>
            <li> Smells nice. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful favorite-for my son-in-law!</li>
            <li> Obsession is a classic, so there&#x27;s no need for me to explain how wonderful it is. This smells great on my husband, so I love getting such a good deal here on Amazon. I&#x27;ve ordered tons of perfume and have never had a problem as long as I order directly from Amazon and not a third party vendor. Obsession is STILL a great scent after all this time!</li>
            <li> my boyfriend loved this so much</li>
            <li> Received from merchante promptly and well packaged. No damage and no leaks. Found the frangrance to be subtle and not particularly masculine. Guess it&#x27;s OK perhaps as a unisex cologne. Not for me....have not received any flattering comments. I will not return product. However, will perhaps gift it to someone who may like the fragrance. Maybe someone who works around Yankee Candles!</li>
            <li> Can not go wrong with this product. The price is very good and the scent is perfect when going out on a date. Don&#x27;t use too much because you should know the scent is lasting and is strong. I would recommend purchasing Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession Cologne Spray for Men. The 4.0 Fluid Ounce is a great bargain. Thank you.</li>
            <li> it was everything i expected it to be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always cautious buying things like this and clothes online because if it&#x27;s not what you want then you have to send it back and wait for the right thing, which just takes too long. This, however, was worth the risk. Smells great. Ladies love it.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase</li>
            <li> cologne by calvin kein . i personelly love thi cologne and have used it for over 7yrs. makes a excellent christmas or birthday gift, or any present needed</li>
            <li> I bought this at a retail store not to long ago for my birthday,  and it smelled really good when i tested it. Walked thought the store for about an hour or so and it was still as strong, That was convincing enough for me to buy the full thing through and through. Skip about two months and the cologne starts to tinge on my nose a bit and i notice the smell doesn&#x27;t quite appeal to me as it did that one day so i decide to shake it up a bit to really see if that helps. . . This smell i knew was no longer there and was just pure disgusting. Granted it was the same smell just i grew over it or it didn&#x27;t match my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways if you like a &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; smell, this is your drift as i thought it would be. Then take no chances and buy it, its a great cologne for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Great price and no comparison to box stores.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite cologne of all time. It&#x27;s sweet but not too sweet and at the same time I feel masculine when I wear this cologne!</li>
            <li> my wife loves it when i wear this</li>
            <li> Used this for 40yrs.,Its the best for me</li>
            <li> I have been a very satisfied user of Obsession for a number of years and in the past paid much more for this product.  Price  was the lowest I&#x27;ve seen for a number of years</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised. Very well packaged and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> been using this for 25 years and hasn&#x27;t disappointed</li>
            <li> CK Obsession for a great price. What can I say?</li>
            <li> Best smelling men&#x27;s cologne, wonderful price for what you get. Service is great! Everything was perfect for this Christmas present!</li>
            <li> Great value for my husbands favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> This arrived right on time for Christmas, was packaged well and am pleased that my husband likes it and the fragrance seems to last as usual.</li>
            <li> Great deal and just love the smell of this</li>
            <li> Great smell and will last all day. I have allergies and this cologne does not affected at all.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite!  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It still do not smell like the original.</li>
            <li> Still, THE best cologne for men!!!!  I&#x27;ve used this for years &amp; years, especially in wintertime. Love it!!!  Thank you Calvin!!!</li>
            <li> I actually wanted to try it as an attractant for wild cats which has been featured in some biology articles for trapping and trail cams.&lt;br /&gt;Traditionally used beaver castorium for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I dunno about the cologne angle just be aware this stuff is REALLY strong-- you should try a sample before you buy.&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged, sturdy bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne~ thank you for a great deal!</li>
            <li> good price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great price, the best smelling guy in town</li>
            <li> The real deal. 4 ounces for under $40.00. Fantastic value.</li>
            <li> Obsession is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne. I bought it for my husband at a great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne for my dad as a present and he absolutely loved it! Smells great.</li>
            <li> Great cologne at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Ok, but got my doubt&#x27;s about whether it&#x27;s the REAL stuff or not!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift. He loves the smell.  The shipment was on time</li>
            <li> Good price for this large bottle.</li>
