            <li>Love the smell and the product.</li>
            <li>I can tell after tanning and leaving it on overnight that I have some more color.</li>
            <li>I tanned 2 times in their level 5 beds with this lotion and was way more tan than when I started and my skin was really smooth too.</li>
            <li>Great product and will be using this product as low as I can get it from here thanks for a great product</li>
            <li>What I love love about this lotion is that this is the ONLY lotion I have ever tried that even hours after tanning I still smell so good.</li>

            <li>Best of an expensive situation.</li>

            <li> This is one of the better bronzers on the market, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with streaking or uneven color when applied correctly.
