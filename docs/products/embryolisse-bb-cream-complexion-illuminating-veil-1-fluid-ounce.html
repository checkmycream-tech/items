            <li>Oh, and the best part?</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is the best BB cream EVER.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of covering under-eye circles.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>It feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>Works great alone or as a primer.</li>
            <li>LOVE the Embryolisse moisturizer!!</li>
            <li>My mother has fairly oily skin and loves it though.</li>
            <li>and I figured the chances of it being a good color on me were slim to none.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful, luxurious BB cream and I am completely in love.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This BB cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>i like this product a lot -- it has a really nice silicone-like feel which works well as a primer underneath foundation.  </li>
            <li>I use my fingers to apply is as I feel it kind of &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; the cream onto my face better.  </li>
            <li>This BB cream is very light.</li>
            <li>and I just love the texture of it.</li>
            <li>Plus, who doesn&#x27;t feel awesome using French skincare products?</li>
            <li>but I can apply it and feel like I look significantly better with no effort at all.</li>
            <li>imperfections as well for me as i would have hoped, but i got this more as a sunscreen/</li>
            <li>skin looks silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Maybelline is actually better and 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;ve found this works best when I cover it with my Original formula Bare Minerals (in &amp;#34;Fairly Medium&amp;#34; color).</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Embryolisse and I was very excited to try the BB Cream.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most unique makeup items I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Despite the color match issue, it is easy to make this work</li>
            <li>Fits my skin well, the parfum smell is strong though.  </li>
            <li>I cleanse, tone with an alcohol-free toner, and then lightly smooth on coconut oil.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly...</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for more coverage, then this BB cream probably isn&#x27;t the right one for you.  </li>
            <li>It is super cool!</li>
            <li>It spreads thickly but blends beautifully (I apply with my fingers to warm it up).</li>
            <li>I bought this in Denmark the first time and love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I layer this over the Embryolisse Lait-Creme Concentre cream and the two compliment each other beautifully.</li>
            <li>when i use it on its own, it makes my skin feel really soft also.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking for medium to full coverage this may not be what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>Light, sheer, evens out to canvas-like perfection, not gray nor yellow, adjusts perfectly to my skin tone and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and applies easily.  </li>
            <li>The color blends into the skin and it looks very natural, like my skin but even better.</li>
            <li>It definitely gives a nice hint of color</li>
            <li>Overall, I have liked this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Compared to other BB creams I have tried, I have to admit this left my skin feeling and looking the best.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviews say, the coverage probably isn&#x27;t enough to cover blemishes, but it is perfect if you just want to even out your complexion.</li>
            <li>so the coverage is very light, but after you put it on you can&#x27;t really see your pores anymore and your face feels very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a BB cream I&#x27;ve liked, mostly because they&#x27;re thick but also because I haven&#x27;t had good luck finding an appropriate color for my skin: light-medium with yellow AND pink undertones.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice and thick, very smooth and soft, so it is easy to blend.</li>
            <li>My skins is relatively dry on its own, so this just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and makes my skin feel balmy, not dry and cakey like most.</li>
            <li>I initially got a sample of the Embryolisse moisturizer and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I only purchase beauty products and hair products from the EU and mostly France because they have much higher ingredient standards than the US.</li>
            <li>Before the coconut oil completely absorbs, I take a pea-sized amount of this BB cream and smooth all over with my fingers.</li>
            <li>I tried this because I like the 24-hour cream a lot, and the reviews of this were convincing enough.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re not wrong.</li>
            <li>SPF is just a bonus as I could wear it out at night most likely.</li>
            <li>Pros are that it smells beautifully, and covers the imperfections on the skin, the cons are that the cream is really thick, and kind of hard to distribute.</li>
            <li>I heard so much about embryolisse that I wanted to try this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream.</li>
            <li>I have used this cream before and it works very well on my face, so I purchased this one for my niece in Brazil.</li>
            <li>This dries very matte - no need for a powder (I am very oily so this is a plus).</li>
            <li>This BB cream is super light and almost feels like a powder instead of a heavy liquid.</li>
            <li>Its super sheer, but offers enough coverage to smooth my skin tone, and your skin feels like silk after you apply it.</li>
            <li>My skin was left feeling smooth and soft after application.  </li>
            <li>Decent coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t like a matte finish because I think it just makes me look older.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the darker side than most bb creams.</li>
            <li>very disappointed, i was hoping for something more impressive, especially for the price and the brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s very natural looking.</li>
            <li>It would definitely be a bit dry on its own if your skin is on the dry side, so you can try mixing it with your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I always get even coverage using a foundation brush and unlike a lot of BB creams on the market, this one seems to blend naturally with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li>The coverage is light to medium, it doesn&#x27;t completely cover blemishes but it cancels out any redness or uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>I use the Embryolisse 24 miracle cream as a base under this for super smooth and easy application.</li>
            <li>Love Embryolisse for skin and body care but this gem with a hint of color is seriously an all around winner.</li>
            <li>i am quite pale, but i was still surprised by how dark this turned out to be, the light shade is n really light at all, it does buff out, but it is very yellow toned and can look very patchy, it does have a very sheer coverage overall.</li>
            <li>Has a strange consistency-it is really pasty.  </li>
            <li>And normally I don&#x27;t like silicone-based makeup because it feels like a gross mask.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I got a little nervous, so I always apply this product after moisturizing (I happen to also use Embryolisse Concentrated Lait Cream, which is super lightweight and unscented.)</li>
            <li>Overall, I would be willing to try their other products.</li>
            <li>This is my first BB cream, the only other thing I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>That second step is necessary to even me out, but the combination makes me look as natural as I can look with makeup on.</li>
            <li>The product goes on a little dry and doesn&#x27;t spread as easily as many other BB creams that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Because of my experience with all other face makeup, I was apprehensive about the color, particularly because there&#x27;s only one</li>

            <li> It really does &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; in the sense that minor imperfections just seem to disappear or minimize with only a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have a little bit of cystic acne + plenty of redness, scarring, etc., and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to go a long way!</li>
            <li> When I started exploring other products by this line, I found this BB cream and read numerous reviews raving about it.  </li>
            <li> but I have a bit of redness and imperfections, and after this is dry it gives a bit of a glow and covers all redness.</li>
            <li> Add to all that is the fact that I&#x27;ve tried to mix it with several types of foundation to lighten it up and all it does is create a patchy unflattering mess.</li>
            <li> Its very thick, but doesnt have much coverage.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I end up fighting with the tube for quite a while once it begins to run low.</li>
            <li> product shipped and only took 2 days to arrive and was packaged securely, so no spillage or breakage at all.</li>
            <li> Minimal coverage, but sufficient when used with a concealer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thick and moist which is a plus for mature skin</li>
            <li> It has a rather thick texture that is similar to the traditional Korean BB cream, however the color is flesh-toned and slightly beige.</li>
            <li> It it very minimal coverage</li>
            <li> I use a tiny amount and it lasts at least eight hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just not worth 23 dollars.</li>
            <li> I dropped one star because at times I felt this color was a bit too dark.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my md solar science 50spf cream, but it was about half the price.</li>
            <li> My caucasian skin is slightly on the oily side, not that oily</li>
            <li> Which, admittedly, is no easy task.</li>
            <li> Also, I have really oily skin and just about everything oxidizes on me and looks really bad after about 6 hours.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and not enough coverage.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 3 times.</li>
            <li> My skin is not flawless by any means, and the one-size-fits-all color is a bit too dark for my super-pale skin.</li>
            <li> My favourite thing is that you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing any, especially because I hate heavy make up.</li>
            <li> just a subtle color to even skin tone and doesn&#x27;t look cakey.</li>
            <li> the finish just looks fake.</li>
            <li> I hate foundation.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought it on a whim. I heard so much about embryolisse that I wanted to try this product. Pros are that it smells beautifully, and covers the imperfections on the skin, the cons are that the cream is really thick, and kind of hard to distribute. Overall, I would be willing to try their other products.</li>
            <li> Fits my skin well, the parfum smell is strong though.  It&#x27;s a little on the darker side than most bb creams.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I have combination skin, which tends to get oily when I use foundations and I always end up feeling like I have a ton of makeup clogging my pours. This BB cream is super light and almost feels like a powder instead of a heavy liquid. After reading the reviews I got a little nervous, so I always apply this product after moisturizing (I happen to also use Embryolisse Concentrated Lait Cream, which is super lightweight and unscented.) I always get even coverage using a foundation brush and unlike a lot of BB creams on the market, this one seems to blend naturally with my skin tone. Oh, and the best part? You don&#x27;t need a lot of this product to go a long way! I use a tiny amount and it lasts at least eight hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product shipped and only took 2 days to arrive and was packaged securely, so no spillage or breakage at all. I will definitely be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> i am quite pale, but i was still surprised by how dark this turned out to be, the light shade is n really light at all, it does buff out, but it is very yellow toned and can look very patchy, it does have a very sheer coverage overall. Add to all that is the fact that I&#x27;ve tried to mix it with several types of foundation to lighten it up and all it does is create a patchy unflattering mess. very disappointed, i was hoping for something more impressive, especially for the price and the brand. This is just not worth 23 dollars.</li>
            <li> everything that it promised</li>
            <li> This is one of the most unique makeup items I&#x27;ve tried. It is super cool! The texture is nice and thick, very smooth and soft, so it is easy to blend. It does a great job of covering under-eye circles. My skin is not flawless by any means, and the one-size-fits-all color is a bit too dark for my super-pale skin. Therefore, I&#x27;ve found this works best when I cover it with my Original formula Bare Minerals (in &amp;#34;Fairly Medium&amp;#34; color). That second step is necessary to even me out, but the combination makes me look as natural as I can look with makeup on. I have a little bit of cystic acne + plenty of redness, scarring, etc., and very sensitive skin. Despite the color match issue, it is easy to make this work and I just love the texture of it. Plus, who doesn&#x27;t feel awesome using French skincare products?</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream. I have purchased at least 3 times. It really does &amp;#34;veil&amp;#34; in the sense that minor imperfections just seem to disappear or minimize with only a small amount. It it very minimal coverage but I can apply it and feel like I look significantly better with no effort at all. My only complaint is that I end up fighting with the tube for quite a while once it begins to run low. There is a lot of product left in it, but I almost have to wring it to try to get it out.</li>
            <li> i like this product a lot -- it has a really nice silicone-like feel which works well as a primer underneath foundation.  when i use it on its own, it makes my skin feel really soft also.  i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;blur&amp;#34; imperfections as well for me as i would have hoped, but i got this more as a sunscreen/primer so it serves its purpose.  it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my md solar science 50spf cream, but it was about half the price.</li>
            <li> This has the same consistency of&lt;br /&gt;A Korean bb cream&lt;br /&gt;It is thick and moist which is a plus for mature skin&lt;br /&gt;But I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced</li>
            <li> I have used this cream before and it works very well on my face, so I purchased this one for my niece in Brazil.</li>
            <li> Not what description made out to be.</li>
            <li> skin looks silky smooth!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Like all the Embryolisse line I have tried this is a must have product for me  !</li>
            <li> The product goes on a little dry and doesn&#x27;t spread as easily as many other BB creams that I have tried. My skins is relatively dry on its own, so this just isn&#x27;t for me. My mother has fairly oily skin and loves it though.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Embryolisse and I was very excited to try the BB Cream. I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. Its very thick, but doesnt have much coverage.It feels/looks too matte.</li>
            <li> I initially got a sample of the Embryolisse moisturizer and fell in love with it.  When I started exploring other products by this line, I found this BB cream and read numerous reviews raving about it.  Compared to other BB creams I have tried, I have to admit this left my skin feeling and looking the best.  It is very lightweight and applies easily.  I use my fingers to apply is as I feel it kind of &amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; the cream onto my face better.  My skin was left feeling smooth and soft after application.  It definitely gives a nice hint of color but if you are looking for more coverage, then this BB cream probably isn&#x27;t the right one for you.  I dropped one star because at times I felt this color was a bit too dark.  Overall, I have liked this BB cream.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and not enough coverage. Maybelline is actually better and 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Goes on smooth and makes my skin feel balmy, not dry and cakey like most. Minimal coverage, but sufficient when used with a concealer.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is very light. So if you are looking for medium to full coverage this may not be what you are looking for. I have sensitive skin and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. It is sort of perfumey but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I only purchase beauty products and hair products from the EU and mostly France because they have much higher ingredient standards than the US.</li>
            <li> This is my first BB cream, the only other thing I&#x27;ve used that is close in comparison would be Dr.Hauschka&#x27;s Toned (Tinted) Day Cream which is thicker, a bit oilier, and also a darker tone. My caucasian skin is slightly on the oily side, not that oily but I never have problems with dryness. I cleanse, tone with an alcohol-free toner, and then lightly smooth on coconut oil. Before the coconut oil completely absorbs, I take a pea-sized amount of this BB cream and smooth all over with my fingers. I don&#x27;t have acne but I have a bit of redness and imperfections, and after this is dry it gives a bit of a glow and covers all redness. It&#x27;s not a foundation so the coverage is very light, but after you put it on you can&#x27;t really see your pores anymore and your face feels very soft. It would definitely be a bit dry on its own if your skin is on the dry side, so you can try mixing it with your moisturizer. My face occasionally gets itchy during the day so I always have my fingers in my face, but this cream has a calming effect. My favourite thing is that you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing any, especially because I hate heavy make up.</li>
            <li> It feels great on your skin. Works great alone or as a primer.</li>
            <li> I hate foundation. It either looks cakey or it&#x27;s too sheer or the finish just looks fake. I can never wait to take it off when I get home. I&#x27;ve never found a BB cream I&#x27;ve liked, mostly because they&#x27;re thick but also because I haven&#x27;t had good luck finding an appropriate color for my skin: light-medium with yellow AND pink undertones. Which, admittedly, is no easy task. Also, I have really oily skin and just about everything oxidizes on me and looks really bad after about 6 hours. Enter Embryolisse BB Cream. I tried this because I like the 24-hour cream a lot, and the reviews of this were convincing enough. And they&#x27;re not wrong. This stuff is awesome. Normally I don&#x27;t like a matte finish because I think it just makes me look older. And normally I don&#x27;t like silicone-based makeup because it feels like a gross mask. This doesn&#x27;t do either of those things. Like the other reviews say, the coverage probably isn&#x27;t enough to cover blemishes, but it is perfect if you just want to even out your complexion. It&#x27;s just very natural looking. It doesn&#x27;t oxidize on me, and I only have the slightest bit of shine after 10-12 hours, though I sometimes use that HD powder from Make Up For Ever on my T-zone. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with clogged pores or breakouts. As for application, I&#x27;ve really only used this with a foundation brush. I tried it with the Beautyblender once, but it just seemed to take longer without any noticeable benefit. Because of my experience with all other face makeup, I was apprehensive about the color, particularly because there&#x27;s only one and I figured the chances of it being a good color on me were slim to none. But no problem there either. Again, it&#x27;s very natural looking. This is one of those products that I&#x27;ll buy two at a time so I&#x27;ll have one at home and one I can keep in my bag.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream EVER. Light, sheer, evens out to canvas-like perfection, not gray nor yellow, adjusts perfectly to my skin tone and lasts all day. SPF is just a bonus as I could wear it out at night most likely. I just wish the tube was bigger. Love Embryolisse for skin and body care but this gem with a hint of color is seriously an all around winner.</li>
            <li> This BB cream is amazing. It has a rather thick texture that is similar to the traditional Korean BB cream, however the color is flesh-toned and slightly beige. It spreads thickly but blends beautifully (I apply with my fingers to warm it up). The color blends into the skin and it looks very natural, like my skin but even better. The coverage is light to medium, it doesn&#x27;t completely cover blemishes but it cancels out any redness or uneven skin tone. This dries very matte - no need for a powder (I am very oily so this is a plus). This is a beautiful, luxurious BB cream and I am completely in love. I layer this over the Embryolisse Lait-Creme Concentre cream and the two compliment each other beautifully. I will NEVER be without this BB cream EVER.</li>
            <li> Has a strange consistency-it is really pasty.  It works well if you apply immediately after moisturizer. Decent coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the Embryolisse moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in Denmark the first time and love this BB cream. It goes on smoothly...just a subtle color to even skin tone and doesn&#x27;t look cakey. It&#x27;s paraben-free and you can&#x27;t tell you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> Its super sheer, but offers enough coverage to smooth my skin tone, and your skin feels like silk after you apply it. I&#x27;m never using anything else again.&lt;br /&gt;PS- I use the Embryolisse 24 miracle cream as a base under this for super smooth and easy application.</li>
