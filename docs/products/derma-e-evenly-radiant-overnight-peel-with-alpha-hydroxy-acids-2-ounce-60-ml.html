            <li>Great product for your face, with AHA, you can use it once or twice a week overnight to exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li>Great price too, for a great product.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My skin looks bright and refreshed when I wake up.  </li>
            <li>Really good for oily skin.</li>
            <li>The Hyaluronic Night Creme is good too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this peel for about a week now and love it!</li>
            <li>Once I received it though, I realized its best before date is pretty soon,</li>
            <li>it feels nice and going on, but i haven&#x27;t noticed any age spot lightening or wrinkle reducing yet.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels nice in the morning</li>
            <li>Plus I liked what I read about the company.</li>
            <li>The pH of this product is suitable for chemical exfoliation.</li>
            <li>its real good stuff its general skin</li>
            <li>One star off for the stinging and the fact that it can get tacky/heavy feeling unless you put on a very light layer.</li>
            <li>A plus to this product, as with all Derma E creams, is that it contains no parabens and, for the most part, wholesome ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I use it once or twice a week and love the results.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite product lines.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will get more this</li>
            <li>I think I love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the peel.</li>
            <li>I love this product it works well for me.</li>
            <li>But I would love to hear about.</li>
            <li>but I will keep trying it until I finish the bottle to find out for sure.</li>
            <li>Perfect Product for aging skin, saw results the first time I used it, completely removed an age spot on my cheek after three treatments.</li>
            <li>No bad reaction!</li>
            <li>I have a caramel skin color that easily scars and</li>
            <li>The alpha hydroxyl acid is not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, feels silky, and tones, and looks fine all day.</li>
            <li>Apply at night and you skin will look great the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I use this as a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance Free</li>
            <li>I feel this is a reasonable priced product of this kind.</li>
            <li>I happened to order this off another site because it was buy one get one free</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>(I got it in the end of 2014), and my skin tone got very golden and supple.</li>
            <li>Within about 2-3 weeks I noticed a significant difference in my skin texture, which became smoother than it was before.</li>
            <li>husband even noticed how golden my complexion got!</li>
            <li>I am expecting my 4th baby now and my skin looks so fresh!</li>
            <li>I completely trust Derma-e products and have used them for over a decade, however, I think I get better results from Murad exfoliating cleansers and my Olay Pro-X cleansing brush (don&#x27;t use the Olay cleanser that comes with it!)</li>
            <li>when using so good feeling when you wake up in the morning I only use it 3 times a week</li>
            <li>I have only used this a couple of times, but my face feels really good in the morning.</li>
            <li>These 3 have proven anti-aging ingredients and most studies say you need a year to really reach peak results then</li>
            <li>Man is that true</li>

            <li>Man is that true</li>
            <li>and I love Derma E products in general because they avoid your sulphates/parabens etc., are vegan and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to apply and &amp;#34;soaks&amp;#34; in very quickly.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>After one use my skin felt great, after a few more overnight treatments my pores feel smaller and the fine lines around my eyes seems diminished.</li>
            <li>it does feel nice still the next morning when i wake up.</li>
            <li>Works well on 30-ish skin to keep me looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>This is a more-than-adequate retinol product for daily use, but I have seen nothing spectacular about it.  </li>
            <li>It perfect because it&#x27;s not too harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For night the overnight peel used as a serum after washing keeps the skin exfoliated, fresh, unclogged.  </li>

            <li>I have had some success with this lightening my sun spots.</li>
            <li>The largest part of that was adequate exfoliation and using a very gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I jumped on it right away.</li>
            <li>My skin looks do smooth and vibrant after I use this</li>
            <li>I have used Clinique and Estee Lauder and most all the major drug store brands</li>
            <li>my skin has never looked better, pores smaller, skin tone balanced, pimples rarely happen.</li>
            <li>my skin has never looked better, pores smaller, skin tone balanced, pimples rarely happen.</li>
            <li>I use it practically every night but, to be fair sometimes it does sting a little.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I could feel it working.</li>
            <li>I use the entire Derma E line and love it.</li>
            <li>Really like this product!</li>
            <li>This one has some stinging at first, but no redness or tons of peeling, and results in smooth clear skin.</li>
            <li>At night I put this Radiant Ovenight Peel on first, then this day creme.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps us women on a mission to age as gracefully as possible :)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I never realized it is recommend for once a week.</li>
            <li>I first used it</li>
            <li>Has not failed me yet.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>* Relatively gentle compared to more traditional peels</li>
            <li>Once to get most of the makeup off, then the second time to really clean and open up my skin.</li>
            <li>Really works as described.</li>
            <li>This may be very concerning for some, but I&#x27;ve come to learn that it is just the product doing its job.</li>
            <li>The next day my face was brighter and smooth.</li>
            <li>When I woke up the next morning my face was brighter, lighter, and smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>It goes over your skin smoothly and you only need the tiniest amount.</li>
            <li>At nights when I need to get my makeup up I gently rub this cleanser around my face neck and chest twice.</li>
            <li>this vitamin A moisturizer really makes a difference at keeping my wrinkles at bay.  </li>

            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to try a peel.</li>
            <li>and my skin is VERY</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin since using this</li>
            <li>I cleared up my normal to oily, sensitive, acne prone maturing skin to pretty much a flawless balanced complexion using this Overnight Peel and few other products from derma</li>
            <li>So having something to continually remove the dead skin and show the healthy skin is right up my ally.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel a light to medium burning sensation for the first 10-30 minutes after application, but my skin feels completely soothed by the morning despite the initial irritation.</li>
            <li>My other products work as well, possibly better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just hoping it is helping to keep me from looking too much older before I absolutely have to.</li>
            <li>Great price as well especially when comparing to similar products from other brands.</li>
            <li>a slight change for my skin that is still combo but more on the side of aging than breakouts now.  </li>

            <li>decent overnight peel</li>
            <li>I have used quite a few products and have always loved using them as a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I normally try and keep my skincare products as mild as possible, but I&#x27;ve made the exception here.</li>
            <li>I was astonished because I did not have high hopes</li>
            <li>Nonie is amazing, but is priced at about $35 for a 3.5 oz bottle/jar, and it is really difficult to find a vendor that offers it with free shipping (I always try to avoid paying shipping, at all costs).  </li>
            <li>The day after, you should wash your face as always, and the feeling it leaves, is very soft.</li>
            <li>I also use the peptide eye cream day and night and the petide moisturizer during the day under Cotz Face Natural Skin Tone SPF 40 (cheaper than the colorescience I mention above and higher spf)</li>

            <li>The other thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is not a good standalone moisturizer like the Nonie AHA creams are - you are supposed to use another Derma E moisturizer on top of this one, which only adds one more product to my nightly regimen.  </li>
            <li>, I love that it doesn&#x27;t give you a sticky, icky feeling.</li>
            <li>- I was really looking for an AHA product that I can use daily, like the Nonie creams.  </li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive for BHA&#x27;s during part of the year so using an AHA is a must.</li>
            <li>but I had never realized that the gentle foaming cleansers were actually causing my acne.</li>
            <li>but after working with a rockstar esthetician I found out that mature skin needs this amount of exfoliation to keep cell turnover up and elasticity in the skin.</li>
            <li>I thought the smell was minimal and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>The main reason I purchased the AHA beauty fluid from Derma E is that I was trying to find a less-expensive alternative to the Nonie of Beverly Hills AHA cream that I use once a day.  </li>
            <li>There is a tiny bit of a tingling sensation to it, but nothing thats unbearable, and I have normal- sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It says it&#x27;s for night use, but I love the way my face feels and looks so much with a thin application of this, that I actually wear it during the day!</li>
            <li>two months later my wrinkles really came back in.  </li>
            <li>two months later my wrinkles really came back in.  </li>

            <li>you cannot go wrong with this peel.. amazing</li>
            <li>The key for sensitive skin is to build up to it.</li>
            <li>The key for sensitive skin is to build up to it.</li>
            <li>But it was really a wow moment when I renewed my license and the two pictures showed me with two different Skin tones!</li>
            <li>But there is a slight tingling sensation when I first apply it, so I like to think it&#x27;s doing something.</li>
            <li>The amount of AHA in this is low enough that even my sensitive skin can take it every night as long as I put moisturizer on after it&#x27;s set.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin since using this</li>
            <li> I cleared up my normal to oily, sensitive, acne prone maturing skin to pretty much a flawless balanced complexion using this Overnight Peel and few other products from derma</li>
            <li> So having something to continually remove the dead skin and show the healthy skin is right up my ally.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel a light to medium burning sensation for the first 10-30 minutes after application, but my skin feels completely soothed by the morning despite the initial irritation.</li>
            <li> My other products work as well, possibly better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just hoping it is helping to keep me from looking too much older before I absolutely have to.</li>
            <li> Great price as well especially when comparing to similar products from other brands.</li>
            <li> a slight change for my skin that is still combo but more on the side of aging than breakouts now.  </li>

            <li> decent overnight peel</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few products and have always loved using them as a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I normally try and keep my skincare products as mild as possible, but I&#x27;ve made the exception here.</li>
            <li> I was astonished because I did not have high hopes</li>
            <li> Nonie is amazing, but is priced at about $35 for a 3.5 oz bottle/jar, and it is really difficult to find a vendor that offers it with free shipping (I always try to avoid paying shipping, at all costs).  </li>
            <li> The day after, you should wash your face as always, and the feeling it leaves, is very soft.</li>
            <li> I also use the peptide eye cream day and night and the petide moisturizer during the day under Cotz Face Natural Skin Tone SPF 40 (cheaper than the colorescience I mention above and higher spf)</li>

            <li> The other thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is not a good standalone moisturizer like the Nonie AHA creams are - you are supposed to use another Derma E moisturizer on top of this one, which only adds one more product to my nightly regimen.  </li>
            <li> , I love that it doesn&#x27;t give you a sticky, icky feeling.</li>
            <li> - I was really looking for an AHA product that I can use daily, like the Nonie creams.  </li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive for BHA&#x27;s during part of the year so using an AHA is a must.</li>
            <li> but I had never realized that the gentle foaming cleansers were actually causing my acne.</li>
            <li> but after working with a rockstar esthetician I found out that mature skin needs this amount of exfoliation to keep cell turnover up and elasticity in the skin.</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was minimal and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased the AHA beauty fluid from Derma E is that I was trying to find a less-expensive alternative to the Nonie of Beverly Hills AHA cream that I use once a day.  </li>
            <li> There is a tiny bit of a tingling sensation to it, but nothing thats unbearable, and I have normal- sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s for night use, but I love the way my face feels and looks so much with a thin application of this, that I actually wear it during the day!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> decent overnight peel, I love that it doesn&#x27;t give you a sticky, icky feeling. In fact, there are mornings when I forget to wash it off my face because I don&#x27;t feel it at all! I use it about one a week/once every fortnight and I think it has helped my complexion.</li>
            <li> Really works as described.</li>
            <li> The main reason I purchased the AHA beauty fluid from Derma E is that I was trying to find a less-expensive alternative to the Nonie of Beverly Hills AHA cream that I use once a day.  Nonie is amazing, but is priced at about $35 for a 3.5 oz bottle/jar, and it is really difficult to find a vendor that offers it with free shipping (I always try to avoid paying shipping, at all costs).  The first thing that disappointed me about this products is that it says right on the box that you are only supposed to use it twice a week - I was really looking for an AHA product that I can use daily, like the Nonie creams.  I&#x27;ve cheated a little and been using the product almost every night.  The other thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is not a good standalone moisturizer like the Nonie AHA creams are - you are supposed to use another Derma E moisturizer on top of this one, which only adds one more product to my nightly regimen.  A plus to this product, as with all Derma E creams, is that it contains no parabens and, for the most part, wholesome ingredients.</li>
            <li> Like all DermaE products this one held up to it&#x27;s name. Love it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I use this once a week to help with the flakiness and dullness caused by my Retin-a prescription (I do not use them at the same time). It says on the packaging you don&#x27;t need a moisturizer with it, so I usually skip my nightly moisturizer when I use it, which doesn&#x27;t give me any problems. Sometimes I feel a light to medium burning sensation for the first 10-30 minutes after application, but my skin feels completely soothed by the morning despite the initial irritation. This may be very concerning for some, but I&#x27;ve come to learn that it is just the product doing its job. I normally try and keep my skincare products as mild as possible, but I&#x27;ve made the exception here. I find that my skin seems a lot &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; with this included in my routine, and plan to keep it as a permanent fixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* The pH of this product is suitable for chemical exfoliation. Some may say that the concentration of AHA is too low, but concentration means very little if the pH isn&#x27;t low enough.&lt;br /&gt;* The product is easy to apply and &amp;#34;soaks&amp;#34; in very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;* Does not result in flakiness or peeling&lt;br /&gt;* Relatively gentle compared to more traditional peels</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only used it about 10 times, but they&#x27;re asking me to do a review. it feels nice and going on, but i haven&#x27;t noticed any age spot lightening or wrinkle reducing yet. it does feel nice still the next morning when i wake up. it&#x27;s a small amount in the bottle, but i&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I could feel it working. It had some sting but nothing to bad. The next day my face was brighter and smooth. I use it once or twice a week and love the results.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite product lines. you cannot go wrong with this peel.. amazing</li>
            <li> Not sure what the effect will  actually be but my skin feels nice in the morning</li>
            <li> Works well on 30-ish skin to keep me looking fresh.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other &#x27;peels&#x27; do.</li>
            <li> A great product. You only need to use about twice a week. Apply at night and you skin will look great the next morning.  I love it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Only used twice as directed.  I use the entire Derma E line and love it.</li>
            <li> This caused a rash and did the same to my daughter.</li>
            <li> its real good stuff its general skin you don&#x27;t need no moisture riser when using so good feeling when you wake up in the morning I only use it 3 times a week and I noticed a lot of difference in my skin I will get more this it&#x27;s a very good product Thank You Amazon</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, helps to even tone and texture, and fade dark spots</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! I was skeptical when I first bought it, but after the first time I used it I was blow away. When I woke up the next morning my face was brighter, lighter, and smooth like a baby&#x27;s butt. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
            <li> This is a more-than-adequate retinol product for daily use, but I have seen nothing spectacular about it.  It is very affordable and easy to use.  I had no sensitivity issues with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this peel for about a week now and love it! My skin looks bright and refreshed when I wake up.  It does sting slightly upon application, but it&#x27;s temporary.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now.  No bad reaction!</li>
            <li> I three days into using this product nightly.  It does not cause irritation, nor does your skin get red.  It does moisturize.</li>
            <li> Really like this product! My skin is too sensitive for BHA&#x27;s during part of the year so using an AHA is a must. This one has some stinging at first, but no redness or tons of peeling, and results in smooth clear skin. Great price as well especially when comparing to similar products from other brands. One star off for the stinging and the fact that it can get tacky/heavy feeling unless you put on a very light layer.</li>
            <li> I had to return mine.  Gave me trouble sleeping at night while wearing it.</li>
            <li> I personally do not recommend this product, after using it, I broke out in little tiny blisters, PAINFUL blisters for that matter, it was really harsh to my skin and the smell is horrid. I now have to go to the ER in the morning to get antibiotics for my skin.</li>
            <li> I think I love it. I mean, without only applying it to one side of my face, I can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working. But there is a slight tingling sensation when I first apply it, so I like to think it&#x27;s doing something. At this point, I already have a bunch of wrinkles, so I don&#x27;t think any lotion is going to actually make me look much younger. I&#x27;m just hoping it is helping to keep me from looking too much older before I absolutely have to. I know, it&#x27;s called a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; but clearly it isn&#x27;t going to literally peel enough skin off to get down to my inner child. I just hope it keeps some of the scales chipped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I have no idea how to verify that it&#x27;s reeeally working. But it is tingling.</li>
            <li> I use this in combo with a few other Derma e products for the past couple months, it&#x27;s moisturizing and I like how it feels.  I think my face feels slightly smoother in the morning but nothing major.  I use it once to twice a week. Slight tingle when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and I love Derma E products in general because they avoid your sulphates/parabens etc., are vegan and cruelty free. I have used quite a few products and have always loved using them as a part of my daily routine. This peel did wonders for my skin. Within about 2-3 weeks I noticed a significant difference in my skin texture, which became smoother than it was before. It goes over your skin smoothly and you only need the tiniest amount. There is a tiny bit of a tingling sensation to it, but nothing thats unbearable, and I have normal- sensitive skin. When I saw this on Amazon for about $9, I was over the moon. It usually retails for about $25 in store. I jumped on it right away. Once I received it though, I realized its best before date is pretty soon, which is why I am guessing its been heavily discounted. My last bottle lasted me about 4-5 months so I will probably use it up, and additionally it doesn&#x27;t bother me because its a &amp;#34;best before&amp;#34;, following the logic that applies to medication.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the peel. It perfect because it&#x27;s not too harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no results at all.  This has too low of a Glycolic content for it to be a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Extremely delighted!  I have used Clinique and Estee Lauder and most all the major drug store brands but I will say this is the very best overnight peel I have ever used.  I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> My skin looks do smooth and vibrant after I use this</li>
            <li> I completely trust Derma-e products and have used them for over a decade, however, I think I get better results from Murad exfoliating cleansers and my Olay Pro-X cleansing brush (don&#x27;t use the Olay cleanser that comes with it!) AND the Derma-e Vitamin A with E wrinkle treatment oil.  I will use this product up, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.  My other products work as well, possibly better.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a change.</li>
            <li> I use this as a light moisturizer.  The alpha hydroxyl acid is not too strong.  Really good for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times, but my face feels really good in the morning. I have some other products from Derma E and I like them.</li>
            <li> As I approached 30 my skin started having issues and after consulting a few specialists I realized that I needed to start treating my skin differently. The largest part of that was adequate exfoliation and using a very gentle cleanser. I cleared up my normal to oily, sensitive, acne prone maturing skin to pretty much a flawless balanced complexion using this Overnight Peel and few other products from derma E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Cleanse with the derma e Pycnognol Facial Cleanser, Fragrance Free - I had never thought of using a creamy cleanser especially on my skin type but I had never realized that the gentle foaming cleansers were actually causing my acne. So major difference within a few weeks of using this. At nights when I need to get my makeup up I gently rub this cleanser around my face neck and chest twice. Once to get most of the makeup off, then the second time to really clean and open up my skin. Creams feel a bit weird at first but when I do it twice at night there is absolutely no residue and my acne subsiding was the biggest sign of success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Moisturize with derma e Hyaluronic Acid Day Creme - It doesn&#x27;t break me out and dries to a matte finish so I can put my Colorescience Primer SPF 30 over it. At night I put this Radiant Ovenight Peel on first, then this day creme. The Hyaluronic Night Creme is good too but I usually don&#x27;t need that much moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) This dema e Evenly Raidiant Overnight Peel with Alpha Hydroxy Acids - I use this at night only because it does flush and tingle my skin a bit. I know derma e sales this as a peel not a daily treatment but after working with a rockstar esthetician I found out that mature skin needs this amount of exfoliation to keep cell turnover up and elasticity in the skin. The amount of AHA in this is low enough that even my sensitive skin can take it every night as long as I put moisturizer on after it&#x27;s set. My skin never actually peels with this because it isn&#x27;t like one of those glycolic peels where you will be shedding for a few days after which is why it is well suited for daily use. The key for sensitive skin is to build up to it. I first used this every other night for about 3 weeks and then every night thereafter. The tingling subsides within about 5-10mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this face routine my skin has never looked better, pores smaller, skin tone balanced, pimples rarely happen. I also like to use the derma e Microdermabrasion Scrub once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 years later:&lt;br /&gt;Made a slight change for my skin that is still combo but more on the side of aging than breakouts now.  I think the combo of the derma e overnight peel AHA used as a serum 4-5 nights per week, plus their petide plus serum, plus this vitamin A moisturizer really makes a difference at keeping my wrinkles at bay.  I stopped using the peptide for their firming serum because it was cheaper and started using a different moisturizer and two months later my wrinkles really came back in.  Back to the routine that works.  It&#x27;s about combination.  For night the overnight peel used as a serum after washing keeps the skin exfoliated, fresh, unclogged.  The peptide serum keeps my skin hydrated and also seems to relax wrinkle areas.  The vitamin a green tea moisturizer stimulates cell renewal.  These 3 have proven anti-aging ingredients and most studies say you need a year to really reach peak results then when you stop it goes away.  Man is that true I hope derma e never stops making these 3 products.  It is about continual use.  I also use the peptide eye cream day and night and the petide moisturizer during the day under Cotz Face Natural Skin Tone SPF 40 (cheaper than the colorescience I mention above and higher spf) My skin has never looked so flawless.  I also have started facial exercises that I&#x27;ve found on YouTube.  Just 15mins after my workouts in the AM.  Keeping things tight and toned.  Hope this helps us women on a mission to age as gracefully as possible :)ere you will be shedding for a few days after which is why it is well suited for daily use.

            <li> I really like this product. After one use my skin felt great, after a few more overnight treatments my pores feel smaller and the fine lines around my eyes seems diminished. Delivery was fast. I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> Great product for your face, with AHA, you can use it once or twice a week overnight to exfoliate your skin. The day after, you should wash your face as always, and the feeling it leaves, is very soft. Great price too, for a great product.</li>
            <li> I had been using this for years. Unfortunately I never realized it is recommend for once a week. I love this product it works well for me. I use it practically every night but, to be fair sometimes it does sting a little. I feel this is a reasonable priced product of this kind. I have yet to find this type of product with this quality of ingredients for a comparable price anywhere else. But I would love to hear about. Meanwhile, this the one for me!</li>
            <li> Used a couple of nights since I received this product  can already tell a difference in my skin. Loveit</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have a had difficult time finding a similar product like what I used as an 18 year old by estee lauder.  I happened to order this off another site because it was buy one get one free and I really wanted to try a peel. Plus I liked what I read about the company. So I took a gamble. It was after all for ALL skin types.&lt;br /&gt;When I first used it I thought the smell was minimal and fresh smelling. My skin felt like it was being hydrated. I had no burning, no nothing that made me worry and my skin is VERY sensitive!&lt;br /&gt;No lie, the next day I woke up and I had this beautiful glow. I was astonished because I did not have high hopes but I had hope because alpha hydroxy acid always worked well on my face. I continued to use it (I got it in the end of 2014), and my skin tone got very golden and supple. I have a caramel skin color that easily scars and when pregnant I get darker from melasma and have to work very hard to get that layer off after giving birth. So having something to continually remove the dead skin and show the healthy skin is right up my ally.&lt;br /&gt;My husband even noticed how golden my complexion got! But it was really a wow moment when I renewed my license and the two pictures showed me with two different Skin tones! One was brown, one was gold. Now what happened was that my facial skin now matched the skin on me that never got Sun. I always had about three shades going on, with my face the darkest. Now I am even, and stay out of the sun!&lt;br /&gt;Love this peel! Has not failed me yet. I am expecting my 4th baby now and my skin looks so fresh!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my skin since using this but I will keep trying it until I finish the bottle to find out for sure.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s for night use, but I love the way my face feels and looks so much with a thin application of this, that I actually wear it during the day! It&#x27;s not greasy, feels silky, and tones, and looks fine all day. I never follow instructions well. ;-)</li>
            <li> I have had some success with this lightening my sun spots. I would recommend for others to try.</li>
            <li> Perfect Product for aging skin, saw results the first time I used it, completely removed an age spot on my cheek after three treatments.</li>
