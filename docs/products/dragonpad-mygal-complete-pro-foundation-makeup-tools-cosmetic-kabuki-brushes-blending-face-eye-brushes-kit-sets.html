            <li>I own brand brushes myself but felt like trying out some of the sw dupe kind of brushes and I&#x27;m impressed they blend very well.</li>
            <li>Definitely an Amazing buy.</li>
            <li>But the brush itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>Came in a nice packaging.</li>
            <li>I own Sigma brushes and these are just as well made and perform identically.</li>
            <li>Satisfied results.</li>
            <li>better than mac</li>
            <li>but I love the even layered look that I get with the brush.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Exelent product I love it</li>
            <li>Mine camed 14 days early then said , which is very nice.</li>
            <li>Worth so much more for the quality that you get.</li>
            <li>Brushes are amazing.....very soft and provides really good blending.</li>
            <li>The handles are a nice weight and easy to hold as they are larger around than most brushes.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything special</li>
            <li>Nice and soft brushes.</li>
            <li>These are excellent quality for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>These are actually better than a Bare Minerals brush I bought from Sears!!!</li>
            <li>I have used many different brushes and this ones dont shed, feel really sturdy, i have washed them many times and they still look new.</li>
            <li>They have very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>One handle broke the first time using it.</li>
            <li>They blend your makeup products very well!</li>
            <li>super soft.</li>
            <li>but these brushes are super soft and blend very well.</li>
            <li>The reason im giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because the brushes had a very paint-cimacally-brush smell.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and almost never fall out!</li>
            <li>Granted, a few of the bristles have started to come out, but for the most part, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with these.  </li>
            <li>These are very soft.</li>
            <li>But the metal part seems to be loose and may be needing some super glue from my part soon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 64 years old!</li>
            <li>I was SO surprised when I got them.</li>
            <li>They are soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Love them and use them everyday!!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are not fluffy enough for me</li>
            <li>Not too much of bother but just odd.</li>

            <li> These brushes are so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I use them evey day one has a loose handle</li>
            <li> Only thing is it smells a bit odd like they just made the brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought the same ones but in black &amp; the black seem to shed for some odd reason but these ones dont.</li>
            <li> I know people complained about how long it took to get them, but I had them within a week.</li>
            <li> Each brush is packed tight with bristles, so they feel substantial.</li>
            <li> The glue connecting the brush tip to the shafts sucks.</li>
            <li> Received my order this past Sunday I gotta say theses brushes are awesomeeee!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable quality for the money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame I had to trash them because the brushes were soft. :(</li>
            <li> Was a little skeptical about using a brush vs a sponge for my foundation</li>
            <li> Received this today and all 4 brushes were broken.</li>
