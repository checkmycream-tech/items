            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite for the fall and winter months.  </li>
            <li>Well pleased.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my Daughter because it&#x27;s her favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and rather like it myself.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed her Beautiful smell until that first squirt.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the Beautiful by Estee Lauder fragrance, have been wearing it for years, always getting compliments on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, but it smells sooo good!</li>
            <li>Was glad to see it at a reasonable price here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Always get compliments on this mild  fragrance.</li>
            <li>my new favorite perfume</li>
            <li>OMG this stuff is so hot!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>A little stronger scent, but very nice.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like warm, spicy scents and find them overwhelming-</li>
            <li>We live in an area where it is hard to find products and ordering from Amazon is perfect!!!  </li>
            <li>Better overall price than department stores.</li>
            <li>when someone says I smell pretty, I tell them, &amp;</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>My Mom was givin this for her birthday when it first came out in 1986.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to find something that&#x27;s feminine and slightly spicy.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>fiance really wanted this for Christmas, and I can&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and as described, thanks.</li>
            <li>not the real perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought this was a small version of Beautiful to bring on a trip,however, this was so incredibly tiny</li>
            <li>I think i like the perfume better than the other  forms of the fragrance as it can  become too floral.</li>
            <li>Nice small bottle to put in your purse.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve  used other scents but by far this one gets the most compliments.</li>
            <li>The product was packaged professionally.  </li>
            <li>perfume is too old</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I got a fake perfume.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know but the package seems a little off so not sure if it is real thing but also this stuff is stinky, if you are wanting something to smell nice, please save humanity and go a different route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this fragrance is subtle and has plenty of light notes to balance the heavier ones.</li>
            <li>and I knew something was off with the strength right away, but I think the problem is with Estee Lauder, because I ordered another bottle from their website and the scent was also weaker than usual.</li>

            <li> As always, she loves it</li>

            <li> My favorite delivered to my door, what else can a girl ask for?</li>
            <li> The name says it all. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to find something that&#x27;s feminine and slightly spicy. I usually don&#x27;t like warm, spicy scents and find them overwhelming- but this fragrance is subtle and has plenty of light notes to balance the heavier ones. I received this as a gift and love it. I&#x27;d never worn it before. I also like that it smells nostalgic- I was a kid in the 80s and I remember smelling this perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells good as always</li>
            <li> My wife uses Cosmetique club and the Celeb perfumes of the month. I didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed her Beautiful smell until that first squirt. The wanna be perfumes come and go, but the tradition of Beautifl lives on forever</li>
            <li> Wife loved it, Nuff Said.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my favorite perfume</li>
            <li> I looked around and this was the best price out there.  It was given as a gift and I know she enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> Love this fragence. One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong however it is pleasant used sparingly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the Beautiful by Estee Lauder fragrance, have been wearing it for years, always getting compliments on the scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, but it smells sooo good!</li>
            <li> This is the nicest parfum I have ever used.  Have been using it for about 10 years.  Nice small bottle to put in your purse.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend smells amazing</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a present for my mother-in-law.  We live in an area where it is hard to find products and ordering from Amazon is perfect!!!  I love this cologne and my mother-in-law does too.  It made her very happy.</li>
            <li> my new favorite perfume</li>
            <li> OMG this stuff is so hot!  I can&#x27;t leave my wife alone when she wears it.  Two thumbs up!  ;-)</li>
            <li> Beautiful by Estee Lauder arrived quickly in great condition, as it was a gift my friend was thrilled as it is her favourite perfume</li>
            <li> The item arrived in good condition and was as advertised.  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a small version of Beautiful to bring on a trip,however, this was so incredibly tiny I lost it in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> My Mom was givin this for her birthday when it first came out in 1986. She&#x27;d always spray a little on me  before school. I used it for years before Knowing by Estee lauder came out, and  now use both. To me it has a summery floral smell. I use it along with Knowing by Estee lauder. I think i like the perfume better than the other  forms of the fragrance as it can  become too floral. I  use these 2 fragrances exclusively, and always get complements on them. I try to stay with 3 or so perfumes, and switch them out regularly as people tend to associate perfume with people or events. So this one along with Knowing will be 2 of my top 3 perfumes.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Just what I ordered and excellent price.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite for the fall and winter months.  A little stronger scent, but very nice.</li>
            <li> Nice!!! Well pleased.</li>
            <li> Shipped well it was a gift and the person loved it</li>
            <li> This is my GO - TO perfume.  It is timeless and I&#x27;ve been wearing it since I was a teenager.  Was glad to see it at a reasonable price here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for over 20 years - I guess you could call it my &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; scent.  I always get compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t wear any other perfume.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used beautiful forever. I consider it my signature fragrance. i&#x27;ve  used other scents but by far this one gets the most compliments.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and as described, thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this! I have used Beautiful for years and the best price is right here!</li>
            <li> Very pleased, it came on time .</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume spray a few times from Amazon already. Always get compliments on this mild  fragrance. Will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> I get this perfume for my mom every year, all the stores in my little town do not sell it anymore.. I have went two towns over to buy this for her the last two Christmas&#x27;s. This year I ordered it 5 days shy of Christmas Eve and crossed my fingers hoping it would get here in time.... the delivery date estimated it would be late..... Wrong!! it arrived the 23!!! I was sooooo happy. Packaging was in perfect shape too!! Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> This smells Awesome, i just love it!! V.Young</li>
            <li> Bought this for another friend, who is no longer in my life.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Daughter because it&#x27;s her favorite perfume.  It has a nice light scent and rather like it myself.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy w/ this perfume which makes me even happier</li>
            <li> I just received this and tried it today, I have worn Beautiful for 10 years, never anything else.&lt;br /&gt;When perfume is too old it smells diffrent, I TOTALLY wasted my money, OLD and smelld bad!!!  UGH!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Estee Lauder for years. I can tell that this is a fake not the real perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I would not order again from this company.</li>
            <li> Scent is weaker than it should of been, I&#x27;ve been wearing Beautiful for 15 years and I knew something was off with the strength right away, but I think the problem is with Estee Lauder, because I ordered another bottle from their website and the scent was also weaker than usual.</li>
