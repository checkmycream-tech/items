            <li>I am still searching for the perfect one.</li>
            <li>These are perfect.  </li>

            <li>Material is excellent for sensory defensive individuals.  </li>
            <li>great!</li>
            <li>As of the writing of this review (June 2014) they have held up great and the girls use them every night.</li>
            <li>This item should be sold by a dollar store, and even there it wouldn&#x27;t be a great deal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best like I said but for the price it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>more priceie ones love this item &lt;3</li>
            <li>They are very good at blocking the light, and feel confortable.</li>
            <li>is so great works better then</li>
            <li>and I feel so much better waking up!</li>
            <li>this at your own peril.</li>
            <li>Bouns with excellent professional services .</li>
            <li>As we required the sleeping mask evey night to assist us to sleep better .</li>
            <li>There must be better quality products out there.  </li>
            <li>I feel more refreshed compared when I didn&#x27;t have a sleeping</li>
            <li>My daughter is having a &#x27;storybook&#x27; baby shower where guests are asked to bring a favorite childhood book to help start the baby&#x27;s library with a message written inside from them.  </li>
            <li>he says he love his mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this sleep mask, on and off, for many years.</li>
            <li>Sure, the mask&#x27;s strap doesn&#x27;t break, but it&#x27;s also uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this sleep mask.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the shipping, this would be an ok deal.  </li>
            <li>would get better results buying a halloween mask and taping over the eye</li>
            <li>Nice and comfortable, but tears easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty good and owrth the money.</li>
            <li>perhaps not what I would buy for myself as a single purchase, but perfect for this baby shower.  </li>
            <li>She was indeed very thoughtful and attentive .</li>
            <li>This should fit most people well.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I think it is a great sleep mask!</li>
            <li>Its light weight makes for easy sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worked great for blocking the light but after two mornings of a total of 6 hours of wear, it fell apart.</li>
            <li>Cheap model, delux bargain.</li>
            <li>and they do not block out all the light.</li>
            <li>Since I work nights and sleep during the day, this mask works great, however after wearing it fora week or 2 I noticed that the blue coloring was bleeding on to my bed sheets.</li>
            <li>Clearly a cheaply made item.</li>
            <li>It fits well, is comfortable to wear,  and shuts out light well.</li>
            <li>he enjoy keeping the light out of his face when im watching tv and he trying to rest</li>
            <li>I keep having to replace them because they&#x27;re CHEAPLY manufactured.</li>
            <li>, they don&#x27;t always keep all the light out.</li>
            <li>This helps keep the light from coming under the edges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying these disposable sleep masks, provided it stays at a cheap price to match its cheap construction.</li>
            <li>It is also comfortable and relaxing.</li>
            <li>and I wake up almost always when theres any light in the room.</li>
            <li>Yet they block out all light.</li>
            <li>The bands that keep it on your face are a bit cheaply made, but it works.</li>
            <li>I was especially thrilled to find these at such a reasonable price, since I needed about 25.  </li>
            <li>I am NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>I use it every night as well as the rare days when I can take a nap!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really keep out the light for me and it doesn&#x27;t fit and fell snug as I would like it.</li>
            <li>the light comes righ through this sleep mask,  If I had know that I would not have bout them in the first place</li>
            <li>wanted to try the cheap mask first, to see if I wanted to up-grade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this sleep mask is great no light gets in an the price</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return because it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>strap broke right away</li>
            <li>Comfortable and block enough light to make sleeping on the plane easier.  </li>
            <li>Firstly I would like to say thank you to Karen for assisting me in tracking my orders.</li>
            <li>Soft and keeps light out.</li>
            <li>The product color was exactly what I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Definitely invest In a better one.</li>
            <li>Out of all the sleep masks I&#x27;ve bought over the years, this one is very comfortable, keeps the light out and isn&#x27;t too tight around my head.  </li>
            <li>I like the soft, cool feel of the fabric.</li>
            <li>We sewed it back on, and it works fine, but I won&#x27;t buy another one of these.</li>
            <li>for the price, this is better that what I expected.</li>
            <li>Keeps out the light of the day, especially if you&#x27;re a shift worker.</li>
            <li>sleep mask works very well if you use two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I like about this sleep mask is that it doesn&#x27;t press against the head too much.</li>
            <li>Plus the light definitely comes through</li>
            <li>I have replaced it with a soft, stretchy lace that is more comfortable than the thin elastic that was part of the original design.</li>
            <li>I use eye masks often to block light due to frequent migraines and the light sensitivity that accompanies them.</li>
            <li>They are decent quality...</li>
            <li>Very pretty color blue.</li>
            <li>The size is pretty small for a man and it really is \\&quot;very\\&quot; cheap.  </li>
            <li>Elastic strap becomes stretched out or breaks quickly.  </li>
            <li>if it fit, the area covering the eyes is not thick enough and does not achieve total darkness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Soft!  </li>
            <li>It is very dark and you don&#x27;t have to worry about any light coming through the mask.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, but light definitely comes in both under the bottom and through the material, which is fairly thin.</li>
            <li>, this mask is soft and does the job.</li>
            <li>Soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>As usual filled with great disappointment , the masks did not reach my place .&lt;br</li>
            <li>First to refund the total an secondly to resend me</li>
            <li>With warmer weather and light perspiration, the mask starting leaving black stains on my pillow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too small for my face and light enters through all edges.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>The sleep mask is large enough and blocks light well, but the material creates moisture around the eyes and on the temples and makes it uncomfortable to use on hot nights or in humid areas.</li>
            <li>If they break after a few months, count yourself lucky.</li>
            <li>I keep this mask in my purse for emergency situations and use it at least once a week when traveling, working, visiting family or at the hospital or doctor visits when receiving treatments to block the light and help decrease the amount of pain it causes with the migraines.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he said at first it was a little tight-fitting.</li>
            <li>The item is 7-1/2&amp;#34;: wide and  3-1/2&amp;#34; high.</li>
            <li>If you find that too much light is getting in the nose area, you need to pull it a little further down.</li>

            <li> If you find that too much light is getting in the nose area, you need to pull it a little further down.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who can&#x27;t sleep unless it is extremely dark!</li>
            <li> For the guests, I have put together a little &#x27;something&#x27; that includes a sleep mask, a box of Sleepytime Tea and a moon bookmark with a tassel sweetly packaged in a small book box.  </li>
            <li> The elastic bands don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Light-blocking mask makes a difference in long transit pursuits.</li>
            <li> I got one in blue and one in pink.</li>
            <li> I use this every single night</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like about the mask is that it rises up and won&#x27;t stay down on your eyes properly without you keep having to pull it down.</li>
            <li> If this is the way this person runs their business I can only imagine how messy their life is.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I recommend wearing TWO, one atop the other.</li>
            <li> And with one atop the other they become darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thin (as I&#x27;d hoped) but broke shortly after starting to use</li>
            <li> Then you can slide one mask a bit up on your face, and the other a bit down.</li>
            <li> But its problem is a thick velcro strap that presses against the back of the head while you&#x27;re trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> Hides the dark but fits kinda tight on my face.</li>
            <li> so there is less pressure.  </li>
            <li> Black dye rubbed off on our pillows and sheets.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these sleep masks.  </li>
            <li> WEEKS LATER: one of the elastic straps came out, was poorly constructed, will have to repair by hand.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this quite a few of this item for</li>
            <li> It presses too hard on the eyes and it&#x27;s quite tight, even having an average head shape.</li>
            <li> I wish the masks would have been a little thicker, but you do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I usually have to take one of the two straps off</li>
            <li> The item I got was cheap and very bad quality and wasn&#x27;t even the color displayed.</li>
            <li> string is lame..too small and hard at the edges</li>
            <li> so you hardly know they are on.</li>
            <li> They are thin and very small.  </li>
            <li> Very delicate material.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortable to wear</li>
            <li> Its a bit uncomfortable and minimalist</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s deff on the uncomfortable side.</li>
            <li> lame...</li>

            <li> Bought this for my son as he was asking for one. He wears it to bed every night. Fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, but light definitely comes in both under the bottom and through the material, which is fairly thin.</li>
            <li> I must say that this is an awesome products . Bouns with excellent professional services . Firstly I would like to say thank you to Karen for assisting me in tracking my orders. Earlier I place my orders with Dream Essential . I waited for some time n wrote in to ask for help regards to my sleeping masks order.&lt;br /&gt;Karen attended to me via email . She was indeed very thoughtful and attentive . She assisted me in tracking my products . We waited for a week . As usual filled with great disappointment , the masks did not reach my place .&lt;br /&gt;My family and I were totally depressed . As we required the sleeping mask evey night to assist us to sleep better . Therefore I drop another email to Karen , expressing my concern to her again. Shortly , she dropped me an email with two suggested options. First to refund the total an secondly to resend me</li>
            <li> Worked great for blocking the light but after two mornings of a total of 6 hours of wear, it fell apart. The threading came apart and the satin edges were frayed so I couldn&#x27;t stitch it back together. Asking Amazon for a refund.  There must be better quality products out there.  Now I just have to find them.</li>
            <li> for the price, this is better that what I expected. They are very good at blocking the light, and feel confortable.</li>
            <li> I use this every single night and I feel so much better waking up! I feel more refreshed compared when I didn&#x27;t have a sleeping mask.&lt;br /&gt;My curtains is beige in color and once the sun comes out, it&#x27;s impossible to stay asleep. The sleeping mask helps so so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only con would be: the mask made an imprint on my silk pillow case.</li>
            <li> Soft!  Light-blocking mask makes a difference in long transit pursuits. Cheap model, delux bargain. I purchased 3 pairs: one for each travel bag.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these sleep masks.  They are thin and very small.  Uncomfortable to wear and they do not block out all the light.</li>
            <li> My daughter is having a &#x27;storybook&#x27; baby shower where guests are asked to bring a favorite childhood book to help start the baby&#x27;s library with a message written inside from them.  For the guests, I have put together a little &#x27;something&#x27; that includes a sleep mask, a box of Sleepytime Tea and a moon bookmark with a tassel sweetly packaged in a small book box.  I&#x27;ve tied them all together to sit at each place for the guests.  It&#x27;s PERFECT!  I was especially thrilled to find these at such a reasonable price, since I needed about 25.  They are decent quality...perhaps not what I would buy for myself as a single purchase, but perfect for this baby shower.  I am NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice and comfortable, but tears easily. Very delicate material.</li>
            <li> like me.  I usually have to take one of the two straps off so there is less pressure.  Other than that, this mask is soft and does the job.</li>
            <li> Its a bit uncomfortable and minimalist but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The sleep mask is large enough and blocks light well, but the material creates moisture around the eyes and on the temples and makes it uncomfortable to use on hot nights or in humid areas.</li>
            <li> Since I work nights and sleep during the day, this mask works great, however after wearing it fora week or 2 I noticed that the blue coloring was bleeding on to my bed sheets. You might want to wash it before you use it.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these - one for my spouse and myself - and they work great! Keeps out the light of the day, especially if you&#x27;re a shift worker.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he said at first it was a little tight-fitting. Then, after about three weeks of use, the strap broke. We sewed it back on, and it works fine, but I won&#x27;t buy another one of these.</li>
            <li> Hides the dark but fits kinda tight on my face.</li>
            <li> My girls for some reason wanted these for Christmas last year. I found these and they were perfect. I got one in blue and one in pink. As of the writing of this review (June 2014) they have held up great and the girls use them every night.</li>
            <li> Got this to go with some lingerie that I bought for my friends party.. It matched well with what I got her..</li>
            <li> Soft and keeps light out. Very pretty color blue. The strap is skinny so it isn&#x27;t annoying.</li>
            <li> Perfect design, 2 elastic straps, one for over the ear, one for under. Not adjustable, works because our head sizes aren&#x27;t that different. Since its not adjustable there&#x27;s no clump or bump on the elastics to cause discomfort when you sleep on it.&lt;br /&gt;TWO WEEKS LATER: one of the elastic straps came out, was poorly constructed, will have to repair by hand. So, rating changed from 5 to 3.&lt;br /&gt;FOUR WEEKS LATER: With warmer weather and light perspiration, the mask starting leaving black stains on my pillow. Clearly a cheaply made item. Reduced to 1 star.</li>
            <li> The product color was exactly what I was hoping it would be. I wish the masks would have been a little thicker, but you do get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> strap broke right away</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed. It fits well, is comfortable to wear,  and shuts out light well. The item is 7-1/2&amp;#34;: wide and  3-1/2&amp;#34; high. I am a petite woman and didn&#x27;t want something that was too big or bulky. This should fit most people well.  If you find that too much light is getting in the nose area, you need to pull it a little further down.</li>
            <li> Elastic strap becomes stretched out or breaks quickly.  Buy the mask with the thicker elastic straps and Velcro.</li>
            <li> this sleep mask is great no light gets in an the price is so great works better then more priceie ones love this item &lt;3</li>
            <li> he enjoy keeping the light out of his face when im watching tv and he trying to rest he says he love his mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sleep mask, on and off, for many years. I keep having to replace them because they&#x27;re CHEAPLY manufactured. The elastic bands don&#x27;t last very long. If they break after a few months, count yourself lucky. For the last ones I bought, the elastic bands broke in under two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they&#x27;re inexpensive. So just know up front that these are DISPOSABLE masks that need to be replaced often (kinda like a toothbrush), and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, they don&#x27;t always keep all the light out. I recommend wearing TWO, one atop the other. Then you can slide one mask a bit up on your face, and the other a bit down. This helps keep the light from coming under the edges. And with one atop the other they become darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sleep mask works very well if you use two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like about this sleep mask is that it doesn&#x27;t press against the head too much. Its light weight makes for easy sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a darker sleep mask, one that&#x27;s more expensive and can last for years. But its problem is a thick velcro strap that presses against the back of the head while you&#x27;re trying to sleep. Sure, the mask&#x27;s strap doesn&#x27;t break, but it&#x27;s also uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep buying these disposable sleep masks, provided it stays at a cheap price to match its cheap construction.</li>
            <li> I love this sleep mask. It is very dark and you don&#x27;t have to worry about any light coming through the mask. It is also comfortable and relaxing. The only thing I do not like about the mask is that it rises up and won&#x27;t stay down on your eyes properly without you keep having to pull it down. Other than that, I think it is a great sleep mask!</li>
            <li> The item I rcvd&#x27; was NOT what was displayed by the seller. The item I got was cheap and very bad quality and wasn&#x27;t even the color displayed. The item I got I saw at the dollar tree store. Total rip off. I didn&#x27;t return because it wasn&#x27;t worth it. If this is the way this person runs their business I can only imagine how messy their life is.</li>
            <li> the light comes righ through this sleep mask,  If I had know that I would not have bout them in the first place</li>
            <li> I use eye masks often to block light due to frequent migraines and the light sensitivity that accompanies them. I keep this mask in my purse for emergency situations and use it at least once a week when traveling, working, visiting family or at the hospital or doctor visits when receiving treatments to block the light and help decrease the amount of pain it causes with the migraines. I like the soft, cool feel of the fabric. I also like that it does not attract pet hair as some plush eye masks do, which then will transfer to my eyelashes. The one drawback is that after just a couple of months I have had to repair one of the straps that broke off when I wasn&#x27;t even wearing it - it was in a plastic zipper bag in my purse at the time. I have replaced it with a soft, stretchy lace that is more comfortable than the thin elastic that was part of the original design. I am still searching for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> The elastic band came off after 2nd use.</li>
            <li> Black dye rubbed off on our pillows and sheets.  It took several washes to get it out.  Not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst eye mask but it&#x27;s deff on the uncomfortable side. It presses too hard on the eyes and it&#x27;s quite tight, even having an average head shape. Plus the light definitely comes through and I wake up almost always when theres any light in the room. It&#x27;s not the best like I said but for the price it&#x27;s okay. Definitely invest In a better one.</li>
            <li> lame...string is lame..too small and hard at the edges</li>
            <li> This mask stains sheets and pillowcases...don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this quite a few of this item for I always lost it carelessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty good and owrth the money.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the shipping, this would be an ok deal.  The size is pretty small for a man and it really is \\&quot;very\\&quot; cheap.  This item should be sold by a dollar store, and even there it wouldn&#x27;t be a great deal.  I could import these from China for Pennies!! Somebody&#x27;s getting a deal and it isn&#x27;t the customer.  Don&#x27;t Buy this one.</li>
            <li> I just wanted something inexpensive to give some kids I&#x27;m chaperoning.  These are perfect.  Comfortable and block enough light to make sleeping on the plane easier.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really keep out the light for me and it doesn&#x27;t fit and fell snug as I would like it. Being that I have to sleep during the day since I work at night might as well keep a pillow over my head.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of these.  Giving them as gifts.  Material is excellent for sensory defensive individuals.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Soft and silky.  Out of all the sleep masks I&#x27;ve bought over the years, this one is very comfortable, keeps the light out and isn&#x27;t too tight around my head.  I&#x27;ve bought several of these from this company over the years.</li>
            <li> I order these by the dozen. Light weight with thin elastic so you hardly know they are on. Yet they block out all light.</li>
            <li> Thin (as I&#x27;d hoped) but broke shortly after starting to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sleep mask. Does the trick. The bands that keep it on your face are a bit cheaply made, but it works.</li>
            <li> Received it today 8/31.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too small for my face and light enters through all edges.&lt;br /&gt;Even if it fit, the area covering the eyes is not thick enough and does not achieve total darkness.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try the cheap mask first, to see if I wanted to up-grade.&lt;br /&gt;I would get better results buying a halloween mask and taping over the eye holes.&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe I could just duct tape some cotton squares over my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this at your own peril.</li>
            <li> great! I use it every night as well as the rare days when I can take a nap! I highly recommend this product to anyone who can&#x27;t sleep unless it is extremely dark!</li>
