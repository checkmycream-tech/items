            <li> makes it useless for evening makeup removal.</li>
            <li> that says a lot for an industry that puts out a lot of useless, but expensive, products</li>

            <li> my mom introduced me to this product and it is the best face wash i have ever used. i used to use products like clean and clear, neutrogena and biore and all those products made my skin super dry. i even tried those products for oily face and that never worked out. When I tried this product, I had no more dry spots after I wash my face and it helps with oily faces. Best product ever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to know if a face cleanser is doing anything other than removing the visible makeup and oil. I&#x27;m not really sure what this product is doing for me, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this! Came very quickly. Will order again.</li>

            <li> This is an awesome cleanser!!!! I am an African American woman, age 38 with acne prone sensitive skin who has been searching for a great face cleanser that wasn&#x27;t harsh or drying for a long time -I have finally found it! This cleanser has made my facial skin extremely smooth, it has evened out my skin tone, &amp; the big plus is that it never irritated my skin, even when I used the clarisonic facial brush. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week now &amp; I feel and see a difference.  You don&#x27;t have to use much (it has a cream/gel base)just a pea size will be enough, so it should last you a while. I don&#x27;t believe you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I recently underwent laser surgery for rosacea and the doctor recommended this to soothe the skin and lessen the redness (that Scot thing you know). Anyway, it works quite well. My wife is constantly commenting on how much &#x27;calmer&#x27; my skin looks. All I can say is, \\&quot;Try it.\\&quot; It worked for me and hopefully will for you.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have tried, use with Clarisonic, exfoliates some, less expensive than at the derm, lasts long. It is great.</li>
            <li> I spent a lifetime looking for a soap that would not irritate my skin.  With most soaps, my skin is irritated after a single washing.  This is the only soap I have found that I can use twice a day, and my skin actually looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this soap if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth on my skin and haven&#x27;t had a breakout since! Skin looks refreshed, calm, and even. I will definitely be re ordering!</li>
            <li> Neo Cutis cleanser is soft and gentle and leaves the skin very smooth and soft. I recommend it highly to anyone with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Best cleanser in the world doesn&#x27;t strip face and cleans without scrubbing or tugging on the skin leaves face comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect cleanser.  Good for my skin.  I&#x27;ve used many other skin cleanser over&lt;br /&gt;the years, but this is a bargain for how good it is.</li>
            <li> I can say I rarely break out...ever yet for some reason, this cleanser cause so many breakouts I had to stop using it. Aside from that, left my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love the neocutis neo-cleanse for normal-oily skin.  But the gentle version made me breakout so badly that I had to throw it away!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product; excellent price!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.  Only side effect is increased growth facial hair, but love the way it help w anti-aging.</li>
            <li> This will gently clean the skin without stripping away natural moisture in the skin and reduce irritation and dryness, especially in winter or dry climates.</li>
            <li> love this product, happy to find it on Amazon as it&#x27;s much cheaper and &#x27;no&#x27; it wasn&#x27;t expired</li>
            <li> This is a gentle cleanser, but I wish it foamed up. It is a gel</li>
            <li> Quick delivery,great product for everyday use.Doesn&#x27;t dry skin like may other products on the market.Will continue to purchase...not much more to say.</li>
            <li> Nice gentle cleanser. A little pricey though.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my sensitive skin. Skin feels smooth and supple after a face wash.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used.  I have very sensative skin and adult achne.  This product cleared my skin without drying.  No reactions from the product either.  I love it and highly recommend it!  My niece starting using it as well and her achne has cleared up significantly!!</li>
            <li> Have been using for about several months. Very gentle on my skin, no harsh or tight feeling after use.  I like how my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for many years and will continue to do so. This product was recommended by my doctor of 13 years whom I highly trust.</li>
            <li> this and their Hyalis products they make is effective.  that says a lot for an industry that puts out a lot of useless, but expensive, products</li>
            <li> A very gentle cleanser. Leaves my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> This will be my 2nd bottle. I purchased my first one through the recommendation of my dermatologist. Neo cutis is a great product and this particular face wash is gentle which is good for my sensitive skin. This was almost $10 cheaper than buying at my dr which is right down the street from me but worth waiting 2 days from Amazon Prime. As a matter of fact I&#x27;ve been buying all my neo cutis products from here after noticing a huge price difference. I&#x27;m happy with this product and because my derm suggested it I want to continue to use it. Great price too considering some drug store brands are the around the same price. Neocutis has other face soaps so pick what&#x27;s right for your skin.</li>
            <li> I really do like this cleanser.  It leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent product-makes skin feel so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I use it daily and this keeps my skin looking good.</li>
